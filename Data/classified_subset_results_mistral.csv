'Congestion measure', 'Extreme weather conditions', 'Historical dataset', 'Traffic conditions', 'Traffic management systems', 'Urban transportation systems', 'Traffic congestion']",2020,2020///,2020///,"Traffic congestion is one of the most common phenomena in urban transportation systems. The condition of traffic congestion emerges when the normal flow of traffic is interrupted, resulting in speed reduction, travel delay, and poor level of services. Additionally, congestions could also cause economic losses to the drivers and affect the environment due to excess carbon dioxide emissions. Traffic congestion can be recurring or non-recurring, depending on the reasons behind the congestion. Excessive traffic demand, capacity violation, and temporary signal changes cause recurring congestion. On the other hand, non-recurring congestion could occur due to extreme weather conditions, work zones, and other rare-event incidents. To reduce traffic congestion and improve the level of services, it is essential to monitor the traffic conditions at certain time intervals and measure the congestion level. A variety of congestion evaluation measures have been developed with the consideration of speed, travel time, delay rate, level of service, or other congestion indices. In this paper, the currently available congestion measures were categorized into five categories and were explored within these categories. Each of the enlisted congestion measures was implemented to measure congestion based on a traffic tacker historical dataset. The results showed a similar congestion trend for different measures. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of each measure were identified from the analysis results. The discrepancies between the complexity and applicability of different measures were also indicated from the evaluation of these measures. The accurate evaluation of traffic congestion can aid as a foundation in developing a more robust traffic management system. � Proceedings of the 2020 IISE Annual.

**Explanation**: The abstract does not meet the criteria for either Combination 1 or Combination 2 of the sufficiency framework.

- **Policy Measures & Practices**: The abstract mentions measures to evaluate and reduce traffic congestion, which could be considered a policy measure or practice.
- **Resource Demand Avoidance**: The abstract does not explicitly address avoiding or reducing demand for resources such as energy, materials, land, water, etc. It focuses on managing traffic congestion but does not link this to resource demand reduction.
- **Well-being Delivery**: The abstract does not discuss human well-being, equity, social welfare, etc.
- **Planetary Boundaries Context**: The abstract mentions environmental impacts (excess carbon dioxide emissions), but it does not discuss these issues within the context of planetary boundaries or sustainability.

Therefore, the abstract does not meet the required combinations to be classified as ""About Sufficiency."""

**Title**: Measuring energy efficiency performance of China's transport sector: A data envelopment analysis approach

**Abstract**: This study presents an application of data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach with considering undesirable outputs, and not only examines the energy efficiency performance of China's transport sector from 2003 to 2009, but also maximizes energy-saving potential of transport sector of China's 30 administrative regions. Environmental DEA technology is adopted, which treats undesirable measures by distinguishing between weak and strong disposability. The output directional distance function is used, which explicitly expands desirable outputs and simultaneously reduces undesirable outputs. From the empirical results, the lowest number of efficient regions was recorded in 2007 or 2008, which eventually slightly recovered. Similarly, the overall average energy efficiency reached the lowest record in 2007 or 2008. These results are consistent with the policy guidance in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010) period that a series of new policies in the transport sector are implemented to reverse the trend of energy intensity increase. The Eastern area generally performed better than the Central area and Western area. The Central area was better than the Western area, except in some critical years such as in 2008, the financial crisis significantly affected port turnover. The total potential energy saving from 2003 to 2009 was 35.72 Mtce, the total potential energy saving was approximately 2.75% of the total transport energy use. � 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

**Analysis**:
- **Policy Measures & Practices**: The abstract mentions the implementation of new policies in the transport sector to reverse the trend of energy intensity increase, which aligns with the requirement of mentioning concrete policy measures or practices.
- **Resource Demand Avoidance**: The abstract explicitly discusses energy-saving potential and reducing undesirable outputs, which addresses avoiding or reducing demand for resources.

**Conclusion**:
The abstract meets the criteria for **Combination 1** of the sufficiency framework.

30995.0,30995.0,JOUR,Life Cycle Assessment of Land Use in Neighborhoods,,,Life Cycle Assessment... (2017),"['eppi-reviewer', 'Built density', 'Neighbourhood layout', 'Primary land use', 'Secondary land use', 'Land occupation', 'Land transformation']",2017,2017///,2017///,"Urban sprawl and the increase of the built-up area have a major impact on land use. Buildings are responsible for two types of land use interventions: primary land use, i. e. the building footprint and secondary land use, associated with the resource extraction, production, transport and end-of-life treatment of construction products. However the environmental impact related to the primary land use is mostly not considered in current Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies of the built environment. The purpose of this paper is to assess the environmental impact of primary land use in neighbourhoods, considering not only the footprint of buildings but also the footprint of infrastructure and open spaces. Impacts related to land occupation and transformation are evaluated based on the impact assessment methods soil organic matter (SOM) (i. e. impact on soil quality) and Eco-indicator 99 (i. e. impact on biodiversity). An LCA study of neighbourhood models with diverse built densities, i. e. consisting of detached houses, semi-detached houses, terraced houses to compact apartment blocks, is performed. Moreover, buildings are simulated using combinations of building elements, from solid to timber frame structure. The results reveal the high contribution of primary land use to the neighbourhood life cycle environmental impacts, especially in low built density neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the environmental impact of primary land use is in most cases higher than secondary land use. Based on this analysis, it is recommended to include the assessment of primary land use in neighbourhood LCA, especially in studies comparing different built densities. (C) 2017 The Authors.

1. **Policy Measures & Practices**: The abstract does not mention any concrete policy, lifestyle choice, public policy, private action, or system designed to reduce resource consumption. It primarily discusses the assessment of environmental impacts related to land use in urban planning.

2. **Resource Demand Avoidance**: The abstract does not explicitly address avoiding or reducing demand for resources (energy, materials, land, water, etc.). Instead, it focuses on evaluating the environmental impacts of different land use patterns.

3. **Well-being Delivery**: The abstract does not discuss human well-being, equity, social welfare, or similar concepts.

4. **Planetary Boundaries Context**: The abstract does mention environmental impacts and sustainability concerns related to land use, but it does not frame these within the context of planetary boundaries or similar broader environmental limits.

Given these points, the abstract does not meet the criteria for either Combination 1 or Combination 2. Therefore, the label for this abstract is:

**Title**: A binomial distribution model for describing pedestrian-vehicle crashes in urban areas

**Abstract**: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the numbers of pedestrian-vehicle crashes (PVCs) and the traffic and built environments from a macroscopic perspective. A binomial distribution model has been developed to represent the occurrence of PVCs. To calibrate the model, Bayesian analysis using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method has been employed. The results identify thirteen variables representing urban activities and traffic conditions, including land uses, degrees of mixed use, points of interest, various passage widths, and street hierarchy that significantly impact PVCs. Additionally, the study unveils the spatial distribution of PVC probabilities and exposures. This research contributes to the field by developing an analytical framework for comprehending PVCs from a macroscopic viewpoint, introducing innovative methods for uncovering latent variables, integrating diverse types of data into the analysis, and creating a model for simulating the effects of urban planning revisions and traffic management strategies. � 2024 The Authors

### Analysis:
1. **Policy Measures & Practices**: The abstract mentions urban planning revisions and traffic management strategies, which can be considered concrete policies or practices.
2. **Resource Demand Avoidance**: The abstract does not explicitly address avoiding or reducing demand for resources (energy, materials, land, water, etc.).
3. **Well-being Delivery**: The abstract does not explicitly mention human well-being, equity, social welfare, etc.
4. **Planetary Boundaries Context**: The abstract does not discuss environmental limits, sustainability, climate change, or similar.

### Conclusion:
The abstract does not meet either of the required combinations for classification as ""About Sufficiency."" It mentions policy measures and practices but does not address resource demand avoidance, well-being delivery, or planetary boundaries context.

30956.0,30956.0,JOUR,How Public Education on Ecodriving Can Reduce Both Fuel Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions,,,How Public Education... (2012),['eppi-reviewer'],2012,2012///,2012///,"Ecodriving, the concept of changing driving behavior and vehicle maintenance to affect fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in existing vehicles, has recently gained prominence in North America. One ecodriving strategy involves public education with information disseminated on the Internet. This paper presents the results of a study conducted from June to December 2010 that assessed the effectiveness of static, web-based information on ecodriving with controlled stated responses from approximately 100 faculty, staff, and students at the University of California, Berkeley. A comparison of the experimental and control groups revealed that exposure to ecodriving information influenced people's driving behavior and maintenance practices. The experimental group's distributional shift in behavior was statistically significant, particularly for key practices, including lower highway cruising speed, adjustment of driving behavior, and proper tire inflation. Within the experimental group (N = 51), only 16% of respondents significantly changed their maintenance practices whereas 71% altered some driving practices; these data suggest that intentional alteration of driving behavior is easier than is planning better maintenance practices.

**Title**: Recognizing urban shrinkage and growth patterns from a global perspective

**Abstract**: The incongruous patterns of urban growth often give rise to a myriad of issues, notably urban sprawl and urban shrinkage. These challenges frequently coexist and interact, presenting formidable obstacles to achieving sustainable city development. Therefore, investigations that endeavor to scrutinize both urban expansion and shrinkage in concert from a comprehensive perspective are essential. Present works of defining this trajectory are still vague, in which there is no clear clarification, and the relationship with socioeconomic also tends to be neglected. Thus, we proposed a new framework utilizing characteristic changes over 30 years in population and density to conduct a synthesis of urban growth patterns in 3911 cities worldwide along with their driving factors. We found that the development stage played a crucial role in urban growth pattern. Specifically, the densification cities were mostly found in the early stages of industrialization and urbanization.

### Analysis:

1. **Policy Measures & Practices**:
   - The abstract mentions ""tailor-made management policies and urban planning"" which can be considered as concrete policies or practices.

2. **Resource Demand Avoidance**:
   - The abstract does not explicitly address avoiding or reducing demand for resources (energy, materials, land, water, etc.). It discusses urban growth patterns and their implications but does not directly link these to resource demand avoidance.

3. **Well-being Delivery**:
   - The abstract does not explicitly mention human well-being, equity, or social welfare.

4. **Planetary Boundaries Context**:
   - The abstract mentions ""sustainable city development"" and ""SDG indicators 11.3.1,"" which relate to environmental limits and sustainability.

We found that: (1) The land use efficiency of urban agglomerations was context dependent. Whereas it was higher in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region for population density per unit area of construction land than in the Yangtze River Delta region, the opposite was true for gross domestic production. Thus, a single aspect did not fully reflect the land use efficiency of urban agglomerations. (2) The land use efficiency of the two urban agglomerations was also scale dependent, and in the Yangtze River Delta region, the use of multiple metrics induced variations between aggregate and local measures. Median values for the land use efficiency of cities within an urban agglomeration were the most representative for comparative purposes. (3) The drivers of the spatial allocation of construction land were trans-regional. At the regional scale, most topographical factors were restrictive. Major regional transport networks significantly influenced the occurrence of construction land near them. Dominant cities and urban areas within each city exerted remote effects on non-dominant cities and rural areas. In principle, the median value can be considered a promising metric for assessing an urban agglomeration’s performance. We suggest that stringent management of land use in areas located along regional rail tracks/roadways may promote sustainable land use. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

While being active is preferable to not doing physical activity, not leaving the house for long periods might increase mortality risk, lead to social isolation, depression, cognitive impairment, besides other health problems. However, going out of home, even to spend rest time outdoors could improve mental health, increase vitamin D intake, or provide opportunities in involvement in various experiences such as psychosocial, emotional, cultural, therapeutic, leisure or even PA, since resting forms an essential part of PA for some seniors. Previous studies show that the characteristics of individuals as well as the physical environment and how seniors perceive it affect their outdoor behavior. Aiming to contribute to the literature which mostly focuses on the relationship between characteristics of the physical environment and seniors' PA, this study explores how a specific urban characteristic: urban vitality impacts seniors' outdoor rest while considering age and gender. To do so we used GPS-tracking and accelerometer data belonging to 253 seniors residing in Barcelona, in combination with a GIS-based urban vitality index and a questionnaire for sociodemographic data and neighborhood perceptions. Results show that seniors in Barcelona tend to rest rather than being active in more vital areas. However, results differ among age and gender groups. The probability of using vital areas for outdoor rest was especially higher among older senior men (>75 years old). This study furthers our understanding of seniors' outdoor behavior, its relationship with the built environment and how this relationship varies among individual characteristics. Results might provide valuable insights for the design of vital urban spaces that can have positive contributions to seniors' lives while strengthening the community life by promoting social inclusion of all age and gender groups in urban life.",98,,,,,,['| | | Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 12 | Total Times Cited: 13 | Cited Reference Count: 66'],JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2021.103241,0966-6923,1.0,0,,43718.0,,,"Based on the provided sufficiency framework and classification criteria, let's analyze the abstract ""Urban vitality and seniors' outdoor rest time in Barcelona"":

,,,Environmental impacts of public transport systems using real-time control method,Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment,,,,2017,,,"Public Transport (PT) systems rely more and more on online information extracted from both operator's intelligent equipment and user's smartphone applications. This allows for a better fit between supply and demand of the multimodal PT system, especially through the use of PT real-time control actions/tactics. In doing so there is also an opportunity to consider environmental-related issues to approach energy saving and reduced pollution. This study investigates and analyses the benefits of using real-time PT operational tactics in reducing the undesirable environmental impacts. A tactic-based control (TBC) optimization model is used to minimize total passenger travel time and maximize direct transfers (without waiting). The model consists of a control policy built upon a combination of three tactics: holding, skip-stops, and boarding limit. The environmental-related measure is the global warming potential (GWP) using the life cycle assessment technique. The methodology developed is applied to a real life case study in Auckland, New Zealand. Results show that TBC could reduce the GWP by means of reduction of total passenger travel times and vehicle travel cycle time. That is, the TBC model results in a 5.6% reduction in total GWP per day compared with an existing no-tactic scenario. This study supports the use of real-time control actions to maintain a reliable PT service, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and subsequently moving towards greener PT systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010634314&doi=10.1016%2fj.trd.2016.12.006&partnerID=40&md5=85b5dc38844fb883cc35572265faa0db,,,10.1016/j.trd.2016.12.006,,,1,,,,"['Nesheli, M.M.', 'Ceder, A.A.', 'Ghavamirad, F.', 'Thacker, S.']","Based on the provided sufficiency framework, let's evaluate the abstract titled ""Environmental impacts of public transport systems using real-time control method"":

1. **Policy Measures & Practices**: The abstract mentions ""urban planning toward a sustainable cycling-friendly city,"" which can be considered a policy measure or practice designed to promote sustainable transportation.
2. **Resource Demand Avoidance**: The abstract does not explicitly address avoiding or reducing demand for resources (energy, materials, land, water, etc.).
3. **Well-being Delivery**: The abstract does not explicitly mention human well-being, equity, social welfare, etc.
4. **Planetary Boundaries Context**: The abstract mentions ""sustainable,"" which could be interpreted as addressing environmental limits or sustainability, but it is not explicitly linked to planetary boundaries or resource demand avoidance.

### Conclusion:
The abstract does not meet the criteria for either Combination 1 or Combination 2. While it mentions a policy measure (urban planning for sustainable cycling), it does not explicitly address resource demand avoidance or well-being delivery within the context of planetary boundaries.

,,,Surat's sustainable future: analyzing compact urban development and population density trends,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-URBAN DESIGN AND PLANNING,,,,2024,,,"Rapid urbanization is a challenge for the cities of developing countries like India. The share of an urban area is rapidly increasing in dynamically growing cities. Due to this, the land use is altered, causing sprawl and unplanned development. The consumption of resources is greater, and the impact on the surroundings is negative. The compact city concept is always more efficient and cost effective compared to unplanned organic growth. The compact city optimise available land resources with its maximum possible capacity in accordance with other available natural resources. The primary study objective is to assess the growth trend of Surat city using satellite images, GIS techniques and census data for the last few years. The analysis considers population density for different city wards from 1991 to 2020. Based on the land use land cover change carried out using the maximum likelihood method from the satellite images, the rate of spreading out, its direction, and causes are also found. In this study, population density is a crucial attribute of the compact city concept. The study shows that wardwise density is increasing in a specific direction and making that portion of the city a dense, compact development. This is observed in ward numbers 48, 42 and 35 in the East, North and Southeast directions from CBD, respectively. The average population density in persons per sq. km. is continuously increasing from 5006 to 20329 at city level which also shows the compact city development for Surat. The governing authorities must incorporate the compact city concept into the planning policy for sustainable urban development. By this, policymakers can understand housing needs to promote affordable housing, invest in infrastructure development and public services and identify areas where sustainable transportation options, such as public transit, walking, or cycling, need improvement.",,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/jurdp.24.00005,,,10.1680/jurdp.24.00005,,,1,,,,"['Chauhan, SR', 'Tailor, R']","Based on the provided sufficiency framework, let's evaluate the abstract for the paper titled ""Surat's sustainable future: analyzing compact urban development and population density trends"":

,,,Impact of road features on shared e-scooter trip volume: A study based on multiple membership multilevel model,Travel Behaviour and Society,,,,2022,,,"E-scooter sharing systems have been widely adopted by cities around the world. Previous studies analyzed community-level factors influencing e-scooter usage. Few studies examined the effect of road features on e-scooter trip volume (ETV) of the road segment, which can reveal the road features that riders prefer. This study explores this topic by analyzing the ETV of 29,544 road segments in Calgary, Canada, while controlling for community-level factors. Because some segments are the boundaries of multiple communities, the multiple membership multilevel model is adopted to tackle this boundary problem.

**Title**: Impact of road features on shared e-scooter trip volume: A study based on multiple membership multilevel model

**Abstract**: E-scooter sharing systems have been widely adopted by cities around the world. Previous studies analyzed community-level factors influencing e-scooter usage. Few studies examined the effect of road features on e-scooter trip volume (ETV) of the road segment, which can reveal the road features that riders prefer. This study explores this topic by analyzing the ETV of 29,544 road segments in Calgary, Canada, while controlling for community-level factors. Because some segments are the boundaries of multiple communities, the multiple membership multilevel model is adopted to tackle this boundary problem. The results show that segments with sidewalks, dedicated bicycle facilities, lower speed limit, more street lights and trees have higher ETV. ETV is also higher in communities with high income, high percentage of commercial and residential area. Quantifying the effect of road features on ETV could help government agencies determine where e-scooters should be ridden and design road facility improvement plans for e-scooter users. © 2022 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies

,,,Slugging: Casual Carpooling for Urban Transit,M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT,,,,2022,,,"Problem definition: Slugging, or casual carpooling, refers to the commuting practice of drivers picking up passengers at designated locations and offering them a free ride in order to qualify for high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. Academic/practical relevance: It is estimated that tens of thousands of daily commuters rely on slugging to go to work in major U.S. cities. As drivers save commute time and passengers ride for free, slugging can be a promising Smart Mobility solution. However, little is known about the welfare, policy, and environmental implications of slugging. Methodology: We develop a stylized model that captures the essence of slugging. We characterize commuters' equilibrium behavior in the model. Results: We find that slugging indeed makes commuters better off. However, the widely observed free-ride tradition is socially suboptimal. As compared with the social optimum, commuters always underslug in the free-slugging equilibrium when highway travel time is insensitive to slugging activities butmay overslug otherwise. The socially optimal outcome can be achieved by allowing pecuniary exchanges between drivers and passengers. Interestingly, passengers may be better off if they pay for a ride than if they do not under free slugging. We also find that although policy initiatives to expand highway capacity or improve public transportation always increase social welfare in the absence of slugging, they may reduce socialw elfare in areaswhere free slugging is amajor commuting choice. Nevertheless, these unintended consequences would be mitigated by the introduction of pecuniary exchanges. Finally, contrary to conventional wisdom, slugging as a form of carpooling can result in more cars on the road and thus, more carbon emissions. Managerial implications: Our results call upon the slugging community to rethink the free-ride practice. We also caution that slugging benefits commuters possibly to the detriment of the environment.",,,,,,0,,,10.1287/msom.2021.0988,,,1,,,,"['Cui, SL', 'Li, KL', 'Yang, LY', 'Wang, JT']","Based on the provided sufficiency framework, let's analyze the abstract for the paper titled ""Slugging: Casual Carpooling for Urban Transit"":

,,,The dynamics of fare and frequency choice in urban transit,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,,2010,,,"This paper investigates the choice of fare and service frequency by urban mass transit agencies. A more frequent service is costly to provide but is valued by riders due to shorter waiting times at stops, and faster operating speeds on less crowding vehicles. Empirical analyses in the 1980s found that service frequencies were too high in most of the cities studied. For a given budget constraint, social welfare could be improved by reducing service frequencies and using the money saved to lower fares. The cross-sectional nature of these analyses meant that researchers were unable to address the question of when the oversupply occurred. This paper seeks to answer that question by conducting a time-series analysis of the bus operations of the Chicago Transit Authority from 1953 to 2005. The paper finds that it has always been the case that too much service frequency was provided at too high a fare. The imbalance between fares and service frequency became larger in the 1970s when the introduction of operating subsidies coincided with an increase in the unit cost of service provision.
