This is the prompt created with Claude Sonnet 3.7 based on the extensive definition of sufficiency


# Prompt for Classification of Scientific Papers on Sufficiency

## Task
Analyze the abstract of scientific papers and classify them as either "About Sufficiency" or "Not About Sufficiency" based on the definition and criteria provided below.

## Definition of Sufficiency
Sufficiency is a set of policy measures and daily practices which avoid the demand for energy, materials, land, water, and other natural resources, while delivering well-being for all within planetary boundaries.

## Classification Criteria
A paper should be classified as "About Sufficiency" if it meets EITHER of these combinations:

### Combination 1:
- **Policy Measures & Practices** (required): Mentions at least one concrete policy, lifestyle choice, public policy, private action, or system designed to reduce resource consumption
  AND
- **Resource Demand Avoidance** (required): Explicitly addresses avoiding or reducing upfront demand for resources (not merely efficiency improvements or renewable substitution)

### Combination 2:
- **Policy Measures & Practices** (required): Mentions at least one concrete policy, lifestyle choice, public policy, private action, or system
  AND
- **Well-being Delivery** (required): Explicitly addresses maintaining or improving human well-being for all
  AND
- **Additional Context** (required for this combination): The paper must contain contextual elements suggesting the policies/practices help stay within planetary boundaries or manage natural resources sustainably

### Dimension Details
1. **Policy Measures & Practices**:
   - Keywords: practice, choice, lifestyle, public policy, private action, property, feature, technological device, system, service, regulation, initiative, intervention, standard, restriction
   
2. **Resource Demand Avoidance**:
   - Energy
   - Materials
   - Land
   - Water
   - Other natural resources
   - Keywords: reduction, avoidance, lowering consumption, minimizing use, decreasing demand, prevention, limits, caps, quotas

3. **Well-being Delivery**:
   - Well-being dimensions: Housing, Jobs, Education, Civic Engagement, Life Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, Income, Community, Environment, Health, Safety
   - Justice dimensions: Distributional, Procedural, Corrective, Recognitional, Transitional
   - Keywords: equity, quality of life, social welfare, human needs, prosperity, thriving communities, social benefits, shared resources

### Additional Context (Critical for Combination 2)
- **Planetary Boundaries Consideration**:
  - Climate change
  - Novel entities
  - Stratospheric ozone depletion
  - Atmospheric aerosol loading
  - Ocean acidification
  - Modification of biogeochemical flows
  - Freshwater change
  - Land system change
  - Biosphere integrity
  - Keywords: ecological limits, carrying capacity, environmental thresholds, sustainability boundaries, safe operating space

- **Specific Resources**:
  - Freshwater
  - Marine Resources
  - Wetlands
  - Metals and Ores
  - Non-Metallic Minerals
  - Fossil Fuels
  - Agricultural Land
  - Forests
  - Urban Land
  - Biomass

- **Conceptual Framework**:
  - COP 26 Sufficiency Framework (Saheb, 2021)
  - IPCC Climate Mitigation Report (2022)
  - IPCC Synthesis Report (2023)
  - Doughnut Economics
  - Degrowth
  - Post-growth
  - Circular economy (when focused on reducing total resource use)
  - Keywords: sustainable consumption, footprint reduction, resource caps, carrying capacity

## Classification Guidelines
- "About Sufficiency": The paper must meet EITHER Combination 1 OR Combination 2 criteria above
- "Not About Sufficiency": The paper fails to meet either combination of criteria
- Papers can be classified as "About Sufficiency" even if they also discuss efficiency, technological solutions, or other topics
- The entire paper does not need to focus exclusively on sufficiency to qualify

## Examples for Clarity

### Example 1: "About Sufficiency" via Combination 1
"This study evaluates urban car-free zone policies (Policy Measure) as a strategy to reduce urban transportation energy consumption and associated emissions (Resource Demand Avoidance). We analyze implementation strategies in three European cities and identify factors that influence public acceptance."

### Example 2: "About Sufficiency" via Combination 2
"This research examines community-based urban garden initiatives (Policy/Practice) that enhance food security for low-income neighborhoods while building social cohesion (Well-being). The study evaluates how these initiatives contribute to reducing land and water footprints compared to conventional supply chains, helping communities operate within local ecological constraints (Additional Context: planetary boundaries)."

### Example 3: "Not About Sufficiency"
"This analysis focuses on next-generation battery technology and its potential to accelerate renewable energy adoption. We model cost reductions and efficiency improvements expected over the next decade and their impact on grid stability."
[Missing: No focus on demand reduction or specific policies/practices for sufficiency]

## Output Format
Classification: [About Sufficiency / Not About Sufficiency]
Reasoning: [Brief explanation citing which combination criteria were met or not met, with specific evidence from the abstract]
