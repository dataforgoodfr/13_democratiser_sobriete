{"openalex_id":"W1924671000","chunk_idx":0,"text":"Findings from this article indicate that prenatal and early postnatal periods have a critical role in the individual outcome, as Barker affirms: \u201cMuch of human development is completed during the first 1000 days after conception\u201d. There is overall consistency in literature about negative effects of fetal and postnatal exposure to parental tobacco smoking on several outcomes: preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome, neurodevelopmental and behavioral problems, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, impaired lung function, asthma and wheezing.\n\nWhile maternal smoking during pregnancy plays a major role on adverse postnatal outcomes, it may also cumulate negatively with smoking during lactation and with second-hand smoking exposure.\n\nThis review aimed to discuss the current evidence regarding the short and long-term effects of parental tobacco smoking during a critical period of life (pregnancy and lactation). It should be pointed out that it was not strictly designed a priori as a systematic review, and that the PRISMA Statement was not fully applied (including PICOS). Although this is a weakness, a descriptive approach might benefit the reader.\n\nParental tobacco smoking\nHealth outcomes\nShort-term\nLong-term\nDuring pregnancy\nMaternal smoking\nPreterm birth\nFetal growth restriction\nLow birth weight\nAltered brain structure and function in newborns\nLower fetal heart rate variability\nReduced alveolarization\nIncreased risk of overweight and obesity\nHigher blood pressure\nIncreased risk of wheezing, asthma, airway hyperresponsiveness, impaired lung function, bronchitis\nPaternal\/environmental smoking\nLow birth weight\nFurther studies are needed\nDuring lactation\nMaternal smoking\nIncreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)\nNeurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders\nSleep disruption\nIncreased risk of overweight and obesity\nImpaired glucose homeostasis\nIncreased risk of respiratory allergy (asthma and rhinitis)\n\nThe results of this review strengthen the need to plan population health policies aimed to implement educational programs to hopefully minimize tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and lactation. Mothers should be strongly encouraged to stop smoking especially during pregnancy and lactation. Parents should know that exposure to prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoking is associated with different adverse outcomes and that tobacco smoking is one of the most preventable causes of infant morbidity and mortality. However, breastfeeding is the best way of infant feeding even if a mother doesn\u2019t quit smoking during lactation. Amalgamating results from different studies, this paper could be a useful tool to educate and increase"}

The validation of the mathematical connection between AOT and weather parameters has been established. The type of relationship between AOT and weather parameters can be direct or inverse. The assimilation of the fourteen years ground data set shows that some parameters like minimum temperature have been overtaken by the global climatic change. However, the sensitivity of this model was comparatively analyzed to be 0.1%. Hence, the south-west Nigeria aerosol activity may be the highest compared to northern Nigerian. Therefore more attention should placed on Lagos and Ogun state as its aerosol content may increase beyond control."}
