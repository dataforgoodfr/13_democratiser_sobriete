{"question": "The findings indicate that the increasing conversion of agricultural land to urban uses in rapidly expanding metropolitan areas has led to a measurable decline in both local food production capacity and ecosystem services. These land-system changes are associated with heightened pressures on freshwater resources, necessitating integrated planning approaches to balance urban development and resource conservation. Policymakers should prioritize the implementation of land use regulations and incentives that support sustainable urban expansion while safeguarding critical agricultural zones.", "regional_group": "Asia-Pacific States", "geographical_scopes": ["Local or subnational"], "main_country_focus": ["India"], "human_needs": ["Nutrition", "Shelter and living conditions"], "natural_ressource": ["Agricultural Land", "Freshwater", "Urban Land"], "wellbeing": ["Environment"], "justice_consideration": ["Distributional"], "planetary_boundaries": ["Land-System Change", "Freshwater Use"]}

{"question": "Our analysis of urban expansion demonstrates a strong correlation between the loss of peri-urban agricultural land and the decline in local food security. The findings suggest that rapid land-use change, if left unregulated, can compromise both nutritional outcomes and environmental resilience, especially in densely populated metropolitan regions. This underscores the necessity for integrated spatial planning policies that prioritize sustainable land management to balance development needs with long-term resource stewardship.", "regional_group": null, "geographical_scopes": ["Local or subnational"], "main_country_focus": [], "human_needs": ["Nutrition", "Shelter and living conditions"], "natural_ressource": ["Agricultural Land", "Urban Land"], "wellbeing": ["Environment"], "justice_consideration": ["Distributional"], "planetary_boundaries": ["Land-System Change"]}
{"question": "The analysis indicates that coastal urban expansion in Vietnam is intensifying pressure on marine resources and nearby wetlands, leading to heightened vulnerability for low-income communities reliant on fisheries. Unregulated land conversion for residential and commercial development is diminishing both ecosystem services and biodiversity. To address these concerns, stronger procedural justice measures, such as inclusive urban planning, are recommended to ensure equitable participation and sustainable outcomes.
