{"question": "In aquatic invertebrates, adaptation to hypoxic environments is often discussed in terms of physiological flexibility. While some species enhance their oxygen-uptake efficiency through increased gill surface area or improved hemocyanin oxygen affinity, others modify their behavioral responses to minimize energy expenditure under low-oxygen conditions. However, several studies indicate that not all invertebrate species show such adaptations, particularly those inhabiting environments with relatively stable oxygen levels. What factors might explain the absence of hypoxia-related physiological or behavioral plasticity in these species, despite theoretical predictions that such flexibility should evolve under fluctuating or low-oxygen regimes?", "response": "Lack of hypoxia-related physiological or behavioral plasticity in certain aquatic invertebrates may be explained by the relative stability of oxygen levels in their habitats, reducing the selective pressure for such adaptations. If hypoxic events are rare or mild, energy costs associated with maintaining or evolving additional plastic traits may outweigh their benefits. Furthermore, species with inherently low metabolic rates or alternative strategies, such as dormancy or valve closure, may rely on passive tolerance rather than active compensation. Ecological context, life history traits, and evolutionary trade-offs all contribute to the absence of observed plasticity despite theoretical predictions."}
