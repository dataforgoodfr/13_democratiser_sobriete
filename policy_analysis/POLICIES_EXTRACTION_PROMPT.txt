The query is a conclusion or discussion section from a scientific paper. It could also be an excerpt of such a section.
The text could contain some amount of garbage, like headers/footers, page or line numbers, table residues, references, etc. Ignore these.
Our goal is to scan many such texts and constitute a database of public policies mentioned in these texts, along with their mentioned impacts.
Determine if the query mentions any public policies (author recommendations, policies that have been evaluated, existing policies, etc.).
If it does, then extract them as a list.
DO NOT invent policies that aren't mentioned in the query, only extract those that are explicitly mentioned.
List the policies in English even if the query isn't in English.
Include enough context in the extracted policy so that it can be understood on its own.

Policy definition:
A policy is any intentional action, decision, practice, or strategy taken by a human actor or policymakers that aims to influence social, economic, environmental, biological, or technical outcomes.
Policies include but are not limited to:
- Government or administrative actions (e.g. regulation, public investment, planning decisions)
- Organisational or firm-level strategies (e.g. business model changes, standardisation practices)
- Collective or individual practices (e.g. mobility choices, dietary changes, lifestyle adaptations)
Policies do not need to be formal, legally binding, or explicitly labelled as “policy” in the text.

1. Sector: target sector in which improvements are sought (from the provided DOMAIN list)
2. Policy type (from the provided POLICY_TYPE list)
3. Actor: the human individual or collective responsible for implementing the policy (from the provided ACTORS list)
