{"cleaned_text": "The way people handle stress has a significant influence on how it affects their general well-being. There has been a lot of research on stress management in the teaching profession. Many studies have been done to determine the sources of stress for educators. For example, a study by Shaheen and Mahmood and Skaalvik and Skaalvik reveals a number of stressors, such as work-related stress, depression, success-related feelings, a lack of emotional support, workload, interpersonal relationships, and the workplace. According to Cooper and Dewe and Dlamini & Adams , stress factors can have physiological as well as psychological effects, which can result in health problems, anxiety, anger, depression, and feelings of inadequacy. Stress among teachers has serious effects on both teachers and students. Reduced job commitment, job satisfaction, and teaching quality have all been associated with high levels of stress . Teachers under stress may also exhibit less effective classroom management and teaching strategies, which can have a detrimental impact on students' learning outcomes. Teachers use a range of coping mechanisms to handle stress. These tactics fall into two general categories: direct action and palliative methods. Exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption are examples of palliative techniques that are intended to lessen emotional distress . Proactive approaches to managing stressors, such as talking to mental health specialists or colleagues, are referred to as direct action techniques. Teachers frequently rely on administrators and other staff members for social support, which is a critical component of stress management . Teachers with positive social networks have been found to have better mental and physical health . Furthermore, teachers' well-being is significantly impacted by the support of their spouses and romantic partners . The unique stressors that preschool teachers encounter stem from their role as careers for young students. Teachers are required by the Kurikulum Standard Pra Sekolah (Standard Preschool Curriculum) to get their students ready for national exams. This creates a number of issues, including crammed classrooms and a lack of support from parents and administrators. Preschool teachers' job satisfaction and commitment are negatively impacted by stress, which may result in attrition and lower the standard of instruction for young students. Stress among teachers is a common and alarming problem that is fueled by a number of factors. Effective coping mechanisms and social support networks are essential, given the detrimental effects of stress on educators and learners. By comprehending the difficulties educators encounter and recognizing effective coping strategies, the teaching profession can strive to establish a nurturing and enduring work atmosphere. To create more resilient coping mechanisms and safeguard the welfare of both educators and learners, more research is necessary. This will ultimately help to create a supportive and productive learning environment. On the other hand, work overload describes a situation in which a person is overburdened with tasks, responsibilities, or work that exceeds their ability to manage or finish. This may result in higher levels of stress, lower output, and detrimental effects on well-being and job satisfaction. According to Osaat and Ekechukwu , workloads are the duties or all the tasks carried out by workers in the course of their activities in their workplace. Relating to the lecturers, workloads are professional and non- professional duties carried out by the lecturers in the course of their activities in the instruction of students. Lecturers are the greatest assets as well as major stakeholders in the university industry. Osaat and Ekechukwu also note that the main work of lecturers is to teach and bring up the young generation of students to acquire skills and knowledge for growth and development. Teaching is a difficult task and demands serious commitment In addition to the responsibilities listed above, lecturers handle a wide range of other tasks, some of which are difficult and occasionally conflict with their main responsibilities as academic staff members and teachers. Lecturers may experience work overload due to a variety of reasons, including grading and assessment, student supervision, resource constraints, long teaching days, research and publication obligations, and administrative duties. These lecturers' primary responsibility is teaching, which exposes them to a variety of tasks almost simultaneously.

These lecturers' primary responsibility is teaching, which exposes them to a variety of tasks almost simultaneously. The National Universities Commission (NUC) Benchmark Minimum Academic Standard (BMAS) recommendation of students to lecturers is not followed by many Nigerian universities, which adds to the burden of teaching a large number of students in each class . For various student categories (regular undergraduate, part-time undergraduate, sandwich, postgraduate, pre-degree, open and distance education, etc.), they instruct up to four to five courses or more. As a result, they work continuously throughout the year with little to no vacation. According to the American Psychological Association , one of the things that causes stress among workers is overwork (excess workload). However, the recommendations made by lecturers to students regarding the NUC (National Universities Commission) are tailored according to the unique characteristics of each faculty. For instance, NUC shows that for the faculties of Administration, Arts, Education, Law, and Social Sciences, the Lecturer-Student Ratio (LSR) is 1:30; for Science, the LSR is 1:20; for Technology, Environmental Design, and Management, and Agricultural Science, the LSR is 1:15. For Basic Medical Sciences, Clinical Sciences, Dentistry, and Pharmacy, the LSR is 1:10. Brief Historical Background of Obafemi Awolowo University Obafemi Awolowo University, located in IleIfe, Nigeria, is a renowned institution of higher education. It was established in 1962 as the University of Ife by the regional government of Western Nigeria, under the leadership of Chief Samuel Ladoke Akintola, the then Premier of the Western Region of Nigeria. In 1987, the university was renamed Obafemi Awolowo University in honor of Chief Obafemi Awolowo, a prominent Nigerian nationalist, lawyer, and statesman who played a significant role in the country's fight for independence. Currently, Obafemi Awolowo University houses 13 faculties: Environmental Design and Management These faculties are then divided into various departments, offering a wide range of academic programs. Each department specializes in specific areas of study. In summary, Obafemi Awolowo University provides a comprehensive educational experience. The university has remained a well-known center of excellence over the years, according to information retrieved from the university website and signed by Omosule, registrar and secretary to the council . Known as \"the most beautiful\" campus south of Sub-Saharan Africa, the university has produced National Merit Award winners and a Nobel Laureate among its faculty. It has also led the way in the development of cutting-edge technologies that can help address some of the current problems facing society. Academic Strengths of Obafemi Awolowo University Based on the report of the Federal Ministry of Education to Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife.

{"cleaned_text": "OAU The above table illustrates the extremely deplorable state of affairs in the university, with only five (5) of the thirteen faculties having reached the required lecturer-to-student ratio and, consequently, meeting NUC benchmarks in their respective fields. There are significant gaps in the remaining eight faculties, with the Faculty of Technology having the largest deficit at 154 academic staff members. Compared to the 370 shortages noted in the 2017/2018 session, there are now 435 total shortfalls for the 13 faculties. However, the Registrar and Secretary to the Council, Omosule , states in the job advertisement for the university registrar position that the university's initial enrollment of 244 students has increased to 34,036 as of the 2021/2022 academic year. Additionally, the university, which began operations with 94 employees, has expanded to employ 4,000 people, of whom 2,635 are non-teaching staff and 1,365 are academic staff. The data above is consistent with the finding of Osaat and Ekechukwu , which reveals that academic staff members in most universities in Nigeria are observed to be overworked because, regrettably, the number of academic staff does not keep up with the growing number of students enrolling in universities. In a nutshell, the abundance of data gathered overwhelmingly indicates that there is a significant shortage of staff members at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. This inadequacy of lecturers has the potential to impose excessive workloads on the existing lecturers, subsequently having a detrimental impact on their performance and job satisfaction. Work Overload: Impact on Lecturers' Stress Levels, Job Satisfaction, and Overall Well-Being Work overload can have a significant impact on lecturers' stress levels, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. When lecturers have an excessive workload, they often experience higher levels of stress. The pressure to complete numerous tasks within tight deadlines can lead to feelings of overwhelm and anxiety. Chronic stress can have detrimental effects on mental and physical health, leading to burnout, exhaustion, and decreased productivity . Work overload can diminish job satisfaction among lecturers. When they constantly feel overwhelmed by their workload, they may find less enjoyment and fulfillment in their work. Lecturers may struggle to maintain enthusiasm for teaching, Work overload can significantly impact the overall well-being of lecturers. The sustained pressure and demands can lead to a lack of work- life balance, causing strain on personal relationships, decreased leisure time, and neglect of self-care. Lecturers may experience physical symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and sleep disorders. Moreover, work overload can negatively impact their psychological well-being, leading to feelings of overwhelm, frustration, and a compromised sense of purpose. Work overload brings about unnecessary stress, fatigue, and headaches, which has led to the demise of many lecturers . Paradoxically, excessive workload can impair lecturers' productivity and the quality of their work. When lecturers are overloaded, they may have to rush through tasks, leading to subpar performance. The lack of time for adequate preparation, grading, and feedback can compromise the quality of teaching and supervision, affecting the student's learning experience in the long run. If work overload persists over time, lecturers may find it challenging to engage in professional development activities, conduct research, or publish papers. A lack of time and energy may hinder their ability to pursue promotions, grants, and other career advancements, potentially affecting their career progression in academia . It should be noted that mitigating work overload is crucial to supporting lecturers' well- being, job satisfaction, and overall effectiveness. Strategies such as workload distribution, realistic expectations, supportive work environments, adequate resources, and time management training can help alleviate the burden and create a healthier and more productive work environment for lecturers.

Empirical Studies Previous research has shown that the excessive bureaucratic tasks that European university professors must add to their teaching and research responsibilities frequently have an impact on their psychosocial well-being, which includes their coping mechanisms, internal states (mood), and psychophysical well-being. According to Tight , the perception among academics today that their workloads are getting heavier may be directly related to the amount of time they spend on administration; nonetheless, the rising quantity and percentage of academic time that is spent on administrative tasks can have an impact on university lecturers' well-being. Put differently, the teacher's commitment to completing all of his responsibilities to the best of his ability, almost to the point of alienation, makes the workload a risk factor for stress (Pace, D'Urso, Zappulla, & Pace, 2019). Their research concludes that university professors' negative perception of their work-related well-being is predisposed by their workload, which is associated with bureaucratic university procedures. Furthermore, according to several studies , this may pose a risk to the university as a whole. Hobson and Beach's study highlighted the risk factors associated with psychological health, including excessive workloads and frustrating work-related excesses. On the other hand, workload can decrease if one works in a non-compulsive manner and does not take on excessive tasks . Conversely, other research has indicated that university lecturers face occupational constriction due to inadequate funding and resources, work overload, or poor management practices relative to requirements, which may put them under stress . According to the Health and Safety Executive in Great Britain, stress, anxiety, and depression are linked to 39% of work-related complaints. It also stated that the age group of 45– Wu, and Wang on occupational stress and its related factors among Chinese university lecturers. Specifically, mental health, role overload, role insufficiency, social support, monthly income, role Pace, 2013). Additionally, the study by Bauer et al. on working conditions: adverse events and mental health problems in a sample of 949 German teachers highlighted that many participants reported significant mental health problems regarding stress, concentration skills, sleep issues, decision-making ability, and feelings of depression and sadness. In a recent contribution, it was discovered (Hogan, Hogan, & Hodgins, 2016) that workaholism is more common in academia in Ireland than in other professions and that it negatively affects both psychological well-being and work-related outcomes. According to research by Kinman and Wray , there is a tendency for stress to increase with time, and 75% of lecturers believe their job is stressful. Hobson and Beach looked at the relationship between psychological health, work-related stress, and excessive workloads. The study conducted by Arbabisarjou, Ajdari, Omeidi, and Jalalinejad examined the connection between hospital nurses' performance and job stress in Iran. The descriptive correlation research method was employed. Of all the nurses, Pearson coefficient correlation were used to analyze the data. The study's conclusion demonstrates that there is a negative relationship between performance and job stress.

The study's conclusion demonstrates that there is a negative relationship between performance and job stress. A study by Warraich, Ahmed, Ahmend, and Khoso examined the impact of stress on workers' job performance in Karachi, Pakistan's private universities. For the study, 133 staff members of private universities in Karachi that offer courses in business administration, engineering, medicine, textiles, and fashion were used. The theory was tested using the multiple linear regression technique. Workload, role conflict, and inadequate financial compensation are the main causes of employee stress, according to the data, and this stress lowers employee efficiency. According to the study, to improve employees' job performance and job satisfaction, employers should reduce stress by reducing workload, reducing role conflict, paying a fair salary, and offering employees training and counseling. A study on academics' emotional intelligence and job stress performance was conducted by Yusoff, Khan, and Azam , 65 faculty members from two Pakistani universities, one public and one private, were included in the study's sample. A questionnaire was used to gather the data, and descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze it. It was discovered that there is a strong positive correlation between emotional intelligence and job performance, but a negative correlation between job stress and performance. It was suggested that Pakistan's higher education system attempt to manage students' emotional competence by fostering a positive work environment, in addition to concentrating on identifying job stress factors. Anazodo, Onyeizugbe, and Uchenna note that there is a strong positive correlation between work-life balance and academic performance and that academic workload has an impact on the health of Nigerian university lecturers. According to the study's findings, stress management is essential for raising the caliber of instruction delivered by Nigerian university lecturers, and ignoring this practice will hinder the expansion of the higher education sector. Pedro and Roberts looked at the connection between management communication and the perception of organizational support a factor that affects employee performance. A panel design with cross-lags was used in the study. A social service organization in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States distributed 575 copies of the questionnaire to supervisors and subordinates. The study's conclusion indicates that there was a positive correlation between management communication and a change in perceived organizational support over time. The study concludes that management communication has an impact on performance primarily because it conveys to workers that the company values their contributions to the organization's expansion and cares about their well-being. In South Korea, Kyoung looked into how affective commitment and role performance were affected by work-life balance. Information was obtained from 293 Korean labourers. Regression analysis and structural equations were used in the study to test the hypothesis. The outcome demonstrates that work-life balance has no direct impact on in-role performance. The study also shows that affective commitment is positively correlated with in-role performance and that employees' experiences of work-life balance enhance affective commitment. Amina and Bako examined the effects of stress on the performance of university lecturers in Nigeria. The study looked at pertinent empirical research on the relationship between job stress and the performance of Nigerian university lecturers. The study focused on how stress negatively affects lecturers' performance in Nigerian universities, highlighting issues such as depression, poor sexual performance, fabricating excuses for poor work, chronic fatigue, difficulty making decisions, and social disengagement. According to the report, individuals should evaluate their values, identify their ideal lifestyles, and then work on improving their problem-solving abilities. A study by Osaat and Ekechukwu examined the workload of lecturers and its impact on their job performance, as well as effective management techniques to handle workload, are important factors to consider. The study also looked at coping mechanisms for handling workloads, such as time management, setting priorities for different tasks, and consistently taking short breaks or vacations. Therefore, their study concludes that Nigerian lecturers would work and live to work again if these strategies were followed by administrations and instructors alike; hence, the workload would be managed to a great extent. Stress management skills were studied by Nnabuife, Onyeizugbe, and Onwuka as a requirement for enhancing the performance of female lecturers in Nigerian universities. The research utilized a descriptive survey that involved administering questionnaires. A total of 135 participants were chosen from seven Nigerian universities.

According to the study, female lecturers in Nigerian universities experience health problems as a result of occupational stress. The study suggests that to guarantee that its goals are consistently met, efficient stress management policies should be implemented, regularly funded, and reviewed. In Kwara State College of Education in Nigeria, Alabi, Marlala, and Lawal investigated the nature of the relationship between lecturers' job performance and work stress. The correlation design method was used in the study. For the study, a random selection of 111 lecturers was made. The results show that lecturers had an excessive amount of work to do for academic purposes. Also, behavioral and psychological work stress had a negative impact on lecturers' ability to perform their jobs. It was suggested that lecturers take a regular stress management induction course. Kyriacou emphasized that it is imperative to keep an eye on the degree to which academic systems are contributing to elevated levels of stress among educators and look into the reasons behind the success of certain lecturers in navigating periods of career reappraisal and maintaining a positive commitment to employment (particularly research and instructional activities). According to Sarmiento's study, routinely practicing biofeedback, which entails monitoring one's body functions to improve one's general health, is one way to manage stress brought on by workload. Mayo contends that, among other strategies, effective time management, learning to say no, taking a vacation, and listening to music are effective ways to deal with work-related stress. In a similar vein, Orluwene notes that to manage their workload, employees should take advantage of quick breaks to go for a walk or take lunch and refreshments. They should also plan a balanced schedule of daily tasks to avoid burnout. According to research by Susic , taking a break from work and unplugging for a while is crucial as it allows the body, soul, and spirit to rest. Potential Strategies to Manage and Mitigate Work Overload among Lecturers Managing and mitigating work overload among lecturers requires a multi-faceted approach that focuses on various aspects of their workload and well-being. The following were considered as some interventions and strategies that can be implemented: Ensuring a fair and equitable distribution of workload among lecturers can help prevent excessive workloads. This may involve reviewing teaching assignments, research responsibilities, and Providing lecturers with the necessary resources, such as teaching assistants, support staff, technology, and budget allocations, can help alleviate their workload. Having access to appropriate resources can enhance efficiency and productivity, allowing lecturers to focus on their core responsibilities. In addition, offering training programs on time management, organizational skills, and stress management can equip lecturers with tools and techniques to better manage their workload and enhance their resilience. Training in these areas can also help improve their efficiency and reduce stress levels. Creating a supportive work environment where lecturers can openly communicate their challenges and seek assistance is crucial. Encouraging teamwork, collaboration, and mutual support among lecturers can also help alleviate work overload through shared responsibilities and collective problem-solving. Simplifying and streamlining administrative processes can help reduce the burden on lecturers. Automating routine administrative tasks, minimizing paperwork, and leveraging technology for streamlined processes can free up lecturers' time and energy to focus on their core responsibilities. Promoting work-life balance initiatives, such as flexible work arrangements, wellness programs, and initiatives to promote healthy and positive work environments, can support lecturers' well-being. These initiatives can help alleviate work overload by providing opportunities for rest, relaxation, and personal time. There is a need for the establishment of regular feedback mechanisms and evaluation processes to ensure that workload distribution and performance expectations are reviewed periodically. This can help identify and address workload issues proactively and provide opportunities for adjustments based on feedback from lecturers. Furthermore, encouraging collaboration and networking opportunities with other lecturers and researchers can support lecturers in sharing workloads, ideas, and resources. Collaborative projects and partnerships can help distribute workloads and enhance productivity. The need for establishing effective communication channels and feedback loops between lecturers, department heads, and administration can open dialogues regarding workload concerns.

Existing lecturers reported feeling emotionally exhausted from their excessive workloads and finding it difficult to maintain a work-life balance as a result of the inadequate academic staff members. These results highlight how crucial it is to address work overload in higher education to protect lecturers' health and output. According to the study's findings, work overload negatively impacts the well-being of lecturers at Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. As a result, recruiting more lecturers to fill open positions will help the university comply with the NUC's recommendation concerning the lecturer-to-student ratio. Based on the research findings, several recommendations can be made to help alleviate work overload and enhance the well-being of lecturers at Obafemi Awolowo University. By implementing these recommendations, Obafemi Awolowo University and other educational institutions can take significant strides towards promoting the well-being of its lecturers and creating a conducive work environment that supports productivity and job satisfaction. It recommends that the university administration consider implementing workload management policies and practices that promote a balanced distribution of teaching, research, and administrative responsibilities. This could involve revising curriculum guidelines, providing adequate resources and support for lecturers, and fostering a culture of collaboration and teamwork. It is essential to provide professional development opportunities and training programs for lecturers to enhance their time management and organizational skills. This can help them prioritize tasks effectively and optimize their productivity, ultimately reducing work overload. The paper suggests that the creation of a supportive work environment that encourages open communication, feedback, and recognition can contribute to lecturers' well-being. Regular meetings, a mentoring program, and wellness initiatives can foster a sense of belonging and reduce stress levels. The study also recommends that the university management should comply with the NUC recommendation on the lecturers/students ratio by recruiting more academic staff members. This will reduce the workload on the existing lecturers.", "deleted_count": 2, "triggered_rules": ["trim_garbage_start", "results_discussions"]}
{"cleaned_text": "SST Anomalies, and peat fire occurrence Like other tropical regions, Central Kalimantan experiences two seasons namely a dry and a wet season. Previous studies have defined dry and wet seasons in Central Kalimantan by using the monthly rainfall variation. But this monthly precipitation is not sufficient to understand the fires that occur almost every day even in June or before the dry season. Therefore we examined the precipitation variability to investigate the influence of precipitation variability on the fire activity in the MRP area by analyzing the 30-years of daily precipitation data from The analysis clearly shows a U-shaped precipitation pattern in Palangkaraya with a high plateau from December to March and a trough reaching minimum in the middle of August, clearly shows the actual wet and dry periods in Palangkaraya. This pattern is one of three typical precipitation patterns in Indonesia . A daily mean precipitation (7.8 mm) is used here to differentiate the dry and wet periods in Palangkaraya. The wet period lasts for about seven months and it is two months longer than the dry periods. Thus, the length of the dry periods is about five months from the start of June (DN 152) to the end of October (DN 301). This study defines June to October as the dry periods in Palangkaraya. The precipitation pattern in clearly shows the large difference in precipitation between the wet and dry periods in Palangkaraya. There is a more than two times difference between the mean daily precipitation values in the dry periods (4.7 mm) and wet periods (10.0 mm), and the total precipitation in the dry periods (698.9 mm) is Ground water level measurement point Tjilik Riwut climatology station Scale: 1 : 1,400,000 Palangkaraya during the dry period. Low daily precipitation, less than the mean dry precipitation (4.7 mm), occurred between July and September and the lowest daily precipitation of less than U-curve shape is for the rate of occurrence of rainless days. The rate of occurrence of rainless days is higher than the number of rainy days in a year. Occurrence rates of rainless days in the wet period are between 38 and 60% and increases to more than 60% in the dry period. The occurrence rates of rainy days are between 20 and 36% in the wet period and less than 15% in the dry period. In the peak of the dry period, the middle of August, there are not only high occurrence rates (more than 80%) of rainless days but also low occurrence rates (less than 10%) of rainy days. Under these occurrence rates, dry weather conditions are created and conducive conditions of ignition of peat are created; stimulating the high fire activity in the area in this period. Almost all of the past positive Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies or El Niño events brought droughts to Indonesia.

However the amount of precipitation in the dry period of El Niño years may be below 15% of the mean annual precipitation (2845.7 mm), such as in 1982 (240.8 mm, 8.46%), 1987 (347.5 mm, 12.21%), 1991 (292.8 mm, 10.29%), 1997 (117.0 mm, 4.11%), 2002 (308.1 mm, 10.83%), and in 2006 (294.5 mm, 10.35%). These numbers suggest that severe droughts occurred during the dry period of El Niño years, with resulting severe fire occurrences. The number of hotspots or fires detected in Central Kalimantan are 26,757 in 1997; 19,470 in 2002; and 41,102 in 2006 . There is a negative correlation between Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies and precipitation in Palangkaraya during the dry period. Previously, a strong correlation between SST anomalies and the precipitation variability were reported for some regions in Indonesia . The Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies of more than ºC bring less than 500 mm precipitation in the dry period such as in 1991 (292.8 mm, +0.8 ºC), and 2006 (294.5 mm, +0.5 ºC). Less than 350 mm precipitation occurred in the dry period when the Niño 3.4 SST anomalies average was above +1 ºC as in 1982 (240.8 mm, +1.4 ºC), and 2002 (308.1 mm, +1.1 ºC). There was only 117.0 mm of precipitation during the dry period of 1997 when the Niño 3.4 SST anomaly averaged 2.1 ºC. Low Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies smaller than -0.5 ºC brings large amounts of precipitation in the dry period. The amount of precipitation in the dry period exceeded 850 mm in 1988, 1998, 1999, and 2007 when the Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies in the dry period were below ºC. However, below mean value precipitation also occurred in several neutral or non El Niño years such as in 1990, 2003, and 2005, when there were low positive Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies, between +0.1 ºC and +0.5 ºC, in the dry season. This study used the total number of rainless days (TNR) and the maximum number of consecutive rainless days (MNR) in the dry season to assess fire risks in the MRP area based on the precipitation variability.

Thus, this study clearly showed a positive correlation between Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies and both of TNR and MNR; indicating that the recent severe dry conditions in Palangkaraya are closely related with positive Niño 3.4 SST Anomaly occurrences. Hotspots or fires in the MRP area numbered 7017, 4618, and 2052 in the dry periods of the El Niño years 2006, 2004, and 2002, respectively. The large number of hotspots showed that peat fires in the MRP area are more common in El Niño years. Murdiyarso and Adiningsih showed the role of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in providing dry weather inducing biomass burning and widespread fires.

The number of fires increased progressively in the dry period as the dry period progressed. Fires in the starting month of the dry period (June) contributed only 1.24% of the total number of fires, but fires at the end of the dry period (October) contributes more than 39% of the total fire number. More than 88% of fires occurred in the dry period, strongly suggesting a coupling of the dry period and fire occurrences in the MRP area. MRP area coincide with the precipitation curve.

This is caused as fires spread rapidly when they take hold in dry surface biomass and dry peat . The fire season ended at the start of November or about ten days after the end of the dry season at the end of October. This may indicate that peat in the MRP area is still in the dry condition at the beginning of the wet period, after suffering from the severe dry conditions of the long dry period, thus maintaining conditions where ignition may easily occur.

Fires are fewer and the period of occurrence is shorter in non-El Niño years, but both El Niño and non-El Niño years show the same starting day of the fire season (DN 212, end of July) and peak fire period (DN 230, middle of August). The fire season is shorter in non-El Niño years (DN 296, end of October) than in El Niño years (DN 316, start of November). Large amounts of precipitation at the end of the dry period significantly decreases the number of fires, followed by the end of peak fire period and fire season in non-El Niño years at DN 295 and DN 306, respectively. However, the peak fire period and fire season in El Niño years lasts longer (DN 316 and DN 323, respectively); this may be a result of the still dry condition of the peat early in November due to low rainfall pattern at the beginning of rainy season in El Niño years. The composite seasonal precipitation and fire cycle in is derived from years 2002 and 2006 for the El Niño years, and years 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2005 for the non-El Niño years. Ground water levels, precipitation, and peat fire occurrence The ground water level (GWL) could be one of the key indicators determining fire activity in peatlands because the dryness of peat and the moisture content of grass, litter, and the surface peat are directly influenced by the GWL . and 11 shows that peat fires occurred when the GWL was lower than the soil surface both in El Niño years and non-El Niño years; suggesting that the low GWL accelerated conditions where fires ignite with ease. and 11 show that fire occurrences in the MRP area coincide with the GWL. The decrease in GWL in El Niño years is faster than in non-El Niño years (Fig 10). The GWL dropped below the soil surface from the middle of May and reached a minimum of -117.4 cm at the end of October in El Niño years; in non- El Niño years the minimum in GWL was -59.5, reached at the middle of October. This evidence strongly indicates that the dry conditions of the peat in El Niño years during the dry period is more severe rather than that in the non-El Niño years, thus accelerating and causing larger numbers of fires in El Niño years than in non-El Niño years. The fire records both in El Niño years and non-El Niño years and 11) showed that the fire season in the MRP area started when the GWL dropped to around -30 cm and fires become more severe when the GWL is below -40 cm. The moisture content of the top layer of the peat will decrease when the ground water level in tropical peat drops below -40 cm (from the surface level) (Wösten et al. 2008), making the peat susceptible to fires. There is an exception in 2004 where large numbers of fires start when the GWL is at around -20 cm, but in this year the GWL progressively decreased until it reached -71.4 at the middle of October (not showed in", "deleted_count": 11, "triggered_rules": ["regex_table_soup", "remove_citations", "figure_or_table", "fig_table_ref"]}

The GWL stays steady at around 5 cm above the soil surface between January and the middle of May, in the wet season; this suggests that the area could be categorized as a peat swamp forest area. The GWL decreased progressively below the soil surface during the dry period from the end of May until it reached the lowest value in early October; clearly indicating that the GWL followed the precipitation changes. However, there is a time-lag between GWL and precipitation. There is about a one and a half month time-lag between the lowest precipitation in mid August and the lowest GWL in early October. The decrease in precipitation occurs over three months to reach the lowest in mid August (from mid May), but the lowering of GWL below the soil surface takes around 4.5 months from the middle of May until it reaches its lowest value in early October. The GWL then reaches the soil surface again at the end of December after the precipitation has reached its highest value in mid December. This may suggest that the recovery of the ground water level in the MRP area occurs after having been replenished by the water supplied by the continuous precipitation. Finally, this study has established the factors that are important for peat fire occurrences in the MRP area, including: the onset of the dry period and precipitation patterns, Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies, and ground water level changes in the dry season. As peat fires in the MRP area are human caused fires , fire forecasts based on such information will assist in preventing devastating peat fire occurrences in the future in the MRP area. The analysis using daily precipitation data, hotspot data, Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies, and ground water levels clearly support the following conclusions: Under this precipitation pattern, the dryness of the peat is increased and stimulated the large number of fire occurrences. Around 2938 of fires or 87.1% of the annual number of fires in the MRP area occurred in the peak fire period, indicating that the large areas of bare peat in the MRP area now are highly susceptibility to fires, coupled with the precipitation pattern of the dry period.

The growth of CH4 emissions is attributed mostly to an in- crease in emissions from the energy sector, with AAGRs of 5.8 %–9.0 %. A considerable discrepancy was found between REAS and the other inventories in terms of the magnitude and variation, with a difference as high as This result was probably because the coal consumption trend was adjusted to a higher value in the China Statistical Year- book (CSY), according to the GOME satellite, with a higher trend (increased 50 % from 1996–2002) than the provincial statistical trend (25 %) and IEA trend (15 %) . The CH4 emissions estimated from EDGAR v5.0 were 13.2 % higher than those from the NCCC in the respective corresponding periods. These re- sults are due to the higher estimates of agriculture and energy emissions obtained by using higher emission factors in rice cultivation and coal mining in EDGAR . For coal mining, the emis- sion factor used in EDGAR is 10.0 m3 t−1, while the NCCC is a lower 8.89 m3 t−1, and for rice cultivation, EDGAR is 0.1–1.4 g m−2 d−1, while the NCCC is 0.005–0.21 g m−2 d−1 .

Emissions derived from PKU were 12.2 % lower than those from the NCCC, which resulted from the lower emission factors in livestock and coal mining . Therefore, the provincial emission factors in for coal mining emissions are useful in the im- provement of national-data-based inventories. Speciﬁcally, agricultural activities were the main contrib- utors to national CH4 emissions before 2000 (46.1 %–60.0 % of the total emissions;, as reported by the FAO. Emissions from agriculture were rather stable and showed slight decreases during 2000–2010, with AAGRs of −0.7 %– (AAGR: 0.9 %), a reduction in livestock (AAGR: −0.6 %) in EDGAR v5.0, and a dominating increasing trend in live- stock in CEDSv2021-02-05 (AAGR: 2.3 %). Over the study period, energy source emissions showed a substan- tial increase, ranging from 11.0 ± 3.0 Tg CH4 yr−1 in 1990 to 24.0 ± 2.4 Tg CH4 yr−1 in 2010. After 2000, emissions from energy increased signiﬁcantly and became the lead- ing source (AAGR: 5.9 %–9.0 %, 2000–2010). This increase was mainly driven by the rapid growth of coal production in China, with an AAGR up to 9.0 % in the 2000s, while it was only 2.6 % in the 1990s according to the ofﬁcial data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China . However, China has consolidated its coal industry to concen- trate production by transforming small mines into larger and more efﬁcient coal mines (abandoning approximately 4000 mines) since 2010 . As a result, the emissions from coal mines have stabilized or decreased since 2012, with coal production in 2016 returning to lev- els similar to those in 2010 (∼2.4 × 103 million metric tons) . Additionally, discrepancies exist in the magnitude of waste sector emissions, although the value continued to increase steadily during 2000–2010 (AAGR: 2.1 %–3.4 %).

To interpret the discrepancy in emissions among different inventories, frequency distri- bution and kappa analysis were conducted at the grid cell level. The higher kappa coefﬁcient of 0.51 indicates that EDGAR has a relatively better agreement with PKU than CEDS and GAINS (0.43 and 0.40). REAS had a weak corre- lation with PKU, with a kappa coefﬁcient of 0.30. Remark- able regional disparities were observed among inventories. The spatial patterns had a close relationship with regional urbanization and economic activities because of the associ- ated increased energy production and livestock and waste sector emissions. High-emission areas (e.g., emitting grids >40 g CH4 m−2 yr−1) were generally located in densely pop- ulated areas (such as Beijing and Shanghai), energy pro- duction regions (such as Shanxi), and rice cultivation areas in south-central China as well as livestock-dominated re- gions in the North China Plain and Northeast China. The western regions showed low emissions (e.g., emitting grids <1 g CH4 m−2 yr−1). Intense emissions from large cities are attributable to industrial activities, transportation, and solid waste in landﬁlls . The expansive areas of rice paddy and double-cropping systems in southern and central China are recognized as being large contributors to the corresponding high emissions . Due to massive emissions from coal min- ing, provinces such as Shanxi, Ningxia, Henan, Guizhou, Chongqing, and Sichuan were emissions hotspots, emitting grids higher than 40 g CH4 m−2 yr−1. To further character- ize the spatial distribution of emissions hotspots, the top 2 % of high-emitting grids (>33 g CH4 m−2 yr−1) based on PKU were analyzed to identify the consistency and differences among inventories–V). Regional emissions hotspots were presented in PKU and EDGAR, III), suggest1079 North China Plain and southern agricultural areas. However, such patterns showed a large spatial heterogeneity among in- ventories. There was a lack of emissions hotspots in southern China in GAINS. Speciﬁcally, PKU and EDGAR both showed a large number (>1000;, III) of high- emitting grids (emissions >33 g CH4 m−2 yr−1), accounting for 27 % and 41 % of total emissions.

In addition, the number of high-emitting grids (32 % of total emissions) from REAS was less than half that from PKU and EDGAR. This indicated that CEDS and GAINS cannot properly in- terpret hotspots. Emissions hotspots in REAS were strongly biased towards Shanxi Province. The incomplete information on emission patterns may mislead or bias mitigation efforts for CH4 emission reductions.

For example, the amount of CH4 emissions from agriculture in EDGAR v5.0 was 24.2 %–45.7 % higher than those from PKU, CEDS, REAS, and GAINS. The spatial pat- tern of agricultural emissions in EDGAR was similar to the corresponding distribution in PKU because the distribution of rice and livestock both used the gridded data from Mon- freda et al. and , and further the emission factors of rice cultivation used in EDGAR were updated with those in PKU . Grids with high estimations (10–40 g CH4 m−2) were mainly >33 g CH4 m−2 yr−1) were based on PKU. located in the Yangtze River valley, and the east- ern part of the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region accounted for nearly half of the agricultural emissions (with values that were 22.7 %–39.3 % higher than the others;. The higher CH4 emissions estimated from EDGAR v5.0 in Bei- jing are due to the higher number of livestock from FAO statistics (5.5 million cattle) , which was considerably higher than the number provided by the NBS (0.3 million cattle) in 2010 . Additionally, GAINS and REAS tended to allocate more emissions from energy to the North China Plain (such as Shanxi and Shan- dong provinces; and s). More than 75 % of the en- ergy emissions from EDGAR v5.0 were allocated in high- emitting grids (>60 g CH4 m−2 yr−1;, which cov- ered less than 0.8 % of the total number of grids. This re- sult implied that EDGAR may provide lower estimates in other areas. EDGAR v4.2 originally uses 328 coal mines with locations for China from the World Coal Association as point emissions to disaggregate the amount of national emissions and is then up- dated using data from Liu et al. . However, emissions from coal mining estimated by EDGAR v5.0 still have no- table bias towards Shanxi Province. Emissions from the energy sector in CEDS have a similar pattern as EDGAR, with 72 % of energy emissions from high-emitting grids (>60 g CH4 m−2 yr−1;, w). The data source of CEDS is mainly from EDGAR v4.2 . PKU had a distinct spatial pattern for energy emissions, which was attributable to the fact that emissions from coal exploitation were located using the geolocation (latitude and longitude) of 4264 coal mines from Liu et al. and the regional emission factors .

The emissions from waste treat- ment estimated by EDGAR v5.0 and CEDS were 20.7 %– (>33 g CH4 m−2 yr−1) were highly consistent with the distri- bution of provincial capitals, III). Higher emissions of waste treatment in EDGAR were from wastewater, which probably adopted a higher CH4 correction factor for wastew- ater treatment plants or a higher chemical oxygen demand . Changes in the spatial pattern of anthropogenic From 2000 to 2010, anthropogenic CH4 emissions increased considerably in China, and this increase was mainly driven by increased emissions from energy exploitation (especially in coal mining) in the northern and central regions, followed by waste treatment in the southern and eastern regions and agriculture in the northeastern region. Growth was profoundly affected by urbanization and economic develop- ment. The decrease in CH4 emissions from PKU in southern and southeastern China was attributed to a decline in rice cul- tivation and livestock feeding , and simi- lar results were also observed in REAS, q). Since the 1980s and perhaps earlier, most Chinese farmers have adopted the practice of draining paddy ﬁelds in the middle of the rice-growing season, which halts most of the methane released from the ﬁelds . Additionally, emissions from livestock in southeastern China have decreased due to the reduction in the buffalo population . These changes in livestock and rice cultivation contributed to the mitigation of CH4 emissions. In EDGAR v5.0, a de- creasing trend was found for energy emissions in the central regions and in the North China Plain, while a simi- lar trend was not found in the other inventories during 2000– Further comparison with other inventories at the subsector level To further evaluate the quality of existing inventories, in- dependent and more detailed subsector datasets were col- lected to improve our understanding of the uncertainty in total amounts and spatial patterns among different invento- ries. Based on the data availability, three subsectors of major emissions sources are displayed, i.e., rice cultivation, live- stock, and coal mining. These three subsectors ac- counted for 70 %–85 % of the total emissions in China in Zhang et al. (for rice cultivation), Lin et al. (for livestock), and Sheng et al. (for coal mining). Zhang et al. compiled the NCCC inventory of rice by using a semiempirical model (CH4MOD). The CH4MOD model is a semiempirical model simulating CH4 production and emissions at daily steps. Inputs into the CH4MOD in- clude daily air temperature, percentage of sand in the paddy soil, rice grain yield, type and amount of organic matter ap- plied, and water management used for rice irrigation . Lin et al. estimated emissions from livestock based on county-level statistical data and region- speciﬁc emission factors. Sheng et al. estimated emis- sions from coal mining based on more than 10 000 operating coal mines reported by the Chinese State Administration of Coal Mine Safety (SACMS).

However, EDGAR v5.0 tended to provide higher estimates, with a value of 13.9 Tg CH4 yr−1. This difference could be seen from the larger contribution of high- emitting grids (>10 g CH4 m−2 yr−1; in EDGAR v5.0 (6.7 Tg CH4 yr−1 or 48.7 % of total emissions), while the values in the other inventories ranged from 17 %–34 % (1.2–2.8 Tg CH4 yr−1). The higher estimates from EDGAR v5.0 were primarily located in the Yangtze River (e.g., Hu- nan and Jiangxi). According to the study of Cheewaphong- phan et al. , EDGAR uses a higher proportion of con- tinuous ﬂoods, leading to a higher emission factor than that produced in intermittent-ﬂood conditions. In contrast, REAS tended to provide a lower estimate (6.7 Tg), especially in the Yangtze River and Northeast China. This dis- crepancy is partly because emissions from rice cultivation in REAS2.1 are from 2008, while others are from 2010. Moreover, emissions in 2008 from REAS2.1 are extrapolated from REAS1.1 in 2000 , which may not have captured the emission changes caused by the in- creases in rice cultivation area. As reported by the NBS, the areas of rice cultivation have increased by 5900 km2 in An- hui, Hunan, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi provinces and 12 514 km2 in Northeast China (i.e., Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces) from 2000 to 2008 . Overall, PKU and Zhang et al. were closer to the NCCC estimates with provincial activity data and emission factors, and Zhang et al. used the detailed regional water management data and provincial organic-matter application rates, which are also used in the NCCC as part of the national inventory reported to the UNFCCC . For the livestock subsector, including enteric fermenta- tion and manure management , the amount of emissions ranged from 9.2 (REAS) to 11.4 (PKU) Tg CH4 yr−1. The bottom-up inventory based on detailed county-level activity data estimated the 2010 emissions to be 12.4 Tg CH4 yr−1 . A consistent spatial pattern from livestock sources was found among inventories. However, REAS had lower emissions in the North China Plain (such as in Shandong and Henan), Tibetan Plateau, and Northeast China, which missed large numbers of high- emitting grids compared to other inventories. In ad- dition, higher emissions in the northeastern part of Beijing were reported by EDGAR v5.0, with grids emitting more than 20 g CH4 m−2 yr−1. These results were caused by the high estimated number of livestock induced by us- ing machine learning methods in the spatial-proxy approach .

This result may be due to the limited number of coal mines (∼4000) used in EDGAR . The allocation of national total emissions to limited mine locations leads to incorrect spa- tial patterns and artiﬁcial emissions hotspots . These spatial errors would cause bias in the analy- sis of trends and source attribution in inversions and mislead mitigation strategies in coal exploitation . Additionally, emissions from coal mining in PKU show a rel- atively consistent pattern with that in Sheng et al. ; however, PKU tended to have similar proportions among emitting grids. This result is because the locations of coal mines used in PKU have a coarser spatial resolution than 0.1◦. Estimates and uncertainties in total and sectoral emissions Considering the comparability of different inventories (i.e., with the same year and completeness of all the same subsectors), emissions were collected for ﬁve datasets (i.e., PKU, EDGAR v5.0, CEDSv2021-02-05, the NCCC, and Zhang et al., 2016). In 2010, the total emissions in China were estimated to be 49.6 ± 4.5 Tg CH4 yr−1 (mean ± standard deviation (SD), hereafter the same) among inventories. The mean emissions from agricul- tural activities were 18.5 ± 3.1 Tg CH4 yr−1, of which live- stock contributed 11.0 Tg CH4 yr−1, and rice cultivation contributed 7.8 Tg CH4 yr−1. Among all the agricultural activities, rice cultivation showed a relatively large range, from 5.3 Tg CH4 yr−1 in CEDSv2021-02-05 to GAINS (m–p) from 2000 to 2010, and REAS (q–t) from 2000 to 2008.", "deleted_count": 20, "triggered_rules": ["trim_garbage_start", "remove_citations", "chapter_titles", "fig_table_ref", "figure_or_table"]}

Emissions from waste treatment were 7.4 ± 2.7 Tg CH4 yr−1, which contributed a relatively small share of the national total emissions (14 %). However, a notable discrepancy ex- ists in emissions from waste treatment, which can be clas- siﬁed into two groups. Estimates from PKU, the NCCC, GAINS, and Zhang et al. were 4.3– These differences were mainly induced by the different esti- mates for wastewater. The uncertainty associated with CH4 emissions from wastewater mainly results from the methane correction factor and the amount of chemical oxy- gen demand . The high uncertainty in waste emissions estimates is generally due to many small point sources and large site-speciﬁc variations in emission factors related to different climatic factors and man- agement practices (Höglund-Isaksson, 2012). The detailed regional activity data and localized emission factors used in PKU, the NCCC, and Zhang et al. should be taken CH4 emissions by subsector (b) among different inventories in 2010. into account for the variation in local conditions– Data availability To increase the understanding of China’s anthropogenic CH4 emissions and help to reduce its uncertainties, we made all the data used in this study publicly available.

Our works shed light on the sources of differences and uncer- tainties among inventories. Temporally, emissions stabilized in the 1990s but increased signiﬁcantly thereafter, with AAGRs of 2.6 %–4.0 % during 2000–2010 and slower AAGRs of 0.5 %–2.2 % during 2011–2015. The growth of CH4 emis- sions is profoundly affected by changes in emissions from the energy sector, with AAGRs of 5.8 %–9.0 %. Since 2015, a relatively stable trend was estimated by CEDSv20201-0205 and our results, with AAGRs of 0.3 % and 0.8 %, re- spectively. Spatially, the regional patterns of CH4 emissions were largely associated with economic development and ur- banization. Emissions hotspots in PKU and EDGAR were mostly located in the North China Plain and southern China, which are densely populated areas, energy production re- gions, and agriculture-dominant regions. Such patterns were not presented in GAINS and REAS, with a lack of emissions hotspots in southern China and biased allocation of the ma- jority of emissions towards Shanxi Province. The incomplete information on emission patterns may mislead or bias mitiga- tion efforts for CH4 emission reductions. During 2000–2010, anthropogenic CH4 emissions from China differed widely among inventories, of which the energy sector contributed the most to the total emissions, followed by agricultural ac- tivities and waste treatment. Large discrepancies mainly re- sulted from region-speciﬁc activity data and emission fac- tors for coal mining, emission factors for rice cultivation, and emission factors for wastewater. We suggest that data devel- opers should make the detailed activity data for sectors and subsectors publicly available; furthermore, they should use the local optimized emission factors instead of the default emission factors to reduce the level of uncertainty.

An unusually high value was recorded at St. 2 in June due to the contribution of Ulva sp. and Codium sp. Ulva sp. and Pachymeniopsis sp. showed cov- erage values of 22.5-95% and 10-27.5%, respectively. Undaria pinnatipida and Sargassum sp. appeared with coverage of 5% to 46.7% during winter season and species of Gelidium, Chondrus, Lomentaria, Hizikia (now considered as a Sargassum sp.), and Gigartina were iden- tified with 5-20% of coverage. The concentration of total dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; NO3 +) and phosphate varied among sampling sites. The concentrations of DIN were May. The tissue nitrogen content of seaweeds was highest at St. 1 (average = 4.75%), where DIN was highest. Those of St. 2 and St. 3 averaged 3.13% and 2.65%, respectively . The tissue nitrogen contents of Porphyra were up to 5.7% (5.4 ± 0.26%) of dry wt and showed highest value among seaweeds tested. Sargassum spp., Enteromorpha spp., and Undaria spp. showed 4.7%, 4.6%, and 4.2% of tissue nitrogen contents, respectively, in the winter season. The nitrogen contents of green, brown and red algae were average of 3.18%, 2.91% and 3.42%, respectively. In brown and red algae, the tissue nitrogen contents decreased during the period of study. However, the green algae, most of them were Ulva spp., showed large fluctuations. There was a positive correlation between the tissue nitrogen content and seawater DIN. The correlation analysis showed the hyperbolic function seemed a better fit with higher correlation coefficient than those of the linear function; therefore, the rates of nitrogen accumula- tion in seaweed tissue seemed to reach maximum at higher DIN in seawater at over 600 µg·l–1. This pattern was also found in Ulva spp.. Porphyra and Ulva showed four to six times higher rates of short-term NH4 + uptake than other red algal species tested in this study. Based on the values of NH4 + uptake rates and growth, production and har- vest information, the efficiency of NH4 + removal of Porphyra was estimated. The model predicted that more than 17% of ammonium would be removed from the continuous supply of 100 µmol · l–1 NH4 + at 100 l · sec–1 flow rate with conditions described in the precious sec- tion. The algal coverage data showed that the green alga Ulva sp. could be regarded as a green tide, especially in June. Recently, the occurrence of green tides began to spread along the south coast of the Korean peninsula (A) and phosphate (B) in Tongyeong-goeje area. tion . Fundamentally, the growth of marine algae in a given ecosystem should be proportional to the rate of supply of nutrients, temperature, light, and water motion .

Deliberate nutrient loading reductions indeed have led to dramatic improvements in several areas in Japan . The total nutrient load from aquaculture in an open system may be very small in comparison with other nutrient sources; however, its point source effects may have adverse effects on coastal ecosystems that can be significant . Seaweed cultivation can act as a nutrient scrubber system; integrated aquaculture of seaweeds with fish (or other forms of fed aquaculture) maybe one of the most reasonable means for bioremediating coastal waters . The tissue nitrogen contents of Porphyra and Ulva species showed ranges of values similar to those report- ed in other studies. The nitrogen contents of Porphyra were over 5% and that of Ulva was above 4%. For those species with cover greater than 10%, red algae had high- er average tissue N than brown algae (though the differ- ence was not significant). Red algae may have higher potential values due to their photosynthetic pigments (N-containing phycobiliproteins) and protein levels. Tissue nitrogen contents increased with increased con- centration of dissolved nitrogen in seawater. The internal tissue nitrogen content is thought to be the complex results of the interactions among the external environment, uptake kinetics, assimilation, growth and reproductive processes . The hyper- bolic correlation between tissue nitrogen and DIN in sea- water could be speculated as the result of hyperbolic + uptake as found in Ulva lactuca . Tissue nitrogen content of Gracilaria was also correlated with nutrient availability (Jones et al. Porphyra tenera, which has been cultivated from the beginning of Porphyra cultivation in Korea, showed the highest rate of NH4 + uptake (3.4 µmol · g dw–1· min–1 at . Although the present experiments were not designed to analyze the rate of NH4 + uptake according to the per surface area basis nor the ratio of surface area to volume, the values were similar to those reports of Porphyra and Ulva . Several taxa such as Ulva, Gracilaria, Laminaria, and Porphyra have been investigated from different research groups . The values of uptake rates in the present study were in the same range of other studies. Wallentinus found Enteromorpha sp. and Cladophora sp. showed about 2 µmol · g dw–1· min–1 at 60 µM NH4 +. Taylor et al. reported Ulva sp. exhibited about 2.0 µmol ·g dw–1· min–1 and Porphyra sp. was about 4 µmol·g dw–1· min–1 at 100 µM NH4 +. Other studies on the rate of NH4 + uptake showed different val- ues. Subandar et al. reported the rates of NH4 + uptake ranged between 0.1 and 0.4 µmol · g dw–1· min–1 in Laminaria saccharina using salmon farm effluent of 6.225.4 µmol NH4 +· l–1 in continuous flow", "deleted_count": 18, "triggered_rules": ["trim_garbage_start", "remove_citations", "fig_table_ref", "figure_or_table", "chapter_titles"]}

An estimated 17% nitrogen removal efficiency could be easily achieved, because we applied a conservative uptake rate of 2.5 µmol · g dw–1· min–1 instead of 3.4 µmol · g dw–1· min–1 with conventional culture and har- vesting methodologies. This conservative estimate is about half of the removal potential compared with the estimates of Chopin et al. . If higher uptake rates and stocking densities were applied, the efficiency could increase up to 50% in our model. However, the self- shading effects and circulation factors (such as flow and mixing rate) should be considered with increasing stock- ing densities . Previous studies showed the range of 10 to 90% of nitrogen removal efficiency in polyculture systems. Ulva lactuca removed 40-90% depending on NH4 + supply and up to 85% in study of Vadermuelen and Gordin . The efficiency of Ulva rigida in Sparus aurata waste water treatment was 76% in the daily input of 150 mmol NH4 +· m–2· day–1 with 2.7g fw · l–1 . Troell et al. found slightly lower removal (5%) of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in a cage culture experiment with Gracilaria, but found much higher seasonal rates of NH4 + removal with 50% in winter and 90-95% in spring in a tank system . Laminaria saccharina removed 26-40% of incoming dissolved nitrogen from salmon farm efflu- ent . The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a strategy for the sustainability of aquaculture in the coastal ecosystem based on the sound ecological and economic principles . There are many conflicts among the users of coastal waters, and aquaculture should be conducted under a plan of integrated coastal zone management with a balance between ‘extractive’ and ‘fed’ aquaculture . The results of this preliminary study seem very promising, because the biology of the proposed species are well studied and the economic value of some are also high; nevertheless, more complete information should be obtained to expand integrated aquaculture systems . Based on this study, a site-specific year-round system will be established depending on culture type, species, local hydrodynamic and other environmental factors. Moreover, monitoring and regulation of aquaculture systems need to be based upon carrying capacity models of each area, if there will be sustainable aquaculture along the Korean coastal zone (Fernandes et al. 2000,", "deleted_count": 12, "triggered_rules": ["remove_citations"]}

Hirsch Associate Director for Water FOREWORD The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is committed to serve the Nation with accurate and timely scientiﬁc infor- mation that helps enhance and protect the overall quality of life, and facilitates effective management of water, biologi- cal, energy, and mineral resources. ( Information on the quality of the Nation’s water resources is of critical interest to the USGS because it is so integrally linked to the long-term availability of water that is clean and safe for drinking and recreation and that is suitable for industry, irrigation, and habitat for ﬁsh and wildlife. Esca- lating population growth and increasing demands for the multiple water uses make water availability, now measured in terms of quantity and quality, even more critical to the long-term sustainability of our communities and ecosys- tems. The USGS implemented the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program to support national, regional, and local information needs and decisions related to water-quality management and policy. ( by and coordinated with ongoing efforts of other Federal, State, and local agencies, the NAWQA Program is designed to answer: What is the condition of our Nation’s streams and ground water? How are the conditions changing over time? How do natural fea- tures and human activities affect the quality of streams and ground water, and where are those effects most pro- nounced? By combining information on water chemistry, physical characteristics, stream habitat, and aquatic life, the NAWQA Program aims to provide science-based insights for current and emerging water issues and priorities. NAWQA results can contribute to informed decisions that result in practical and effective water-resource management and strategies that protect and restore water quality. Since 1991, the NAWQA Program has implemented interdisciplinary assessments in more than 50 of the Nation’s most important river basins and aquifers, referred to as Study Units. ( Collectively, these Study Units account for more than 60 percent of the overall water use and popu- lation served by public water supply, and are representative of the Nation’s major hydrologic landscapes, priority eco- logical resources, and agricultural, urban, and natural sources of contamination. Each assessment is guided by a nationally consistent study design and methods of sampling and analysis. The assessments thereby build local knowledge about water- quality issues and trends in a particular stream or aquifer while providing an understanding of how and why water quality varies regionally and nationally. The consistent, multi-scale approach helps to determine if certain types of water-quality issues are isolated or pervasive, and allows direct comparisons of how human activities and natural pro- cesses affect water quality and ecological health in the Nation’s diverse geographic and environmental settings. Comprehensive assessments on pesticides, nutrients, vola- tile organic compounds, trace metals, and aquatic ecology are developed at the national scale through comparative analysis of the Study-Unit ﬁndings. ( The USGS places high value on the communication and dissemination of credible, timely, and relevant science so that the most recent and available knowledge about water resources can be applied in management and policy deci- sions. We hope this NAWQA publication will provide you the needed insights and information to meet your needs, and thereby foster increased awareness and involvement in the protection and restoration of our Nation’s waters. The NAWQA Program recognizes that a national assessment by a single program cannot address all water- resource issues of interest.

We analyzed the sum of the mean daily air temperatures above 10 °C for the period from 2014 to 2019. The highest sum of active temperatures (SAT) was recorded in 2015 and amounted to almost 2,182 °C; the lowest was recorded in (383.3 mm), the minimum was observed in 2017 (98.8 mm) . Earlier, the authors analyzed the sum of active air temperatures (above 10°C) over the past decades in the entire Trans-Baikal Territory. According to these works, the °C are usually observed from mid-May to the first decade of September, and on average their number is 110, with the maximum values in the south-east of the region (more than 130 days) and the minimum in the north (less than 90 days)…”. Our research objects grow in the central part of the Trans-Baikal Territory and manage to complete the full cycle of their development in an average of 110 days. An increase in air temperature in the spring period boosts vegetation. An increase in temperature (within the normal range) accelerates growth and decreases phenological intervals, while a decrease (within the normal range), on the contrary, slows down development and increases the phenological intervals . At the same time, the temperature sufficient for vegetation of any species varies from year to year, depending on other conditions, such as, for example, the winter duration and weather or the endogenous dormancy of the plant . Let us consider in more detail the dynamics of seasonal changes in introduced plants by phenophases. The initial phase of the growing season – “bud swelling” – changed over the years. For individuals of Corylus heterophylla, this phase began somewhat earlier in The highest air temperature for that April was 6.3 °C, and the total precipitation in April was 7.6 mm, which exceeds the indicators of 2015 and 2018–2019. The temperature in April of 2017 and 2018 was slightly less – 4.4 and 3.3 °C, respectively, and there was less precipitation. Our Ekaterina A.

In 2015–2016 and 2019, these individuals entered the growing season later, at a mean monthly air temperatures of 2.7, 1.2, and 2.0 °C, respectively. For the species Armeniaca sibirica, the earliest onset of the growing season was recorded in 2017–2018 (in mid-April), which is one decade earlier than in 2014. In 2019, the growing season began in the third decade of April, as opposed to 2015–2016 (I decade of May). For individuals of Euonymus maackii, the onset of this phase remained unchanged from year to year (vegetation begins in the third decade of April and lasts for one decade). The accompanying phases of “leaf bud budding” and “first leaf budding” occurred either systematically or in parallel to each other for one week. For example, for individuals of Corylus heterophylla, we registered a simultaneous swelling and rapid deployment of the first leaves during the third decade of May 2015, despite the large amount of precipitation and cool weather, compared to other years. In all other years, these two phases occurred one week earlier, successively replacing each other (I–II decade of May). Consequently, cold spring temperatures and humid air accelerate developmental stages of plants. In individuals of Armeniaca sibirica, we observed a similar reaction to the weather in 2015–2016 and 2019, including the late opening of leaf buds and their deployment (from late May to mid-June) compared to 2017–2018 (II–III decade of May), with the gradual passage of two phases. The phenospectrum of Euonymus maackii samples showed simultaneous swelling of leaf buds, and their flowering was stable from 2014 to 2019 in the third decade of April. However, in 2019, we registered a late consistent opening of the buds (from the 3rd decade of April to the 1st decade of May). In general, the initial phenological phases of vegetation in the studied species fall on the period from mid-April to the end of May. At this time, there are frequent ground and atmospheric frosts with changes in air temperatures. Based on the data of the graph of meteorological parameters (by month) and the phenospectrum, individuals of Corylus heterophylla and Armeniaca sibirica were the most sensitive in spring to temperature extremes, in contrast to Euonymus maackii, which were stable. The duration of the phenophases was different over the years. In parallel, the “onset of flowering” was recorded in the spring-summer period. It is known that Armeniaca sibirica and Corylus heterophylla according to the characteristics of phenological development is of the early spring type (generative buds bloom earlier than vegetative ones). The duration of the flowering phase varied: it was within 18–22 days for individuals of Armeniaca sibirica; 15–25 days for Euonymus maackii; and 10–15 days for Corylus heterophylla. The subsequent phase of “fruit formation” follows flowering and occurs in spring or in summer. In individuals of Armeniaca sibirica, it was registered in the period from the end of May , as well as from the first decade of June .

{"cleaned_text": "The subsequent phase of “fruit formation” follows flowering and occurs in spring or in summer. In individuals of Armeniaca sibirica, it was registered in the period from the end of May , as well as from the first decade of June . In individuals of Corylus heterophylla, it was registered in the 2nd decade of May (with the exception of 2015–2017, when no fruiting was observed). In individuals of Euonymus maackii, it was registered at the end of June and at the beginning of July . No fruiting in Corylus heterophylla can probably be associated with low temperatures (frosts in mid-May) or with a wet period at the time of flowering. It was found that with the highest amount of precipitation and relative air humidity, despite the mean daily air temperature above +10 °C, in individuals of this species, flowering was delayed until a more favorable time. Anemophilic pollen was released from anthers, which cracked under the influence of dry air. In May 2015, when the flowering continued, the highest amount of precipitation was recorded – 34.0 mm. In 2016–2017, the phase came earlier (in April); the amount of precipitation was 16.0 and 17.8 mm, respectively, which exceeded the indicators of this month in other years. In this regard, most likely in these years, the fruits were not formed. However, it is difficult to say unequivocally, since in May 2019, there was also a large amount of precipitation (35.1 mm), with low mean monthly air temperatures (9.3 °C); fruiting in individuals was noted. This is followed by the “ripening of fruits and seeds” phase. In Armeniaca sibirica, maturation lasted from 80 to 100 days; in Corylus heterophylla, it lasted up to 110 days; and in Euonymus maackii, it lasted 60 to 100 days. However, some fruits in Euonymus maackii did not fall over the winter and were recorded on the branches of the plants the following spring. In 2014 and 2015 fruit maturation was faster in all the studied objects; 2017 and 2018 were the years, in which this phase lasted longer. One of the final stages of the growing season is the “autumn leaf color” phase. In 2014, 2016, and 2017, in all species it began earlier (at the end of August), and later leaf coloring (at the beginning of September) was noted in 2015, 2018, and 2019. In general, by the end of September, the full color of the leaves of all the studied plants was recorded over the years, with a mean monthly air temperature in the range of 8.0–11.3 °C (below-zero values were noted only in 2014, in the third decade of September). The influence of short daylight hours and low above-zero temperatures in autumn contributes to the intensity and variety of the color palette of the leaves (from bright red to purple shades). However, early frosts weaken the bright red color of the foliage. Rainy or cloudy days reduce the color intensity of the autumn leaves, and cool, dry, and sunny weather contributes to the autumn color scheme. The final phase of the growing season is “leaf litter”. The East Asian forest-steppe species complete the growing season in late September – early October. The Manchu-Daurian preboreal species turned out to be the most variable over the years. The years of 2014, 2016, and 2017 were characterized by below-zero mean monthly temperatures in October (–2.4 °C; –3.9 °C; –0.7 °С, respectively). It was during these years that the individuals showed early leaf fall and the end of the growing season. The dynamics of seasonal changes in introduced plants under conditions of Eastern Transbaikalia indicates that the East Asian forest-steppe and ManchurianDaurian preboreal species exhibit phenological plasticity in response to sudden changes in air temperatures and insufficient precipitation in the region (Armeniaca sibirica, Corylus heterophylla).

The observed small deviations in seasonal development (duration of phenophases) over the years are associated with the weather conditions in the region. At the beginning of the growing season, atmospheric frosts with changes in air temperatures are rather common. Corylus heterophylla and Armeniaca sibirica are most sensitive to temperature extremes in spring, in contrast to Euonymus maackii, which were stable. Warm and dry weather contributes to the early start of Ekaterina A. Banshchikova DYNAMICS OF SEASONAL CHANGES IN INTRODUCED ... the growing season (Corylus heterophylla). Low above- zero air temperatures in spring and a large amount of precipitation encourage plants to pass the development stages faster (phenophases) than in dry and warm weather (Corylus heterophylla, Armeniaca sibirica). At the same time, low temperatures (frosts) in spring with a wet period at the time of flowering negatively affect the further fruit formation in Corylus heterophylla individuals. Based on the hereditary and physiological characteristics, it was established that introduced plants are adapted to the conditions of Eastern Transbaikalia and are cold- and drought-resistant. According to the phenological development, the individuals have the following characteristics: early flowering (Armeniaca sibirica, Corylus heterophylla) and longer retention of foliage on the branches in the autumn (Corylus heterophylla), as well as retention of fruits in winter (Euonymus maackii, Corylus heterophylla). The influence of short daylight hours and low above-zero temperatures in autumn contributes to the intensity and variety of the color palette of the leaves (from bright red to purple shades). Rainy or cloudy days reduce the intensity of the color of the autumn leaves, and cool, dry, and sunny weather contributes to the autumn multi-color. Below-zero monthly mean temperatures in October were observed for 2014, 2016–2017 (–2.4 °C; –3.9 °C and –0.7 °C, respectively). It was during these years that the individuals showed early leaf fall and the end of the growing season. Armeniaca sibirica and Corylus heterophylla are variable in terms of the onset of the main phenophases; individuals of the species Euonymus maackii are characterized by minimal individual variability. The longest growing seasons on the phenological spectrum were demonstrated in 2014 and 2018–2019 (in individuals of Corylus heterophylla, it was 190 days), which contributes to the accumulation of greater phytomass.

{"cleaned_text": "There is overall consistency in literature about negative effects of fetal and postnatal exposure to parental tobacco smoking on several outcomes: preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome, neurodevelopmental and behav- ioral problems, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, impaired lung function, asthma and wheezing. While maternal smoking during pregnancy plays a major role on adverse postnatal outcomes, it may also cumulate negatively with smoking during lactation and with sec- ond-hand smoking exposure. This review aimed to discuss the current evidence regarding the short and long-term effects of parental tobacco smoking during a critical period of life (preg- nancy and lactation). It should be pointed out that it was not strictly designed a priori as a systematic review, and that the PRISMA Statement was not fully applied (including PICOS).

The results of this review strengthens the need to plan population health policies aimed to implement educa- tional programs to hopefully minimize tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and lactation. Mothers should be strongly encouraged to stop smoking espe- cially during pregnancy and lactation. Parents should know that exposure to prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoking is associated with different adverse outcomes and that tobacco smoking is one of the most preventable causes of infant morbidity and mortality [52]. However, breastfeeding is the best way of infant feeding even if a mother doesn’t quit smoking during lactation [49]. Amal- gamating results from different studies, this paper could be a useful tool to educate and increase awareness about adverse health effects of parental tobacco smoking for children. Additionally, it could be a starting point for the conception of new health promotion and public health campaigns that emphasize the importance of parental smoking cessation.

Earliness in sprouting and increase in num- ber of sprouts may be due to better utilization of stored carbohydrates, nitrogen and other factors with the help of growth regulators .Further stored food materials with the help of growth regulators have fastened the sprouting there by enhancing the utilization of carbohydrates at base of cuttings through photosynthesis . According to Wright, that vegetative propagation, the sprouting depends on food reserve available within the cuttings. In case of rooting per- centage among IAA and IBA effect on root- ing of different types and length of cuttings of P. pin- nata, IBA treated in hard wood cuttings of 25 cm length showed maximum rooting (60 %) for the mean value of rooting percentage (over all concentration) where as soft wood cuttings of 15 cm length treated with IBA resulted in minimum rooting (18.88 %). The effect may be due to the slow translocation property or slow destruction by auxin destroying enzyme system . It is also came to know from this investigation that IBA treated 25 cm length hard wood cuttings at the concentration of 800 ppm gave the maximum rooting of P. pinnata (90%) com- pared to with control treated in distil water of 15 cm length of soft wood cuttings which is minimum (0%).This may be due to better response to optimum concentration of IBA may be attribute to increase rate of respiration, accumulation of higher level of amino acids of base after 4 hours the treatment with auxins than in control treated with distil water. This pattern is continued with nitrogenous substances accumulating in the basal part of treated cuttings, apparently mobilized in the upper part and translocated as aspergene . Palanisamy and Kumar, reported that exogenously applied aux- ins are sensitive to activate the cambium probably in the active period of cambium resulting significant root formation and also mentioned that IBA induced more number of roots during the months of January, Febru- ary, March and April and 800 ppm IBA proved to be most suitable for adventitious rooting and formation of more number of roots in case of P. pinnata. The rela- tively poor rooting with IAA treated stem cuttings of P. pinnata in comparison to IBA could be explained by the sensitivity of IAA to light , production of more ethylene which is known to inhibit the root production (Mullins, 1972 ) and could also be due to the higher metabolic turnover . IBA is less sen- sitive than IAA to non biological degradation such as photo oxidation .In general IBA 800 ppm has been found to induce better root system in P. pinnata cuttings. The basis for this may be enhancement of hydrolysis of nutrient response (mainly starch) by auxin treatment .According to Nanda et al., enhanced hydrolysis activity in the presence of exoge- nously applied hormones was responsible for the in- creased rooting in auxin treated cuttings. IBA treat- ment enhanced the cambial activity . In case of soft wood, semi hard wood, hard wood cuttings of 15 cm length treated with S. Rout and S. Nayak / J.

Appl. & (2): 844 – 850 IAA 200 ppm and 400 ppm respectively resulted in maximum rooting percentage .This may be due to the synergetic effect of the total amount of indigenous auxin present in the cuttings and the exogenous auxin (IAA) applied at various concentration to the different types of cuttings enhances the cambial activity at opti- mum photoperiod and temperature. Wareing and Rob- erts, 1956; Waisel and Fahn ; Smith and Ware- ing reported that endogeneous IAA, photope- riod and temperature presumed to control the cambial activity. However in case of soft wood, semi hard wood, hard wood cuttings of 25 cm length treated with IAA 1000 ppm, IBA 1000 ppm and IBA 800 ppm re- spectively resulted in maximum rooting. Similarly for root length IBA showed maximum (19.16 cm) which may be due to its greater stability, transportability, ability to produce roots and consequently results in promoting root length and lower mortality in plants . The length of longest root was observed in 400ppm IBA treated with 25 cm length semi hard wood cuttings and IAA 1000 ppm and IBA 400 ppm and 2000 ppm re- spectively resulted in maximum rooting length (Table 3) .The possible reason for IAA and IBA showing highest root length might for the early formation of roots and more utilization of reserved food materials of the treated cuttings . As per Keseri et al., maximum root length was observed in case of cuttings treated with 2.85mM IAA .The differences among auxins could also be related to other factors such as higher stability and slow rate of conjugation of IBA ,so that the free IBA required to induce rooting will be available over a longer period of time than IAA .Similarly for root number 15 cm length soft wood cuttings treated with IBA gave maximum root numbers (16.22) over other treatments and control. Which may be due to less sensi- tivity of IBA to none biological degradation such as photo oxidatation and comparatively less production of ethylene which helps in root production.

Forty-one per cent of Italian subjects cited ‘to release tension’ as an important reason for participation in physical activity, compared to 16% of Swedish subjects. Otherwise, Swedish subjects were more concerned about getting ﬁt (36%) while only 8% of the Portuguese saw ‘to get ﬁt’ as an important motivation factor for participation in physical activity. The proportions of EU respondents believing ‘to socialize’, ‘to control weight’ and ‘to have fun’ were good reasons for participating in physical activity were 14%, 13% and 10%, respectively. The variable ‘do not participate in any form of physical activity/exercise’ showed the greatest intercountry variation in values ranging from <1% in Finland to almost half of the Portuguese population. When the motivating factors for participation in physical exercise were examined by the various demographics, ‘for good health’ was regarded as being the most important variable across all demo- graphics, especially among those aged 55þ years and those with a primary-level education. The factors ‘achievement’, ‘competition’, ‘concentra- tion’ and other and uncertain answers were cited by less than 5% of the subjects and, therefore, are not given in the table. The individuals mentioning ‘to maintain good health’ as a reason for physical exercise were analysed by CHAID.

In almost all member states there was a clear education- related increase for both males and females. Compared to subjects educated to primary or secondary level, subjects with a tertiary-level education were more likely to choose this item as a perceived beneﬁt to participate in physical exercise. A CHAID analysis revealed that the beneﬁt ‘to control weight’ was most frequently mentioned (32%) by women perceiving themselves to be overweight and being physically active for 1.5–4.5 hours per week. Only 21% of men with the same characteristics gave this answer. Twenty-three per cent of women and 18% of men wish to reduce their body weight by their effort in physical exercise. Surprisingly, these data do not correlate with the real body mass index (BMI) of the subjects. Among women this motivation slightly increases parallel to the recorded physical exercise, women being active up to 1 hour, 1.5–4.5 hours and more than 5 hours per week mention the factor ‘to control weight’ with a frequency of 13%, 19% and 16%, respectively. This tendency was not observed among male subjects. There is also a positive relationship between the factor ‘to control weight’ and the self- estimated BMI of the subjects. Thirty-one per cent of overweight and 26% of obese women expect to normalize their perceived body weight by being active. Among obese men recording to be active more than 5 hours per week there is also a relatively high percentage (21%) of subjects who expect a normalizing effect on their body weight. There was an age-related increase in those people selecting the response ‘I do not participate in any activity’, while the opposite trend occurred with increasing education level with 14% primary-educated subjects versus only 7% of those with a tertiary-level education selecting this variable. This relationship between education level and the selection of ‘I do not participate’ was examined further across the 15 member states.

Indeed, Portugal was unique among the 15 member states in that the percentages in all education levels exceeded the other countries by a factor of two to three. As many as 61% of Portuguese subjects with primary-level education did not participate in any form of physical activity and this value dropped to just 23% among those educated to tertiary level. Conﬂicting statements can be observed analysing those subjects not perceiving a beneﬁt from physical exercise and simultaneously citing to be inactive. Indeed, only 10% of these individuals (12% of female, 9% of male) recorded no physical activity. However, 24% of men and 23% of women believing themselves to be inactive, were in fact participating in some physical activity for up to 1 hour per week. Perceived barriers The second question aims to assess the perceived barriers which people may have to participating in physical activity. On observation of the EU average, ‘work/study commitments’ was the most frequently perceived barrier cited for not increasing partici- pation in physical activity at 28%, followed by ‘not the sporty type’ at 25%.

Indeed the percentage of EU subjects selecting ‘looking after children/elderly relatives’ and ‘no need to do any more’ is There were, however, signiﬁcant variations between countries, particularly for the barrier ‘work/study commitments’ with 46% of the Italian respondents selecting this barrier in comparison to only 13% of the German respondents. Thirty-three per cent of German subjects believed that ‘not the sporty type’ was a barrier in comparison to 12% of Finnish subjects. Over a quarter of Spanish subjects felt ‘poor health’ was a barrier to partaking in physical exercise and one-ﬁfth of this population also believed they were too old, compared with the EU average of one in 10 subjects. Just as there was considerable interstate variation in the perceived barriers to increasing participation level in physical exercise, there were also marked differences in percentages across demographics . Respondents who were younger, educated to tertiary level and who were male, were more inclined to choose ‘work/study commitments’ as a major barrier to increasing levels of physical activity especially compared to primary-educated subjects (16%). ‘Looking after children/elderly relatives’ was an important barrier for females with more than three times as many (18%) selecting this barrier compared to males (5%). The barriers ‘lack of facilities’, ‘no-one to do it with’, ‘fear of injury’, ‘shy/embarrassment’, ‘waste of time’ were cited by less than 10% each. The relationship between education level and the barrier ‘not the sporty type’ was further examined across the 15 EU member states. The education- related decrease seen in the average EU sample was apparent in 10 of the member states. In the other ﬁve countries there was little effect of education level on the selection of this barrier. As education level of subjects increased from primary to tertiary level, so did the percentage of subjects mentioning the barrier ‘work/study commitments’ in all 15 member states . Thus, for tertiary-educated subjects in all 15 member states, this time-related barrier represents an important obstacle to increasing their level of physical activity.

For those who mentioned the barrier ‘not the sporty type’, almost half of the respondents said they took part in no physical activity, compared to a quarter of those who did not mention this barrier. The percentage of respondents who mentioned ‘not the sporty type’ varied by current body image, with an increase from 30% of subjects with current body image ﬁgures 1–3 (low weight) to 45% of subjects with current body image ﬁgures 5–7 (overweight). Participation in various physical activities was also looked at in terms of another perceived barrier ‘no need to do more’. Respondents who selected this barrier had higher rates of participation in gardening and walking and had lower levels of non-participation (24%), compared with those who did not select ‘no need to do more’ (32%). This 24% of EU subjects represents a resistant group of inactive people who feel they do not need to be more active and presents those developing programmes which encourage increased levels of activity in the population with a formidable challenge. This study was intended to ﬁnd new approaches to counteract the sedentary lifestyle of the European population. The results give much new information, especially for special risk groups.

Only subgroups with elevated risk show a higher afﬁnity to draw personal consequences from their situation and to change their everyday habits. This can be demon- strated among obese and overweight females. These subjects are more likely to perceive a beneﬁt for weight control from their physical exercise than the rest of the population. However, the ability of subjects to estimate their personal level of activity is limited to a certain degree. One reason is that the term ‘physical activity/ exercise’ used in this study was deﬁned in a rather broad sense. The study participants were forced to associate with the term not only sport exercise, but also all their everyday activities at work and during leisure time. Even with this information participants tended to underestimate the extent and duration of activities not typically associated with the image of physical exercise. Analogous to the phenomena of over- and under-reporting in dietary records, a similar behaviour is likely to be found in records of physical activity. As a methodical consequence it seems to be better to supply close-ended questionnaires on levels of activity to participants, so they can better control their own answers. The quality of recording may also be improved by a detailed list of several activities and by some explanations how these activities have to be recorded in respect to their duration and intensity12,15,24. From the study results it is obvious that the majority of respondents associate physical activity and exercise with being more a strenuous task and duty than with fun, recreation and relaxation. Mostly, physical activity is equated to sports. Therefore, many respondents mention ‘not a sporty type’ or ‘too old’ as a barrier and use this statement as an excuse not to increase their levels of activity. This is true also for many overweight and obese subjects who reject the idea of doing any sports and increasing their level of physical activity. They perceive a link between a lean body image and the level of activity. These subjects, especially older age groups, are not well enough informed about recent studies demonstrating the positive effects of moderate physical activity on health25–31. To stimulate more people to be physically active it is necessary to be aware of the determinants of physical behaviour. There are a number of models which explain physical activity behaviour, but in general these include three sets of determinants: (1) knowledge and attitudes, (2) social inﬂuences, and (3) barriers and self-efﬁcacy32. In a review Sabha and Achterberg33 discussed the problems of recognition, interpretation and motivation arising in the complex of nutrition, activity and health-related behaviour. They demon- strated that outcome expectations, health belief and health value associated with health-related behaviour are not sufﬁcient to release the necessary health-related action of an individual. The perceived barriers within the individual’s consciousness can only be overcome by an improved self-efﬁcacy and distinctive self- conﬁdence.

The perceived barriers within the individual’s consciousness can only be overcome by an improved self-efﬁcacy and distinctive self- conﬁdence. To achieve a higher level of physical activity in the population, however, not only behavioural but also social aspects have to be considered. The social side of prevention has to take into account the opportunity available to people to implement altered activities into their lifestyle, the situation at work and education, the national conditions of health-promoting measures and the reputation of the desired behaviour within the society. Thus, the public health message to increase physical exercise in a population base seems to be very simple, as published in the USA: ‘Every US adult should accumulate 30 minutes or more of moderate- intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days of the week’34. However, to be successful with such recommendations new preventive programmes have to focus both on personal and environmental conditions of the individual and the population. Few studies in the EU, all of them on a national level, have looked at knowledge and attitudes towards physical activity35. The Allied Dunbar National Fitness Survey conducted in 1992 in the UK is one example, and examined attitudes to physical activity as well as the motivating factors and barriers to participate in physical activity36. No European study has, however, looked at the stages of change towards physical activity. One approach in the US, aimed at encourag- ing people to be more active, uses the stages of change model (PACE)7. This model describes the changes that need to take place for a more physically active lifestyle. While there are many programmes to tackle obesity in different countries in the EU most do so in the absence of knowledge of the attitudes towards physical activity and body weight. They also do so in the absence of the perceived motivating factors and barriers to physical activity and the stages of change towards physical activity. Weight loss is best achieved by combining dietary intervention with increased amounts of physical activity. The most effective strategy for weight loss in either moderately obese or morbidly obese individuals appears to be a hypocaloric, low-fat diet combined with a moderate-intensity, moderate-duration resist- ance or aerobic exercise training programme. Increas- ing amounts of physical activity or maintaining high levels of physical activity for purposes of weight control might be most important in preventing the increases in weight known to occur with ageing, from the early twenties through to the late sixties. This pan-EU survey of consumer attitudes to physical activity, body weight and health is the ﬁrst study to examine the attitudes of EU consumers from all 15 member states, together with obtaining a measure of prevailing levels of activity, inactivity and self-reported body weight. Some strategy recommendations to increase levels of physical activity in the EU and to stem the continuing rise in obesity, by means of preventing further weight gain are proposed based on the data arising from this pan-EU consumer attitudinal survey. The preventive aspect of physical activity must be an area of priority for future research attempting to better understand the role of physical activity in weight regulation.", "deleted_count": 1, "triggered_rules": ["trim_garbage_start"]}

The raw BTS displayed un- evenly distributed pores, rough and irregular structure while raw HTS dominantly exhibited a rough coalesced carbon layer with stacked alignment. The reason for raw BTS is due to the lignin and cellulose structures of the sample was extremely damaged and/or disappeared during pyrolysis. During the HTC process, the acidic medium has gradually seeped into the amorphous cellulose and some soluble segments of lignin of straw resulting in cracked and disrupts the cellulose chain [21]. The SEM after fluoride adsorp- tion were observed to be a uniform morphological distribution of particles containing scattershot pores and smooth heterogeneous surfaces with dull edges in both adsorbents. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of HTS and BTS ana- lyzed. According to IUPAC classification, BTS displayed isotherm a combined type I and type IV with H4 hysteresis loop, explaining the presence of a narrow slit-like microporous and meso- porous surface gain through multilayer adsorption followed by capillary condensation. By contrast, HTS exhibited isotherm type IV with H3 hysteresis loop, indicating staged adsorption on mesopores. Its hysteresis loop revealed loose assemblages of the plate-like structure at which the capillary condensation taking place to fill and withdraw N2 molecules on those mesopores. It is noteworthy that the BET specific surface area (SBET) and total pore volume (VT) of HTS are far less than BTS. Hence, BTS is expected to further facilitate the adsorption of fluoride through having such favorable morphology which is accessible to adsorbate molecules in a given size and shape than HTS. The linkages of phosphate and phosphate ester with lignocellulose may encourage the expansion of the struc- ture, whereby the voids volume was protected [22, 35]. Further, the average pore diameter (Dav) shows larger for HTS than BTS. The functionalities of both adsorbents studied by FTIR spectra are shown in. The peaks observed on both adsorbents at 3,421 cm-1 and 1,036 cm-1 are assigned to stretching vibrations of O-H [36] and sulfonic group, respectively. Compared to HTS, the peak observed at 2,908 cm-1 derived from the asymmetric ali- phatic saturated C-H group [37] and 1,632 cm-1 indicating C = C stretching vibrations and its derived carbons [38] are not observed in BTS. Rather, BTS shows an intensity reduction of such groups due to lignin removal during the pyrolysis treatments. The bending vibration peaks of the water molecules at 1,180 cm-1 representing aromatic C-O-C stretching from cellulose. Some weak bands were also observed in both adsorbents between 700-490 cm-1, indicating the presence of C-C stretching. Phase analysis of HTS and BTS and their XRD patterns are shown in. The diffraction patterns of BTS at 16.2 and 27.3º shows the planes of CaO6P2 while 26.5º shows the plane of Si (P2O7). Those peaks also revealed the crystalline carbonaceous structure of BTS. The sharp and intense peak at 24º is due to the enlargement of crystalline size and further development of pores. The extra slight peaks appeared at 13.56, 31.35, and 42º are associated with randomly existed SiC crystal structure of a short-ranged order in graphene oxide layers.

{"cleaned_text": "The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of BTS (a) and HTS (b) (insert: pore size distribution). range from 30 to 250°C, ascribed to the surface-bound water and moisture release (dehydration). The steep and gradual weight loss (49%) for HTS occurred from 250°C to 545°C and the major weight loss (about 76%) for BTS took place from 250°C to 700°C is attributed mainly to the decomposition of cellulose and lignin [32]. The final weight loss (86.07%) of BTS remained constant above 700°C while the total weight loss (91.79%) for HTS remained constant after the temperature reached 545°C. The adsorption process was highly depending on the solution pH with a similar trend for both adsorbents. The high adsorption ca- pacity was recorded in low pH with a peak at pH 2 while abruptly ceased after pH 8(a)). It is evident that the presence of H+ at low pH, the attraction of fluoride ion with the adsorbent sites could be strengthened since the hydroxylation process is formed [40]. Conversely, the higher pH enhances the adsorption competition between hydroxyl and fluoride ions; thereby the ad- sorbent sites could be more occupied by hydroxide ions over aimed adsorbate. Hereafter, pH 2 was used for subsequent experiments. The effect of initial moisture content present on the prepared adsorb- ent was studied by varying the drying temperature for both adsorb- ents(b)). The higher adsorption capacity was shown at 15% initial moisture content. A slight decrease in adsorption capacity at the moisture level below 15% might be due to less hygroscopicity (formed by the carbon-oxygen and H2O complexes on carbonaceous material), which bind the H2O molecules and then hinder the pore chamber expansion. The available adsorbent moisture content was calculated using ASTM D2867 standards [42]. In order to examine the effect of adsorbent dose, 100 mg/L of initial fluoride solution was employed with an adsorbent dose started from 0.1 g till the point at which the final concentration could able down to a safe level. As shown in(c) the amount of BTS needed to obtain safe fluoride level was achieved by using 2/3 of the amount for HTS(d)). This phenomenon may due to the difference in the availability of free active sites which still enabled to adsorb the remaining ions [43]. Consequently, the driving force of mass transfer between the liquid and solid phase in an aqueous adsorption system decreasing with time elapse [44]. The adsorption capacity of fluoride ion was investigated at different initial fluoride concentration. The adsorption capacity of BTS and HTS increased from 1.5 to 27 mg/g and 1.7 to 24 mg/g, respectively, as the initial fluoride concentration was in- creased from 2 to 40 mg/L. At lower initial concentration, the adsorp- tion system goes independent of initial concentration and gradually gets exhausted sharply with the increase in initial fluoride concen- tration [45].

{"cleaned_text": "At lower initial concentration, the adsorp- tion system goes independent of initial concentration and gradually gets exhausted sharply with the increase in initial fluoride concen- tration [45]. This could probably take place due to an increase in the diffusion of fluoride ion to adsorption sites until sorbent saturation is achieved. Moreover, the utilization of less accessible or less active sites of the adsorbent could occur when there was more fluoride ion in the solution to be taken up. The fluoride removal increased for both adsorbents on increasing the agitation speed. From, it can be seen that the equili- brium adsorption capacity occurred at the speed of 200 rpm for both adsorbents. Beyond 200 rpm agitation speed, there was no further fluoride uptake noticed for both adsorbents. The lower agitation speed leads to the accumulation of the adsorbent particles in the flask instead of spreading in the sample solution [44]. On the contrary, a higher agitation speed encour- ages the mobility and mass transfer of the fluoride ion in the system by reducing a boundary layer thickness around the ad- sorbent surface. The thermodynamic behavior of the adsorption process was exam- ined through varying adsorption temperatures. The parameters re- sult shows the function of temperature and related ther- modynamic parameters of the adsorption which are calculated by the following equations: ∆ ∆ ∆ Where ∆G0 (kJ/mol), ∆H0 (kJ/mol) and ∆S0 (kJ/mol K) are the standard free energy, enthalpy and entropy change, respectively. T is the temperature (K) and R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K). The slope and intercept of the plot of the distribution coefficient (KL) versus 1/T were used to calculate the values ∆H0 and ∆S0, respectively. Both adsorbents exhibited almost similar thermodynamic behavior. The less negative values of ∆G0 with increasing the adsorp- tion temperatures showing the adsorption process was spontaneous and the exchange is proportional to the temperature for both adsorbents. The positive values of ∆H0 revealed an exothermic adsorption process. It also likely indicated the higher electro- negativity of fluoride ion and its substitution for hydroxide ion on the carbonized feature of the adsorbents, thereby chemical in nature [46]. The positive values of ∆S0 confirm the affinity of fluoride ions towards the adsorbents. The adsorption response for an increment in the amount of adsorbate at constant temperature was studied.

Based on the higher correlation coefficients along with a close value of experimental and calculated adsorption capacity, the pseudo-second-order was favorably fitted by the pseudo-sec391 ond-order model than the pseudo-first-order. Thus, the adsorption of fluoride onto both adsorbents was governed by a chemical reaction at which the electrons are shared between adsorb- ent sites and fluoride ions via valency forces. The desorption potential of fluoride ion from the exhausted adsorbent was directly proportional with the eluent concentration. The max- imum desorption capacity of BTS and HTS using NaOH was found to be 75% and 84%, respectively. By contrast, higher desorption was performed by using Na2CO3 with 82% for HTS and 91% for BTS. In general, HTS has better desorption efficiency than BTS. This may be due to less affinity of fluoride ion with HTS surface.

Additionally, this main reaction is also followed by an exothermic reversed water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and endothermic CO methanation, as shown in Equations (3) and (4), respectively. H2 + CO2 ↔CO + H2O ∆H298 K = 41 kJ/mol. CO + 3H2 ↔CH4 + H2O ∆H298 K = −206 kJ/mol The overall CO2 methanation reaction (Equation (1)) is associated with a decrease in the overall number of gas molecules and releasing heat. Hence, according to Le Chatelier’s principle, the CO2 methanation process should favor high pressure and low process temperature for high methane yield [29]. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed using Aspen Hysys V11 by the Gibbs free energy minimization method to identify the reaction conditions with maximum CO2 conversion and methane selectivity. shows the eﬀect of temperature and pressure versus CO2 conversion.

The conversion kinetics are infeasible at low temperatures, while at high temperatures, the reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable. Almost complete CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity are observed at a temperature of 200 ◦C, and further increases in the temperature cause the CO2 conversion to decrease. At a stoichiometric H2:CO2 ratio of 4, the optimum temperature range for CO2 methanation is 200 to 500 ◦C, where CO2 conversion drops by only 20% and the CH4 selectivity is 99%. With an increase in the temperature above 500 ◦C, the CO2 conversion drops with CH4 selectivity. CO and carbon formation is favored at a high-temperature, which reduces CH4 selectivity drastically [30]. shows the eﬀect of pressure on CO2 conversion at diﬀerent temperatures. The calculations reveal that an increase in the pressure favors the methanation reaction. Additionally, according to Jurgensen et al., the elevated pressure increases the temperature at which carbon deposits occur [31]; hence, reaction at high pressure has dual advantages. However, the CO2 conversion is increased with increasing pressure up to a certain pressure, while further increase in the pressure does not signiﬁcantly increase the CO2 conversion at high temperature. Hence, all reactions were performed at an optimum 8 bar pressure. Reactor design plays an important role in exothermic CO2 methanation, especially using adiabatic reactors. The beneﬁts of adiabatic reactors are that they are relatively simple in construction and maintenance, but it is not easy to manage the heat generated [32]. There is a risk of CO and/or carbon formation in case of too high reactor temperature. CO can be just a byproduct, but the catalyst surface’s carbon formation may completely deactivate the catalyst over time. Hence reaction heat management is of utmost importance to avoid carbon formation and catalytic deactivation. Generally, the heat is either managed by a specially tailored design reactor system, eﬃcient cooling ﬂuid surrounding the reactor, or diluting the feed gas with an inert gas to lower the heat generation per volume. Our state-of-the-art reactor design managed the heat generation per volume by adding total reactant feed in small portions at the inlet of all four reactors and circulating eﬃcient cooling oil. This process resulted in stable temperature management within the optimal temperature range (<500 ◦C), and we achieved almost equilibrium conversion as expected by the above simulations (see also the discussion in Section 3).

The CO2 conversion was approximately 90% and remained almost steady over the test period. The methane selectivity was >99%. The catalyst was used for more than 500 h and did not show any sign of deactivation or activity loss over the entire period. Similar observations were also seen from catalyst characterization, where no signiﬁcant carbon formation was observed by XRD, BET, TGA, which could suppress or inhibit the catalyst activity. Physically no carbon formation was observed on the catalyst surface at the inlet of the reactor, and no pressure drop change was observed across the reactors throughout the test campaign. This result indicated no signiﬁcant carbon formation which could block the ﬁxed bed reactors. The Ni3S2 phase formation after the reaction indicated that feed biogas was contaminated with sulfur-containing compounds. This could be because of a sudden interruption of the desulfurization process during the test campaign. The backup carbon ﬁlter could not remove all the bulk sulfur from the biogas to ppb levels required by the Ni catalyst. A potential future improvement could be a sacriﬁcial ZnO adsorbent before the active Ni catalyst, which can reduce the sulfur level to ppb in The Temperature Programmed Reduction of H2 (H2", "deleted_count": 10, "triggered_rules": ["trim_garbage_start", "figure_or_table", "chapter_titles", "fig_table_ref"]}

The diﬀraction peak at 26.2◦in both diﬀraction patterns are from the graphite base (JCPDS = 75-2078) used to support the catalyst sample for XRD analysis. The Temperature Programmed Reduction of H2 (H2-TPR) is usually employed for estimating the reducibility of the catalyst. shows the H2-TPR results for the fresh and used catalysts, respectively. The reduction patterns for a fresh catalyst showed two main reduction peaks; one at a lower temperature around 244 ◦C and another at a higher temperature above 550 ◦C. A sharp hydrogen consumption peak at 244 ◦C was attributed to reducing free NiO or weakly bonded NiO with Al2O3. At 579 ◦C, a broad peak corresponded to the reduction of a NiO, which is strongly bonded with Al2O3 [39]. A reduction at 400–600 ◦C generally corresponds to less reducible NiO species present in an aluminum oxide rich phase [40]. The H2-TPR of used catalysts showed low-intensity peaks at 213, The BET surface area results for fresh and used catalysts are shown in. It is seen that the surface area of the used catalyst decreased by 75.6 m2/g compared to the fresh catalyst. The catalyst reduction, carbon deposition on the catalyst surface leading to pore blockage, and crystalline phase transition leading to metal and support sintering are mainly responsible for the loss in the surface area [41–43]. Catalyst SBET (m2/g) Fresh catalyst Used catalyst In our case, XRD shows phase transition and increase in crystalline size due to the Ni3S2 phase, and this could be the reason for the loss in the surface area as the Ni3S2 phase can accelerate the Further detailed studies are needed to clarify this catalyst phase formation and its relationship with catalytic activity. It is reported that the carbon deposition starts from the formation of graphitic carbon (150–250 ◦C) and amorphous carbon (250–500 ◦C) islands on the catalyst surface. The carbon species may encapsulate the active nickel sites, causing the catalyst’s deactivation, or the carbon may form ﬁlamentous carbon on the catalyst surface. The latter does not encapsulate active sites and will only reduce the catalytic activity [47]. Since we did not observe drastic changes in the catalytic activity over a 6-month test campaign, the latter type of carbon formations may very likely occur and thus be responsible for the loss in the overall surface area along with sulfur poisoning. The fresh and used catalyst was tested for the decomposition of any species using thermo- gravimetric analysis (TGA).,b shows the TGA of a fresh and used catalyst, respectively. The results indicated that the total weight loss for fresh and used catalysts was ca. 8.2 and 9.6%, respectively. The fresh catalyst’s loss was due to water evaporation, decomposition of carbonates, and surface hydroxyl species. For the used catalyst, the change in weight loss was only 1.4%, which was negligible compared to the total time the catalyst was in operation. The small changes in the TGA graph of the used catalyst observed at 170 and 700 ◦C could be due to surface adsorbed species or carbon [48], but no major weight loss indicates that the carbon deposition was negligible on the catalyst. Furthermore, these observations were in good agreement with the decrease in the surface area and no major loss in catalytic activity.", "deleted_count": 10, "triggered_rules": ["trim_garbage_start", "results_discussions", "fig_table_ref", "chapter_titles", "figure_or_table"]}

The Law No. 24 of 2011 on Social Security Organizing Bodies regulates the obligation of companies to provide social security to workers by enrolling them in the BPJS Andika, Septa Bagaskara Ketenagakerjaan program. The law also specifies the registration procedures and requirements for employers and workers. Additionally, detailed registration procedures are outlined in derivative regulations. According to the BPJS Ketenagakerjaan law, companies with 10 or more employees or a total monthly wage payment of IDR 1 million must enroll every worker in the BPJS Ketenagakerjaan program. The payment of BPJS Ketenagakerjaan contributions for employees is the responsibility of the company . Based on BPS (Statistics Indonesia) publication in November 2021, the workforce in August 2021 was 140.15 million people, an increase of 1.93 million from August 2020. The percentage of workers in the informal sector was 59.45%, totaling 77.91 million people, a decrease of 1.02% from August 2020. The open unemployment rate in August 2021 was 6.49%, a decrease from 7.07% in August 2020. In light of economic growth, BPJAMSOSTEK (now BPJS Ketenagakerjaan) was tasked by the government to protect 70 million active participants by 2026. To achieve this target, BPJAMSOSTEK formulated a strategy: New UShield to increase participant acquisition. The responsibility of BPJS Ketenagakerjaan in providing protection to workers is significant. This is the responsibility of the state, regulated through several laws, namely Law Number 40 of 2004 concerning the National Social Security System (SJSN), Law Number 24 of 2011 concerning Social Security Organizing Bodies (BPJS), and Presidential Regulation Number 25 of 2020 concerning the Governance of Social Security Organizing Bodies. All these regulations provide a clear mandate to BPJS Ketenagakerjaan to implement employment social security with the aim of realizing welfare and enhancing the competitiveness and productivity of workers . BPJS Ketenagakerjaan must ensure that participants feel secure about the protection benefits provided when they are actively working or when they are no longer productive, along with their families. Additionally, efforts to expand participation are a focus, even though the country is not entirely welfare-based, with the hope that every worker, whether formally or informally employed, can become a participant in BPJS Ketenagakerjaan with the right to social protection. To achieve protection for 70 million workers by 2026, a significant challenge faced by BPJS Ketenagakerjaan lies in a stronger marketing strategy to optimize membership expansion . Marketing strategy refers to the description of how a brand or product achieves its goals. According to Ulyah, , marketing strategy is a series of marketing programs designed to dominate and retain target market segments. This can be understood as the primary instrument applied by a company to achieve its goals. Marketing strategy determines the components of the marketing mix. The marketing mix is a marketing tool used by companies to reach their target markets, including price, promotion, distribution, and product.

BPJS Ketenagakerjaan has an important role in providing social protection for workers in Indonesia. Currently, BPJS Ketenagakerjaan has no direct competitors because it is the only institution that provides social security programs for workers in Indonesia. Therefore, BPJS Ketenagakerjaan is the main choice for companies and workers to fulfill social obligations and protect themselves from risks that may occur in the workplace. In an effort to achieve this goal, BPJS Employment implements Strategy 345 to the level of pioneer branch offices. Strategy 345 is an approach designed to achieve three main strategies in BPJS Ketenagakerjaan, 4 focuses on using 5 engines to increase the sustainable growth of informal &; small and micro scale workers depicted in the following graph: Company Goals Product The value of the product to consumers Needs and wants Consumer expectations of the product Consumer satisfaction level Andika, Septa Bagaskara In, the 345 strategy is depicted as the target for the year, using an approach that incorporates three main strategies: retention, intensification, and extension, with the goal of achieving specific targets, including the number of new participants, the number of active participants, and the total collected contributions, as outlined below: Retention is the company's ability to maintain its resources to sustain loyalty to the services provided. In the BPJS Employment system, this strategy focuses on retaining the number of participants already involved to keep them active in existing programs. In this strategy, BPJS Employment provides social security for workers, which is protection for workers in the form of financial benefits as a substitute for lost or reduced income and services due to events or conditions experienced by workers, such as work accidents, old age, and death. Intensification is an effort to increase results or make something more intense in its implementation . In the intensification strategy, efforts are made to increase the involvement and contribution of registered participants by expanding the services or benefits provided to them. Extension is an effort used to improve the results of a program that has been implemented . The focus of the extension carried out by BPJS Employment is to attract more new participants to join the offered program. This strategy has specific targets, including obtaining 30.4 million new participants, increasing the number of active participants to 46.35 million, and achieving a total contribution of Rp96.09 trillion. The strategy focuses efforts on four specific areas: village ecosystems, market ecosystems, e-commerce & SMEs, and vulnerable workers. To support these efforts, five engines are utilized: agency system, figures, supply chain, auto-debit, and compliance & positive supervision. These engines play a crucial role in realizing the formulated strategies, involving various aspects such as management, distribution networks, partnerships, and strict monitoring and supervision to ensure that the program runs according to the set targets and rules.

The implementation of the 345 strategy is carried out in all business sectors in Indonesia. BPJS Employment has various strategies for the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) program, Non-Wage Recipients (BPU) program, and the Agency Program, outlined as follows: 1) SME The 345 strategy implemented by BPJS Employment aims to expand participant coverage, especially for Small and Medium Enterprises (SME), using various approaches, one of which is targeting SMEs through various channels such as traditional markets, e-commerce platforms, cooperatives, and franchises. BPJS Employment for SMEs ensures that employees will receive benefits when risks occur while working. This approach involves cooperation and collaboration with relevant parties to expand the reach of BPJS Employment programs, including: a. Partnering with traditional market managers, BPJS Employment can leverage market access and the business network of market entrepreneurs to introduce programs and recruit new participants from SMEs operating in traditional markets. b. Collaboration with franchise owners can also be an effective channel to reach SMEs. Through agreements with franchises, BPJS Employment can offer this program to business owners within the franchise business network. c. Involvement with the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) also has its benefits, as BPS has enumerator networks that can be used for data collection and direct approaches to SMEs registered in the BPS database. 2) BPU Strategies for Non-Wage Recipient (BPU) segment participants initiated by BPJS Employment include several programs: People's Business Credit (KUR), Smart Agent, INCLUDE, and Reactivation & PRS, outlined as follows: a. People's Business Credit (KUR): This is a collaboration between BPJS Employment and the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs. The program aims to provide social security coverage for workers who need financial support, especially in the micro, small, and medium-sized business sectors. b. Smart Agent: Refers to partnerships between BPJS Employment and various financial institutions such as BNI 46, Pegadaian, Pos Indonesia, and Brilink. This partnership allows these financial institutions to become agents assisting in providing BPJS Employment services to participants or potential participants. c. INCLUDE Program: With the slogan \"Prosper Workers Around You,\" allows BPJS participants to register individuals around them who are not yet participants in BPJS Employment, such as gardeners, security guards, household assistants, and others. d. Reactivation & PRS: Refers to efforts to reactivate membership for BPU workers who were previously inactive, perhaps due to forgetting to pay contributions or other reasons. This program is also included in the retention strategy, where BPJS Employment reminds and encourages participants to become active members again. 3) Agency Program a. PERISAI: BPJS Employment can collaborate with various entities or institutions in expanding the membership network. For example, BPJS Employment can collaborate with professional associations or industry groups to expand information and membership services, as well as facilitate more extensive and effective agency registration. b. Utilizing Fintech: BPJS Employment can use financial technology (Fintech) and collaborate with financing institutions to streamline payment processes and Andika, Septa Bagaskara membership management. For example, BPJS Employment can offer payment options through popular Fintech platforms within corporations, providing convenience and incentives for companies to register their workers as BPJS Employment participants. In the implementation of the 345 strategy, although there is consistency in knowledge about strategies and goals across the organization, the implementation of this strategy in each region cannot be done with a uniform approach because each region has different characteristics and approaches. The uniqueness and differences of each region require a tailored approach to face specific challenges in each region. Additionally, the absence of detailed technical instructions in implementing the strategy at each branch has resulted in suboptimal explanation of strategy activities (cascading). Furthermore, the priority of strategy execution in each branch is not clearly focused, which can disrupt the overall strategy implementation. Efforts to address these issues include several recommendations: There is a need for monitoring and execution systems for each ecosystem controlled by specific and focused responsible parties. BPJS Employment needs to have a monitoring system focused on each operational region. Responsible parties in each region need to focus on participant segments and issues in their area. For example, in a particular region, membership issues might be more dominant, while in another region, service issues or participant satisfaction may need to be focused.", "deleted_count": 5, "triggered_rules": ["trim_garbage_start", "url_or_doi", "chapter_titles"]}

This will enable them to sell products to all market segments and not be limited to one specific product or segment. Providing a channel for innovative ideas and program sales proposals from regions according to local wisdom. BPJS Employment needs to open communication channels to receive innovative ideas from various regions, according to the needs of each local region. For example, ideas from a particular region can be used as a model or inspiration to increase participation in other regions. A special program is needed for the education process and approaches to positive retention, especially among BPU. A special program needs to be developed for positive retention, especially among non-wage workers (BPU). Steps in this program might include education about the benefits of social security, a personal approach in service, and providing easily understandable information about the importance of membership for them. All of these recommendations are aimed at increasing participation, participant satisfaction, and strategies to ensure the benefits of BPJS Employment social security reach all layers of society, including those who are usually difficult to reach.

A fire rose diagram for unweighted hotspots (showing the number of hotspots in each 10u compass sector, centred on the pollution monitor) is dominated by the fires that burnt the Australian Alps and Canberra in January 2003 (300–500 km to the south-west of Sydney). The distance-weighted fire rose shows a much more even spread of fire directions, with the fires from 2002/3 and 2006/7 prominent, but with fires from land in all directions. In Perth, hotspots were more dispersed than in Sydney and the fires were smaller. Consequently, the fire roses were similar for the weighted and unweighted distances . Notice the occurrence of hotspots in the direction of the ocean for Sydney, which is due to the inland position of the pollution monitor. In Sydney, the explanatory power of Lag FRP decreased with the length of the lag: r2 decreased from 0.17 for the current day to (0.19). Perth showed a similar pattern, with the Combined FRP with 1 day lag giving the best explanatory power, though this was low (r2 = 0.84,. For both cities, the best FRP variable to use for modelling is the current day + previous day (FRP01). Analyses on the radius of influence showed a peak in explanatory power at 100 km for Sydney (r2 = 0.24,. The peak for Perth was at 400 km with a lower explanatory power (r2 = 0.08). None of the log-transformations improved the fit of the relationships. There were 69 exceedance events for PM2.5 in Sydney, of which 52% lasted a single day. Only four events lasted four days or more . The two longest events were associated with major fire events in the Sydney region (Christmas 2001 fires and early December 2002). Two other four-day events were both during winter, and were not verified fire events (11th July 2002 and 7th June 2005). In Perth, there were more events with shorter durations (n = 80, 75% lasted a single day), and only two lasted four days. These were both in May (26th May 2004 and 9th May 2006), and were not verified fire events. The exceedances in FRP showed similar patterns to the PM2.5 and similar differences between the cities.

There were positive effects of FFDI, C-Haines and PM25lag and on-shore wind and a negative effect of wind speed. The FRP01 effect was weak, and there was an interaction between FRP01 and C-Haines, which meant that FRP had a positive relationship with PM2.5 which became slightly negative when the C-Haines index was less than 1.3 (on about 31% of days).

For Perth there were 23 events and 35% corresponded with the raw FRP01 and 43% with the model predictions. We have demonstrated that there is a relationship between fire activity detectable from satellites and pollution in urban centres. Moreover, there are windows of spatial and temporal influence of Predicting Smoke Pollution from MODIS Hotspots PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e4 fire activity on pollution. For Sydney, the radius of influence is relatively small (100 km) and the relationship is strong, while for Perth the radius is much larger (400 km) and the relationship is weak. The explanatory power of the models was improved by including weather and pollution history variables, to the extent that more than half of the variance in pollution could be explained for Sydney. The weather relationships revealed higher pollution when the atmosphere was stable, when wind speed was low and when the wind in the upper atmosphere was blowing on-shore. Importantly, wind flow from the fires to the monitor was not present in the models. This is presumably because on-shore winds that trap in-situ pollution in the city basins are more important to the overall level of pollution than winds transporting smoke from bushfires, even if days without fire activity are excluded. This trapping effect is probably why stable air and low wind speed also lead to more pollution. The differences between the cities have a logical explanation. Sydney is bounded on three sides by extensive forests (approxi- mately 20,000 km2) at a distance of about 100 km. Beyond this is an extensive agricultural belt with very little fire activity. The mean area burnt in these forests is approximately 5% per year, of which more than 80% is unplanned fire [20]. Generally, the wind associated with bushfire events blows from an arc between northwest and southwest, and so blows smoke into the city. The forests around Perth are much more scattered, comprising small patches spread across a larger region. A higher proportion of the forests are burnt each year (8.5%) [19], but the regime is dominated by prescribed fires (7% compared to 1.5% for Predicting Smoke Pollution from MODIS Hotspots PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e4 unplanned fire).

The closeness of the forests and the more extensive unplanned fire explain why the model has a smaller radius and better goodness of fit for Sydney than for Perth. These differences between cities mean that a forecast tool must be based on a model specific to each city. Our empirical modelling method shows some potential for developing a forecasting tool for bushfire planning. For both cities, the best single predictor of daily pollution is the previous day’s pollution, which may be of use to health authorities. Nevertheless, the FRP and weather variables also contribute substantially to the predictive power. For Sydney, the predictive model explained most of the variation in pollution and three quarters of the known bushfire caused pollution days were identified as peaks in the FRP data. For Perth, the previous days FRP is actually a better predictor than the current day, albeit with low predictive power. Our method may be more efficient and accurate for identifying Sydney and Perth.

Improvements could be made to the forecasting ability by addressing some of the limitations of the data. The most important of these is the lack of identification of non-bushfire sources of Predicting Smoke Pollution from MODIS Hotspots PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e4 pollution, since these are the principle driver of pollution levels on most days. Pollution from these sources also varies and our analysis suggests that they respond to weather conditions, perhaps more than smoke does. If non-smoke pollution days could be filtered from the data then the accuracy of the models would be greatly increased. A more explicit representation of atmospheric transport such as a two or three-dimensional wind-field between the source and monitor would also improve the relationship. Many fires, especially larger ones, inject smoke high into the atmosphere which may reduce pollution on the ground [44]. Since there is actually a relationship between FRP and injection height [44], this effect could be directly incorporated into a predictive model and may be more successful than the use of an atmospheric stability index such as C-Haines. Ultimately, a hybrid model using daily snapshots of FRP and a three-dimensional atmospheric transport model may be the most fruitful approach.

There are other limitations that affect the accuracy of the models. The raw FRP values used here do not account for differences in vegetation type. Vegetation correction factors have been applied elsewhere to FRP values [37], but none have been developed for Australia. The episodic nature of major bushfire events means that the six year time series used here only captured a small number of events (54 events reported in the media for Sydney and 23 for Perth), and these varied greatly in magnitude. The analysis would be improved with a longer time series. Sydney experiences extreme fire seasons (where .10% of the forest area burns) between once and twice per decade [20], so it may be that several decades of data are required to determine the nature of the relationship between FRP and pollution levels. Our results are also relevant to the debate over the appropriate level of prescribed fire treatment. Prescribed fire is imposed as a means of reducing the area and impact of wildfire, and has been suggested as one means of preventing increased wildfire activity due to climate change. However, in many Australian landscapes several hectares of prescribed fire are required to reduce the area of wildfire by one hectare. For example, around Sydney 3–4 ha of prescribed fire are required per hectare reduction in wildfire area [20,45], and the forests around Perth, 6 ha are required [19]. However, prescribed fires consume less biomass per hectare than wildfires because they are more patchy [46], are usually confined to the surface fuels and leave larger proportion of fuel unburned. It has been shown for Southern Australia that smoke plumes from prescribed fires blow over cities, though on average these are five times smaller than plumes from wildfires [21]. Further examina- tion of the contribution of prescribed and wildfires to smoke is needed before the likely impact of increased prescribed burning could be accurately predicted. In conclusion, this study has identified a clear relationship between remotely sensed fire activity and pollution levels in two Australian cities. It has also identified the distance over which fires tend to supply smoke to the cities, and some of the challenges to developing a useful operational tool. With some improvements, models developed using this method could become useful in many fire-prone regions around the world for forecasting smoke pollution. They may be used as an adjunct to smoke-plume modelling or may eventually prove to be more useful. Even as they are now, the method can be used for rapid retrospective identification of bushfire pollution days, in contrast to the labour intensive methods used by Johnston et al. [36]. With further separation of FRP into wild and prescribed fires, our approach could also provide a new tool for understanding the comparative smoke pollution exposure to humans from fires of both types.", "deleted_count": 1, "triggered_rules": ["trim_garbage_start"]}
{"cleaned_text": "After the results from the characterization of the spent FCCC (Section 3.1), the extraction yields for La, Ce, Al, and Si are reported in Section 3.2, whereas in Section 3.3, the zeolite obtained from the synthesis procedure is fully characterized. Several economic indexes (NPV, DPBT, IRR, GMR, and ROI) are proposed in Section 3.4 regarding the baseline scenario. In addition, Section 3.5 investigates the variation of these indexes in function of critical variables. The concentration of the main elements is shown in. It underlines that the total concentration of REs is rather low. Concentration (%wt) Na Al Si P Ti V Fe Ni La Ce XRF ICP-OES The XRD analysis showed that the most probable compounds are dealuminated zeolite Na-Y, that is the main crystalline phase, followed by other minor phases, like zeolite ZSM-5 and alumina. Regarding the BET analysis, the SSA was around 112 m2/g, a bit lower than the area of a fresh FCCC, which is usually in the range 120–180 m2/g. The PSD was a Gaussian curve centered at 80.4 µm, with a Sauter’s diameter D [2,3] equal to 73.6 µm. The extraction yields of the main elements as a function of reaction time are listed in; such yields are reported as medium values and standard deviation. Sample Extraction Yield (%) Ce La Si Al H2SO4 1 h H2SO4 2 h H2SO4 3 h Hence, the best extraction yields for La and Ce were obtained after 3 h. The extraction of Si was lower than 2%, but such element is present as colloidal silica that, once the solution cools down, makes the ﬁltration difﬁcult. For this reason, the following ﬁltration and precipitation shall be carried out with warm solution. The extraction of Al was low as well, but the concentration in leach liquor was not negligible. The initial pH of solution was 0.45 and NaOH was added to increase the pH to La2(SO4)3 + 2 Na+ + SO42- + 2 H2O →2 NaLa(SO4)2·H2O Ce2(SO4)3 + 2 Na+ + SO42- +2 H2O →2 NaCe(SO4)2·H2O This precipitation mechanism as double sulfate salt is also caused by the addition of Na2SO4 instead of NaOH [17]. The solubility of NaRE(SO4)2·H2O in water (in particular, for Ce, La, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Sc) is very low and it decreases with the increase of temperature [18]. After cooling down, the white salt was ﬁltered, washed with distilled water and dried at 105 ◦C for 24 h, and thus used for the analysis. The results of ICP-OES showed the following element concentration: La 36.54%, Ce 2.87%, Na 2.88%, Al 6.14%, and Si 0.7% by weight. The rest is mainly water, oxygen, and sulphur. The XRD analysis indicated that the RE precipitate was mainly composed of NaLa(SO4)2·xH2O and NaCe(SO4)2·xH2O, but Al2SO4 and small amount of Al(OH)3 cannot be excluded. The XRD spectrum of the RE salt was indeed not crystalline and characterized by large and not well-deﬁned peaks. This RE concentrate shall be leached again and La be separated from Ce by solvent extraction. Hence, the precipitated salt can be sold to companies with expertise in separation and reﬁning of REEs like Rhodia (France), Umicore (Belgium) or Sol", "deleted_count": 8, "triggered_rules": ["trim_garbage_start", "chapter_titles", "fig_table_ref", "figure_or_table"]}

After the synthesis procedure that is described in Section 2.5, the zeolite from the acid leaching was fully characterized. In particular, the SSA was 83.2 m2/g, whereas the BJH cumulative average pore volume was 0.062 cm3/g with an average pore size of 3 nm. Spent E-cat and synthetic zeolite obtained from the hydrothermal procedure are shown in. The XRD spectrum of the latter is shown in, whereas proposes a SEM picture of the same zeolite. The zeolite is light brown in color, whereas the spent E-cat is grey. The main phase detected in the zeolite was Na-A, with formula Na12Al12Si12O48·27H2O. Small percentages of dehydrated zeolite Na-X (Na92Al92Si100O384) and Cl-free sodalite (Na8Al6Si6O24), another aluminosilicate mineral, were also present: this means that the conversion to phase-A was not complete. The zeolite Na-A presents a cubic crystalline system with the lattice parameters a = b = c = 24.61 Å and α = β = γ = 90◦. The presence of high crystallinity was demonstrated by the high intensity of the peaks.

The description of the technical aspects was already elaborated and in this phase of the work, the economic analysis is developed. There is a clear relationship between two perspectives. The simulation software quantiﬁes the several amounts of resources that were employed in the process and some economic results (GMR, ROI) are obtained directly by this software, while other results (NPV, DPBT, IRR) are elaborated through Excel programme—.

{"cleaned_text": "In fact, the evaluation of this typology of investment ﬁrstly considers the environmental advantages derived from the recovery of these wastes and at the same time the achievement of environmental goals set by the European Union (COM 490 ﬁnal). The following step is represented by the economic study. NPV quantiﬁes the amount of potential proﬁts when considering the lifetime of the project. The value obtained is extremely relevant: it is equal to 2170 k€. NPV is a realistic metric for decision makers because the DCF method is based on two relevant aspects: (i) the time value of the money and (ii) the lifetime of the project. The distribution of cash ﬂows permits to understand this result. From the revenues side, the recovery of zeolite plays a key role. Its weight is equal to about three quarters (77%). The price of RE oxides is greater than that of zeolite, but the amount of materials recovered in this waste is extremely lower (about 5%). It is opportune to underline as the REO concentrate represents the lowest value among the three revenues of the plant. This conﬁrms that the recovery of REEs from spent E-cat is unproﬁtable, even if they would be separated and recovered with 99.9% grade. The use of raw materials (29%) and the phases linked to the waste treatment and/or disposal (26%) are the main items of costs. Instead, the share of investment costs is not relevant (8%). The main item of the materials cost is due to NaOH, used in solution for precipitation of La and Ce, as well as for hydrothermal treatment, E-cat collection (disposal fee) RE oxides Zeolite Revenues Other Labor dependent Investment Utilities Facility dependent Waste treatment Raw materials Costs DPBT is coherent with the result of NPV. A cut-off period is not ﬁxed in this work but certainly the result is positive, since those cash ﬂows allow the re-entering from the investment already at the end of the second year. This depends on three elements: (i) the positive value of gross proﬁt, (ii) the application of third-party funds that distribute the investment cost over the years of loan, and (iii) the share of investment costs is lower than the operative ones. Finally, also IRR deﬁnes the proﬁtability of this project. A possible concern for users of the IRR method is when the discount rate of a project is unknown, but in this case, it is signiﬁcantly greater than the cost opportunity of capital.

A possible concern for users of the IRR method is when the discount rate of a project is unknown, but in this case, it is signiﬁcantly greater than the cost opportunity of capital. The analysis of cash ﬂows underlines the presence of a single change of sign (it is negative during the year zero and it is positive in the following years due to the gross proﬁt). For this reason, the possible issue of multiple values of IRR is not veriﬁed. NPV, DPBT, and IRR measure the proﬁtability of a project, while other two indexes (GMR, ROI) are referred only to a single year of activity. It is linear with the role of balance sheet that characterizes the world of ﬁrms. Useful indications are provided, but these indexes are more appropriate for other scopes as: (i) a comparison with the value of benchmarking of the sector; (ii) a comparison with other ﬁrms employed in the same sector; (iii) a monitoring to measure the performance of a company over time; and, (iv) for the purposes of the regulatory rules. Gross proﬁt is the difference between the annual revenues and the annual operating costs. Gross margin is the direct percentage of proﬁt in the sale price. Its positive value is determined Net Proﬁt also considers the proﬁt tax and the depreciation in comparison to the gross proﬁt. ROI determines how a purchase is proﬁtable. Its positive value is determined by the positive value of net proﬁt. ROI and GMR are two metrics that give different information. For example, if money is invested in a project, ROI measures the result of the added investment. Instead, GMR indicates whether revenues are going up faster than costs. The aim of this sub-section is to give solidity to economic results obtained in the baseline scenario. In fact, they are based on the assumption of a set of input parameters. Hence, a variance of the expected results could occur. This issue can be overcome by implementing a sensitivity analysis on the critical variables [38]. The choice of critical variables is linked to the results proposed in regarding the main items that characterize the cash ﬂows. A pessimistic and an optimistic scenario are evaluated for each critical variable and a variation of ± 20% is applied. • The zeolite has a weight equal to four-ﬁfths of discounted cash inﬂows. Its price of reference is equal to 1150 €/ton. The potential values of 920 €/ton and 1380 €/ton are hypothesized in alternative scenarios. • Raw materials have a weight equal to one-third of discounted cash outﬂows. In particular, the net cost of NaOH (50% w/w) covers 35.7% of this cost, followed by the net cost of sulfuric acid with the 30%. NaOH 50% sol. has a baseline value of 150 €/ton and alternative values of 120 €/ton and 180 €/ton are proposed. Instead, 96%wt H2SO4 when considering its recycling has a value of reference of 100 €/ton and potential alternative values are 80 €/ton and 120 €/ton. • Waste treatment/disposal have a weight slightly lower than raw materials (−3.5%). In particular, liquid waste disposal covers 56.9% of this cost and the remaining share is linked to the solid one. The difference is not signiﬁcant and both variables are analysed. Solid waste has a baseline value of 130 €/ton and alternative values of 104 €/ton and 156 €/ton are hypothesized. Regarding liquid waste, instead, 120 €/ton is the baseline value and 96 €/ton and 144 €/ton are the alternative values. • A macro-variable of all cash ﬂows is represented by the cost opportunity of capital. This variable measures the return coming from an alternative project, which has the same risk level. It is hypothesized to equal 5%.

Several indexes change in function of both variables regarding revenues and costs——while cost opportunity of capital does not modify the value of balance sheet (GMR and ROI) and at the same time the value of IRR is constant (baseline value equal to 56.7% is always greater than values examined in this work)—.

In this situation, it is opportune to elaborate a BEP analysis. It deﬁnes the value of the price of zeolite from which a null value of NPV is obtained—. Price of zeolite NPV (k€) BEP underlines that the proﬁtability of this project is strictly linked to the price of zeolite. In the baseline scenario, a consistent proﬁt is obtained (equal to 2170 k€), but in a pessimistic scenario, a relevant economic loss is reached (equal to −4942 k€). From a mathematical point of view, the price of zeolite that characterizes NPV = 0 is contained in the range from 920 €/ton to 1150 €/ton. The high level of accuracy of this analysis deﬁnes the value of 1070 €/ton that is close to the baseline value and it is lower than 7%. The other critical variables, instead, do not modify the proﬁtability of the project. In fact, NPV presents its lower value (equal to 1100 k€) when the cost of the liquid waste is 144 €/ton. In this same scenario, DPBT is equal to four years that is, however, a reasonable value for investors. It remains ﬁxed equal to two years when the cost opportunity of capital is modiﬁed. NPV increased by 18% if the cost opportunity of capital is equal to 3%, while it decreased by 15% when this variable is equal to 7%. DPBT in other scenarios varies from two years to three years. There is a particular situation, only when the price of zeolite is modiﬁed. The investment is recovered already after one year if the price of zeolite is ﬁxed to 1380 €/ton, while the value >15 indicates that during the lifetime of the project, the value of discounted cash inﬂows never will be match one of discounted cash outﬂows. In this scenario, IRR cannot be calculated, since all cash ﬂows are always negative (n.d. acronym stands for “not deﬁnable”). In other scenarios, the minimum value is equal to 34.1%, which is signiﬁcantly greater than the cost opportunity of capital used in this analysis.

In fact, the value of annual revenues is greater than the operating costs, but, when also considering investment costs, the proﬁtability is not accomplished. This demonstrates as this index has a great limit. The value is signiﬁcantly low, but it does not give any information on relevant data of a project (as cost opportunity of capital and lifetime of the project). The same is veriﬁed also for ROI. The concept of circular economy requires not only to preserve the environmental value through initiatives of recovery/recycling as those deﬁned in this work, but also at the same time economic opportunities must be developed. The sole recovery of REEs from spent E-cat is absolutely unproﬁtable, so the production of zeolite plays a key-role. However, also the presence of a disposal fee is required to make recycling of spent E-cat proﬁtable. In this direction, another alternative scenario can be evaluated considering the absence of a disposal fee. A BEP analysis is conducted on the price of zeolite—. Price of zeolite NPV (k€) Consequently, the zeolite has a key-role in the economic analysis, but in absence of disposal fee for E-cat collection, the proﬁtability is signiﬁcantly lower. The proﬁtability is achieved with a price of the zeolite equal to 1305 €/ton without the disposal fee. Majority of zeolites are manufactured using alkaline and alkaline earth metals. The most common natural zeolites include analcime, chabazite, clinoptilolite, erionite, ferrierite, heulandite, laumontite, mordenite, and phillipsite. Natural and synthetic zeolites are most commonly used in various end-use industries, owing to various properties, including unique adsorption, molecular sieve, superior catalytic, and ion-exchange properties. Natural zeolites were the largest product segment, accounting for over 60% of the global market volume in Most common synthetic zeolites include types A, X, Y, and ZMS-5. The segment accounted for nearly 40% in 2014 and share is expected to increase by the end of 2022. Growing utilization of these zeolites in the petroleum industry, owing to its ability to purify gas streams, is expected to be the primary factor for the demand growth over the forecast period. The global zeolite market was valued at around USD 3.50 billion in 2014 and it is expected to reach USD 4.50 billion in 2020 and over 2000 ktons of zeolites produced worldwide, both natural and synthetic [39]. In this paper, a novel recycling process was developed for the full recycling of spent E-cat, also known as FCC catalyst. Lanthanum and cerium were recovered by a leaching stage with sulfuric acid solution, thus precipitated as RE sulphates with NaOH. The solid residue from the leaching stage is used for the synthesis of zeolite. The analysis demonstrated that zeolite Na-A is the most concentrated phase, and minor amounts of Na-X and sodalite are also present. Nevertheless, changing the synthesis conditions (amount of Na2CO3, roasting, and hydrothermal stage temperature and time) it could be possible to maximize the Na-A phase. This is the aim of the next experimental campaign.

The economic analysis demonstrated that the process is proﬁtable if the solid residue from the leaching stage is used for production of zeolite; moreover, another important revenue of the plant is the disposal fee for the E-cat. The current metal market prices do not make the recovery of La and Ce proﬁtable, as their concentration in spent E-cat is rather low.

The process and the relevant plant, thus, demonstrated a reliable and useful management of spent E-cat; although part of such catalyst is already used for the partial replacement of cement and mortar powders, powder in refractory materials and mineral woods, the majority of it is still landﬁlled. Hence, it is crucial to ﬁnd the market for such synthetic zeolites, which have many industrial uses and could certainly reduce the consumption of natural zeolites that are mined worldwide and the amount of spent E-cat landﬁlled every year.

The difference in the SOC parameter for the pilot and the main injections between the calculation and the experiment results does not exceed 1 CAD. The difference in the ROHR for the pilot injection can be explained by the low sen- sitivity of the combustion model to low fuel injection mass. The difference between the square under the calculated and experiment ROHR curves (means AHR) does not exceed 5%. The maximum value of the ROHR for the main injection does not differ much for the experiment and calculated curves. It is important to note that both ROHR curves are calculated and that is because the main and the dominating criterion for the validation is the pressure curve as the measured The ﬁrst and the second pilot injection masses were the same and equal to 14 mg/cycle as can be seen in, where the three-stage injection strategy is depicted.

The base value of indicated work for the second pilot SOI is equal to and at the ﬁrst pilot the SOI is equal to 10 CAD BTDC, but NOx emissions exceeded the base case level. This tendency can be seen for other ﬁxed SOI values of the second pilot injection. The main purpose of the optimization was to decrease the NOx emissions, which strongly depend on the local temperature in CC, by retarding the pilot SOI. Advancing the SOI of the ﬁrst pilot injection decreases NOx and increases PM emis- sions, as can be seen below in and 3. Advancing the ﬁrst pilot SOI leads to an increase in the CO mole fraction and a decrease in AHR. This means that the combustion process becomes less efﬁcient. It can be assumed that this is due to a relatively low efﬁciency evaporation process because of the low temperature and pressure values at the SOI. Moreover, advancing the ﬁrst pilot SOI means the compression work increases. It is not possible to simultaneously decrease the emissions and increase the efﬁciency of the combustion process at any time during the ﬁrst pilot SOI, or at least save the fuel efﬁciency at the base case level. 1-st Pilot SOI SOC, CAD CD, CAD EOC, CAD AHR, % CO, % Ai Acompr Base case 1-st Pilot SOI SOC, CAD CD, CAD EOC, CAD AHR, % CO, % Ai Acompr Base case On lower loads, the pilot injection mass is comparable to the main injection mass, hence the inﬂuence of the compression work on the indicated work should be much more signiﬁcant. However, to analyze the reasons for the change of indicated work, it is necessary The three stage injection reduces the AHR and increases the CO mole fraction. This means that the use of fresh charge becomes less efﬁcient with the addition of the second pilot injection and the advancement of the SOI of the ﬁrst pilot. The indicated work increases when the SOI of the ﬁrst pilot is retarded and becomes almost equal to the base case value despite an increasing CO mole fraction, combustion work, CD and a decreasing of the AHR. This can be explained by the earlier end of combustion (EOC) that causes decreased heat loss through exhaust gases and through the cooling system. The main parameters of CP for the case with the second pilot are described in. The combustion process is much more efﬁcient with the increase in AHR and indicated work and the decrease in the CO mole fraction, CD, compression work with the SOI retarded. The EOC does not exceed the base case level. There are two main parameters which inﬂuence the indicated work: the compression work and the efﬁciency of the combustion process.

In the range from 705 CAD to 710 CAD we can see the burning of the premixed charge for the three-stage injection (two cases with two pilot injections and one main; the ﬁrst pilot and and the second is ﬁxed at 19. for both).

The maximum value of the ROHR can be decreased with advanced injection timing and by adding the second pilot injection. Similar results have been described in the re- search [39] where the inﬂuence of multiple injections on the ROHR curve were investigated. The ﬁrst pilot SOI was varied in the range from to with increments of 5 for three different constant values of the second pilot SOI, and there was no opportunity to reduce the emissions and increase or save on the base case level In an indicated work contour plot in dependence of the SOI for the ﬁrst and second pilot injections is depicted. The range for the ﬁrst pilot SOI is from to with increments of 5 CAD. For the second pilot it is from to with increments of 5 CAD. Increasing or saving the indicated work base case level is possible using a retarded SOI for both pilot injections simultaneously. The red-dotted reference line can be seen (base case level), and further on each contour plot. The pressure rise rate ﬁeld shows that exceeding the critical value of To decrease the PM emissions, the SOI range for the ﬁrst pilot injection should be in the range from to. At the same time, the SOI for the second pilot injection should not be less than (more retarded than NOx emissions exceeding the base case level can be achieved earlier than when the indicated work reaches the base case level, as it can be seen in. The decrease in NOx emissions lower than the base case level can be achieved in the range of the SOI more than to for both pilot injections. In conclusion, there is no such combination of SOI for both pilots at which the de- creasing of the NOx emissions, PM and at least saving the base level of efﬁciency can be achieved. Researchers [40] have investigated the inﬂuence of the multiple injection strategies on the emissions. They have used two pilot injections with SOI variable from to with increments of 5 degrees. They also varied the pilot mass injection. The researchers marked a decrease in the NOx and a slight decrease in the soot emissions with an improving combustion process.", "deleted_count": 36, "triggered_rules": ["trim_garbage_start", "regex_table_soup", "fig_table_ref", "figure_or_table", "chapter_titles"]}

The researchers marked a decrease in the NOx and a slight decrease in the soot emissions with an improving combustion process. The next step should be the optimization of the pilot injection fuel mass for two combinations of SOI: 1–the ﬁrst pilot injection: BTDC, the second: 19.2 CAD BTDC. The lowest NOx emissions and a relatively low indicated work value are achieved. It is expected that 2–the ﬁrst pilot injection: SOI 19.2 CAD BTDC, the second: 10 CAD BTDC. It is expected to decrease the NOx emissions due to a decrease in the pilot injection fuel mass. As was mentioned above the fuel mass of the pilot injection is close enough to fuel the mass of the main injection in case of a three-stage injection. The pilot injections play an important role in the combustion process, and probably have the main inﬂuence on the local temperature in CC as long as the fresh oxidizer is available for the ﬁrst pilot injection predominantly. Further, the ﬁrst and the second SOI pilot injection sets. The results of the simulation are depicted in. The ﬁrst pilot injection mass fuel is equal to the second. The varying range is from 3.5 mg to 15.75 mg with increments of 1.75 mg. The fuel mass for both pilot injections is the same. For the ﬁrst SOI pilot injection set an indicated work is lower than the base case value in the range from 5% to 9%. A decrease in the rate of the pressure rise with a decrease in the pilot injection fuel mass can be seen. The PM emissions are higher than the base level in the range of the pilot injection fuel mass from 1.75 mg to 10.5 mg, and the increase in the pilot fuel mass injection decreases the PM emissions. The NOx emissions are lower than the base case level in the whole pilot fuel mass injection varying range, divided by factor 1.5. In the second SOI pilot injection set the indicated work value is lower than base case level in the range of the fuel mass pilot from 1.75 mg to 7 mg, the increase in the pilot injection fuel mass leads to an increase in indicated work. The pressure rise rate does not exceed the critical value of 1.5 MPa/CAD. The PM emissions has a higher base case level in the range of the pilot injection fuel mass in a range from 3 mg to 9 mg. The NOx emissions lower base case level is in the range from 1.75 mg to 7 mg of the pilot injection fuel mass. Later increases in pilot injection fuel mass leads to an increase in NOx emissions. The authors in [41,42] conducted an investigation where the analyses of multiple injection strategy on the combustion process was described. They mention that emissions strongly depend on the engine load. The varying of the pilot injection fuel mass does not allow the purpose of the opti- mization to be reached. The next step of the optimization is to vary the main SOI. The main SOI optimization simulation should be completed with other injection parameters set constant. Thus, the ﬁrst pilot SOI is ﬁxed at a value of 45 CAD BTDC, the second pilot SOI is ﬁxed at a value The negative SOI value on this ﬁgure means the injection ATDC. The optimal SOI range to increase the indicated work is from to compared with the base case level.

Advancing the SOI out of the described range decreases the indicated work by 5% and retarding the SOI out of range decreases the indicated work by 35%. The highly advanced SOI leads to an increase in compression work, and a highly retarded SOI leads to signiﬁcant heat losses. Varying the main SOI does not lead to an exceeding of the allowable level of pressure rise rate. To decrease the PM emissions, the main SOI range from to should be chosen. The maximum decrease is 71% compared with the base case level at 15 CAD BTDC. To decrease the NOx emissions, the advancing main SOI should not be more than 5 CAD BTDC. The optimal value of the main SOI should be chosen to be equal to 5 CAD BTDC. The 23% reduction in PM emissions can be achieved, as well as the base case level of the indicated work and the increase in NOx emissions by 20%. It is expected to reduce the NOx emissions through engaging the post injection. In general, advancing the main SOI leads to an increase in NOx emissions and a decrease in PM emissions. Similar results are described by the authors in [43]. The authors in [44,45] investigated the inﬂuence of advanced injections strategies with EGR on the combustion process. The main idea was to split the main injection and to investigate the dwell between the last main and post injection. It was veriﬁed that the three-split strategy in combination with 20% of EGR led to most of the investigated cases being within a narrow range of NOx concentrations without an increase in the soot emissions. It was found that the injection strategy seems to have a great impact in soot emission reduction for the cases characterized by 80% fuel injected through main pulses. The range and increment of post SOI (red-dashed line) is shown in, as well as the parameters for the pilot and main injections. In, the indicated work dependence of the post SOI can be seen. The addition of post injection reduces the indicated work. The indicated work decreased with a retarding of the post injection SOI. The NOx emissions decreased also. It is important to notice that The addition of the second pilot injection, a variation of the pilot injections mass, and the addition of the post injection do not allow the purpose of investigation to be achieved. As an assumption, the excessive increase in CD via a splitting of the two-stage injection to four deteriorates the evaporation and combustion process or increases NOx emissions and increases the heat losses to the cooling system and to exhaust gases. There is no need to increase the CD at low load conditions, because there is a lot of oxidizer in the combustion zone. It is still important to study the inﬂuence of another injection strategy on the CP. The decision is to exclude the second pilot injection. The pilot SOI optimization is the ﬁrst step of this optimization. The range of the pilot SOI is from to with increments of 5 CAD. The results of the variation of the pilot SOI are presented in. There are two injections–one pilot injection and one main injection. The reference dashed line displays the base case level. The advancing pilot SOI decreases the indicated work. To maintain the indicated work not lower than base case level, the pilot SOI should be in the range from to 10 CAD BTDC. The maximum value of the pressure rise rate does not exceed the critical value of 1.5 MPa/CAD, so there is no limitation.

The dependence of the pressure rise rate on the pilot SOI looks similar to that of the indicated work. The PM emission decreases with a retarding of the pilot SOI. Exceeding the base value can be seen in the range from to 20 CAD BTDC. The NOx emissions look fairly constant in the range of pilot SOI from to 30 CAD BTDC. Retarding the pilot SOI increases the NOx emissions; a maximum of NOx emissions, because of the local enrichment of the air–fuel mixture (the pilot injection becomes closer to main injection). The second reason is more efﬁcient combustion due to a higher temperature and pressure at SOI. As in can be seen from, the optimal value of the pilot SOI is at 19.2 CAD BTDC. The second step of the optimization is to vary the pilot injection mass in the range from 1.75 mg to 14 mg with increments of 1.75 mg. To exceed the pilot injection fuel mass value of 14 mg is not rational due to the increased compression work as the pilot injection fuel mass is increased. The results are presented in. As can be seen, the indicated work increases with the increase in the pilot injection mass. The maximum value reaches To understand the CP in detail, the main parameters of combustion are presented in The CD decreases, as well as the heat loss. Faster combustion is possible via the excessive amount of oxidizer. The detailed combustion process of the pilot and main injections is Pilot Mass, mg SOC, CAD BTDC CD, CAD AHR, % CO, % Acompr, % Ai, % For the pilot injection fuel mass 12.25 mg, the CD is almost the same as for the base case, but the increase in the AHR and the decrease in the compression work, as well as the CO mole fraction compared with the base case leads to an increase in the indicated work. The main inﬂuence on the combustion process is the use of the oxidizer in the burning zone which is characterized by the CO mole fraction and AHR. A higher AHR value or/and a lower CO mole fraction value means that the combustion process is more efﬁcient. The increasing of the pilot injection fuel mass increases the pressure rise rate via increasing the amount of the fuel burned BTDC. The increasing of the pilot injection mass decreases the PM emissions, from the maximum value of 225 mg/kg of fuel at the pilot injection fuel mass equal to 1.75 mg to 92 mg/kg of fuel at the pilot injection mass of 14 mg. The NOx emissions increase with an increasing pilot injection mass; the reason for this is the more efﬁcient use of the oxidizer, hence the local temperatures in CC increase. The pilot injection fuel mass is 12.25 mg. The 1.5% increase in the indicated work, the base case level of PM emissions, the 20% decrease in the pressure rise rate and the 4% decrease in the NOx emissions can be achieved compared with the base case level.

The negative SOI value on this ﬁgure means the injection ATDC. The values of all the estimated parameters at main are almost equal to those at the base case.

The main SOI retarding up to leads to an 18% decrease in the indicated work, a 52% decrease in NOx emissions, and about a doubled increase in PM emissions.

From the description above it can be seen that optimal main SOI is The range of post injection SOI is from to with incre- ments of 2 CAD. The results of the numerical investigation are displayed in. There wasn’t any pressure rise, because the post injection parameters have no inﬂuence on it. The retarding of post SOI decreases the indicated work and NOx emissions. The in- creasing of the PM emissions with advancing the post SOI can be seen, but in the range For the next variable parameter (the mass of the post injection), the post SOI should be taken equal to 2 CAD ATDC.

{"cleaned_text": "A little bit later combustion with an increasing of CD can be seen in. The pilot ROHR is lower than the base case, because the pilot fuel mass injection is lower. The most signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the combustion process has the pilot injection parameters: the pilot SOI and the pilot injection fuel mass. The pilot SOI has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the type of combustion (premixed/non premixed) of the pilot injection, so there is opportunity to control the ignition delay. The parameters described above have an inﬂuence on the compression work, mostly via the AHR BTDC and the CO mole fraction, as there is a lot of fresh oxygen in the CC. During the combustion of the pilot injections, the fuel mass, the temperature and the pressure in the combustion chamber increase and the evaporating of the main injection fuel mass and the mixture preparation becomes faster, and the combustion of the main portion becomes fuller, hence the increase in the premixed combustion. Therefore, the pilot injection parameters control the temperature and pressure values for burning the main The post injection parameters mostly inﬂuence the emissions and the indicated work via the heat losses through the exhaust gases and through the cooling system. Splitting the injection allows the fuel portions to be burned separate from each other and improves the mixing and the oxygen use. In particular, it is important in the case of high loads when the amount of cycle injection is high. The process of determining the optimal injection strategy is described above in detail and can be used for other ICEs, and other alternative fuels. The optimization of the injection strategy and the application of alternative fuels in conjunction is a powerful tool to improve the combustion process of any engine without changing the design of the engine itself or its systems. Further improvement of the results can be obtained with the minor change of the ICE design. For example, the optimization of the combustion chamber shape or the optimization of the injector nozzles. All these changes can be simulated using CFD models.

This study examined the association of sitting time and physical activity with HRQoL in older adults. Participants with prolonged sitting time showed signiﬁcantly worse overall HRQoL, even after adjusting for age, sex, marital status, educational level, occupation, household income level, physical activity, current smoking status, alcohol intake, chronic diseases, and depression. Several studies have examined the relationship between sitting time and quality of life in older people [7,18,19]. Garcia-Hermoso et al. found that prolonged sitting time increased the risk of cognitive impairment regardless of the level of physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity could attenuate these negative effects [8]. A longitudinal study of community-dwelling older adults in Spain stated that more time spent watching TV was related to a higher risk of depressive and psychological distress symptoms in women [20]. A recent study indicated that knee joint pain, hip joint pain, and low back pain were associated with sitting time (≥7.5 h/day) in older adults [21]. Similarly, a cross-sectional study found that a high level of sitting time (>7 h/day) was related to low back pain, and individuals with a prolonged sitting time with low physical activity had a higher risk of low back pain [22]. Yen et al. showed that prolonged sitting time was signiﬁcantly associated with limited mobility in older adults. The results of previous studies are consistent with those of the present study in that prolonged sitting time was associated with all of the EQ-5D dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Additionally, we presented the relationship between physical activity and quality of life, independent of sitting time. Both prolonged sitting time and physical activity were independently associated with the EQ-5D dimensions of mobility, self-care, and usual activity. Physical inactivity was not statistically signiﬁcant in the pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression domains of EQ-5D, independent of sitting time. However, prolonged sitting time was statistically signiﬁcant in the pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression domains of the EQ-5D, independent of physical activity. The present study examined the combined impact of sitting time and physical ac- tivity on HRQoL by comparing four groups according to their sitting time and physical activity level. Our ﬁndings suggest that individuals with a prolonged sitting time and low physical activity levels had a worse HRQoL and that the high sitting time/active group had a lower risk of worse results for the usual activity and pain/discomfort domains of HRQoL than the high sitting time/inactive group. In other words, physical activity could weaken the negative association of prolonged sitting time on the usual activity and pain/discomfort domains of HRQoL. A cross-sectional study conducted in the US HRQoL, particularly the general health, physical health, and activity limitation compo- nents. However, there was no signiﬁcant combined association of sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with poor mental health [14]. Unlike the results of their study, the present study showed that individuals with a prolonged sitting time and low physical activity had problems associated with anxiety/depression, as well as problems associated with the mobility, self-care, and usual activity domains of quality of life. Korea has the fastest aging population among the Organization for Economic Coop- eration and Development (OECD) countries. By 2050, 71% of the population of Korea is expected to be aged 65 years or older [23]. Prolonged sitting time in the older population has become a major social issue because it causes various problems such as cardiovascular disease, sarcopenia, cognitive impairment, and mortality [8,10]. The reason for prolonged sitting time in the Korean elderly seems to be that more than 90% of them spend their leisure time watching TV or listening to the radio, and they often play sedentary Korean games such as hwatu, janggi, and baduk [18]. It is known that leisure activities in older people are associated with higher life satisfaction. In order to improve the HRQoL of older people, it is essential to develop outdoor leisure programs focusing on physical activities [24].

{"cleaned_text": "It is known that leisure activities in older people are associated with higher life satisfaction. In order to improve the HRQoL of older people, it is essential to develop outdoor leisure programs focusing on physical activities [24]. This study has some limitations. First, because of the nature of the cross-sectional study, it is difﬁcult to accurately identify the causal relationship between sitting time and HRQoL. Second, the self-reported data on sitting time and physical activity might be less accurate and reliable than objective measurement data. Third, the EQ-5D has limitations in assessing overall HRQoL. Several studies have suggested that the Short Form 6 Dimensions (SF-6D) is more useful and valid than EQ-5D [25,26]. However, the validity and reliability of the EQ-5D has been proven in previous studies, and it has been widely used as a simple method for evaluating quality of life [27–29]. Despite these limitations, the strengths of this study were that a nationally representative sample from South Korea was used and potential confounding factors were adjusted for. Moreover, few studies have examined the combined association of sitting time and physical activity with HRQoL in older people. This cross-sectional study using representative data from South Korea suggests that prolonged sitting time and low physical activity are associated with poor general HRQoL in elderly people. Social support as well as interventions that reduce sitting time and encourage physical activity are needed to improve HRQoL in elderly people.

Similarly, the concentration of PM2.5 (21, 15, 13, 13µg/m3) in the four sites is far below the standard limit of 35µg/m3. Deficient concentrations of Benzene have been measured (0.8, 0.6, 0.46, 0.16ppb) in the four areas, respectively, in comparison with the PME limit of 4.4ppb/y. Since site S1 is located close to the plant site, the pollutant concentrations were compared with OSHA standard limit for indoor air quality. It was found that all pollutants have concentrations below the permissible exposure limit of 25, 2, 20, 3ppm, and 100ppb for CO, SO2, H2S, NOx, and O3, respectively. WHO recommended desirable limits of 50 and 20 for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. In this study, it is assumed that the total VOCs represent the summation of Benzene, Toluene, O-Xylene, P-Xylene, and Ethylbenzene, and it is recommended a concentration of 120ppb as a healthy indoor environment (Fernández-Agüeraet al., 2019).

The effect of CO on human health depends on the exposure period, CO concentration, and the receptor's sensitivity. Breathing of air with a high CO concentration causes headache, vomiting, nausea, dizziness, and may cause heart disease, angina, reduces brain function, unconscious, or die at high concentration. CO exposure's profound acute health effect includes weakness, dyspnoea, cardiac dysrhythmias, muscle fatigue, palpitations, confusion, hypotension, cardiac and respiratory arrest, impaired vision, pulmonary edema, myocardial ischemia, and coma. Since the blood hemoglobin binding affinity to CO is more than 200 times greater than its relationship to O2, a high concentration of CO causes an increase in the level of carboxyhaemoglobin.

Since CO concentrations are <0.9ppm in all sites and far below the reported limit, no health effect is expected. The industry is the primary source of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere, especially the power plants, oil and gas industries, mineral processing, vehicles with diesel engines, and fossil fuel combustion containing sulfur. Sulfur dioxide can cause many health effects, especially for sensitive people with lung diseases, children, and the elderly. Its effects include irritation of the nose, throat, eyes, respiratory system, and lungs. The common symptoms at high concentration are breathing difficulties, reduced lung function, harsh asthma attacks, and aggravation of heart diseases for sensitive groups. The chemical reaction of SO2 with chemicals in the atmosphere produces acid particles that harm the respiratory system and lungs. It was reported that SO2 is responsible for an increase in hospital respiratory admissions by 4% in Paris and Milan, 6-9% in chronic obstructive lung disease admission in Barcelona. Epidemiological studies showed that the prolonged exposure to SO2 concentration of 10ppm caused damage to the airways' epithelium, while at a higher concentration of 300ppm, slowing of ciliary transport of mucus occurred . National Park Services (NPS) of USA classified air quality index in six categories based on SO2 concentration as: good (0.0-0.1ppm), moderate (0.1-0.2ppm), unhealthy for sensitive groups (0.2–1.0ppm), harmful (1.0–3.0ppm), and very unhealthy (3.0–5.0ppm) and hazardous (>5ppm) . The concentrations of SO2 in all sites ranged from 2.00 to 11.92ppb; subsequently, air quality can be classified as good (0.0-0.1ppm) according to the NPS classification, and therefore no adverse health effects are expected. Nitrogen oxides are generated from the combustion of fuel, vehicle emissions, power plants, and off-road equipment. Exposure to NOx can irritate the respiratory system and throat, asthma, cough, difficulty breathing . Previous studies indicated that short- term exposure (1hr) to a concentration of 200μg/m3 has insufficient evidence of health effects. In comparison, exposure to a concentration of 50μg/m3 for 24hrs showed an increase in hospital admissions for respiratory diseases and mortality . It was reported that a concentration of 0.3ppm for 30-minute is the lowest limit that can affect the pulmonary function, and there were no symptomatic complaints at an exposure limit of 1.0ppm by either asthmatics or healthy groups. Higher concentrations (3.0–4.0ppm) caused a significant effect on lung function and lung protein activity . The maximum concentration of NOx was measured in S1with an average value of 16.28ppb, which is far below the lowest limit of the health effect of 200μg/m3 (97.4ppb), or the limitation of 0.3ppm that affect the pulmonary function.

A concentration of 750-1400mg/m3 is considered an acute lethal level with immediate collapse. Sulfide and hydrogen sulfide anions are strong bases with a significant impact on the nervous system, which caused conjunctional irritation at 10ppm (15mg/m3). Also, it can cause respiratory irritation and eye damage at a concentration above 150ppm, pulmonary edema at a concentration of 267ppm, loss of olfactory sense at a concentration level of 150-250, CNC stimulation at a concentration of 530-1000ppm, and paralysis of respiration at a concentration of 1000-2000ppm. Epidemiological studies reported that daily exposure of workers to H2S with a concentration of >20ppm (>30 mg/m3) resulted in the complaint of 70% of the workers from many symptoms such as headache, fatigue, drowsiness, vertigo, poor memory, disquiet, and eye irritation . The concentration of H2S in the measured sites were: 16.28, 10.3, 3.4, and 3.3ppb for sites S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively. These are far below the limit that causes an effect on the nervous system (10ppm), or the limit that irritates (20ppm), nor the limit that causes an impact on the respiratory system (1000ppm). Therefore, no adverse health effects are expected due to the exposure of H2S at the current concentration level. In terms of VOCs, it was reported that several compounds of VOCs have a carcinogenic impact. EPA said that VOCs are responsible for 35-55% of the ambient air cancer in the USA, and out of 27 carcinogenic pollutants, 17 are VOCs. Health Canada found that VOCs also have noncarcinogenic effects ranging from drowsiness, weakness, fatigue, joint pain, tightness in chess at low concentration (<0.3µg/m3) to irritation, discomfort at a concentration of 0.3-25. In contrast, higher concentration caused a significant effect on the respiratory system and pain . The development of VOCs depends strongly on the type of VOC compounds, as will be discussed later. It was reported that the reference concentration of VOCs is 0.56ppm, 0.018ppm for Benzene, 0.46ppm for Ethyl Benzene, 0.079ppm for toluene, and 0.0537ppm for Xylenes (Liu, et al., 2015), benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and xylenes' concentration ranged from 0.16-0.8, 0.07-0.3, 0.16-0.81, and 0.34-1.67ppb, respectively are far below the reported limits of effect. Dust is the primary environmental challenge to the cement industry due to the high fugitive emissions from most operation processes. While the PME ambient air quality standard limited PM10 and PM2.5 at 340 and 35µg/m3, there are no local indoor air quality standards for them. For indoor air quality, OSHA recommended a limit of 5 mg/m3 for respirable dust and 15mg/m3 for total dust in the cement industry compared with 4 and 10mg/m3 according to UK standards . WHO reported a significant effect of PM10 on the respiratory system while PM2.5 has a high-risk factor due to its impact on the cardiopulmonary system, and can cause an increase in the mortality cases (6-13% per 10µg/m3) in case of long-term exposure time.

Although there is no exceedance in the concentration during the study period, it is expected that high exceedances could occur during extreme weather conditions due to the storm dusts that overrun the KSA most of the year. For this reason, the employees should be provided with PPE, and the plant should maintain continuous awareness training programs, implementing periodic medical checks and a regular sprinkling of water to control the fugitive dust. CO2 is not regulated as an ambient air pollutant according to most international standards. It is generated as a result of the complete combustion of fuel in all combustion chambers. Additionally, it is emitted from the calcination process of materials in cement plants . Alzboon et al. found a high concentration of CO2 at the kiln area, crushing area, and clinker cooling area. According to the health and safety environment, the max allowable limit of CO2 in the workplace is 1500 and 5000ppm for short- and long-term exposure time, respectively . It was reported that the minimum concentration that can cause a health effect is 1000ppm for an exposure time of 2.5hr. At higher concentrations (5000ppm), employees showed many symptoms: lethargy, headache, irritation, mental slowness, sleep disruption, while death may occur at a concentration of 7% with a 5-minute exposure time . OSHA's standard limit of CO2 is 5000ppm.

The average HQ of different pollutants can be ranked as PM10> PM2.5> CO2> O3> CO> VOCs> NOx> SO2> H2S. Except for PM10, all of the HQ values are <1 in all sites, which indicates that no significant potential health effect is expected from any pollutant individually . The high HQ of PM10 is attributed to the dusty weather in Saudi Arabia for most of the year. It worth mentioning that the monitoring process was conducted in October 2017, which is considered as a month with low dust in Saudi Arabia.

The most important variables explaining high versus low reef cover are downward velocities in February, the spa- tial variable between-transect MEM 2, and depth. Less im- portant variables are bottom current speed, upward velocities in February, between-transect MEM 1, and within-transect MEM 4. The other explanatory variables have only a minor contribution on the ﬁrst axis.

To deter- mine how coral mound engineering affects the conﬁguration of cold-water corals reefs, we investigated (1) the environ- mental control on cold-water coral reefs at multiple spatial scales and (2) which of the environmental factors are or are not engineered (i.e. affected) by the corals (coral mound en- gineering). Ventilation and hydrodynamics that stimulate the verti- cal and lateral food supply have been identiﬁed as the most important drivers of cold-water coral reef growth over the past 20 000 years . In our analysis we included simulated hydrodynamic variables that indicate increased vertical or lateral food supply or ven- tilation. By including spatial variables (Moran Eigenvector Maps, MEMs) in our analysis, we were able to investigate whether these hydrodynamic variables had their largest inﬂuence on reef cover at the between- or the within-transect scale. We found that reef cover varied most at the scale of the study area (∼25 km), and this variation seems to be associ- ated most with non-engineered (i.e. not under coral control) downward velocities in winter (Sect. 4.1). By explaining 45.1 % of the variation in benthic cover, our set of variables performed well in comparison to similar deep-sea studies using RDA: e.g. Vad et al. explained Response and explanatory variables on the same side of the axis are correlated. and hydrodynamic variables appears to beneﬁt the analy- sis. In particular, within-transect MEMs described a rela- tively large part of the variation in our benthic cover data that was not explained by the environmental variables. Henry et al. similarly found that community composition was structured mainly by broad-scale environmental forcings, but that ﬁne-scale MEMs described a signiﬁcant fraction of the variation in community composition. This within-transect variation in benthic cover can be related to spatial patterns of fauna , such as self-organized regular spatial patterns in coral reefs and the typical reef zonation on cold-water coral mounds (Sect. 4.2).

However, when including all mounds at the Logachev cold-water coral mound province, the mag- nitude of the effect on downward velocities in February is not correlated to the height of a coral mound. We thus argue that high reef cover is associated with enhanced down- ward velocities, mostly due to broad-scale, non-engineered, environmental processes. Since downward velocities in February did not signiﬁ- cantly correlate to downward velocities in August (rS = 0.26, p = 0.18) and since downward velocities in August were barely associated to reef cover, reef cover seems mostly steered by processes prevailing in winter and not in summer. At the Rockall trough, deep winter mixing extends as far down into the water column as 600 m , and during winter months, dense water is created over the Rockall Bank that cascades down over the Rock- all trough margin . Both processes cause an accelerated downward ﬂow of organic matter that peaks near the winter–spring transition, at the onset of the phy983 (f). The mound effect was calculated by subtracting the hydrodynamic variables obtained from hydrodynamic simulations without coral mounds from the variables obtained from hydrodynamic simulations with coral mounds. Positive 1 values in the panels thus indicate an enhancing effect of coral mounds on the hydrodynamic variables. toplankton bloom that is particularly early (March and/or April) at the Rockall Bank . These broad-scale, non-engineered, envi- ronmental processes offer a food supply mechanism for the cold-water corals during and shortly after the food-limited winter months and have a larger control on coral survival than food supply mechanisms in summer . This ﬁnding suggests that broad-scale environmental pro- cesses exert a stronger control on cold-water coral cover than engineered environmental variables. However, the rather coarse resolution of the hydrodynamic simulations might cause us to overestimate the importance of broad-scale envi- ronmental variables. Variance partitioning showed that 8.8 % of the variation in benthic cover was explained solely by within-transect MEMs compared to only 2.4 % by between- transect MEMs. This signals that the variation at the within- transect scale might be related to environmental variables at a ﬁner resolution. Such ﬁne-scale variation in hydrodynamic variables is more likely to be caused by the interaction be- tween water ﬂow and ﬁne-scale topography, i.e. ecosystem engineering. Since MEMs 3 to 5, which describe the mound foot-to-summit spatial scale, play a role in explaining the variation in benthic cover, cold-water coral mound ecosys- tem engineering might cause self-organized variation in ben- thic cover. Environmental factors other than the hydrodynamic vari- ables investigated here might also affect coral reef growth and subsequent cold-water coral mound formation. For ex- ample, certain water masses , the perma- nent pycnocline , internal waves , seawater density (Flögel et al., 2014), and (terrestrial) sediment supply have been suggested to restrain mound formation.

At the mound ﬂank, upward velocities are enhanced, whereas at the mound summits, downward velocities are enhanced . Previous studies showed that cold-water coral mounds affect downward water motions. Our results also indicate that coral mounds inﬂuence downward velocities in Febru- ary. However, the magnitude of this effect does not correlate to mound height, likely because of the prevailing inﬂuence of non-engineered, broad-scale environmental pro- cesses in winter (discussed in Sect. 4.1). These ﬁndings are in line with hydrodynamic theory of water ﬂow passed an object and with other stud- ies reporting the hydrodynamics around coral mounds . Such a regime can be generalized as follows: (1) ﬂow acceleration at the mound side facing the incoming current and at the lee and (2) ﬂow deceleration at the other two mound sides, (3) ﬂow decel- eration at the summit if the summit is ﬂat, (4) upwelling along the lower mound ﬂanks, and (5) downwelling around the mound upper ﬂanks and summit. As these typical hy- drodynamic zones likely determine the typical benthic cover zones, we will argue in the following that reef zonation on cold-water coral mounds is self-organized. Cold-water coral mounds show a typical, often-reported benthic zonation, with mostly sediment cover at the mound foot, coral rubble at the lower ﬂank, dead-coral frameworks on the higher ﬂank, and living corals at the sum- mit (e.g. Cathalot et al., 2015; Davies et al., 2009; Genin et al., 1986; De Clippele et al., 2021; Maier et al.,", "deleted_count": 9, "triggered_rules": ["trim_garbage_start", "remove_citations", "fig_table_ref", "figure_or_table"]}
{"cleaned_text": "Indeed, we found that high cold-water coral reef and rub- ble cover correlated to the spatial scale from mound foot-to- summit (MEM 3 and 4) and to strong bottom current speeds , suggesting that reef growth is more prominent on those mound ﬂanks where (engineered) bottom currents are accelerated (i.e. front and rear) than on the ﬂanks where (en- gineered) bottom currents are decelerated; Mohn et al., 2014). High coral rubble cover correlated to strong upward velocities in August, whereas high reef and sediment cover correlated to weak upward velocities in February. This suggests that strong upwelling occurs mostly around the mound ﬂanks and not around the mound summit and foot. Flow induced up- and downwelling over coral mounds is often mentioned as an important food supply mechanism to cold-water coral reefs . During a tidal cycle, isopycnals are depressed at the mound ﬂank, and at the turning of the tide, an internal bore is formed that propagates over the mound ﬂank towards the summit . The vertical length scale of these excursions follows the length scale of the mound . Larger coral mounds generally have a larger effect on hydrodynamics than smaller mounds; Lim et al., 2018; van der Kaaden et al., 2021). This underlines the mound ecosystem engineer- ing aspect of hydrodynamic zonation and benthic zonation: as the coral mound grows taller, the formerly higher ﬂank regions on the mound that were suitable for coral growth become unsuitable lower ﬂank regions, thereby maintaining the typical reef zonation and causing a so-called Massener- hebung effect. The Massenerhebung effect was ﬁrst described for the zonation of ﬂora and fauna on terrestrial mountains . Terres- trial mountains exhibit zones with a typical ﬂora and fauna that are determined by various factors such as temperature, humidity, and solar radiation. These zones vary with rela- tive altitude on the mountain but not with the absolute height above the ground because of feedbacks between the size of the mountain and the environment . A perhaps surprising result of this effect is that, for example, the treeline lies higher on higher moun- tains than on lower mountains. Genin et al. report that cold-water coral presence is also related to the posi- tion on the mound rather than the actual height above the seaﬂoor or depth in the water column. Here, we hypothesize that this Massenerhebung effect, whereby the distribution of organisms is determined by feedbacks between the mountain and the environment, applies to cold-water coral mounds too. Since depth is also an important variable explaining benthic cover, it is likely that the position of cold-water coral reefs on coral mounds is determined by the feedbacks between the mound and the hydrodynamics but that shallower m", "deleted_count": 16, "triggered_rules": ["remove_citations", "figure_or_table", "chapter_titles", "fig_table_ref"]}

Ecosystem-engineering effects on cold-water corals and climate change Cold-water coral mounds seem to exhibit a zone with pre- dominantly upward water motions on the mound ﬂanks and a zone with predominantly downward water motions around the mound summit. The summit and upper ﬂank seem to be most suitable for cold-water coral growth, likely because downward water motions accelerate the downward transport of organic matter. In contrast, on the coral mound ﬂanks, coral rubble and dead-coral frameworks are more abundant than live corals. Nutrient-rich deep water is pushed up to- wards the lower mound ﬂanks , and the community associated with the dead coral framework re- leases substantial amounts of nutrients . These nutrients might be transported by the predominantly upward water motions towards the ocean surface . This might beneﬁt the coral reefs as a global review and studies on millennial timescales show the beneﬁts of increased primary productivity for coral reef growth. The upward wa- ter motions around the mound ﬂanks likely also resuspend deposited particles. These particles are transported higher up the mound by lateral advection where they supply the corals with additional food . Factors other than food supply also inﬂuence cold-water coral growth, such as biogeochemical seawater properties (Flögel et al., 2014; da Costa Portilho-Ramos et al., 2022; Fink et al., 2012). Deep water that is upwelled around cold- water coral mounds typically has lower temperatures, oxy- gen content, and aragonite saturation than water from higher in the water column that is downwelled (Findlay et al., 2013, 2014; Mienis et al., 2007; Flögel et al., 2014). The mound zone inﬂuenced by downward water motions therefore likely experiences higher temperatures, oxygen content, and arago- nite saturation state than the region of upward water motions. While higher oxygen content and aragonite saturation state would beneﬁt cold-water corals , higher temperatures might have an adverse effect . Currently, most cold-water corals occur within their thermal tolerance . A higher temperature may be beneﬁcial but only up to the up- per limit of the thermal tolerance range (Büscher et al., 2022; Dodds et al., 2007). Increased temperatures from global change increase the energy demand of cold-water corals . When not compen- sated for by sufﬁcient food supply, the framework-forming cold-water coral habitat is expected to move to deeper wa- ters . Our results show that this poses a problem to cold-water corals and their associated fauna liv- ing on mounds as the corals prefer the downwelling zone where they proﬁt from a higher vertical particle ﬂux, oxy- gen content, and aragonite saturation state. The temperatures in this zone, however, might become unfavourable in the fu- ture. Further down the mound ﬂank is the upwelling zone that seems less suitable for cold-water coral growth.
