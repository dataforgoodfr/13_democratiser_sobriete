Our key findings include the following: i. El Ni\u00f1o events worsen the region\u2019s drought conditions, while Atlantic SST variability has less influence. ii. Long-term surface warming trends increase the evapotranspiration demand, aggravating drought conditions. However, vegetation greenness remains high despite high surface temperatures, suggesting that temperature alone does not significantly affect vegetation phenology and root zone water reserves. A sustained rainfall deficit is necessary to cause observable changes in the vegetation and soil conditions. iii.

        "question": "Research question 1 Regarding the first research question, in line with societal stereotypes and after controlling for students\u2019 beginning-of-year mathematics achievement, teacher expectations were higher for Asian and lower for M\u0101ori, compared with NZ European students. These findings are in line with previous research in the same context (Turner et al., 2015), but also corroborate findings from other educational systems that teachers differentiate in their expectations based on students\u2019 minority background (e.g., Glock & Krolak-Schwerdt, 2013; Tenenbaum & Ruck, 2007; Timmermans et al., 2015, 2018). However, contrary to the expected stereotypes, expectations within the domain of mathematics were higher for girls than for boys. This finding is inconsistent with earlier research as it has also been found that, in line with stereotypes, girls have been the target of low expectations in mathematics (Jussim et al., 1996). However, there is also some evidence (Jaremus et al., 2020) that expectations for girls and boys in mathematics at the elementary and middle school level are less differentiated (e.g., Gentrup & Rjosk, 2018) and that it is at higher levels of schooling (secondary and tertiary) where teachers tend to have higher expectations for boys in the STEM fields. Perhaps, this finding is a reflection of teachers more often disapproving of boys\u2019 classroom behavior, causing boys generally to be perceived as academically poorer students (e.g., Bennett et al., 1993; Harlen, 2005; Hecht & Greenfield, 2002; Kenney-Benson et al., 2006). Moreover, the New Zealand public have been made aware of societal stereotypes related to girls in STEM and how greater numbers of girls need to be encouraged into these fields (e.g., https://www.curiousminds.nz/actions/community/womenand- girls/). It may be that this information has led teachers to more carefully consider the capabilities of girls in mathematics.

Teachers\u2019 expectations for the academic achievement of elementary school students have been found to be positively related to students\u2019 perceived assertiveness, independence (Alvridez & Weinstein, 1999; Bonvin & Genoud 2006; Rubie-Davies, 2010), selfconfidence (Driessen, 2006; Rubie-Davies, 2010), and self-concept (Upadyaya & Eccles, 2015). These studies have indicated that teachers tend to have higher expectations of a student they perceive of as independent, more confident, or with a greater self-concept.

        "question": "Research question 2 Regarding the second research question, teachers\u2019 beginning-year expectations were predictive of achievement and self-concept of students at end-of-year. For mathematics achievement, these findings correspond to numerous studies showing that differential expectations are confirmed in generally small to moderate self-fulfilling prophecies in various academic domains (e.g., Jussim & Harber 2005; Rubie-Davies 2008; Tenenbaum & Ruck, 2007; Wang et al., 2018). The finding that beginning-of-year teacher expectations are not only predictive of achievement but also of students\u2019 self-concept is an important contribution for two reasons. First, many previous studies have failed to take initial self-concept into account; therefore, it has remained largely unknown whether the reported positive associations were spurious. Second, children\u2019s perceptions of themselves affect their motivation and subsequent behavior (Bandura, 1986; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Harter, 1983; Marsh, 1990). The finding that teacher expectations are predictive of later student self-concept is in line with Expectancy-Value Theory (Eccles, 1983). It seems that the teachers\u2019 expectations serve as an evaluation of a significant other (e.g., Bong & Skaalvik, 2003; Gniewosz et al., 2014; Shavelson et al., 1976), and when felt and regarded as support and acceptance by students, these expectations lead the student to evaluate themselves more positively (Liu & Wang, 2008).",

The current study, however, failed to find this association. Various methodological differences may account for the difference in findings. Some prior studies tested this association in a different or combined subject domains (Benner & Mistry, 2007; Boerma et al., 2016), or included students\u2019 perceptions of teacher expectations instead of teacher ratings (Gilbert et al., 2014; Lazarides & Watt, 2015; Woolley et al., 2010). Furthermore, all studies above are based on data collections in which teacher expectations and task values were collected at a single moment. Perhaps, once controlled for beginning-of-year levels of intrinsic and utility value, teacher expectations are not strong enough to predict intrinsic and utility value about 8 months later. Alternatively, although it may be assumed that attitudes of socializers (i.e., teachers) affect students\u2019 subjective task values (Wigfield & Eccles, 1992, 2000), this perhaps holds for other teacher attitudes but potentially does not include teachers\u2019 performance expectations.",

It is therefore not possible from these studies to disentangle teacher expectation effects on these outcomes from potentially higher initial expectations for more confident, efficacious, or interested students (Timmermans et al., 2016). A major strength of the current study was the design with measures at both the beginning and end-of-school year and therefore the possibility to control for beginning-of-year ratings of students\u2019 self-concept and task values. Therefore, the association that higher teacher expectations at beginning-of-year are predictive of greater self-concept at end-of-year and of the absence of an association with end-of-year intrinsic and utility value is possibly a more reliable and robust finding than that of earlier studies.

        "question": "5. Conclusions This study presented a consolidated framework for the vulnerability assessment of rural communities by indicating that rural\u2013urban linkages are crucial in influencing flood vulnerability. To do so, this paper presented a thorough review of the concept of vulnerability, its components, and conceptual frameworks, as well as the examination of terms \u201crural\u201d and \u201curban\u201d, interaction theories, and a general understanding of rural\u2013urban linkages. Theories and conceptual frameworks facilitated to identify factors that drive variation in rural\u2013urban linkages and flood vulnerability. The review suggested that rural\u2013 urban linkages can be essential in influencing vulnerability of flood-prone rural communitieswhich have not been given attention in previous conceptual frameworks. Thus, rural vulnerability to floods should not be studied in isolation, rather its relationship with urban areas is important to consider. It should not only be defined by the internal characteristics of its residents but also by considering the changing rural\u2013urban interactions. Thus, rural\u2013 urban linkages may also provide an opportunity to reduce vulnerability of rural communities. The framework highlights to understand the multi-dimensional, differential, and dynamic nature of vulnerability and rural\u2013urban linkages, the interaction between them, as well as the driving forces that shape the overall flood vulnerability of rural communities. Further, the role of city size and proximity is identified as an important research gap which is widely neglected in the discourse of flood vulnerability and could be imperative for improved understanding of rural vulnerability. The framework is useful for application at the local level in developing countries. It provides multiple and broad aspects for investigation and hence can be applied in any flood-affected rural area by using their context-specific information. For example, socioeconomic, physical, institutional factors differ spatially and temporally and so are the flows. Moreover, the framework is not limited to flooding (even though the discussion revolves around flood hazards) and can be a vade mecum for other hazards considering their character and scope of impacts. For example, droughts or extreme temperatures may not affect physical infrastructure in the same way as flooding and thus linkages as well as resulting vulnerability. In this context, the framework can guide factors and the nature of influence on linkages to examine vulnerability for other hazards and propose vulnerability and risk reduction measures accordingly. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed framework can be evaluated and validated through empirical investigations. The framework is flexible and allows both qualitative and quantitative assessment of overall vulnerability based on the dynamics of rural\u2013urban linkages. It gives freedom to develop area and hazard specific indicators and looks at overall vulnerability from the holistic and integrated perspective. Moreover, various methodological and analytical frameworks can be developed depending on different disciplines. The proposed framework has its limitations, it only considers rural areas as flood-prone and vulnerable and does not underscore how changing linkages and resulting vulnerability can indirectly affect urban areas/cities and vice versa. Moreover, urban\u2013rural interrelationships and their related issues may vary across various regions of the world. The paper endorses that rural\u2013urban linkages must be incorporated into vulnerability assessments of rural communities. The proposed framework can support disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation of rural communities by highlighting the role of cities on which rural population depends. Considering this, in addition to rural areas, necessary measures can be developed to enhance the capacities of cities so that they can support rural areas. In this context, better information delivery mechanisms, short- and long-term employment opportunities in cities, controlling price inflation, the smooth and continuous supply of goods and services, intelligent investment decisions in the reconstruction and rehabilitation phase will be the relevant areas for policymaking to strengthen linkages, curtail vulnerability, and reduce disaster risk. Finally, the framework can be a useful tool in increasing awareness among disaster managers, regional planners, and policymakers at the local and regional levels regarding the complex and dynamic nature of vulnerability. It also calls to bring professionals from different fields\u2014especially from climate change and disaster risk as well as regional and rural development planning communities\u2014to coordinate and work together to gain an accurate understanding of rural\u2013urban linkages and associated factors that determine flood vulnerability. It helps to prioritize the potential areas of intervention and delineate proper plans to support rural\u2013urban linkages and reduce flood vulnerability as indicated earlier. The proposed framework contributes to recognize priority 1 of SFDRR, SDGs (goal 11 and 13), and a new urban agenda through enhanced understanding of vulnerability by suggesting the importance of linkages and facilitating the link between spatial planning and vulnerability discourse.",

On the other hand, protecting the environment for future generations and efficient use of resources can be stated as a summary of environmental sustainability. Economic activities should not threaten natural ecosystems with limited resources and capacity. In this context, logistics centres, which save energy and resource use in the location selection model within the scope of green ports, are an important solution alternative for regions disadvantaged in terms of air pollution, traffic congestion and emissions. Thanks to the consolidation and connection of low-emission transport modes to be provided by logistics centres, greenhouse gas emissions caused by transportation and transportation activities will be reduced.",

As a matter of fact, while it cannot be expected that a port will have all the criteria at the same time, all of the port preference criteria have similar importance weights. In particular, the difference between port location, port fees and port infrastructure criteria is around 1.5%. This showed that there is no indispensable criterion for the selection of the main port within the scope of the study, and that all criteria must be found in the main port concept in a relationship. The importance weight of the proximity to the market and hinterland criteria was found to be 23.6%. Because proximity to the market and hinterland are related to how full the ship can leave the port at a point or how close it is to customer or industry needs. This criterion has been found to be the most important port selection criterion in many studies in the literature on port selection and the order of importance of port criteria. Right after this comes the port location criterion. This criterion is a criterion that directly affects the operational cost of the ship. The location of the port must give the ship a minimum deviation from its main course. At the same time, this criterion is closely related to proximity to the market and hinterland. As it can be understood from here, due to the technical and financial extra costs of the green port implementation, as well as the sanction burden of the green port implementation legislation, the location and proximity to the market criteria are much more decisive than ecological factors in the selection of the port establishment location.",

When this literature is examined in general; it can be said that the criteria of air pollution, water pollution, energy management and waste management come to the fore. It is natural for these criteria to come to the fore, as environmental issues are primarily considered in almost every sector that aims to alleviate the intensity of pollution, which is increasing day by day. In future studies, the potential of ports to be green ports can be evaluated. From this point of view, it can be suggested as a suggestion for ports that do not have green port certification to consider successful green port examples as role models.

In this context, it can be stated as another suggestion that ports should perform benefit, opportunity, cost and risk analysis and this can be resolved by the Analytical Network Process-Benefit, Opportunity, Cost and Risk (ANP-BOCR) method.

Under the fixed price and time of use rate, a new peak will emerge in the late evening and this peak in many cases is higher than the existing peak without PHEVs. Therefore, there is a great possibility of congestion in the network, loss of voltage and frequency, and ultimately black outs. A similar situation holds for the controlled off peak charging under time of use rate.

In addition, stark differences were seen in the oxygen consumption rates between summer- and winter-acclimatized A. anatina. We found only very limited evidence of thermal compensation. We are unaware of any data relating the behaviours we studied to temperature change; however, a comparison of previously published data examining the effects of temperature change on oxygen consumption from a range of bivalves is possible. Evidence from a number of marine (Newell and Pye, 1970a; Newell and Pye, 1970b; Widdows, 1973; Newell et al., 1977; Pernet et al., 2007; Resgalla et al., 2007; Pernet et al., 2008; Riascos et al., 2012) and freshwater (Hornbach et al., 1983; Baker and Hornbach, 2001; Alexander and McMahon, 2004) bivalve species indicates that bivalves compensate oxygen consumption rates at intermediate, and in some species, higher temperatures, while there is no evidence of compensation at lower temperatures. As our primary interest was the difference between summer- and winter-acclimatized mussels, we did not measure oxygen consumption rates in A. anatina at intermediate temperatures as well, and cannot conclusively say whether A. anatina partially compensates oxygen consumption at intermediate temperatures. Nonetheless, from Experiment 2, it is clear that there is no compensation of oxygen consumption rates evident between the summer and winter temperatures. If we consider parameters other than just the oxygen consumption for which we do have measurements at intermediate temperatures, i.e. Experiment 1s monthly measurements of BRI, valve closure duration and frequency and locomotory speed, we can see from the R\u2013T plot linear regression parameters that there is only slight evidence of partial compensation for BRI and inverse compensation of locomotion, while valve closure behaviour was not compensated.

Working through a hierarchy of biological functions, an animal will progressively switch off less essential functions as oxygen supply and consumption become more limited. The first to go are lipid and carbohydrate storage, then reproduction and growth, followed by activity and finally homeostatic maintenance (Sokolova et al., 2012; Sokolova, 2013). What is neglected here is the process of feeding, which can come at a considerable energetic cost, provoking a significant increase in metabolic rate in bivalves (Lurman et al., 2013). Thus, we would expect that feeding would be one of the first processes, along with storage, that would be switched off, although in winter this may occur in response to a restricted food supply (see below). Much more work needs to be done to determine whether this model can be equally applied to acclimatization processes in A. anatina and other animals, or whether all biological processes are downregulated/upregulated to the same degree as a result of decreasing/increasing temperature, such that the entire system is thermodynamically driven, or whether less essential biological functions are switched off in winter.

Given that this species is in a temperate zone and experiences wide seasonal thermal variation as well as temperature fluctuations across days (rather than hours), current theory would suggest it should be highly plastic between seasons. These are all the conditions where we would expect thermal plasticity to evolve (Gabriel and Lynch, 1992; Angilletta, 2009). So, why do they not acclimatize? In short, because there is no evolutionary pressure to do so as the costs may outweigh the benefits. As exemplified by fishes, the primary factor driving thermal compensation is predation. A fish is either a predator or prey. In either case, it is of obvious advantage to maintain locomotory performance. Consequently, cold acclimation typically leads to compensation of a suite of biological processes that ultimately affect locomotion (e.g. Johnston and Temple, 2002; Woytanowski and Coughlin, 2013). Changes typically include alterations in the energy production machinery either at a molecular level, taking the form of alterations in enzyme isoform expression and membrane lipid compensation, or at the cellular level, with changes in mitochondrial volume density (Sidell, 1983; Johnston et al., 1998; Guderley, 2004b; Abele, 2012). In the muscle itself, there can be changes in ion channel function (McArdle and Johnston, 1982; Godiksen and Jessen, 2002) as well as changes in muscle fibre protein composition (Johnston and Temple, 2002; Tattersall et al., 2012) and recruitment order (Rome, 1990; Catal\u00e1n et al., 2004). At a physiological level, there are also changes in cardiac function (Keen and Farrell, 1994; Lurman et al., 2012).

What is more, even if they were, they would have no chance of outrunning a predator given that their maximal \u2018walking\u2019 speed is less than 1 cm min\u22121 between 20 and 26\u00b0C. Indeed the best strategy they can, and indeed do, adopt is to simply shut their valves and wait for any predator to leave. In light of this, the longer a mussel can stay closed, the better. The consequence of which is that their metabolic rates are kept as low as possible. Moreover, these mussels are not active predators and compensation of locomotory rates to enable prey capture is equally unnecessary, and with respect to keeping the metabolic rate low, also of potential disadvantage. If they want to increase their feeding rate they must simply increase filtration rates, as seen in other bivalves (Thompson and Bayne, 1972; Riisg\u00e5rd et al., 2003). However, given that algal concentrations in freshwater bodies are generally low in winter months, there is little reason to increase filtration rates. Thus, being neither predator nor prey, there is little for A. anatina to gain by increasing locomotory ability, as the increased metabolic rate would reduce their ability to close their valves when under threat, i.e. the costs must outweigh the benefits.",
        "example_response": "Adopt valve closure as the primary defensive strategy to avoid predation. Keep metabolic rates as low as possible by remaining inactive when threatened. Increase feeding rate by raising filtration rates rather than locomotory activity.

        "reasoning": "The paragraph discusses the behavior and metabolic strategies of the mussel species A. anatina. It highlights that these mussels are not preyed upon in their natural setting and have a very low 'walking' speed. Their primary defense mechanism is to shut their valves and wait for predators to leave. The longer they can stay closed, the lower their metabolic rates, which is beneficial for their survival. Additionally, they are not active predators, so there is no need for them to increase their locomotory rates to capture prey. Increasing filtration rates to enhance feeding is also not necessary during winter months due to low algal concentrations. Therefore, there is little advantage for A. anatina to increase their locomotory ability, as the increased metabolic rate would reduce their ability to close their valves when under threat.",

There is a clear demonstrable advantage where short-term exposure to very high or low, but non-lethal temperatures can result in a favourable shift in the upper or lower critical temperature, respectively, while other physiological and performance characteristics remain unchanged (Hoffmann, 1995). One study recently found that acclimation can have an (albeit minimal) affect on the upper critical thermal maximum in North American freshwater mussels, with an increase of 1\u20132\u00b0C following acclimation seen in two of three species tested (Galbraith et al., 2012).

It inhabits a relatively stable thermal environment (in the short-term when compared with the marine intertidal), where temperature changes are slow. We suggest that these two factors serve as selective pressures for these mussels to not compensate behaviour or metabolic rate. Because their only predator avoidance mechanism is to close their valves, combined with the fact that they are subject to considerable seasonal fluctuations in food supplies, they instead simply allow their behaviour and metabolic rate to fluctuate at the behest of the seasons. Given the 500 million year fossil record for bivalves, this is most clearly an ecologically and evolutionary successful strategy that needs to be further explored and more explicitly considered in acclimation/acclimatization models.",

The total bio- mass was highest at St. 3 and lowest at St. 1. Generally, there were decreasing trends in biomass during the study period. An unusually high value was recorded at\nSt. 2 in June due to the contribution of Ulva sp. and\nCodium sp. Ulva sp. and Pachymeniopsis sp. showed cov- erage values of 22.5-95% and 10-27.5%, respectively.\nUndaria pinnatipida and Sargassum sp. appeared with coverage of 5% to 46.7% during winter season and species of Gelidium, Chondrus, Lomentaria, Hizikia (now considered as a Sargassum sp.), and Gigartina were iden- tified with 5-20% of coverage.\nThe concentration of total dissolved inorganic nitrogen\n(DIN; NO3\n+) and phosphate varied among sampling sites. The concentrations of DIN were\nFig. 2. Conceptual model representing the uptake/growth and harvest of a biofilter/production system. high at St. 1 excepted in February (Fig. 4A). The phos- phate remained low at 1 \u00b5g \u00b7 l\u20131 except in January and\nMay (Fig. 4B).\nThe tissue nitrogen content of seaweeds was highest at\nSt. 1 (average = 4.75%), where DIN was highest. Those of\nSt. 2 and St. 3 averaged 3.13% and 2.65%, respectively\n(Fig. 5A). The tissue nitrogen contents of Porphyra were up to 5.7% (5.4 \u00b1 0.26%) of dry wt and showed highest value among seaweeds tested. Sargassum spp.,\nEnteromorpha spp., and Undaria spp. showed 4.7%, 4.6%, and 4.2% of tissue nitrogen contents, respectively, in the winter season. The nitrogen contents of green, brown and red algae were average of 3.18%, 2.91% and 3.42%, respectively. In brown and red algae, the tissue nitrogen contents decreased during the period of study. However, the green algae, most of them were Ulva spp., showed large fluctuations (Fig. 5B).\nThere was a positive correlation between the tissue nitrogen content and seawater DIN.  The correlation analysis showed the hyperbolic function seemed a better fit with higher correlation coefficient than those of the linear function; therefore, the rates of nitrogen accumula- tion in seaweed tissue seemed to reach maximum at higher DIN in seawater at over 600 \u00b5g\u00b7l\u20131 (Fig. 6). This pattern was also found in Ulva spp. (Fig. 7).\nPorphyra and Ulva showed four to six times higher rates of short-term NH4\n+ uptake than other red algal species tested in this study (Table 1). Based on the values of NH4\n+ uptake rates and growth, production and har- vest information, the efficiency of NH4\n+ removal of\nPorphyra was estimated. The model predicted that more than 17% of ammonium would be removed from the continuous supply of 100 \u00b5mol \u00b7 l\u20131 NH4\n+ at 100 l \u00b7 sec\u20131 flow rate with conditions described in the precious sec- tion.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\nThe algal coverage data showed that the green alga\nUlva sp. could be regarded as a green tide, especially in\nJune.

Fundamentally, the growth of marine algae in a given ecosystem should be proportional to the rate of supply of nutrients, temperature, light, and water motion (Schramm 1999; Smith et al. 1999). Therefore, the control of eutrophication should be accomplished by restricting the loading of key nutrients to the ecosystem.\nDeliberate nutrient loading reductions indeed have led to dramatic improvements in several areas in Japan (e.g.,\nSmith et al. 1999).\nThe total nutrient load from aquaculture in an open system may be very small in comparison with other",

Seaweed cultivation can act as a nutrient scrubber system; integrated aquaculture of seaweeds with fish (or other forms of fed aquaculture) maybe one of the most reasonable means for bioremediating coastal waters\n(McVey et al. 2002).\nThe tissue nitrogen contents of Porphyra and Ulva species showed ranges of values similar to those report- ed in other studies. The nitrogen contents of Porphyra were over 5% and that of Ulva was above 4%. For those species with cover greater than 10%, red algae had high- er average tissue N than brown algae (though the differ- ence was not significant). Red algae may have higher potential values due to their photosynthetic pigments\n(N-containing phycobiliproteins) and protein levels.\nTissue nitrogen contents increased with increased con- centration of dissolved nitrogen in seawater (Figs 6, 7).\nThe internal tissue nitrogen content is thought to be the complex results of the interactions among the external environment, uptake kinetics, assimilation, growth and reproductive processes (e.g. Hanisak 1983). The hyper- bolic correlation between tissue nitrogen and DIN in sea- water could be speculated as the result of hyperbolic\nFig. 5.

Tissue nitrogen content of Gracilaria was also correlated with nutrient availability (Jones et al.\nPorphyra tenera, which has been cultivated from the beginning of Porphyra cultivation in Korea, showed the highest rate of NH4\n+ uptake (3.4 \u00b5mol \u00b7 g dw\u20131\u00b7 min\u20131 at\n150 \u00b5M) and nitrogen content (over 5%). The rate of uptake was a kind of surge uptake and may be higher than the accumulation uptake (Pedersen and Borum\n1997). The values of Pophyra serriata and Ulva pertusa were slightly lower than that of P. tenera but four to five times higher rates than those of other species tested\n(Table 1). Although the present experiments were not designed to analyze the rate of NH4\n+ uptake according to the per surface area basis nor the ratio of surface area to volume, the values were similar to those reports of\nPorphyra and Ulva (Pedersen and Borum 1997; Taylor et al. 1998).\nSeveral taxa such as Ulva, Gracilaria, Laminaria, and\nPorphyra have been investigated from different research groups (e.g., Chopin et al. 2001). The values of uptake rates in the present study were in the same range of other studies. Wallentinus (1984) found Enteromorpha sp. and Cladophora sp. showed about 2 \u00b5mol \u00b7 g dw\u20131\u00b7 min\u20131 at 60 \u00b5M NH4\n+. Taylor et al. (1999) reported Ulva sp. exhibited about 2.0 \u00b5mol \u00b7g dw\u20131\u00b7 min\u20131 and Porphyra sp. was about 4 \u00b5mol\u00b7g dw\u20131\u00b7 min\u20131 at 100 \u00b5M NH4\n+. Other studies on the rate of NH4\n+ uptake showed different val- ues. Subandar et al. (1993) reported the rates of NH4\n+ uptake ranged between 0.1 and 0.4 \u00b5mol \u00b7 g dw\u20131\u00b7 min\u20131 in Laminaria saccharina using salmon farm effluent of 6.225.4 \u00b5mol NH4\n+\u00b7 l\u20131 in continuous flow",

This conservative estimate is about half of the removal potential compared with the estimates of Chopin et al. (1999).  If higher uptake rates and stocking densities were applied, the efficiency could increase up to 50% in our model. However, the self- shading effects and circulation factors (such as flow and mixing rate) should be considered with increasing stock- ing densities (Cohen and Neori 1991; Quian et al. 1995;\nNelson et al. 2001).\nPrevious studies showed the range of 10 to 90% of nitrogen removal efficiency in polyculture systems.  Ulva lactuca removed 40-90% depending on NH4\n+ supply\n(Cohen and Neori 1991) and up to 85% in study of\nVadermuelen and Gordin (1990).

Laminaria saccharina removed 26-40% of incoming dissolved nitrogen from salmon farm efflu- ent (Subandar et al. 1993).\nThe ultimate goal of this study is to develop a strategy for the sustainability of aquaculture in the coastal ecosystem based on the sound ecological and economic principles (Newkirk 1996). There are many conflicts among the users of coastal waters, and aquaculture should be conducted under a plan of integrated coastal zone management with a balance between \u2018extractive\u2019 and \u2018fed\u2019 aquaculture (McVey et al. 2002; Rawson et al.\n2002). The results of this preliminary study seem very promising, because the biology of the proposed species are well studied and the economic value of some are also high; nevertheless, more complete information should be obtained to expand integrated aquaculture systems\n(Troell et al. 1999; Harrison and Hurd 2001). Based on this study, a site-specific year-round system will be established depending on culture type, species, local hydrodynamic and other environmental factors.\nMoreover, monitoring and regulation of aquaculture systems need to be based upon carrying capacity models of each area, if there will be sustainable aquaculture along the Korean coastal zone (Fernandes et al. 2000,",

Parents should know that exposure to prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoking is associated with different adverse outcomes and that tobacco smoking is one of the most preventable causes of infant morbidity and mortality [52]. However, breastfeeding is the best way of infant feeding even if a mother doesn\u2019t quit smoking during lactation [49]. Amal- gamating results from different studies, this paper could be a useful tool to educate and increase awareness about adverse health effects of parental tobacco smoking for children. Additionally, it could be a starting point for the conception of new health promotion and public health campaigns that emphasize the importance of parental smoking cessation.\nAbbreviations\nBMI: body mass index; BP: blood pressure; CO: carbon monoxide; COX: cytochrome c oxidase; DHA: docosahexaenoic acid; HRV: heart rate variability;\nLBW: low birth weight; LC-PUFA: long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids; SGA: small for gestational age; SIDS: sudden infant death syndrome; TH: T-helper.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nGB had primary responsibility for manuscript management, and contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

The number of fires increased progressively in the dry period as the dry period progressed. Fires in the starting month of the dry period (June) contributed only 1.24% of the total number of fires, but fires at the end of the dry period (October) contributes more than 39% of the total fire number. More than 88% of fires occurred in the dry period, strongly suggesting a coupling of the dry period and fire occurrences in the MRP area.\nFig. 8 shows that the fire season in MRP area started from the end of July when fires occur intensively with more than 4 fires/day in average. The peak of the fire season tends to start from the middle of August and ends at the start of November when large fires occur intensively with more than 26 fires/day in average. Fires in the peak fire period were 2938 or around 87.1% of the annual number of fires in the MRP area. Thus, based on the data here we suggest the middle of August as both the peak of the dry period and the start of the peak of the fire season.\nFig. 9 shows that the peat fire occurrences in the\nMRP area coincide with the precipitation curve. Daily precipitation decreased gradually from June and reached the lowest point in the middle of August, creating the necessary dry conditions for fires to ignite. Then, fires start to occur on a daily basis from the middle of June and become numerous from the end of July, making the end\nFig. 7.

The fire period peaks from the middle of August when daily precipitation drops below the lowest mean value, less than 3 mm. This is caused as fires spread rapidly when they take hold in dry surface biomass and dry peat\n(Frandsen 1997).\nThe fire season ended at the start of November or about ten days after the end of the dry season at the end of October. This may indicate that peat in the MRP area is still in the dry condition at the beginning of the wet period, after suffering from the severe dry conditions of the long dry period, thus maintaining conditions where ignition may easily occur.\nThe above conditions of the peat fire season in the\nMRP area are present in both in El Ni\u00f1o years and non-El\nNi\u00f1o years (Fig. 10).

The number of fires increases as the dry period progresses, with over 39% of fires occurring in October.\n3. The fire season coincides with the precipitation curve, with daily precipitation reaching its lowest point in mid-August, creating dry conditions conducive to fires.\n4.

Further, the TNR in the dry periods of\n2000 to 2006 all exceeded 100, indicating that; recently, a severely dry period has become an annual occurrence in\nPalangkaraya. There is an exception in 2007 which suffered from an exceptionally large rainfall all of the year due to a La Ni\u00f1a event. Thus, this study clearly showed a positive correlation between Ni\u00f1o 3.4 SST Anomalies and both of TNR and MNR (Fig. 6); indicating that the recent severe dry conditions in Palangkaraya are closely related with positive Ni\u00f1o 3.4 SST Anomaly occurrences.\nHotspots or fires in the MRP area numbered 7017,\n4618, and 2052 in the dry periods of the El Ni\u00f1o years\n2006, 2004, and 2002, respectively (Fig. 7). The large number of hotspots showed that peat fires in the MRP area are more common in El Ni\u00f1o years. Murdiyarso and\nAdiningsih (2006) showed the role of the El Ni\u00f1o\nSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) in providing dry weather inducing biomass burning and widespread fires. However, there were more than 1,500 fires in the dry period (June to October) of the non El Ni\u00f1o years of 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005 when the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 SST Anomalies were between\n\u00baC and 0.3\n\u00baC, indicating that recently a large number of fires is strongly correlated with positive Ni\u00f1o 3.4 SST\nAnomalies, even when the values are low positive ones.\nThe peat fire occurrence graph for the MRP area\n(Fig. 8) clearly shows that intermittent fires occur in the wet season but that fires are much more intense in the\nAverage Ni\u00f1o 3.4 SST Anomalies (0C)\nNumber of days\nPalangkaraya\nTNR\nMNR\nFig. 6.
