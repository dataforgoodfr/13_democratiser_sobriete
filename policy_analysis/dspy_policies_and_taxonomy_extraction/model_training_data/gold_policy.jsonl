{"question": "5. Conclusions Our study assessed the impacts of climate variables and droughts in the Orinoco River Basin using a combination of Earth observation data and surface observations. Our key findings include the following: i. El Niño events worsen the region’s drought conditions, while Atlantic SST variability has less influence. ii. Long-term surface warming trends increase the evapotranspiration demand, aggravating drought conditions. However, vegetation greenness remains high despite high surface temperatures, suggesting that temperature alone does not significantly affect vegetation phenology and root zone water reserves. A sustained rainfall deficit is necessary to cause observable changes in the vegetation and soil conditions. iii.

For instance, we did not analyze the couplings between atmospheric and oceanic modes of variability and the changes that occur at different time scales in the biophysical variables of the basin during the presence of dry conditions. Moreover, we did not consider other drought indices that could provide complementary information on different aspects of drought severity and duration.

{"question": "Conclusion The aim of the current study was to investigate whether students’ gender and minority background were moderators of teacher expectation effects for mathematics outcomes as well as self-concept and subjective task value in the mathematics domain. This study adds to the current knowledge base by empirically studying moderator effects of both gender and minority background. Additionally, whereas previous research mostly investigated self-concept only, we investigated the association between teacher expectations and students’ self-concept as well as their subjective task values (intrinsic and utility value).", "response": "Investigate whether students’ gender and minority background moderate teacher expectation effects for mathematics outcomes.

{"question": "Research question 1 Regarding the first research question, in line with societal stereotypes and after controlling for students’ beginning-of-year mathematics achievement, teacher expectations were higher for Asian and lower for Māori, compared with NZ European students. These findings are in line with previous research in the same context (Turner et al., 2015), but also corroborate findings from other educational systems that teachers differentiate in their expectations based on students’ minority background (e.g., Glock & Krolak-Schwerdt, 2013; Tenenbaum & Ruck, 2007; Timmermans et al., 2015, 2018). However, contrary to the expected stereotypes, expectations within the domain of mathematics were higher for girls than for boys. This finding is inconsistent with earlier research as it has also been found that, in line with stereotypes, girls have been the target of low expectations in mathematics (Jussim et al., 1996). However, there is also some evidence (Jaremus et al., 2020) that expectations for girls and boys in mathematics at the elementary and middle school level are less differentiated (e.g., Gentrup & Rjosk, 2018) and that it is at higher levels of schooling (secondary and tertiary) where teachers tend to have higher expectations for boys in the STEM fields. Perhaps, this finding is a reflection of teachers more often disapproving of boys’ classroom behavior, causing boys generally to be perceived as academically poorer students (e.g., Bennett et al., 1993; Harlen, 2005; Hecht & Greenfield, 2002; Kenney-Benson et al., 2006). Moreover, the New Zealand public have been made aware of societal stereotypes related to girls in STEM and how greater numbers of girls need to be encouraged into these fields (e.g., https://www.curiousminds.nz/actions/community/womenand- girls/). It may be that this information has led teachers to more carefully consider the capabilities of girls in mathematics. All in all, these findings suggest that for students with comparable levels of achievement in the mathematics domain, teachers may hold different expectations because of their gender or ethnicity.", "response": "Encourage teachers to hold equitable expectations for students in mathematics regardless of gender. Encourage teachers to hold equitable expectations for students in mathematics regardless of ethnicity. Increase awareness among teachers about societal stereotypes in STEM to ensure fair assessment of students’ capabilities."}
{"question": "Moreover, after controlling for background variables and beginning-of-year achievement, student self-concept and, to a lesser extent, interest in mathematics were associated with teachers’ expectations. This implies that teachers base their expectations on a wider range of student characteristics than just achievement and demographic background (Timmermans et al., 2016, 2019). Teachers’ expectations for the academic achievement of elementary school students have been found to be positively related to students’ perceived assertiveness, independence (Alvridez & Weinstein, 1999; Bonvin & Genoud 2006; Rubie-Davies, 2010), selfconfidence (Driessen, 2006; Rubie-Davies, 2010), and self-concept (Upadyaya & Eccles, 2015). These studies have indicated that teachers tend to have higher expectations of a student they perceive of as independent, more confident, or with a greater self-concept. Although it is generally assumed that teachers use these student attributes in shaping their expectations (e.g.,Rubie-Davies, 2008), the empirical evidence is still rather limited. The current finding therefore presents an important addition to the limited evidence base.", "response": "Base teachers’ expectations on a wider range of student characteristics beyond achievement and demographic background. Consider students’ perceived assertiveness, independence, self-confidence, and self-concept when forming expectations for academic achievement."}
{"question": "Research question 2 Regarding the second research question, teachers’ beginning-year expectations were predictive of achievement and self-concept of students at end-of-year. For mathematics achievement, these findings correspond to numerous studies showing that differential expectations are confirmed in generally small to moderate self-fulfilling prophecies in various academic domains (e.g., Jussim & Harber 2005; Rubie-Davies 2008; Tenenbaum & Ruck, 2007; Wang et al., 2018). The finding that beginning-of-year teacher expectations are not only predictive of achievement but also of students’ self-concept is an important contribution for two reasons. First, many previous studies have failed to take initial self-concept into account; therefore, it has remained largely unknown whether the reported positive associations were spurious. Second, children’s perceptions of themselves affect their motivation and subsequent behavior (Bandura, 1986; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Harter, 1983; Marsh, 1990). The finding that teacher expectations are predictive of later student self-concept is in line with Expectancy-Value Theory (Eccles, 1983). It seems that the teachers’ expectations serve as an evaluation of a significant other (e.g., Bong & Skaalvik, 2003; Gniewosz et al., 2014; Shavelson et al., 1976), and when felt and regarded as support and acceptance by students, these expectations lead the student to evaluate themselves more positively (Liu & Wang, 2008).", "response": "Set high beginning-of-year expectations for students to positively influence their end-ofyear achievement. Maintain positive expectations for students to enhance their end-of-year self-concept. Consider children’s initial self-concept when evaluating the effects of teacher expectations. Use teacher expectations as a form of support and acceptance to improve students’ selfevaluation."}
{"question": "Previous research had shown positive correlations between teacher expectations and subjective task values, as expectations were positively related to utility value (e.g., Benner & Mistry, 2007; Boerma et al., 2016; Gilbert et al., 2014; Lazarides and Watt, 2015) and intrinsic value (Woolley et al., 2010). The current study, however, failed to find this association. Various methodological differences may account for the difference in findings. Some prior studies tested this association in a different or combined subject domains (Benner & Mistry, 2007; Boerma et al., 2016), or included students’ perceptions of teacher expectations instead of teacher ratings (Gilbert et al., 2014; Lazarides & Watt, 2015; Woolley et al., 2010). Furthermore, all studies above are based on data collections in which teacher expectations and task values were collected at a single moment. Perhaps, once controlled for beginning-of-year levels of intrinsic and utility value, teacher expectations are not strong enough to predict intrinsic and utility value about 8 months later. Alternatively, although it may be assumed that attitudes of socializers (i.e., teachers) affect students’ subjective task values (Wigfield & Eccles, 1992, 2000), this perhaps holds for other teacher attitudes but potentially does not include teachers’ performance expectations.", "response": "Consider methodological differences when evaluating the relationship between teacher expectations and students’ subjective task values.Account for differences in subject domains when assessing the effect of teacher expectations on task values.Include both teacher ratings and students’ perceptions of teacher expectations in studies of subjective task values.Collect data on teacher expectations and task values at multiple time points to properly evaluate longitudinal effects.Control for beginning-of-year levels of intrinsic and utility value when assessing the predictive effect of teacher expectations."}
{"question": "Research question 3 Regarding the third research question, we expected that gender and minority background would moderate the effects of teacher expectations on mathematics performance (e.g., Boerma et al., 2016; McKown & Weinstein, 2002), with larger effects of expectations for stigmatized groups (girls in mathematics, students with minority backgrounds). In the current study, we did not find evidence for moderation effects of gender and minority background, which implies that, at least in the current sample, the effects of teacher expectations were of roughly similar magnitude for various student groups.", "response": "Maintain consistent teacher expectations for all student groups, regardless of gender or minority background. Do not assume that teacher expectations have larger effects for stigmatized groups in mathematics performance."}
{"question": "Strengths and limitations In interpreting the results of this study, a number of strengths and limitations need to be considered. Many available studies investigating the association between teacher expectations and subsequent student self-concept and task values have failed to control for measures of current levels of achievement and self-concept. It is therefore not possible from these studies to disentangle teacher expectation effects on these outcomes from potentially higher initial expectations for more confident, efficacious, or interested students (Timmermans et al., 2016). A major strength of the current study was the design with measures at both the beginning and end-of-school year and therefore the possibility to control for beginning-of-year ratings of students’ self-concept and task values. Therefore, the association that higher teacher expectations at beginning-of-year are predictive of greater self-concept at end-of-year and of the absence of an association with end-of-year intrinsic and utility value is possibly a more reliable and robust finding than that of earlier studies. Nevertheless, we cannot infer general conclusions about causal effects of teacher expectations as a potential important confounder may have been omitted from the multilevel models.", "response": "Control for beginning-of-year student achievement and self-concept when evaluating the effects of teacher expectations. Measure teacher expectations at the beginning of the school year to predict student selfconcept at the end of the year.

{"question": "Moreover, the sample of the study consisted of 1663 students and their teachers from three intermediate schools in the geographical Auckland area. Although the sample was of reasonable size at the student (n = 1663) and teacher (n = 42) level, the number of participating schools is rather small. Nevertheless, in the selection of the three participating intermediate schools, variation in student population in relation to socioeconomic status was explicitly considered. For future research, it would be beneficial to assess the generalizability of these associations using samples consisting of more schools. Moreover, it remains worthwhile to replicate this study in various contexts, educational systems (outside the Auckland area), and for different age groups, in order to investigate the generalizability of the findings.", "response": "Consider variation in student population in relation to socioeconomic status when selecting schools for studies.

{"question": "5. Conclusions This study presented a consolidated framework for the vulnerability assessment of rural communities by indicating that rural–urban linkages are crucial in influencing flood vulnerability. To do so, this paper presented a thorough review of the concept of vulnerability, its components, and conceptual frameworks, as well as the examination of terms “rural” and “urban”, interaction theories, and a general understanding of rural–urban linkages. Theories and conceptual frameworks facilitated to identify factors that drive variation in rural–urban linkages and flood vulnerability. The review suggested that rural– urban linkages can be essential in influencing vulnerability of flood-prone rural communitieswhich have not been given attention in previous conceptual frameworks. Thus, rural vulnerability to floods should not be studied in isolation, rather its relationship with urban areas is important to consider. It should not only be defined by the internal characteristics of its residents but also by considering the changing rural–urban interactions. Thus, rural– urban linkages may also provide an opportunity to reduce vulnerability of rural communities. The framework highlights to understand the multi-dimensional, differential, and dynamic nature of vulnerability and rural–urban linkages, the interaction between them, as well as the driving forces that shape the overall flood vulnerability of rural communities. Further, the role of city size and proximity is identified as an important research gap which is widely neglected in the discourse of flood vulnerability and could be imperative for improved understanding of rural vulnerability. The framework is useful for application at the local level in developing countries. It provides multiple and broad aspects for investigation and hence can be applied in any flood-affected rural area by using their context-specific information. For example, socioeconomic, physical, institutional factors differ spatially and temporally and so are the flows. Moreover, the framework is not limited to flooding (even though the discussion revolves around flood hazards) and can be a vade mecum for other hazards considering their character and scope of impacts. For example, droughts or extreme temperatures may not affect physical infrastructure in the same way as flooding and thus linkages as well as resulting vulnerability. In this context, the framework can guide factors and the nature of influence on linkages to examine vulnerability for other hazards and propose vulnerability and risk reduction measures accordingly. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed framework can be evaluated and validated through empirical investigations. The framework is flexible and allows both qualitative and quantitative assessment of overall vulnerability based on the dynamics of rural–urban linkages. It gives freedom to develop area and hazard specific indicators and looks at overall vulnerability from the holistic and integrated perspective. Moreover, various methodological and analytical frameworks can be developed depending on different disciplines. The proposed framework has its limitations, it only considers rural areas as flood-prone and vulnerable and does not underscore how changing linkages and resulting vulnerability can indirectly affect urban areas/cities and vice versa. Moreover, urban–rural interrelationships and their related issues may vary across various regions of the world. The paper endorses that rural–urban linkages must be incorporated into vulnerability assessments of rural communities. The proposed framework can support disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation of rural communities by highlighting the role of cities on which rural population depends. Considering this, in addition to rural areas, necessary measures can be developed to enhance the capacities of cities so that they can support rural areas. In this context, better information delivery mechanisms, short- and long-term employment opportunities in cities, controlling price inflation, the smooth and continuous supply of goods and services, intelligent investment decisions in the reconstruction and rehabilitation phase will be the relevant areas for policymaking to strengthen linkages, curtail vulnerability, and reduce disaster risk. Finally, the framework can be a useful tool in increasing awareness among disaster managers, regional planners, and policymakers at the local and regional levels regarding the complex and dynamic nature of vulnerability. It also calls to bring professionals from different fields—especially from climate change and disaster risk as well as regional and rural development planning communities—to coordinate and work together to gain an accurate understanding of rural–urban linkages and associated factors that determine flood vulnerability. It helps to prioritize the potential areas of intervention and delineate proper plans to support rural–urban linkages and reduce flood vulnerability as indicated earlier. The proposed framework contributes to recognize priority 1 of SFDRR, SDGs (goal 11 and 13), and a new urban agenda through enhanced understanding of vulnerability by suggesting the importance of linkages and facilitating the link between spatial planning and vulnerability discourse.", "response": "Incorporate rural–urban linkages into flood vulnerability assessments of rural communities.

{"question": "5. Conclusion When the case studies are examined, it is seen that economic, social and environmental constraints affect the solution. On the other hand, protecting the environment for future generations and efficient use of resources can be stated as a summary of environmental sustainability. Economic activities should not threaten natural ecosystems with limited resources and capacity. In this context, logistics centres, which save energy and resource use in the location selection model within the scope of green ports, are an important solution alternative for regions disadvantaged in terms of air pollution, traffic congestion and emissions. Thanks to the consolidation and connection of low-emission transport modes to be provided by logistics centres, greenhouse gas emissions caused by transportation and transportation activities will be reduced.", "response": "Select logistics centre locations within green port planning to save energy and resource use. Use logistics centres to consolidate and connect low-emission transport modes."}
{"question": "Based on the findings obtained, the criteria that will guide the construction of a new port can be reached from the said port investigations. As a matter of fact, while it cannot be expected that a port will have all the criteria at the same time, all of the port preference criteria have similar importance weights. In particular, the difference between port location, port fees and port infrastructure criteria is around 1.5%. This showed that there is no indispensable criterion for the selection of the main port within the scope of the study, and that all criteria must be found in the main port concept in a relationship. The importance weight of the proximity to the market and hinterland criteria was found to be 23.6%. Because proximity to the market and hinterland are related to how full the ship can leave the port at a point or how close it is to customer or industry needs. This criterion has been found to be the most important port selection criterion in many studies in the literature on port selection and the order of importance of port criteria. Right after this comes the port location criterion. This criterion is a criterion that directly affects the operational cost of the ship. The location of the port must give the ship a minimum deviation from its main course. At the same time, this criterion is closely related to proximity to the market and hinterland. As it can be understood from here, due to the technical and financial extra costs of the green port implementation, as well as the sanction burden of the green port implementation legislation, the location and proximity to the market criteria are much more decisive than ecological factors in the selection of the port establishment location.", "response": "Construct new ports using criteria derived from port investigations.

{"question": "On the other hand, when the relevant literature is evaluated; It can be said that there are few studies on which criteria should be considered in order for ports to receive green port certification, and besides, very different criteria are considered in these studies, that is, there is no unity. When this literature is examined in general; it can be said that the criteria of air pollution, water pollution, energy management and waste management come to the fore. It is natural for these criteria to come to the fore, as environmental issues are primarily considered in almost every sector that aims to alleviate the intensity of pollution, which is increasing day by day. In future studies, the potential of ports to be green ports can be evaluated. From this point of view, it can be suggested as a suggestion for ports that do not have green port certification to consider successful green port examples as role models. In addition, it can be said that the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (AHP, VIKOR, TOPSIS, ELECTRE etc.) techniques will give more accurate results, since it is a subject that requires consideration of both numerical and non-numerical criteria for studies to evaluate green port performances. In this context, it can be stated as another suggestion that ports should perform benefit, opportunity, cost and risk analysis and this can be resolved by the Analytical Network Process-Benefit, Opportunity, Cost and Risk (ANP-BOCR) method. In addition, the DEMATEL Method, which is frequently used in considering the relationships between the criteria, may be one of the techniques that researchers may prefer. However, it can be stated that the studies are generally published in journals such as \"\"The Asian Journal of Shipping and Logistics, Transportation Research Part and Research in Transportation Business & Management and that researchers may turn to these journals. As a result, the ever-decreasing resources and increasing pollution have brought the concept of sustainability to a more important dimension. The concept of sustainability, which is based on meeting the needs of the present generation without ignoring the needs of future generations, has made the ecological environment a priority and a demanded criterion in almost every sector. Green port and green logistics activities aiming to protect the environment can be given as examples. In this context, when environmental sustainability awareness is considered, the necessity of increasing the number of studies related to it emerges.", "response": "Consider air pollution, water pollution, energy management and waste management criteria when working toward green port certification.

{"question": "The findings of this study demonstrate that distance of human dwellings to irrigated agriculture influences indoor Anopheles mosquito abundance and risk of malaria infection despite intensive malaria control and bed net usage. Further, this study reveals important effects of socioeconomics on malaria epidemiology; there is a linear relationship between the household wealth index and malaria risk. As the number and sizes of irrigation schemes expand in Malawi and the sub-Saharan region to boost economic growth and mitigate food insecurity concerns, it becomes important to consider how these types of economic improvements could affect malaria risk, particularly for those living in close proximity to irrigated sites. Appropriate control measures to curb malaria transmission enhanced by irrigated sites is imperative. It is important to maximize impact of available malaria control by ensuring adequate LLIN coverage and access to prompt treatment. Other additional measures may include larval source reduction through careful water resource management and larviciding of larval habitats, and indoor residual spray of insecticide for households near irrigation schemes among others. Future studies are needed to evaluate the impact of a community-led implementation of these control strategies on larval and adult vector abundance and malaria risk within irrigated agroecosystems.", "response": "Ensure adequate LLIN coverage and access to prompt malaria treatment to maximize the impact of existing malaria control.

{"question": "5 Conclusion Strict environmental regulations and EU targets aimed at decreasing the level of CO2 emissions have placed the electrification of the transport system at the centre of policy attention.

{"question": "The results show that the current grid might be unable to deal with the increasing load of PHEVs. Under the fixed price and time of use rate, a new peak will emerge in the late evening and this peak in many cases is higher than the existing peak without PHEVs. Therefore, there is a great possibility of congestion in the network, loss of voltage and frequency, and ultimately black outs. A similar situation holds for the controlled off peak charging under time of use rate. In comparison with uncontrolled charging, time of use rate does not provide a lower peak demand and it only decreases the duration of peak. These results suggest that even controlled off peak charging has a limited capacity and cannot be accounted as a comprehensive solution to the problem of PHEVs load.", "response": "Avoid relying on fixed electricity prices and time-of-use rates for PHEV charging because they create new evening peak loads. Avoid using controlled off-peak charging under time-of-use rates as a primary strategy for managing PHEV load. Do not treat time-of-use rate structures as a sufficient solution for reducing peak electricity demand from PHEV charging. Avoid relying on uncontrolled PHEV charging due to its potential to create network congestion, voltage and frequency losses, and blackouts."}
{"question": "However, the simulation results show that real time pricing in the smart grid environment will not deteriorate the current peak demand. Instead, the smart grid effectively distributes the demand over the off peak period. In winter, when the system reliability concerns increase, it can be seen that no new peak emerges. Similarly, in the summer the maximum demand including PHEVs is lower than the existing peak demand without PHEVs. Therefore, by the aid of demand response in the smart grid environment, accommodating a huge number of PHEVs becomes technically and economically feasible.", "response": "Implement real-time pricing in the smart grid environment to distribute demand over the off-peak period.

{"question": "There was a very clear effect of seasonal temperature change on the burrowing rate, valve closure behaviour and locomotory speed in A. anatina. In addition, stark differences were seen in the oxygen consumption rates between summer- and winter-acclimatized A. anatina. We found only very limited evidence of thermal compensation. We are unaware of any data relating the behaviours we studied to temperature change; however, a comparison of previously published data examining the effects of temperature change on oxygen consumption from a range of bivalves is possible. Evidence from a number of marine (Newell and Pye, 1970a; Newell and Pye, 1970b; Widdows, 1973; Newell et al., 1977; Pernet et al., 2007; Resgalla et al., 2007; Pernet et al., 2008; Riascos et al., 2012) and freshwater (Hornbach et al., 1983; Baker and Hornbach, 2001; Alexander and McMahon, 2004) bivalve species indicates that bivalves compensate oxygen consumption rates at intermediate, and in some species, higher temperatures, while there is no evidence of compensation at lower temperatures. As our primary interest was the difference between summer- and winter-acclimatized mussels, we did not measure oxygen consumption rates in A. anatina at intermediate temperatures as well, and cannot conclusively say whether A. anatina partially compensates oxygen consumption at intermediate temperatures. Nonetheless, from Experiment 2, it is clear that there is no compensation of oxygen consumption rates evident between the summer and winter temperatures. If we consider parameters other than just the oxygen consumption for which we do have measurements at intermediate temperatures, i.e. Experiment 1s monthly measurements of BRI, valve closure duration and frequency and locomotory speed, we can see from the R–T plot linear regression parameters that there is only slight evidence of partial compensation for BRI and inverse compensation of locomotion, while valve closure behaviour was not compensated. Consequently, we would not expect to find significant compensation of the oxygen consumption rates at intermediate temperatures either.", "response": "Measure seasonal temperature effects on burrowing rate, valve closure behavior, and locomotory speed in A. anatina.

Analyze monthly measurements of BRI, valve closure duration and frequency, and locomotory speed to assess partial thermal compensation. Use R–T plot linear regression parameters to evaluate thermal compensation in behavioral parameters."}
{"question": "The lack of seasonal acclimatization to cold, winter temperatures seen in A. anatina and the aforementioned species may be an energy-saving mechanism, allowing for a thermodynamically driven reduction in energetic requirements, which would correlate with seasonal reductions in food supply. This parallels similar conclusions from another study of the marine gastropod Littorina saxatalis (Sokolov et al., 2003). Cold-acclimated specimens from the White Sea (where food is extremely scarce in winter) had a significantly lower metabolic rate than cold-acclimated conspecifics from the North Sea, which continue to feed and be active in winter. Yet warm-acclimated specimens from both areas had comparable oxygen consumption rates, and were both significantly higher than cold-acclimated rates.", "response": "Use a lack of seasonal acclimatization to cold as an energy-saving mechanism in A. anatina and related species. Reduce energetic requirements during winter to correlate with seasonal reductions in food supply."}
{"question": "One theoretical model that integrates dynamic energy budgeting (Kooijman, 2000) and the oxygen and capacity limitation of thermal tolerance (OCLTT) model (Pörtner, 2012) suggests that as acute thermal stress increases, oxygen supply and, as a consequence, oxygen consumption become increasingly limited, which leads to a progressive limitation in biological functioning. Working through a hierarchy of biological functions, an animal will progressively switch off less essential functions as oxygen supply and consumption become more limited. The first to go are lipid and carbohydrate storage, then reproduction and growth, followed by activity and finally homeostatic maintenance (Sokolova et al., 2012; Sokolova, 2013). What is neglected here is the process of feeding, which can come at a considerable energetic cost, provoking a significant increase in metabolic rate in bivalves (Lurman et al., 2013). Thus, we would expect that feeding would be one of the first processes, along with storage, that would be switched off, although in winter this may occur in response to a restricted food supply (see below). Much more work needs to be done to determine whether this model can be equally applied to acclimatization processes in A. anatina and other animals, or whether all biological processes are downregulated/upregulated to the same degree as a result of decreasing/increasing temperature, such that the entire system is thermodynamically driven, or whether less essential biological functions are switched off in winter. We predict that it may turn out to be a mix of both.", "response": "Switch off less essential biological functions progressively as oxygen supply and consumption become limited under acute thermal stress. Prioritize switching off lipid and carbohydrate storage, followed by reproduction and growth, then activity, and finally homeostatic maintenance under oxygen limitation. Consider feeding as a biological process that may be switched off early under oxygen limitation due to its high energetic cost. Investigate whether biological processes are downregulated or upregulated to the same degree across species and seasons under thermal stress. Predict that response to thermal stress may involve a mix of thermodynamically driven system-wide regulation and selective switching off of less essential functions."}
{"question": "We are unable to know whether other biological rates such as feeding, growth or cellular processes were compensated as a result of seasonal temperature; however, the fact remains that A. anatina did not (within the experimental errors of this study) thermally compensate BRI, valve closure behaviour, locomotory speed or oxygen consumption. Given that this species is in a temperate zone and experiences wide seasonal thermal variation as well as temperature fluctuations across days (rather than hours), current theory would suggest it should be highly plastic between seasons. These are all the conditions where we would expect thermal plasticity to evolve (Gabriel and Lynch, 1992; Angilletta, 2009). So, why do they not acclimatize? In short, because there is no evolutionary pressure to do so as the costs may outweigh the benefits. As exemplified by fishes, the primary factor driving thermal compensation is predation. A fish is either a predator or prey. In either case, it is of obvious advantage to maintain locomotory performance. Consequently, cold acclimation typically leads to compensation of a suite of biological processes that ultimately affect locomotion (e.g. Johnston and Temple, 2002; Woytanowski and Coughlin, 2013). Changes typically include alterations in the energy production machinery either at a molecular level, taking the form of alterations in enzyme isoform expression and membrane lipid compensation, or at the cellular level, with changes in mitochondrial volume density (Sidell, 1983; Johnston et al., 1998; Guderley, 2004b; Abele, 2012). In the muscle itself, there can be changes in ion channel function (McArdle and Johnston, 1982; Godiksen and Jessen, 2002) as well as changes in muscle fibre protein composition (Johnston and Temple, 2002; Tattersall et al., 2012) and recruitment order (Rome, 1990; Catalán et al., 2004). At a physiological level, there are also changes in cardiac function (Keen and Farrell, 1994; Lurman et al., 2012). These factors combined lead to maintained swimming performance despite changes in temperature, and thus maintained ability to out-swim predators or catch prey. Of course we cannot rule out similar molecular or cellular acclimation processes in A. anatina, despite our integrative measures generally showing otherwise.", "response": "Maintain locomotory performance in organisms to ensure predator avoidance or prey capture under temperature fluctuations. Compensate biological processes affecting locomotion through alterations in energy production machinery at molecular and cellular levels. Adjust muscle function via changes in ion channel activity, fibre protein composition, and recruitment order to maintain performance under thermal variation. Modify cardiac function to support maintained swimming performance across temperature changes. Apply integrative measures to detect potential molecular or cellular acclimation processes in species despite lack of observed thermal compensation."}
{"question": "Indeed, similar compensatory mechanisms have been identified in bivalves (Abele, 2012). The only examination of bivalve locomotory performance we can find showed that swimming performance in the scallops Chlamys islandica and Euvola ziczac was not affected by changes in temperature; however, the recovery duration was prolonged (Guderley, 2004a). This can be explained in part by the fact that swimming is anaerobic, and thus relatively temperature independent. Recovery, by contrast, depends upon aerobic machinery, which is in turn dependent upon metabolic rates set, at least in part, by temperature.", "response": "Assess bivalve swimming performance under different temperatures to evaluate compensatory mechanisms. Consider recovery duration in bivalves as dependent on aerobic metabolism influenced by temperature."}
{"question": "With respect to A. anatina, there is no reason to believe that these mussels are predated upon in their natural setting. What is more, even if they were, they would have no chance of outrunning a predator given that their maximal ‘walking’ speed is less than 1 cm min−1 between 20 and 26°C. Indeed the best strategy they can, and indeed do, adopt is to simply shut their valves and wait for any predator to leave. In light of this, the longer a mussel can stay closed, the better. The consequence of which is that their metabolic rates are kept as low as possible. Moreover, these mussels are not active predators and compensation of locomotory rates to enable prey capture is equally unnecessary, and with respect to keeping the metabolic rate low, also of potential disadvantage. If they want to increase their feeding rate they must simply increase filtration rates, as seen in other bivalves (Thompson and Bayne, 1972; Riisgård et al., 2003). However, given that algal concentrations in freshwater bodies are generally low in winter months, there is little reason to increase filtration rates. Thus, being neither predator nor prey, there is little for A. anatina to gain by increasing locomotory ability, as the increased metabolic rate would reduce their ability to close their valves when under threat, i.e. the costs must outweigh the benefits.", "response": "Adopt valve closure as the primary defensive strategy to avoid predation. Keep metabolic rates as low as possible by remaining inactive when threatened. Increase feeding rate by raising filtration rates rather than locomotory activity. Do not increase locomotory ability, as higher metabolic rates would reduce the ability to close valves under threat."}
{"question": "That said, there are other forms of thermal compensation and acclimation that we did not explore. The phenomena of heat and cold hardening have been well studied in plants, bacteria and fruit flies. There is a clear demonstrable advantage where short-term exposure to very high or low, but non-lethal temperatures can result in a favourable shift in the upper or lower critical temperature, respectively, while other physiological and performance characteristics remain unchanged (Hoffmann, 1995). One study recently found that acclimation can have an (albeit minimal) affect on the upper critical thermal maximum in North American freshwater mussels, with an increase of 1–2°C following acclimation seen in two of three species tested (Galbraith et al., 2012). With many species living close to their upper thermal limit, a difference of 1–2°C may be the difference between life and death. It remains to be seen whether the thermal tolerance limits show signs of thermal compensation in A. anatina.", "response": "Use short-term exposure to very high or low, non-lethal temperatures to induce heat or cold hardening in organisms. Investigate whether thermal tolerance limits show signs of thermal compensation in A. anatina."}
{"question": "To summarise, A. anatina, like many bivalves, has a very low-energy lifestyle. It inhabits a relatively stable thermal environment (in the short-term when compared with the marine intertidal), where temperature changes are slow. We suggest that these two factors serve as selective pressures for these mussels to not compensate behaviour or metabolic rate. Because their only predator avoidance mechanism is to close their valves, combined with the fact that they are subject to considerable seasonal fluctuations in food supplies, they instead simply allow their behaviour and metabolic rate to fluctuate at the behest of the seasons. Given the 500 million year fossil record for bivalves, this is most clearly an ecologically and evolutionary successful strategy that needs to be further explored and more explicitly considered in acclimation/acclimatization models.", "response": "Explore and explicitly consider the low-energy lifestyle and seasonal fluctuation strategy of A. anatina in acclimation and acclimatization models."}
{"question": "CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION In conclusion, the study found that while most participants knew the dietary influence on their conditions, a significant proportion was unaware of it. Cultural practices, such as consuming traditional carbohydrate-rich foods, posed a challenge to some participants in making proper dietary choices. However, most patients had received the necessary support from family, spouses, and friends to adhere to the recommended changes in their diet. The findings also revealed that patients were willing to change their dietary practices and had adequate knowledge to self-manage their conditions. However, eating a balanced diet remained a challenge due to affordability and the availability of recommended foods. Overall, the study emphasised the significance of nutrition education and counselling in empowering patients to manage their conditions effectively.", "response": "Provide nutrition education to empower patients to manage their conditions effectively. Provide nutrition counselling to support patients in adhering to recommended dietary changes.

{"question": "Implications Based on the studys findings, there are several implications for healthcare workers and policymakers. While providing nutrition education and counselling is commendable, healthcare workers should put more effort into ensuring that the message is clearly understood by patients, especially those with poor knowledge. Furthermore, healthcare providers should consider cultural practices, such as consuming traditional foods, when developing patient 33 dietary plans. To help patients contextualise their knowledge, experiential learning through a hospital kitchen could greatly benefit. The study also indicates that food security remains a challenge in the country, and policymakers should develop strategies to ensure that food security is addressed, especially for the ageing population. Finally, the study revealed that a low proportion of participants had their HbA1c levels measured within the last three months, which is a concern that requires further investigation by the CDM clinic team.", "response": "Ensure nutrition education and counselling messages are clearly understood by patients, especially those with poor knowledge.

{"question": "RESULTS\nThe changes in the fresh weight and dry weight of intertidal seaweed species in Tongyeong-Goeje area dur- ing the study period are shown in Fig. 3. The total bio- mass was highest at St. 3 and lowest at St. 1. Generally, there were decreasing trends in biomass during the study period. An unusually high value was recorded at\nSt. 2 in June due to the contribution of Ulva sp. and\nCodium sp. Ulva sp. and Pachymeniopsis sp. showed cov- erage values of 22.5-95% and 10-27.5%, respectively.\nUndaria pinnatipida and Sargassum sp. appeared with coverage of 5% to 46.7% during winter season and species of Gelidium, Chondrus, Lomentaria, Hizikia (now considered as a Sargassum sp.), and Gigartina were iden- tified with 5-20% of coverage.\nThe concentration of total dissolved inorganic nitrogen\n(DIN; NO3\n+) and phosphate varied among sampling sites. The concentrations of DIN were\nFig. 2. Conceptual model representing the uptake/growth and harvest of a biofilter/production system. high at St. 1 excepted in February (Fig. 4A). The phos- phate remained low at 1 µg · l–1 except in January and\nMay (Fig. 4B).\nThe tissue nitrogen content of seaweeds was highest at\nSt. 1 (average = 4.75%), where DIN was highest. Those of\nSt. 2 and St. 3 averaged 3.13% and 2.65%, respectively\n(Fig. 5A). The tissue nitrogen contents of Porphyra were up to 5.7% (5.4 ± 0.26%) of dry wt and showed highest value among seaweeds tested. Sargassum spp.,\nEnteromorpha spp., and Undaria spp. showed 4.7%, 4.6%, and 4.2% of tissue nitrogen contents, respectively, in the winter season. The nitrogen contents of green, brown and red algae were average of 3.18%, 2.91% and 3.42%, respectively. In brown and red algae, the tissue nitrogen contents decreased during the period of study. However, the green algae, most of them were Ulva spp., showed large fluctuations (Fig. 5B).\nThere was a positive correlation between the tissue nitrogen content and seawater DIN.  The correlation analysis showed the hyperbolic function seemed a better fit with higher correlation coefficient than those of the linear function; therefore, the rates of nitrogen accumula- tion in seaweed tissue seemed to reach maximum at higher DIN in seawater at over 600 µg·l–1 (Fig. 6). This pattern was also found in Ulva spp. (Fig. 7).\nPorphyra and Ulva showed four to six times higher rates of short-term NH4\n+ uptake than other red algal species tested in this study (Table 1). Based on the values of NH4\n+ uptake rates and growth, production and har- vest information, the efficiency of NH4\n+ removal of\nPorphyra was estimated. The model predicted that more than 17% of ammonium would be removed from the continuous supply of 100 µmol · l–1 NH4\n+ at 100 l · sec–1 flow rate with conditions described in the precious sec- tion.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\nThe algal coverage data showed that the green alga\nUlva sp. could be regarded as a green tide, especially in\nJune. Recently, the occurrence of green tides began to spread along the south coast of the Korean peninsula\nFig. 3.

Fundamentally, the growth of marine algae in a given ecosystem should be proportional to the rate of supply of nutrients, temperature, light, and water motion (Schramm 1999; Smith et al. 1999). Therefore, the control of eutrophication should be accomplished by restricting the loading of key nutrients to the ecosystem.\nDeliberate nutrient loading reductions indeed have led to dramatic improvements in several areas in Japan (e.g.,\nSmith et al. 1999).\nThe total nutrient load from aquaculture in an open system may be very small in comparison with other", "response": "Restrict the loading of key nutrients to the ecosystem; Implement deliberate nutrient loading reductions to improve water quality"}
{"question": ", light, and water motion (Schramm 1999; Smith et al. 1999). Therefore, the control of eutrophication should be accomplished by restricting the loading of key nutrients to the ecosystem.\nDeliberate nutrient loading reductions indeed have led to dramatic improvements in several areas in Japan (e.g.,\nSmith et al. 1999).\nThe total nutrient load from aquaculture in an open system may be very small in comparison with other nutrient sources; however, its point source effects may have adverse effects on coastal ecosystems that can be significant (Chopin and Yarish 1999; Paez-Osuna et al.\n1999). Seaweed cultivation can act as a nutrient scrubber system; integrated aquaculture of seaweeds with fish (or other forms of fed aquaculture) maybe one of the most reasonable means for bioremediating coastal waters\n(McVey et al. 2002).\nThe tissue nitrogen contents of Porphyra and Ulva species showed ranges of values similar to those report- ed in other studies. The nitrogen contents of Porphyra were over 5% and that of Ulva was above 4%. For those species with cover greater than 10%, red algae had high- er average tissue N than brown algae (though the differ- ence was not significant). Red algae may have higher potential values due to their photosynthetic pigments\n(N-containing phycobiliproteins) and protein levels.\nTissue nitrogen contents increased with increased con- centration of dissolved nitrogen in seawater (Figs 6, 7).\nThe internal tissue nitrogen content is thought to be the complex results of the interactions among the external environment, uptake kinetics, assimilation, growth and reproductive processes (e.g. Hanisak 1983). The hyper- bolic correlation between tissue nitrogen and DIN in sea- water could be speculated as the result of hyperbolic\nFig. 5. The tissue nitrogen contents of seaweeds at different sites (A) and algal groups (B).\nFig. 6.

Tissue nitrogen content of Gracilaria was also correlated with nutrient availability (Jones et al.\nPorphyra tenera, which has been cultivated from the beginning of Porphyra cultivation in Korea, showed the highest rate of NH4\n+ uptake (3.4 µmol · g dw–1· min–1 at\n150 µM) and nitrogen content (over 5%). The rate of uptake was a kind of surge uptake and may be higher than the accumulation uptake (Pedersen and Borum\n1997). The values of Pophyra serriata and Ulva pertusa were slightly lower than that of P. tenera but four to five times higher rates than those of other species tested\n(Table 1). Although the present experiments were not designed to analyze the rate of NH4\n+ uptake according to the per surface area basis nor the ratio of surface area to volume, the values were similar to those reports of\nPorphyra and Ulva (Pedersen and Borum 1997; Taylor et al. 1998).\nSeveral taxa such as Ulva, Gracilaria, Laminaria, and\nPorphyra have been investigated from different research groups (e.g., Chopin et al. 2001). The values of uptake rates in the present study were in the same range of other studies. Wallentinus (1984) found Enteromorpha sp. and Cladophora sp. showed about 2 µmol · g dw–1· min–1 at 60 µM NH4\n+. Taylor et al. (1999) reported Ulva sp. exhibited about 2.0 µmol ·g dw–1· min–1 and Porphyra sp. was about 4 µmol·g dw–1· min–1 at 100 µM NH4\n+. Other studies on the rate of NH4\n+ uptake showed different val- ues. Subandar et al. (1993) reported the rates of NH4\n+ uptake ranged between 0.1 and 0.4 µmol · g dw–1· min–1 in Laminaria saccharina using salmon farm effluent of 6.225.4 µmol NH4\n+· l–1 in continuous flow", "response": "Restrict nutrient loading to control eutrophication"}

This conservative estimate is about half of the removal potential compared with the estimates of Chopin et al. (1999).  If higher uptake rates and stocking densities were applied, the efficiency could increase up to 50% in our model. However, the self- shading effects and circulation factors (such as flow and mixing rate) should be considered with increasing stock- ing densities (Cohen and Neori 1991; Quian et al. 1995;\nNelson et al. 2001).\nPrevious studies showed the range of 10 to 90% of nitrogen removal efficiency in polyculture systems.  Ulva lactuca removed 40-90% depending on NH4\n+ supply\n(Cohen and Neori 1991) and up to 85% in study of\nVadermuelen and Gordin (1990). The efficiency of Ulva rigida in Sparus aurata waste water treatment was 76% in the daily input of 150 mmol NH4\n+· m–2· day–1 with 2.7g fw · l–1 (Jimenez Del Rio et al. 1994). Troell et al. (1997) found slightly lower removal (5%) of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in a cage culture experiment with Gracilaria, but found much higher seasonal rates of NH4\n+ removal with\n50% in winter and 90-95% in spring in a tank system\n(Troell et al. 1999). Laminaria saccharina removed 26-40% of incoming dissolved nitrogen from salmon farm efflu- ent (Subandar et al. 1993).\nThe ultimate goal of this study is to develop a strategy for the sustainability of aquaculture in the coastal ecosystem based on the sound ecological and economic principles (Newkirk 1996). There are many conflicts among the users of coastal waters, and aquaculture should be conducted under a plan of integrated coastal zone management with a balance between ‘extractive’ and ‘fed’ aquaculture (McVey et al. 2002; Rawson et al.\n2002). The results of this preliminary study seem very promising, because the biology of the proposed species are well studied and the economic value of some are also high; nevertheless, more complete information should be obtained to expand integrated aquaculture systems\n(Troell et al. 1999; Harrison and Hurd 2001). Based on this study, a site-specific year-round system will be established depending on culture type, species, local hydrodynamic and other environmental factors.\nMoreover, monitoring and regulation of aquaculture systems need to be based upon carrying capacity models of each area, if there will be sustainable aquaculture along the Korean coastal zone (Fernandes et al. 2000,", "response": "Apply higher uptake rates and stocking densities to increase nitrogen removal efficiency; Develop integrated coastal zone management plans balancing extractive and fed aquaculture; Establish site-specific year-round systems based on culture type, species, and local environmental factors; Implement monitoring and regulation based on carrying capacity models for sustainable aquaculture."}

{"question": "RESULTS\nFindings from this article indicate that prenatal and early postnatal periods have a critical role in the individual outcome, as Barker affirms: “Much of human develop- ment is completed during the first 1000 days after con- ception” [51]. There is overall consistency in literature about negative effects of fetal and postnatal exposure to parental tobacco smoking on several outcomes: preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome, neurodevelopmental and behav- ioral problems, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, impaired lung function, asthma and wheezing (Table 1).\nWhile maternal smoking during pregnancy plays a major role on adverse postnatal outcomes, it may also cumulate negatively with smoking during lactation and with sec- ond-hand smoking exposure.\nThis review aimed to discuss the current evidence regarding the short and long-term effects of parental tobacco smoking during a critical period of life (preg- nancy and lactation). It should be pointed out that it was not strictly designed a priori as a systematic review, and that the PRISMA Statement was not fully applied (including PICOS). Although this is a weak- ness, a descriptive approach might benefit the reader\nTable 1  Parental tobacco smoking and offspring health outcomes a  Proved in vitro and/or in animals b  Hypothesized in humans\nParental tobacco smoking\nHealth outcomes\nShort-term\nLong-term\nDuring pregnancy\nMaternal smoking\nPreterm birthb\nFetal growth restrictionb\nLow birth weightb\nAltered brain structure and function in newbornsb\nLower fetal heart rate variabilityb\nReduced alveolarizationb\nIncreased risk of overweight and obesitya,b\nHigher blood pressurea,b\nIncreased risk of wheezing, asthma, airway hyperrespon- siveness, impaired lung function, bronchitisb\nPaternal/environmental smoking\nLow birth weightb\nFurther studies are needed\nDuring lactation\nMaternal smoking\nIncreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)b\nNeurodevelopmental and behavioral disordersb\nSleep disruptionb\nIncreased risk of overweight and obesitya,b\nImpaired glucose homeostasisa\nIncreased risk of respiratory allergy (asthma and rhinitis)a,b with a promptly and friendly readable update of the matter.\nThe results of this review strengthens the need to plan population health policies aimed to implement educa- tional programs to hopefully minimize tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and lactation. Mothers should be strongly encouraged to stop smoking espe- cially during pregnancy and lactation. Parents should know that exposure to prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoking is associated with different adverse outcomes and that tobacco smoking is one of the most preventable causes of infant morbidity and mortality [52]. However, breastfeeding is the best way of infant feeding even if a mother doesn’t quit smoking during lactation [49]. Amal- gamating results from different studies, this paper could be a useful tool to educate and increase awareness about adverse health effects of parental tobacco smoking for children. Additionally, it could be a starting point for the conception of new health promotion and public health campaigns that emphasize the importance of parental smoking cessation.\nAbbreviations\nBMI: body mass index; BP: blood pressure; CO: carbon monoxide; COX: cytochrome c oxidase; DHA: docosahexaenoic acid; HRV: heart rate variability;\nLBW: low birth weight; LC-PUFA: long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids; SGA: small for gestational age; SIDS: sudden infant death syndrome; TH: T-helper.\nAuthors’ contributions\nGB had primary responsibility for manuscript management, and contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

The number of fires increased progressively in the dry period as the dry period progressed. Fires in the starting month of the dry period (June) contributed only 1.24% of the total number of fires, but fires at the end of the dry period (October) contributes more than 39% of the total fire number. More than 88% of fires occurred in the dry period, strongly suggesting a coupling of the dry period and fire occurrences in the MRP area.\nFig. 8 shows that the fire season in MRP area started from the end of July when fires occur intensively with more than 4 fires/day in average. The peak of the fire season tends to start from the middle of August and ends at the start of November when large fires occur intensively with more than 26 fires/day in average. Fires in the peak fire period were 2938 or around 87.1% of the annual number of fires in the MRP area. Thus, based on the data here we suggest the middle of August as both the peak of the dry period and the start of the peak of the fire season.\nFig. 9 shows that the peat fire occurrences in the\nMRP area coincide with the precipitation curve. Daily precipitation decreased gradually from June and reached the lowest point in the middle of August, creating the necessary dry conditions for fires to ignite. Then, fires start to occur on a daily basis from the middle of June and become numerous from the end of July, making the end\nFig. 7.

Further, the TNR in the dry periods of\n2000 to 2006 all exceeded 100, indicating that; recently, a severely dry period has become an annual occurrence in\nPalangkaraya. There is an exception in 2007 which suffered from an exceptionally large rainfall all of the year due to a La Niña event. Thus, this study clearly showed a positive correlation between Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies and both of TNR and MNR (Fig. 6); indicating that the recent severe dry conditions in Palangkaraya are closely related with positive Niño 3.4 SST Anomaly occurrences.\nHotspots or fires in the MRP area numbered 7017,\n4618, and 2052 in the dry periods of the El Niño years\n2006, 2004, and 2002, respectively (Fig. 7). The large number of hotspots showed that peat fires in the MRP area are more common in El Niño years. Murdiyarso and\nAdiningsih (2006) showed the role of the El Niño\nSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) in providing dry weather inducing biomass burning and widespread fires. However, there were more than 1,500 fires in the dry period (June to October) of the non El Niño years of 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005 when the Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies were between\nºC and 0.3\nºC, indicating that recently a large number of fires is strongly correlated with positive Niño 3.4 SST\nAnomalies, even when the values are low positive ones.\nThe peat fire occurrence graph for the MRP area\n(Fig. 8) clearly shows that intermittent fires occur in the wet season but that fires are much more intense in the\nAverage Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies (0C)\nNumber of days\nPalangkaraya\nTNR\nMNR\nFig. 6.

{"question": "RESULTS\nPrecipitation pattern, SST Anomalies, and peat fire occurrence\nLike other tropical regions, Central Kalimantan experiences two seasons namely a dry and a wet season.\nPrevious studies (Putra et al. 2008, Aldrian and Susanto\n2003, Usup et al. 2004, MacKinnon et al. 1997) have defined dry and wet seasons in Central Kalimantan by using the monthly rainfall variation. But this monthly precipitation is not sufficient to understand the fires that occur almost every day even in June or before the dry season. Therefore we examined the precipitation variability to investigate the influence of precipitation variability on the fire activity in the MRP area by analyzing the 30-years of daily precipitation data from\nThe analysis clearly shows a U-shaped precipitation pattern in Palangkaraya with a high plateau from\nDecember to March and a trough reaching minimum in the middle of August (Fig. 2), clearly shows the actual wet and dry periods in Palangkaraya. This pattern is one of three typical precipitation patterns in Indonesia\n(Aldrian and Susanto 2003). A daily mean precipitation\n(7.8 mm) is used here to differentiate the dry and wet periods in Palangkaraya.\nThe wet period lasts for about seven months and it is two months longer than the dry periods. Thus, the length of the dry periods is about five months from the start of\nJune (DN 152) to the end of October (DN 301). This study defines June to October as the dry periods in\nPalangkaraya.\nThe precipitation pattern in Fig. 2 clearly shows the large difference in precipitation between the wet and dry periods in Palangkaraya. There is a more than two times difference  between the mean daily precipitation values in the dry periods (4.7 mm) and wet periods (10.0 mm), and the total precipitation in the dry periods (698.9 mm) is\nGround water level measurement point\nTjilik Riwut climatology station\nScale: 1 : 1,400,000\nFig. 1. Study area and location of Tjilik Riwut Climatology Station and ground water level measurement point. only 1/3 of that in the wet periods, this pattern clearly describes the overall dr y climate conditions in\nPalangkaraya during the dry period.\nLow daily precipitation, less than the mean dry precipitation (4.7 mm), occurred between July and\nSeptember and the lowest daily precipitation of less than\n3 mm is in the middle of August. Low precipitation brings a drier climate and increases the dryness of the peat in the MRP area.\nFig. 3 shows the daily occurrence rates of rainless and rainy days in Palangkaraya based on the 30-year daily precipitation analysis. The rates of occurrence of rainy days form a U-curve shaped pattern. The inverted\nU-curve shape is for the rate of occurrence of rainless days. The rate of occurrence of rainless days is higher than the number of rainy days in a year.\nOccurrence rates of rainless days in the wet period are between 38 and 60% and increases to more than 60% in the dry period. The occurrence rates of rainy days are between 20 and 36% in the wet period and less than 15% in the dry period. In the peak of the dry period, the middle of August, there are not only high occurrence rates (more than 80%) of rainless days but also low occurrence rates\n(less than 10%) of rainy days. Under these occurrence rates, dry weather conditions are created and conducive conditions of ignition of peat are created; stimulating the high fire activity in the area in this period.\nAlmost all of the past positive Niño 3.4 SST\nAnomalies or El Niño events brought droughts to\nIndonesia.

{"question": "at drops below -40 cm (from the surface level) (Wösten et al. 2008), making the peat susceptible to fires. There is an exception in 2004 where large numbers of fires start when the GWL is at around -20 cm (Fig. 11), but in this year the GWL progressively decreased until it reached -71.4 at the middle of October (not showed in\nFig. 11) and most of the fires occurred when the GWL was below -40 cm. Therefore this study suggests -40 cm as a critical level of GWL for large peat fire occurrences\nFig. 11. Ground water level and peat fire occurrences, middle of July – middle of August, 2001 – 2006.\nDay Number\nNumber of hotspots\nGround water level (cm)\nHotspot\nGWL\n2006 in the MRP area, and this GWL could be used as an indicator suggesting a high likelihood of severe fire occurrences in the MRP area.\nFig.12 shows that the GWL reached -40 cm at the middle of August when the peak fire period has started, and indicates -40 cm as a critical value of GWL for large peat fire occurrences. Fig. 12 also shows the changes in\nGWL in the MRP area. The GWL stays steady at around 5 cm above the soil surface between January and the middle of May, in the wet season; this suggests that the area could be categorized as a peat swamp forest area.\nThe GWL decreased progressively below the soil surface during the dry period from the end of May until it reached the lowest value in early October; clearly indicating that the GWL followed the precipitation changes. However, there is a time-lag between GWL and precipitation.\nThere is about a one and a half month time-lag between the lowest precipitation in mid August and the lowest GWL in early October. The decrease in precipitation occurs over three months to reach the lowest in mid August (from mid May), but the lowering of\nGWL below the soil surface takes around 4.5 months from the middle of May until it reaches its lowest value in early October. The GWL then reaches the soil surface again at the end of December after the precipitation has reached its highest value in mid December. This may suggest that the recovery of the ground water level in the\nMRP area occurs after having been replenished by the water supplied by the continuous precipitation.\nFinally, this study has established the factors that are important for peat fire occurrences in the MRP area, including: the onset of the dry period and precipitation patterns, Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies, and ground water level changes in the dry season. As peat fires in the MRP area are human caused fires (Putra et al. 2008), fire forecasts based on such information will assist in preventing devastating peat fire occurrences in the future in the\nMRP area.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\nThe analysis using daily precipitation data, hotspot data,\nNiño 3.4 SST Anomalies, and ground water levels clearly support the following conclusions:\n1.　 The 30 year daily precipitation data analysis showed large differences in the precipitation pattern of the dry and wet periods in Palangkaraya where the mean daily precipitation in the dry period (4.7 mm) is less than half of that in the wet period (10 mm). Less than\n3 mm of daily precipitation and a higher than 80% incidence of rainless days in the middle of August suggests the middle of August as the peak of the dry period as well as the start of the peak fire period.\nUnder this precipitation pattern, the dryness of the peat is increased and stimulated the large number of fire occurrences. Around 2938 of fires or 87.1% of the annual number of fires in the MRP area occurred in the peak fire period, indicating that the large areas of bare peat in the MRP area now are highly susceptibility to fires, coupled with the precipitation pattern of the dry period.\n2.　 There is a negative correlation between Niño 3.4 SST\nAnomalies and precipitation; and a high positive correlation between Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies, severity\nFig. 12.

These numbers suggest that severe droughts occurred during the dry period of El Niño years, with resulting severe fire occurrences. The number of hotspots or fires detected in\nCentral Kalimantan are 26,757 in 1997; 19,470 in 2002; and 41,102 in 2006 (Putra and Hayasaka 2007).\nThere is a negative correlation between Niño 3.4 SST\nAnomalies and precipitation in Palangkaraya during the dry period (Fig. 4). Previously, a strong correlation between SST anomalies and the precipitation variability were reported for some regions in Indonesia (Aldrian and\nSusanto 2003). The Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies of more than\nºC bring less than 500 mm precipitation in the dry period such as in 1991 (292.8 mm, +0.8\nºC), and 2006 (294.5 mm, +0.5\nºC). Less than 350 mm precipitation occurred in the dry period when the Niño 3.4 SST anomalies average was above +1\nºC as in 1982 (240.8 mm, +1.4\nºC), and 2002 (308.1 mm, +1.1\nºC). There was only 117.0 mm of precipitation during the dry period of 1997 when the Niño 3.4\nSST anomaly averaged 2.1\nºC.\nLow Niño 3.4 SST Anomalies smaller than -0.5\nºC brings large amounts of precipitation in the dry period. The amount of precipitation in the dry period exceeded 850 mm in 1988, 1998, 1999, and 2007 when the\nNiño 3.4 SST Anomalies in the dry period were below\nºC. However, below mean value precipitation also occurred in several neutral or non El Niño years such as in 1990, 2003, and 2005, when there were low positive\nNiño 3.4 SST Anomalies, between +0.1\nºC and +0.5\nºC, in the dry season.\nThis study used the total number of rainless days\n(TNR) and the maximum number of consecutive rainless days (MNR) in the dry season to assess fire risks in the\nMRP area based on the precipitation variability.\nConsiderable variation in fire risks from year to year in\nMRP has been shown to be closely related to the rainfall and length of dry season (Wösten et al. 2008).\nThe longest TNR (", "response": "Use total number of rainless days (TNR) and the maximum number of consecutive rainless days (MNR) as indicators for fire risk assessment and management"}

The fire season is shorter in non-El Niño years\n(DN 296, end of October) than in El Niño years (DN 316, start of November). Large amounts of precipitation at the end of the dry period significantly decreases the number of fires, followed by the end of peak fire period and fire season in non-El Niño years at DN 295 and DN 306, respectively. However, the peak fire period and fire season in El Niño years lasts longer (DN 316 and DN 323, respectively); this may be a result of the still dry condition of the peat early in November due to low rainfall pattern at the beginning of rainy season in El Niño years. The composite seasonal precipitation and fire cycle in Fig. 10 is derived from years 2002 and 2006 for the El Niño years, and years 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2005 for the non-El Niño years.\nGround water levels, precipitation, and peat fire occurrence\nThe ground water level (GWL) could be one of the key indicators determining fire activity in peatlands because the dryness of peat and the moisture content of grass, litter, and the surface peat are directly influenced by the\nGWL (Usup et al. 2004).  Figs. 10 and 11 shows that peat fires occurred when the GWL was lower than the soil surface both in El Niño years and non-El Niño years; suggesting that the low GWL accelerated conditions where fires ignite with ease.\nFigs. 10 and 11 show that fire occurrences in the\nMRP area coincide with the GWL. The decrease in GWL in El Niño years is faster than in non-El Niño years (Fig\n10). The GWL dropped below the soil surface from the middle of May and reached a minimum of -117.4 cm at the end of October in El Niño years; in non- El Niño years the minimum in GWL was -59.5, reached at the middle of\nOctober. This evidence strongly indicates that the dry conditions of the peat in El Niño years during the dry period is more severe rather than that in the non-El Niño years, thus accelerating and causing larger numbers of fires in El Niño years than in non-El Niño years.\nThe fire records both in El Niño years and non-El\nNiño years (Figs 10 and 11) showed that the fire season in the MRP area started when the GWL dropped to around -30 cm and fires become more severe when the\nGWL is below -40 cm. The moisture content of the top layer of the peat will decrease when the ground water level in tropical peat drops below -40 cm (from the surface level) (Wösten et al. 2008), making the peat susceptible to fires. There is an exception in 2004 where large numbers of fires start when the GWL is at around -20 cm (Fig. 11), but in this year the GWL progressively decreased until it reached -71.4 at the middle of October (not showed in\nFig. 11", "response": "Use total number of rainless days (TNR) and the maximum number of consecutive rainless days (MNR) as indicators for fire risk assessment and management"}

The closeness of the forests and the more extensive unplanned fire explain why the model has a smaller radius and better goodness of fit for Sydney than for Perth. These differences between cities mean that a forecast tool must be based on a model specific to each city.\nOur empirical modelling method shows some potential for developing a forecasting tool for bushfire planning. For both cities, the best single predictor of daily pollution is the previous day’s pollution, which may be of use to health authorities. Nevertheless, the FRP and weather variables also contribute substantially to the predictive power. For Sydney, the predictive model explained most of the variation in pollution and three quarters of the known bushfire caused pollution days were identified as peaks in the FRP data. For Perth, the previous days FRP is actually a better predictor than the current day, albeit with low predictive power.\nOur method may be more efficient and accurate for identifying\nFigure 5.

Pollution from these sources also varies and our analysis suggests that they respond to weather conditions, perhaps more than smoke does. If non-smoke pollution days could be filtered from the data then the accuracy of the models would be greatly increased. A more explicit representation of atmospheric transport such as a two or three-dimensional wind-field between the source and monitor would also improve the relationship. Many fires, especially larger ones, inject smoke high into the atmosphere which may reduce pollution on the ground [44]. Since there is actually a relationship between FRP and injection height [44], this effect could be directly incorporated into a predictive model and may be more successful than the use of an atmospheric stability index such as C-Haines. Ultimately, a hybrid model using daily snapshots of FRP and a three-dimensional atmospheric transport model may be the most fruitful approach.\nThere are other limitations that affect the accuracy of the models.

{"question": "RESULTS\nDuring the study period (2002 to 2007) 1845 and 1687 days had both pollution measures and fire hotspots in Sydney and Perth, respectively. In Sydney, the hotspots occurred in a wide arc of forest surrounding the city from north, west, and south (Figure 1a).\nMajor, damaging fires occurred in the 2002/3 and 2006/7 fire seasons. A fire rose diagram for unweighted hotspots (showing the number of hotspots in each 10u compass sector, centred on the pollution monitor) is dominated by the fires that burnt the\nAustralian Alps and Canberra in January 2003 (300–500 km to the south-west of Sydney) (Figure 4a). The distance-weighted fire rose shows a much more even spread of fire directions, with the fires from 2002/3 and 2006/7 prominent, but with fires from land in all directions. In Perth, hotspots were more dispersed than in\nSydney and the fires were smaller (Figure 1b). Consequently, the fire roses were similar for the weighted and unweighted distances\n(Figure 4b). Notice the occurrence of hotspots in the direction of the ocean for Sydney, which is due to the inland position of the pollution monitor.\nIn Sydney, the explanatory power of Lag FRP decreased with the length of the lag: r2 decreased from 0.17 for the current day to\n0.04 for 4 days previously (Figure 5a). However, the best explanatory power was obtained with the Combined FRP with 1 day lag (FRP01, r2 = 0.23) and was also high for Combined FRP with 2 and 3 day lags. For the Combined Forecast FRP (excluding the current day), the explanatory power was highest for a 3 day lag\n(0.19). Perth showed a similar pattern, with the Combined FRP with 1 day lag giving the best explanatory power, though this was low (r2 = 0.84, Figure 5b). For both cities, the best FRP variable to use for modelling is the current day + previous day (FRP01).\nAnalyses on the radius of influence showed a peak in explanatory power at 100 km for Sydney (r2 = 0.24, Table 1).\nThe peak for Perth was at 400 km with a lower explanatory power\n(r2 = 0.08). None of the log-transformations improved the fit of the relationships.\nThere were 69 exceedance events for PM2.5 in Sydney, of which\n52% lasted a single day. Only four events lasted four days or more\n(Figure 6). The two longest events were associated with major fire events in the Sydney region (Christmas 2001 fires and early\nDecember 2002). Two other four-day events were both during winter, and were not verified fire events (11th July 2002 and 7th\nJune 2005). In Perth, there were more events with shorter durations (n = 80, 75% lasted a single day), and only two lasted four days. These were both in May (26th May 2004 and 9th May\n2006), and were not verified fire events. The exceedances in FRP showed similar patterns to the PM2.5 and similar differences between the cities. In Sydney there were 48 events, of which 54% lasted a single day, but ten lasted four days or more. In Perth there were 75 events, of which 75% lasted a single day, and only three were four days or more.\nThe best statistical model for Sydney included positive effects for FRP01, FFDI, C-Haines, PMlag and with on-shore winds and a negative effect of wind-speed. PM25lag had the strongest effect\n(see the importance value, Table 2a), followed by FRP01. There were also negative interactions between FRP01 and wind- speed,and FRP01 and PM25lag, but these were weak effects\n(Table 2, Figure 7). The model explained 56% of variance in\nPM2.5 (r2 = 0.562) and there were no supported alternatives. When the analysis was repeated without PM25lag, the final model was similar, but explained 45% of variation. Using log(PM2.5) as the dependent variable or including all days also resulted in similar models and explanatory power (r2 = 0.561, 0.569 respectively", "response": "Develop city-specific models for bushfire planning"}

Using log(PM2.5) as the dependent variable or including all days also resulted in similar models and explanatory power (r2 = 0.561, 0.569 respectively).\nUsing the log of FRP as a predictor variable gave weaker results than the untransformed FRP variables.\nThe best model for Perth was similar to Sydney, but explained less variation (r2 = 0.310, Table 2b). There were positive effects of\nFFDI, C-Haines and PM25lag and on-shore wind and a negative effect of wind speed. The FRP01 effect was weak, and there was an interaction between FRP01 and C-Haines, which meant that FRP had a positive relationship with PM2.5 which became slightly negative when the C-Haines index was less than 1.3 (on about\n31% of days). There were no supported alternative models.\nPM25lag was the most important variable, followed by C-Haines.\nWithout PM25lag, the best model explained only 19% of variance.\nUsing log(PM2.5) as the dependent variable, including all days, or using log of FRP as the predictor variable all resulted in similar models with slightly lower explanatory power (r2 = 0.294, 0.308,\n0.306 respectively).\nThere were 54 validated bushfire events in Sydney with matching PM2.5 peaks, and 74% of these corresponded with peaks in the raw FRP01 value and 61% corresponded with peaks in the model predictions. For Perth there were 23 events and 35% corresponded with the raw FRP01 and 43% with the model predictions.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\nWe have demonstrated that there is a relationship between fire activity detectable from satellites and pollution in urban centres.\nMoreover, there are windows of spatial and temporal influence of\nPredicting Smoke Pollution from MODIS Hotspots\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\nOctober 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e4 fire activity on pollution. For Sydney, the radius of influence is relatively small (100 km) and the relationship is strong, while for\nPerth the radius is much larger (400 km) and the relationship is weak. The explanatory power of the models was improved by including weather and pollution history variables, to the extent that more than half of the variance in pollution could be explained for Sydney. The weather relationships revealed higher pollution when the atmosphere was stable, when wind speed was low and when the wind in the upper atmosphere was blowing on-shore.\nImportantly, wind flow from the fires to the monitor was not present in the models. This is presumably because on-shore winds that trap in-situ pollution in the city basins are more important to the overall level of pollution than winds transporting smoke from bushfires, even if days without fire activity are excluded. This trapping effect is probably why stable air and low wind speed also lead to more pollution.\nThe differences between the cities have a logical explanation.\nSydney is bounded on three sides by extensive forests (approxi- mately 20,000 km2) at a distance of about 100 km. Beyond this is an extensive agricultural belt with very little fire activity. The mean area burnt in these forests is approximately 5% per year, of which more than 80% is unplanned fire [20]. Generally, the wind associated with bushfire events blows from an arc between northwest and southwest, and so blows smoke into the city. The forests around Perth are much more scattered, comprising small patches spread across a larger region. A higher proportion of the forests are burnt each year (8.5%) [19], but the regime is dominated by prescribed fires (7% compared to 1.5% for\nFigure 4.

{"question": "could be directly incorporated into a predictive model and may be more successful than the use of an atmospheric stability index such as C-Haines. Ultimately, a hybrid model using daily snapshots of FRP and a three-dimensional atmospheric transport model may be the most fruitful approach.\nThere are other limitations that affect the accuracy of the models. The raw FRP values used here do not account for differences in vegetation type. Vegetation correction factors have been applied elsewhere to FRP values [37], but none have been developed for Australia. The episodic nature of major bushfire events means that the six year time series used here only captured a small number of events (54 events reported in the media for\nSydney and 23 for Perth), and these varied greatly in magnitude.\nThe analysis would be improved with a longer time series. Sydney experiences extreme fire seasons (where .10% of the forest area burns) between once and twice per decade [20], so it may be that several decades of data are required to determine the nature of the relationship between FRP and pollution levels.\nOur results are also relevant to the debate over the appropriate level of prescribed fire treatment. Prescribed fire is imposed as a means of reducing the area and impact of wildfire, and has been suggested as one means of preventing increased wildfire activity due to climate change. However, in many Australian landscapes several hectares of prescribed fire are required to reduce the area of wildfire by one hectare. For example, around Sydney 3–4 ha of prescribed fire are required per hectare reduction in wildfire area\n[20,45], and the forests around Perth, 6 ha are required [19].\nHowever, prescribed fires consume less biomass per hectare than wildfires because they are more patchy [46], are usually confined to the surface fuels and leave larger proportion of fuel unburned. It has been shown for Southern Australia that smoke plumes from prescribed fires blow over cities, though on average these are five times smaller than plumes from wildfires [21]. Further examina- tion of the contribution of prescribed and wildfires to smoke is needed before the likely impact of increased prescribed burning could be accurately predicted.\nIn conclusion, this study has identified a clear relationship between remotely sensed fire activity and pollution levels in two\nAustralian cities. It has also identified the distance over which fires tend to supply smoke to the cities, and some of the challenges to developing a useful operational tool. With some improvements, models developed using this method could become useful in many fire-prone regions around the world for forecasting smoke pollution. They may be used as an adjunct to smoke-plume modelling or may eventually prove to be more useful. Even as they are now, the method can be used for rapid retrospective identification of bushfire pollution days, in contrast to the labour intensive methods used by Johnston et al. [36]. With further separation of FRP into wild and prescribed fires, our approach could also provide a new tool for understanding the comparative smoke pollution exposure to humans from fires of both types.", "response": "Develop and apply vegetation correction factors for FRP values for fire monitoring specific to Australia; Prescribed fire is imposed as a means of reducing the area and impact of wildfire; Differentiate between prescribed and wildfires in FRP data to better understand their respective impacts on smoke pollution"}

Hirsch\nAssociate Director for Water\nFOREWORD\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is committed to serve the Nation with accurate and timely scientiﬁc infor- mation that helps enhance and protect the overall quality of life, and facilitates effective management of water, biologi- cal, energy, and mineral resources. (http://www.usgs.gov/).\nInformation on the quality of the Nation’s water resources is of critical interest to the USGS because it is so integrally linked to the long-term availability of water that is clean and safe for drinking and recreation and that is suitable for industry, irrigation, and habitat for ﬁsh and wildlife. Esca- lating population growth and increasing demands for the multiple water uses make water availability, now measured in terms of quantity and quality, even more critical to the long-term sustainability of our communities and ecosys- tems.\nThe USGS implemented the National Water-Quality\nAssessment (NAWQA) Program to support national, regional, and local information needs and decisions related to water-quality management and policy. (http:// water.usgs.gov/nawqa).  Shaped by and coordinated with ongoing efforts of other Federal, State, and local agencies, the NAWQA Program is designed to answer: What is the condition of our Nation’s streams and ground water? How are the conditions changing over time? How do natural fea- tures and human activities affect the quality of streams and ground water, and where are those effects most pro- nounced? By combining information on water chemistry, physical characteristics, stream habitat, and aquatic life, the\nNAWQA Program aims to provide science-based insights for current and emerging water issues and priorities.\nNAWQA results can contribute to informed decisions that result in practical and effective water-resource management and strategies that protect and restore water quality.\nSince 1991, the NAWQA Program has implemented interdisciplinary assessments in more than 50 of the\nNation’s most important river basins and aquifers, referred to as Study Units. (http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/ nawqamap.html). Collectively, these Study Units account for more than 60 percent of the overall water use and popu- lation served by public water supply, and are representative of the Nation’s major hydrologic landscapes, priority eco- logical resources, and agricultural, urban, and natural sources of contamination.\nEach assessment is guided by a nationally consistent study design and methods of sampling and analysis. The assessments thereby build local knowledge about water- quality issues and trends in a particular stream or aquifer while providing an understanding of how and why water quality varies regionally and nationally. The consistent, multi-scale approach helps to determine if certain types of water-quality issues are isolated or pervasive, and allows direct comparisons of how human activities and natural pro- cesses affect water quality and ecological health in the\nNation’s diverse geographic and environmental settings.\nComprehensive assessments on pesticides, nutrients, vola- tile organic compounds, trace metals, and aquatic ecology are developed at the national scale through comparative analysis of the Study-Unit ﬁndings. (http://water.usgs.gov/ nawqa/natsyn.html).\nThe USGS places high value on the communication and dissemination of credible, timely, and relevant science so that the most recent and available knowledge about water resources can be applied in management and policy deci- sions.  We hope this NAWQA publication will provide you the needed insights and information to meet your needs, and thereby foster increased awareness and involvement in the protection and restoration of our Nation’s waters.\nThe NAWQA Program recognizes that a national assessment by a single program cannot address all water- resource issues of interest. External coordination at all lev- els is critical for a fully integrated understanding of water- sheds and for cost-effective management, regulation, and conservation of our Nation’s water resources.

{"question": "On observation of the EU average,\n‘work/study commitments’ was the most frequently perceived barrier cited for not increasing partici- pation in physical activity at 28%, followed by ‘not the sporty type’ at 25% (Table 5). The remaining perceived barriers to increase one’s physical activity were not regarded as being as important. Indeed the percentage of EU subjects selecting ‘looking after children/elderly relatives’ and ‘no need to do any more’ is\nThere were, however, signiﬁcant variations between countries, particularly for the barrier ‘work/study commitments’ with 46% of the\nItalian respondents selecting this barrier in comparison to only 13% of the German respondents. Thirty-three per cent of German subjects believed that ‘not the sporty type’ was a barrier in comparison to 12% of\nFinnish subjects. Over a quarter of Spanish subjects felt\n‘poor health’ was a barrier to partaking in physical exercise and one-ﬁfth of this population also believed they were too old, compared with the EU average of one in 10 subjects.\nJust as there was considerable interstate variation in the perceived barriers to increasing participation level in physical exercise, there were also marked differences in percentages across demographics\n(Table 6). Respondents who were younger, educated to tertiary level and who were male, were more inclined to choose ‘work/study commitments’ as a major barrier to increasing levels of physical activity especially compared to primary-educated subjects\n(16%). ‘Looking after children/elderly relatives’ was an important barrier for females with more than three times as many (18%) selecting this barrier compared to males (5%). The barriers ‘lack of facilities’, ‘no-one to do it with’, ‘fear of injury’, ‘shy/embarrassment’, ‘waste of time’ were cited by less than 10% each.\nThe relationship between education level and the barrier ‘not the sporty type’ was further examined across the 15 EU member states (Table 7). The education- related decrease seen in the average EU sample was apparent in 10 of the member states. In the other ﬁve countries there was little effect of education level on the selection of this barrier. As education level of subjects increased from primary to tertiary level, so did the percentage of subjects mentioning the barrier\n‘work/study commitments’ in all 15 member states\n(Table 7). Thus, for tertiary-educated subjects in all 15 member states, this time-related barrier represents an important obstacle to increasing their level of physical activity. In this instance the differences across educa- tion level within member states tended to be greater\nTable 5 Percentage of subjects in each member state selecting different perceived barriers to increasing levels of physical activity/exercise\nNot the\nLooking after\nCountry\nWork/study sporty type children/elderly\nNo need\nPoor health\nNo energy\nToo old\nOther\nAustria\nBelgium\nDenmark\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nGreece\nIreland\nItaly\nLuxembourg\nNetherlands\nPortugal\nSpain\nSweden\nUK\nEU average*\n12 than between member states. Among those with a tertiary education, 23% of subjects in Germany and\nSweden selected the barrier ‘work/study commitments’ compared to almost two-third of Italians with the same education level.\nFor those who mentioned the barrier ‘not the sporty type’, almost half of the respondents said they took part in no physical activity, compared to a quarter of those who did not mention this barrier. The percentage of respondents who mentioned ‘not the sporty type’ varied by current body image, with an increase from\n30% of subjects with current body image ﬁgures 1–3\n(low weight) to 45% of subjects with current body image ﬁgures 5–7 (overweight).\nParticipation in various physical activities was also looked at in terms of another perceived barrier ‘no need to do more’. Respondents who selected this barrier had higher rates of participation in gardening and walking and had lower levels of non-participation\n(24%), compared with those who did not select ‘no need to do more’ (32%). This 24% of EU subjects represents a resistant group of inactive people who feel they do not need to be more active and presents those developing programmes which encourage increased levels of activity in the population with a formidable challenge.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\nThis study was intended to ﬁnd new approaches to counteract the sedentary lifestyle of the European population. The results give much new information, especially for special risk groups. They demonstrate that most\nEuropean individuals are quite well- informed about lifestyle factors inﬂuencing health in a positive or negative way.

{"question": "RESULTS\nPerceived beneﬁts\nThe ﬁrst question aims to identify what motivates people to participate in physical activity across the EU.\nThe most important perceived reasons or beneﬁts for taking part in physical activity are summarized in\nTable 1. The top three reasons for participation in physical exercise were ‘to maintain good health’,\nFig. 1 Percentage of subjects mentioning or not mentioning ‘to maintain good health’ as a beneﬁt of taking part in physical activity (results of\nCHAID analysis). RI; response index, i.e. ratio of the percentage of positive answers in a subgroup divided by the percentage of positive answers in the entire sample\n‘to release tension’ and ‘to get ﬁt’. There was a wide interstate variation in the selections. ‘To maintain good health’ varied from 21% in Portugal to 55% in Spain.\nForty-one per cent of Italian subjects cited ‘to release tension’ as an important reason for participation in physical activity, compared to 16% of Swedish subjects.\nOtherwise, Swedish subjects were more concerned about getting ﬁt (36%) while only 8% of the Portuguese saw ‘to get ﬁt’ as an important motivation factor for participation in physical activity. The proportions of EU respondents believing ‘to socialize’, ‘to control weight’ and ‘to have fun’ were good reasons for participating in physical activity were 14%, 13% and\n10%, respectively. The variable ‘do not participate in any form of physical activity/exercise’ showed the greatest intercountry variation in values ranging from\n<1% in Finland to almost half of the Portuguese population.\nWhen the motivating factors for participation in physical exercise were examined by the various demographics, ‘for good health’ was regarded as being the most important variable across all demo- graphics, especially among those aged 55þ years and those with a primary-level education (Table 2).\nThe factors ‘achievement’, ‘competition’, ‘concentra- tion’ and other and uncertain answers were cited by less than 5% of the subjects and, therefore, are not given in the table.\nThe individuals mentioning\n‘to maintain good health’ as a reason for physical exercise were analysed by CHAID (Figure 1). The highest response index of 1.35 is found among women recognizing both diet and physical activity as important factors for health.\nThis index means that within this subgroup the portion of individuals believing in a positive health effect of these inﬂuencing factors is higher by approximately one-third than in the entire sample questioned. Male individuals with an identical answer- ing pattern show a smaller response index of only\n1.16. There is, however, no relationship between these answering proﬁles to the real physical activity level recorded by the same individuals.\nYounger subjects educated to tertiary level were more inclined to choose ‘to get ﬁt’ (Table 2). While 20% of EU respondents claim that ‘to be out of doors’ was a motivating factor for taking part in physical activity/ exercise, this level rose to 25% for those with primary- level education and to 30% for subjects aged 55þ years.\nTable 1 Percentage of subjects in each member state selecting different perceived motivating factors for participation in physical activity\nTo maintain\nTo release\nTo be out\nTo control\nDo not\nCountry good health tension\nTo get ﬁt of doors\nTo socialize weight\nFor fun participate\nAustria\nBelgium\nDenmark\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nGreece\nIreland\nItaly\nLuxembourg\nNetherlands\nPortugal\nSpain\nSweden\nUK\nEU average*\n* Weighted according to population size.\nTable 2 Percentage of EU subjects selecting different perceived motivating factors for participating in physical activity classiﬁed by demographics (age, sex and education level)\nAge (years)\nSex\nEducation level\nMotivating factors\nMale\nFemale\nPrimary\nSecondary\nTertiary\nTo release tension\nTo be out of doors\nTo maintain good health\nTo socialize\nTo control weight\nFor fun\nTo get ﬁt\nDo not participate\n‘To control weight’ was not perceived to be important in motivating subjects to participate in physical activity.

The ‘to release tension’ variable was regarded as more important for younger and middle- aged subjects and those with a secondary and tertiary- level education. This higher choice of ‘to release tension’ among these groups may be a reﬂection of their work routine or lifestyle.

This lack of speciﬁc information may cause not only a lack of motivation to increase the individual level of exercise, but also a lack in translating health- oriented knowledge into health-oriented behaviour.\nThus, there is only a limited or absence of stimulation to alter the personal lifestyle on a long-term scale. Only subgroups with elevated risk show a higher afﬁnity to draw personal consequences from their situation and to change their everyday habits. This can be demon- strated among obese and overweight females. These subjects are more likely to perceive a beneﬁt for weight control from their physical exercise than the rest of the population. However, the ability of subjects to estimate their personal level of activity is limited to a certain degree. One reason is that the term ‘physical activity/ exercise’ used in this study was deﬁned in a rather broad sense. The study participants were forced to associate with the term not only sport exercise, but also all their everyday activities at work and during leisure time. Even with this information participants tended to underestimate the extent and duration of activities not typically associated with the image of physical exercise. Analogous to the phenomena of over- and under-reporting in dietary records, a similar behaviour is likely to be found in records of physical activity. As a methodical consequence it seems to be better to supply close-ended questionnaires on levels of activity to participants, so they can better control their own answers. The quality of recording may also be improved by a detailed list of several activities and by some explanations how these activities have to be recorded in respect to their duration and intensity12,15,24.\nFrom the study results it is obvious that the majority of respondents associate physical activity and exercise with being more a strenuous task and duty than with fun, recreation and relaxation. Mostly, physical activity is equated to sports. Therefore, many respondents mention ‘not a sporty type’ or ‘too old’ as a barrier and use this statement as an excuse not to increase their levels of activity. This is true also for many overweight and obese subjects who reject the idea of doing any sports and increasing their level of physical activity.\nThey perceive a link between a lean body image and the level of activity. These subjects, especially older age groups, are not well enough informed about recent studies demonstrating the positive effects of moderate physical activity on health25–31.\nTo stimulate more people to be physically active it is necessary to be aware of the determinants of physical behaviour. There are a number of models which explain physical activity behaviour, but in general these include three sets of determinants: (1) knowledge and attitudes, (2) social inﬂuences, and (3) barriers and self-efﬁcacy32. In a review Sabha and Achterberg33 discussed the problems of recognition, interpretation and motivation arising in the complex of nutrition, activity and health-related behaviour. They demon- strated that outcome expectations, health belief and health value associated with health-related behaviour are not sufﬁcient to release the necessary health-related action of an individual. The perceived barriers within the individual’s consciousness can only be overcome by an improved self-efﬁcacy and distinctive self- conﬁdence.\nTo achieve a higher level", "response": "Improve public awareness of the benefits of physical activity in preventing and managing cardiovascular diseases; Encourage a broader definition of physical activity that includes everyday activities, not just sports; Implement close-ended questionnaires to improve the accuracy of physical activity records; Address perceived barriers to physical activity, such as the belief that physical activity is only for the \"sporty type\" or that it is too strenuous; Promote the idea that physical activity can be enjoyable and relaxing, not just a duty; Enhance self-efficacy and self-confidence to overcome barriers to physical activity"}

The perceived barriers within the individual’s consciousness can only be overcome by an improved self-efﬁcacy and distinctive self- conﬁdence.\nTo achieve a higher level of physical activity in the population, however, not only behavioural but also social aspects have to be considered. The social side of prevention has to take into account the opportunity available to people to implement altered activities into their lifestyle, the situation at work and education, the national conditions of health-promoting measures and the reputation of the desired behaviour within the society. Thus, the public health message to increase physical exercise in a population base seems to be very simple, as published in the USA: ‘Every US adult should accumulate 30 minutes or more of moderate- intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days of the week’34. However, to be successful with such recommendations new preventive programmes have to focus both on personal and environmental conditions of the individual and the population.\nFew studies in the EU, all of them on a national level, have looked at knowledge and attitudes towards physical activity35. The Allied Dunbar National Fitness\nSurvey conducted in 1992 in the UK is one example, and examined attitudes to physical activity as well as the motivating factors and barriers to participate in physical activity36. No European study has, however, looked at the stages of change towards physical activity. One approach in the US, aimed at encourag- ing people to be more active, uses the stages of change model (PACE)7. This model describes the changes that need to take place for a more physically active lifestyle. While there are many programmes to tackle obesity in different countries in the EU most do so in the absence of knowledge of the attitudes towards physical activity and body weight. They also do so in the absence of the perceived motivating factors and barriers to physical activity and the stages of change towards physical activity.\nWeight loss is best achieved by combining dietary intervention with increased amounts of physical activity. The most effective strategy for weight loss in either moderately obese or morbidly obese individuals appears to be a hypocaloric, low-fat diet combined with a moderate-intensity, moderate-duration resist- ance or aerobic exercise training programme. Increas- ing amounts of physical activity or maintaining high levels of physical activity for purposes of weight control might be most important in preventing the increases in weight known to occur with ageing, from the early twenties through to the late sixties. This pan-EU survey of consumer attitudes to physical activity, body weight and health is the ﬁrst study to examine the attitudes of EU consumers from all 15 member states, together with obtaining a measure of prevailing levels of activity, inactivity and self-reported body weight. Some strategy recommendations to increase levels of physical activity in the EU and to stem the continuing rise in obesity, by means of preventing further weight gain are proposed based on the data arising from this pan-EU consumer attitudinal survey. The preventive aspect of physical activity must be an area of priority for future research attempting to better understand the role of physical activity in weight regulation.", "response": "Improve self-efficacy and self-confidence to overcome perceived barriers to health-related action; consider social aspects such as lifestyle, work, education, and national health-promoting measures; focus on both personal and environmental conditions in preventive programs; implement the stages of change model to encourage physical activity; combine dietary intervention with increased physical activity for weight loss; prioritize research on the preventive role of physical activity in weight regulation."}
{"question": "- aged subjects and those with a secondary and tertiary- level education. This higher choice of ‘to release tension’ among these groups may be a reﬂection of their work routine or lifestyle. The percentage of subjects in each member state selecting ‘to release tension’ classiﬁed by gender is shown in Table 3. In almost all member states there was a clear education- related increase for both males and females. Compared to subjects educated to primary or secondary level, subjects with a tertiary-level education were more likely to choose this item as a perceived beneﬁt to participate in physical exercise.\nA CHAID analysis revealed that the beneﬁt ‘to control weight’ was most frequently mentioned (32%) by women perceiving themselves to be overweight and being physically active for 1.5–4.5 hours per week.\nOnly 21% of men with the same characteristics gave this answer. Twenty-three per cent of women and 18% of men wish to reduce their body weight by their effort in physical exercise. Surprisingly, these data do not correlate with the real body mass index (BMI) of the subjects.\nAmong women this motivation slightly increases parallel to the recorded physical exercise, women being active up to 1 hour, 1.5–4.5 hours and more than 5 hours per week mention the factor ‘to control weight’ with a frequency of 13%, 19% and 16%, respectively. This tendency was not observed among male subjects. There is also a positive relationship between the factor ‘to control weight’ and the self- estimated BMI of the subjects. Thirty-one per cent of overweight and 26% of obese women expect to normalize their perceived body weight by being active. Among obese men recording to be active more than 5 hours per week there is also a relatively high percentage (21%) of subjects who expect a normalizing effect on their body weight.\nThere was an age-related increase in those people selecting the response ‘I do not participate in any activity’, while the opposite trend occurred with increasing education level with 14% primary-educated subjects versus only 7% of those with a tertiary-level education selecting this variable. This relationship between education level and the selection of ‘I do not participate’ was examined further across the 15 member states (Table 4). While an education-related decrease occurred in all but one member state (Finland, where less than 1% of respondents with a primary, secondary or tertiary-level education did not engage\nTable 3 Percentage of subjects in each member state selecting ‘to release tension’ classiﬁed by education level and gender\nMale\nFemale\nCountry\nPrimary\nSecondary\nTertiary\nPrimary\nSecondary\nTertiary\nAustria\nBelgium\nDenmark\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nGreece\nIreland\nItaly\nLuxembourg\nNetherlands\nPortugal\nSpain\nSweden\nUK\nEU average*\n* Weighted according to population size.\nTable 4 Percentage of subjects in each member state who selected\n‘I do not participate in any physical activity/exercise’ classiﬁed by education level\nCountry\nPrimary\nSecondary\nTertiary\nAustria\nBelgium\nDenmark\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nGreece\nIreland\nItaly\nLuxembourg\nNetherlands\nPortugal\nSpain\nSweden\nUK\nEU average*\n7 in some form of exercise) there was considerable variation in the strength of decrease from a gradual decrease in Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain to a large reduction in Belgium, Greece, Luxembourg and\nPortugal. Indeed, Portugal was unique among the 15 member states in that the percentages in all education levels exceeded the other countries by a factor of two to three. As many as 61% of Portuguese subjects with primary-level education did not participate in any form of physical activity and this value dropped to just\n23% among those educated to tertiary level.\nConﬂicting statements can be observed analysing those subjects not perceiving a beneﬁt from physical exercise and simultaneously citing to be inactive.\nIndeed, only 10% of these individuals (12% of female,\n9% of male) recorded no physical activity. However,\n24% of men and 23% of women believing themselves to be inactive, were in fact participating in some physical activity for up to 1 hour per week.\nPerceived barriers\nThe second question aims to assess the perceived barriers which people may have to participating in physical activity. On observation of the EU average,\n‘work/study commitments’ was the most frequently perceived barrier cited for not increasing partici- pation in physical activity at 28%, followed by ‘not the sporty type’ at 25% (Table 5). The remaining perceived barriers to increase one’s physical activity were not regarded as being as important. Indeed the percentage of EU subjects selecting ‘looking after children/elderly relatives’ and ‘no need to do any more’ is", "response": "Encourage physical activity as a means to release tension, particularly among those with higher education levels"}
{"question": "share of investment costs is lower than the operative ones.\nFinally, also IRR deﬁnes the proﬁtability of this project. A possible concern for users of the IRR method is when the discount rate of a project is unknown, but in this case, it is signiﬁcantly greater than the cost opportunity of capital. The analysis of cash ﬂows underlines the presence of a single change of sign (it is negative during the year zero and it is positive in the following years due to the gross proﬁt). For this reason, the possible issue of multiple values of IRR is not veriﬁed.\nNPV, DPBT, and IRR measure the proﬁtability of a project, while other two indexes (GMR, ROI) are referred only to a single year of activity. It is linear with the role of balance sheet that characterizes the world of ﬁrms. Useful indications are provided, but these indexes are more appropriate for other scopes as: (i) a comparison with the value of benchmarking of the sector; (ii) a comparison with other\nﬁrms employed in the same sector; (iii) a monitoring to measure the performance of a company over time; and, (iv) for the purposes of the regulatory rules.\nGross proﬁt is the difference between the annual revenues and the annual operating costs.\nGross margin is the direct percentage of proﬁt in the sale price. Its positive value is determined\n13 of 19 by the revenues that are greater than the operative costs (6305 k€ against 5306 €). When this value becomes negative, not only it does not produce wealth, but it even generates economic losses.\nNet Proﬁt also considers the proﬁt tax and the depreciation in comparison to the gross proﬁt.\nROI determines how a purchase is proﬁtable. Its positive value is determined by the positive value of net proﬁt. ROI and GMR are two metrics that give different information. For example, if money is invested in a project, ROI measures the result of the added investment. Instead, GMR indicates whether revenues are going up faster than costs.\n3.5. Economic Analysis—Alternative Scenarios\nThe aim of this sub-section is to give solidity to economic results obtained in the baseline scenario.\nIn fact, they are based on the assumption of a set of input parameters. Hence, a variance of the expected results could occur. This issue can be overcome by implementing a sensitivity analysis on the critical variables [38].\nThe choice of critical variables is linked to the results proposed in Figure 5 regarding the main items that characterize the cash ﬂows. A pessimistic and an optimistic scenario are evaluated for each critical variable and a variation of ± 20% is applied.\n•\nThe zeolite has a weight equal to four-ﬁfths of discounted cash inﬂows. Its price of reference is equal to 1150 €/ton (see Table 1). The potential values of 920 €/ton and 1380 €/ton are hypothesized in alternative scenarios.\n•\nRaw materials have a weight equal to one-third of discounted cash outﬂows. In particular, the net cost of NaOH (50% w/w) covers 35.7% of this cost, followed by the net cost of sulfuric acid with the 30%. NaOH 50% sol. has a baseline value of 150 €/ton and alternative values of 120 €/ton and 180 €/ton are proposed. Instead, 96%wt H2SO4 when considering its recycling has a value of reference of 100 €/ton and potential alternative values are 80 €/ton and 120 €/ton.\n•\nWaste treatment/disposal have a weight slightly lower than raw materials (−3.5%). In particular, liquid waste disposal covers 56.9% of this cost and the remaining share is linked to the solid one.\nThe difference is not signiﬁcant and both variables are analysed. Solid waste has a baseline value of 130 €/ton and alternative values of 104 €/ton and 156 €/ton are hypothesized. Regarding liquid waste, instead, 120 €/ton is the baseline value and 96 €/ton and 144 €/ton are the alternative values.\n•\nA macro-variable of all cash ﬂows is represented by the cost opportunity of capital. This variable measures the return coming from an alternative project, which has the same risk level. It is hypothesized to equal 5%. In this case, four scenarios are assessed with values varying from 3% up to 7%.\nThe presentation of six critical variables has determined the elaboration of fourteen alternative case studies.\nSeveral indexes change", "response": "Utilize NPV, DPBT, and IRR for comprehensive project profitability assessment; Employ GMR and ROI for annual performance evaluation and benchmarking; Monitor company performance over time using financial metrics; Implement regulatory rules based on financial performance indicators; Evaluate the impact of zeolite price fluctuations on discounted cash inflows; Assess the influence of raw material costs, particularly NaOH and sulfuric acid, on project expenses; Analyze the effects of waste treatment and disposal costs on overall project economics; Consider the cost of capital in financial evaluations and assess its impact on project viability."}
{"question": "minimum value is equal to 34.1%, which is signiﬁcantly greater than the cost opportunity of capital used in this analysis.\nGMR proposes a comparison between revenues and operating costs. Such an index is positive, even in the worst scenario (equal to 0.4%). In fact, the value of annual revenues is greater than the operating costs, but, when also considering investment costs, the proﬁtability is not accomplished.\nThis demonstrates as this index has a great limit. The value is signiﬁcantly low, but it does not give any information on relevant data of a project (as cost opportunity of capital and lifetime of the project).\nThe same is veriﬁed also for ROI.\nThe concept of circular economy requires not only to preserve the environmental value through initiatives of recovery/recycling as those deﬁned in this work, but also at the same time economic opportunities must be developed. The sole recovery of REEs from spent E-cat is absolutely unproﬁtable, so the production of zeolite plays a key-role. However, also the presence of a disposal fee is required to make recycling of spent E-cat proﬁtable. In this direction, another alternative scenario can be evaluated considering the absence of a disposal fee. A BEP analysis is conducted on the price of zeolite—Figure 8.\n920 €/ton\n1070 €/ton\n1150 €/ton\n1305 €/ton\n1380 €/ton\nPrice of zeolite\nNPV (k€)\nFigure 8. Break even point analysis—Price of zeolite in absence of disposal fee.\n1150 €/ton is no longer veriﬁed. In fact, NPV is negative and is equal to −5149 k€ (a difference of about 7319 k€—see Figure 7). At the same time, in the optimistic scenario in which the price of zeolite is increased by 20%, NPV is positive (equal to 2032 k€). This economic result is lower than that from the baseline scenario (2170 k€), despite that the price of zeolite is increased of 230 €/ton.\nConsequently, the zeolite has a key-role in the economic analysis, but in absence of disposal fee for\nE-cat collection, the proﬁtability is signiﬁcantly lower. The proﬁtability is achieved with a price of the zeolite equal to 1305 €/ton without the disposal fee. Majority of zeolites are manufactured using alkaline and alkaline earth metals. The most common natural zeolites include analcime, chabazite, clinoptilolite, erionite, ferrierite, heulandite, laumontite, mordenite, and phillipsite. Natural and synthetic zeolites are most commonly used in various end-use industries, owing to various properties, including unique adsorption, molecular sieve, superior catalytic, and ion-exchange properties. Natural zeolites were the largest product segment, accounting for over 60% of the global market volume in\n2014. Synthetic zeolites market demand has been tremendously increasing over the past few years.\nMost common synthetic zeolites include types A, X, Y, and ZMS-5. The segment accounted for nearly\n40% in 2014 and share is expected to increase by the end of 2022. Growing utilization of these zeolites in the petroleum industry, owing to its ability to purify gas streams, is expected to be the primary factor for the demand growth over the forecast period. The global zeolite market was valued at around\nUSD 3.50 billion in 2014 and it is expected to reach USD 4.50 billion in 2020 and over 2000 ktons of zeolites produced worldwide, both natural and synthetic [39].\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\nIn this paper, a novel recycling process was developed for the full recycling of spent E-cat, also known as FCC catalyst. Lanthanum and cerium were recovered by a leaching stage with sulfuric acid solution, thus precipitated as RE sulphates with NaOH. The solid residue from the leaching stage is used for the synthesis of zeolite. The analysis demonstrated that zeolite Na-A is the most concentrated phase, and minor amounts of Na-X and sodalite are also present. Nevertheless, changing the synthesis conditions (amount of Na2CO3, roasting, and hydrothermal stage temperature and time) it could be possible to maximize the Na-A phase. This is the aim of the next experimental campaign.\nSpent sulfuric acid solution is regenerated by nanoﬁltration, and also most of", "response": "Implement a disposal fee for E-cat collection to enhance the profitability of recycling"}
{"question": ", but Al2SO4 and small amount of Al(OH)3 cannot be excluded. The XRD spectrum of the RE salt was indeed not crystalline and characterized by large and not well-deﬁned peaks. This RE concentrate shall be leached again and La be separated from Ce by solvent extraction.\nHence, the precipitated salt can be sold to companies with expertise in separation and reﬁning of REEs like Rhodia (France), Umicore (Belgium) or Solvay (Belgium).\n3.3. Characterization of the Synthesized Zeolite\nAfter the synthesis procedure that is described in Section 2.5, the zeolite from the acid leaching was fully characterized. In particular, the SSA was 83.2 m2/g, whereas the BJH cumulative average pore volume was 0.062 cm3/g with an average pore size of 3 nm. Spent E-cat and synthetic zeolite obtained from the hydrothermal procedure are shown in Figure 2. The XRD spectrum of the latter is shown in Figure 3, whereas Figure 4 proposes a SEM picture of the same zeolite. The zeolite is light brown in color, whereas the spent E-cat is grey.\nFigure 2. Spent ﬂuid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst (left) and synthetic zeolite (right).\nFigure 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum of the synthetic zeolite.\nFigure 4. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) picture of the synthetic zeolite.\nThe main phase detected in the zeolite was Na-A, with formula Na12Al12Si12O48·27H2O.\nSmall percentages of dehydrated zeolite Na-X (Na92Al92Si100O384) and Cl-free sodalite (Na8Al6Si6O24), another aluminosilicate mineral, were also present: this means that the conversion to phase-A was not complete. The zeolite Na-A presents a cubic crystalline system with the lattice parameters a = b\n= c = 24.61 Å and α = β = γ = 90◦. The presence of high crystallinity was demonstrated by the high intensity of the peaks. Na-A is the major constituent phase (around 91%wt) and spheroidal aggregates of remaining sodalite and Na-X phase. Table 5 shows the composition of the main elements of the zeolite that was obtained from the residue of the sulfuric acid leaching.\nTable 5.

Economic Evaluation Report—Baseline Scenario\nThe description of the technical aspects was already elaborated and in this phase of the work, the economic analysis is developed. There is a clear relationship between two perspectives. The simulation software quantiﬁes the several amounts of resources that were employed in the process and some economic results (GMR, ROI) are obtained directly by this software, while other results (NPV,\nDPBT, IRR) are elaborated through Excel programme—Table 6.\nTable 6.

In fact, the evaluation of this typology of investment ﬁrstly considers the environmental advantages derived from the recovery of these wastes and at the same time the achievement of environmental goals set by the European Union (COM (2017) 490 ﬁnal). The following step is represented by the economic study. NPV quantiﬁes the amount of potential proﬁts when considering the lifetime of the project. The value obtained is extremely relevant: it is equal to 2170 k€. NPV is a realistic metric for decision makers because the DCF method is based on two relevant aspects: (i) the time value of the money and (ii) the lifetime of the project.\nThe distribution of cash ﬂows permits to understand this result. From the revenues side, the recovery of zeolite plays a key role. Its weight is equal to about three quarters (77%). The price of RE oxides is greater than that of zeolite, but the amount of materials recovered in this waste is extremely lower (about 5%). It is opportune to underline as the REO concentrate represents the lowest value among the three revenues of the plant. This conﬁrms that the recovery of REEs from spent E-cat is unproﬁtable, even if they would be separated and recovered with 99.9% grade. The use of raw materials (29%) and the phases linked to the waste treatment and/or disposal (26%) are the main items of costs. Instead, the share of investment costs is not relevant (8%). The main item of the materials cost is due to NaOH, used in solution for precipitation of La and Ce, as well as for hydrothermal treatment,\n12 of 19 with nearly 837 k€/year. The use of Na2CO3 (around 277 k€/year) in the roasting stage results in signiﬁcant savings with respect to the use of sodium hydroxide. Despite the recycling of sulfuric acid solution, the cost for such reagent is equal to 506 k€/year (cost of fresh acid only). Industrial water is another raw material, but around 85% is reused after the wastewater treatment. The disposal cost of solid and liquid waste is almost high, but the process produces a great amount of sludge and waste solution containing metals. This cost is equal to 644 k€ and 851 k€, respectively—Figure 5.\nE-cat collection (disposal fee)\nRE oxides\nZeolite\nRevenues\nOther\nLabor dependent\nInvestment\nUtilities\nFacility dependent\nWaste treatment\nRaw materials\nCosts\nFigure 5. The distribution of discounted cash ﬂows (baseline scenario).\nDPBT is coherent with the result of NPV. A cut-off period is not ﬁxed in this work but certainly the result is positive, since those cash ﬂows allow the re-entering from the investment already at the end of the second year. This depends on three elements: (i) the positive value of gross proﬁt, (ii) the application of third-party funds that distribute the investment cost over the years of loan, and (iii) the share of investment costs is lower than the operative ones.\nFinally, also IRR deﬁnes the proﬁtability of this project. A possible concern for users of the IRR method is when the discount rate of a project is unknown, but in this case, it is signiﬁcantly greater than the cost opportunity of capital.

{"question": "RESULTS\nIn this section, a quick overview on the main results achieved during the experimental campaign is given. After the results from the characterization of the spent FCCC (Section 3.1), the extraction yields for La, Ce, Al, and Si are reported in Section 3.2, whereas in Section 3.3, the zeolite obtained from the synthesis procedure is fully characterized. Several economic indexes (NPV, DPBT, IRR,\nGMR, and ROI) are proposed in Section 3.4 regarding the baseline scenario. In addition, Section 3.5 investigates the variation of these indexes in function of critical variables.\n3.1. Characterization of Spent FCCC\nThe concentration of the main elements is shown in Table 3. It underlines that the total concentration of REs is rather low.\nTable 3.

The PSD was a Gaussian curve centered at 80.4 µm, with a Sauter’s diameter D [2,3] equal to 73.6 µm.\n3.2. Extraction and Recovery of REEs\nThe extraction yields of the main elements as a function of reaction time are listed in Table 4; such yields are reported as medium values and standard deviation.\nTable 4. Extraction yield for the main elements (ICP-OES).\nSample\nExtraction Yield (%)\nCe\nLa\nSi\nAl\nH2SO4 1 h\nH2SO4 2 h\nH2SO4 3 h\nHence, the best extraction yields for La and Ce were obtained after 3 h. The extraction of Si was lower than 2%, but such element is present as colloidal silica that, once the solution cools down, makes the ﬁltration difﬁcult. For this reason, the following ﬁltration and precipitation shall be carried out with warm solution. The extraction of Al was low as well, but the concentration in leach liquor was not negligible. The initial pH of solution was 0.45 and NaOH was added to increase the pH to\n2. The precipitation occurred slowly as soon as the NaOH solution was added. The precipitation of insoluble NaRE(SO4)3·H2O is expressed, as follows [37]:\nLa2(SO4)3 + 2 Na+ + SO42- + 2 H2O →2 NaLa(SO4)2·H2O\nCe2(SO4)3 + 2 Na+ + SO42- +2 H2O →2 NaCe(SO4)2·H2O\nThis precipitation mechanism as double sulfate salt is also caused by the addition of Na2SO4 instead of NaOH [17]. The solubility of NaRE(SO4)2·H2O in water (in particular, for Ce, La, Pr, Nd,\nPm, Sm, Eu, Sc) is very low and it decreases with the increase of temperature [18]. After cooling down, the white salt was ﬁltered, washed with distilled water and dried at 105 ◦C for 24 h, and thus used for the analysis. The results of ICP-OES showed the following element concentration: La 36.54%, Ce 2.87%,\nNa 2.88%, Al 6.14%, and Si 0.7% by weight. The rest is mainly water, oxygen, and sulphur.\nThe XRD analysis indicated that the RE precipitate was mainly composed of NaLa(SO4)2·xH2O and NaCe(SO4)2·xH2O, but Al2SO4 and small amount of Al(OH)3 cannot be excluded. The XRD spectrum of the RE salt was indeed not crystalline and characterized by large and not well-deﬁned peaks. This RE concentrate shall be leached again and La be separated from Ce by solvent extraction.\nHence, the precipitated salt can be sold to companies with expertise in separation and reﬁning of REEs like Rhodia (France), Umicore (Belgium) or Sol", "response": "Implement a disposal fee for E-cat collection to enhance the profitability of recycling"}

Nevertheless, changing the synthesis conditions (amount of Na2CO3, roasting, and hydrothermal stage temperature and time) it could be possible to maximize the Na-A phase. This is the aim of the next experimental campaign.\nSpent sulfuric acid solution is regenerated by nanoﬁltration, and also most of the water is recycled back after treatment.\nThe economic analysis demonstrated that the process is proﬁtable if the solid residue from the leaching stage is used for production of zeolite; moreover, another important revenue of the plant is the disposal fee for the E-cat. The current metal market prices do not make the recovery of La and Ce proﬁtable, as their concentration in spent E-cat is rather low. The baseline scenario is proﬁtable and\n17 of 19 several alternative case studies present a positive sign of NPV. However, the proﬁtability cannot be veriﬁed in two case studies:\n•\nThe ﬁrst concerns the price of zeolite, when such value is lower than 1070 €/ton in presence of the disposal fee for E-cat collection.\n•\nThe second regards the price of zeolite when this value is lower than 1305 €/ton in the absence of the disposal fee for E-cat collection.\nThe process and the relevant plant, thus, demonstrated a reliable and useful management of spent\nE-cat; although part of such catalyst is already used for the partial replacement of cement and mortar powders, powder in refractory materials and mineral woods, the majority of it is still landﬁlled.

In this case, four scenarios are assessed with values varying from 3% up to 7%.\nThe presentation of six critical variables has determined the elaboration of fourteen alternative case studies.\nSeveral indexes change in function of both variables regarding revenues and costs—Table 7—while cost opportunity of capital does not modify the value of balance sheet (GMR and ROI) and at the same time the value of IRR is constant (baseline value equal to 56.7% is always greater than values examined in this work)—Figure 6.\nTable 7.

In this situation, it is opportune to elaborate a BEP analysis.

Break even point analysis—Price of zeolite in presence of disposal fee.\nBEP underlines that the proﬁtability of this project is strictly linked to the price of zeolite. In the baseline scenario, a consistent proﬁt is obtained (equal to 2170 k€), but in a pessimistic scenario, a relevant economic loss is reached (equal to −4942 k€). From a mathematical point of view, the price of zeolite that characterizes NPV = 0 is contained in the range from 920 €/ton to 1150 €/ton. The high level of accuracy of this analysis deﬁnes the value of 1070 €/ton that is close to the baseline value and it is lower than 7%.\nThe other critical variables, instead, do not modify the proﬁtability of the project. In fact,\nNPV presents its lower value (equal to 1100 k€) when the cost of the liquid waste is 144 €/ton.\nIn this same scenario, DPBT is equal to four years that is, however, a reasonable value for investors.\nIt remains ﬁxed equal to two years when the cost opportunity of capital is modiﬁed. NPV increased by\n18% if the cost opportunity of capital is equal to 3%, while it decreased by 15% when this variable is equal to 7%.\nDPBT in other scenarios varies from two years to three years. There is a particular situation, only when the price of zeolite is modiﬁed. The investment is recovered already after one year if the price of zeolite is ﬁxed to 1380 €/ton, while the value >15 indicates that during the lifetime of the project, the value of discounted cash inﬂows never will be match one of discounted cash outﬂows.\nIn this scenario, IRR cannot be calculated, since all cash ﬂows are always negative (n.d. acronym stands for “not deﬁnable”). In other scenarios, the minimum value is equal to 34.1%, which is signiﬁcantly greater than the cost opportunity of capital used in this analysis.\nGMR proposes a comparison between revenues and operating costs.

In fact, the value of annual revenues is greater than the operating costs, but, when also considering investment costs, the proﬁtability is not accomplished.\nThis demonstrates as this index has a great", "response": "Conduct a break-even point (BEP) analysis to determine the minimum price of zeolite required for a net present value (NPV) of zero"}

{"question": "RESULTS\n2.1. Thermodynamic Calculations\nCO2 methanation reaction is exothermic in nature, where 4 moles of H2 reacts with one mole of\nCO2 to form one mole of CH4 and 2 moles of H2O as shown in the main reaction (Equation (1)).\nAdditionally, this main reaction is also followed by an exothermic reversed water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and endothermic CO methanation, as shown in Equations (3) and (4), respectively.\nH2 + CO2 ↔CO + H2O\n∆H298 K = 41 kJ/mol.\nCO + 3H2 ↔CH4 + H2O\n∆H298 K = −206 kJ/mol\nThe overall CO2 methanation reaction (Equation (1)) is associated with a decrease in the overall number of gas molecules and releasing heat. Hence, according to Le Chatelier’s principle, the CO2 methanation process should favor high pressure and low process temperature for high methane yield [29]. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed using Aspen Hysys V11 by the Gibbs free energy minimization method to identify the reaction conditions with maximum CO2 conversion and methane selectivity. Figure 3 shows the eﬀect of temperature and pressure versus\nCO2 conversion.\nFigure 3. Thermodynamic equilibrium curve of (a) CO2 conversion(XCO2) and methane selectivity\n(SCH4) at 8 bar, 200–600 ◦C, (b) CO2 conversion (XCO2) at 1, 4, 8, and 16 bar pressure at 200–600 ◦C using CO2:H2, 1:4 ratio.\nFigure 3a shows the temperature effect on CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity. The conversion kinetics are infeasible at low temperatures, while at high temperatures, the reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable. Almost complete CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity are observed at a temperature of 200 ◦C, and further increases in the temperature cause the CO2 conversion to decrease. At a stoichiometric H2:CO2 ratio of 4, the optimum temperature range for CO2 methanation is 200 to 500 ◦C, where CO2 conversion drops by only 20% and the CH4 selectivity is 99%. With an increase in the temperature above 500 ◦C, the CO2 conversion drops with CH4 selectivity. CO and carbon formation is favored at a high-temperature, which reduces CH4 selectivity drastically [30]. Figure 3b shows the eﬀect of pressure on CO2 conversion at diﬀerent temperatures. The calculations reveal that an increase in the pressure favors the methanation reaction.\nAdditionally, according to Jurgensen et al., the elevated pressure increases the temperature at which carbon deposits occur [31]; hence, reaction at high pressure has dual advantages. However, the CO2 conversion is increased with increasing pressure up to a certain pressure, while further increase in the pressure does not signiﬁcantly increase the CO2 conversion at high temperature. Hence, all reactions were performed at an optimum 8 bar pressure.\nReactor design plays an important role in exothermic CO2 methanation, especially using adiabatic reactors. The beneﬁts of adiabatic reactors are that they are relatively simple in construction and maintenance, but it is not easy to manage the heat generated [32]. There is a risk of CO and/or carbon formation in case of too high reactor temperature. CO can be just a byproduct, but the catalyst surface’s carbon formation may completely deactivate the catalyst over time. Hence reaction heat management is of utmost importance to avoid carbon formation and catalytic deactivation. Generally, the heat is either managed by a specially tailored design reactor system, eﬃcient cooling ﬂuid surrounding the reactor, or diluting the feed gas with an inert gas to lower the heat generation per volume. Our state-of-the-art reactor design managed the heat generation per volume by adding total reactant feed in small portions at the inlet of all four reactors and circulating eﬃcient cooling oil. This process resulted in stable temperature management within the optimal temperature range (<500 ◦C), and we achieved almost equilibrium conversion as expected by the above simulations (see also the discussion in Section 3).\nTable 1. shows the expected temperature of the adiabatic reactor system, which was calculated by\nAspen Hysys. The actual reactor temperature recorded by a thermocouple placed in the middle of the reactor showed that the reactor temperature was within the optimum range.\nTable 1. Expected and actual reactor temperature.\nReactors\nExpected temperature (◦C)\nActual reactor temperature (◦C)\n2", "response": "Optimize methanation reaction temperature between 200 and 500 °C for high CO2 conversion and methane selectivity; Increase pressure to favor methanation reaction and delay carbon deposition; Implement efficient heat management strategies such as tailored reactor design, cooling fluids, or inert gas dilution to prevent catalyst deactivation and carbon formation; Use a staged feed introduction to control heat generation and maintain stable reactor temperatures within the optimal range."}
{"question": "the carbon deposition was negligible on the catalyst.\nFurthermore, these observations were in good agreement with the decrease in the surface area and no major loss in catalytic activity.\nFigure 7. Thermo-gravimetric analysis of fresh (a) and used (b) catalysts.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\nDirect methanation of CO2 from an operating biogas plant was tested with varying reaction conditions. A four-stage ﬁxed bed reactor system was developed to achieve maximum biomethane yield. The temperature proﬁle shows that the reactor temperature could be maintained within the optimum range (<500 ◦C) according to simulation calculations. A stable operation of a few hours with almost 8 Nm3/h biogas feed showed more than 90% CO2 conversion with a small concentration of H2 and CO in the upgraded biogas. The quality of the produced gas was enough to inject into the gas grid. However, an unrestrictive biomethane injection into the gas grid at the test site needs further cleaning by removing H2, CO, and unreacted CO2, which could easily be achieved by a gas separator system. The catalyst stability under harsh reaction conditions was supported by catalyst characterization after the reactions. Interestingly, Ni phase transformation to Ni2S3 was observed after reaction with loss in surface area, which needs further investigation using in-situ or operando characterization techniques. The catalyst does not show deactivation or loss in activity within the tested period and no major carbon deposits.\nIn summary, the demonstration of direct CO2 methanation of real biogas using H2 produced by water electrolysis was implemented successfully. The newly developed desulfurization unit worked well with almost complete sulfur removal and without any chemical waste production. A successful long-time stability test with 8 Nm3/h biogas feed showed a Technical Readiness Level of 7. This result is an important and crucial step towards upscaling and industrial implementation of (desulfurization,\nH2 production, and CO2 methanation) state-of-the-art technology at the commercial level.\nAuthor Contributions: P.M., L.P.N. conceptualization, funding acquisition; G.G. designed and build the pilot demonstration plant, J.P.R., G.G. methodology and designed the experiments; R.G. analyzed the experimental data, characterized the material, and performed thermodynamic calculations; F.B.G. catalyst characterization;\nR.G., S.N.B.V., P.L.F. prepared and wrote the original draft; R.G., P.M., L.P.N., G.G., F.B.G., P.L.F. involved in review and ﬁnal editing.

{"question": "before the reactor’s daily startup, hydrogen treatment might have reactivated some of the nickel sites [38]. A complete mechanistic study of sulfur poisoning was not a part of this pilot plant test campaign. The diﬀraction peak at 26.2◦in both diﬀraction patterns are from the graphite base (JCPDS = 75-2078) used to support the catalyst sample for XRD analysis.\nThe Temperature Programmed Reduction of H2 (H2-TPR) is usually employed for estimating the reducibility of the catalyst. Figure 6 shows the H2-TPR results for the fresh and used catalysts, respectively. The reduction patterns for a fresh catalyst showed two main reduction peaks; one at a lower temperature around 244 ◦C and another at a higher temperature above 550 ◦C. A sharp hydrogen consumption peak at 244 ◦C was attributed to reducing free NiO or weakly bonded NiO with Al2O3.\nAt 579 ◦C, a broad peak corresponded to the reduction of a NiO, which is strongly bonded with\nAl2O3 [39]. A reduction at 400–600 ◦C generally corresponds to less reducible NiO species present in an aluminum oxide rich phase [40]. The H2-TPR of used catalysts showed low-intensity peaks at 213,\n252 ◦C indicating that very low reducible nickel species were present in the catalyst after the reaction.\nFigure 6. H2-TPR of the catalyst before and after reaction at 8 bar, 350−500 ◦C.\nThe BET surface area results for fresh and used catalysts are shown in Table 2. It is seen that the surface area of the used catalyst decreased by 75.6 m2/g compared to the fresh catalyst. The catalyst reduction, carbon deposition on the catalyst surface leading to pore blockage, and crystalline phase transition leading to metal and support sintering are mainly responsible for the loss in the surface area [41–43].\nTable 2. BET surface area of the fresh and used catalyst.\nCatalyst\nSBET (m2/g)\nFresh catalyst\nUsed catalyst\nIn our case, XRD shows phase transition and increase in crystalline size due to the Ni3S2 phase, and this could be the reason for the loss in the surface area as the Ni3S2 phase can accelerate the\n8 of 13 particle sintering and loss of surface area [44–46]. However, no signiﬁcant catalytic activity loss was observed during the catalytic reaction, which shows that carbon species blocked no active species.\nFurther detailed studies are needed to clarify this catalyst phase formation and its relationship with catalytic activity.\nIt is reported that the carbon deposition starts from the formation of graphitic carbon (150–250 ◦C) and amorphous carbon (250–500 ◦C) islands on the catalyst surface. The carbon species may encapsulate the active nickel sites, causing the catalyst’s deactivation, or the carbon may form ﬁlamentous carbon on the catalyst surface. The latter does not encapsulate active sites and will only reduce the catalytic activity [47]. Since we did not observe drastic changes in the catalytic activity over a 6-month test campaign, the latter type of carbon formations may very likely occur and thus be responsible for the loss in the overall surface area along with sulfur poisoning.\nThe fresh and used catalyst was tested for the decomposition of any species using thermo- gravimetric analysis (TGA). Figure 7a,b shows the TGA of a fresh and used catalyst, respectively.\nThe results indicated that the total weight loss for fresh and used catalysts was ca. 8.2 and 9.6%, respectively. The fresh catalyst’s loss was due to water evaporation, decomposition of carbonates, and surface hydroxyl species. For the used catalyst, the change in weight loss was only 1.4%, which was negligible compared to the total time the catalyst was in operation. The small changes in the TGA graph of the used catalyst observed at 170 and 700 ◦C could be due to surface adsorbed species or carbon [48], but no major weight loss indicates that the carbon deposition was negligible on the catalyst.\nFurthermore, these observations were in good agreement with the decrease in the surface area and no major loss in catalytic activity.\nFigure 7.

The actual reactor temperature recorded by a thermocouple placed in the middle of the reactor showed that the reactor temperature was within the optimum range.\nTable 1. Expected and actual reactor temperature.\nReactors\nExpected temperature (◦C)\nActual reactor temperature (◦C)\n2.2. Experimental Results\nThe pilot plant methanation system ran for approximately 6 months of operation hours, including the startup and shut down by varying reaction conditions to establish stable operating conditions.\nThe methanation process ran continuously for 6 h at optimized reaction conditions using 8 Nm3/h biogas and 16 Nm3/h H2, and it was stable over the operation hours. Figure 4 shows the experimental data from the methanation reactor for CO2 conversion. The CO2 conversion was approximately 90% and remained almost steady over the test period. The methane selectivity was >99%. The catalyst was used for more than 500 h and did not show any sign of deactivation or activity loss over the entire period. Similar observations were also seen from catalyst characterization, where no signiﬁcant carbon formation was observed by XRD, BET, TGA, which could suppress or inhibit the catalyst activity.\nPhysically no carbon formation was observed on the catalyst surface at the inlet of the reactor, and no pressure drop change was observed across the reactors throughout the test campaign. This result indicated no signiﬁcant carbon formation which could block the ﬁxed bed reactors.\nFigure 4. CO2 conversion from raw, cleaned biogas at 350–500 ◦C, 8 bar using CH4:CO2:H2 = 23.1:15.4:61.5.\n2.3. Catalyst Characterization\nFigure 5 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of a fresh and used catalyst, respectively. The fresh catalyst shows broad XRD peaks corresponding to a small noncrystalline nature. The characteristic diffraction peaks at 37.2, 43.1, 62.9, and 75.2◦corresponded to NiO (JCPDS = 47–1049), while the broad peak at 44◦could be attributed to both NiO and Ni [33,34]. According to the database, the diffraction peaks at 44.5 and 51.9◦were assigned to Ni (JCPDS = 87–0712). A small fraction of a catalyst sample after the reaction was taken from all four reactors inlet after a more than 6-month test campaign. The used catalyst diffraction pattern shows that the nickel crystallites have grown in size; according to the XRD database (JCPDS = 44–1418), most of the peaks are assigned to the Ni3S2 phase.\nFigure 5. XRD of the catalyst before (black color) and after (red color) reaction at 8 bar, 350–500 ◦C.\nThe Ni3S2 phase formation after the reaction indicated that feed biogas was contaminated with sulfur-containing compounds. This could be because of a sudden interruption of the desulfurization process during the test campaign. The backup carbon ﬁlter could not remove all the bulk sulfur from the biogas to ppb levels required by the Ni catalyst. A potential future improvement could be a sacriﬁcial ZnO adsorbent before the active Ni catalyst, which can reduce the sulfur level to ppb in\n7 of 13 case of such unforeseen conditions [35,36]. Still, it was surprising to see that the catalyst was active and showing more than 90% CO2 conversion at all the time. This could be because the catalyst had better sulfur tolerance capability, or there was a possibility that only the top layer of the catalyst was poisoned as it was ﬁrst to expose to biogas. Moreover, later, part of the catalyst was still active, which provides an active surface for the methanation reaction. According to Hepola et al., sulfur’s catalyst poisoning decreased along the catalyst bed [37]. Furthermore, before the reactor’s daily startup, hydrogen treatment might have reactivated some of the nickel sites [38]. A complete mechanistic study of sulfur poisoning was not a part of this pilot plant test campaign. The diﬀraction peak at 26.2◦in both diﬀraction patterns are from the graphite base (JCPDS = 75-2078) used to support the catalyst sample for XRD analysis.\nThe Temperature Programmed Reduction of H2 (H2", "response": "Implement a sacrificial ZnO adsorbent before the active Ni catalyst to reduce sulfur levels to ppb"}

Participants with prolonged sitting time showed signiﬁcantly worse overall\nHRQoL, even after adjusting for age, sex, marital status, educational level, occupation, household income level, physical activity, current smoking status, alcohol intake, chronic diseases, and depression.\nSeveral studies have examined the relationship between sitting time and quality of life in older people [7,18,19]. Garcia-Hermoso et al. found that prolonged sitting time increased the risk of cognitive impairment regardless of the level of physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity could attenuate these negative effects [8]. A longitudinal study of community-dwelling older adults in Spain stated that more time spent watching TV was related to a higher risk of depressive and psychological distress symptoms in women [20]. A recent study indicated that knee joint pain, hip joint pain, and low back pain were associated with sitting time (≥7.5 h/day) in older adults [21]. Similarly, a cross-sectional study found that a high level of sitting time (>7 h/day) was related to low back pain, and individuals with a prolonged sitting time with low physical activity had a higher risk of low back pain [22]. Yen et al. showed that prolonged sitting time was signiﬁcantly associated with limited mobility in older adults. The results of previous studies are consistent with those of the present study in that prolonged sitting time was associated with all of the EQ-5D dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Additionally, we presented the relationship between physical activity and quality of life, independent of sitting time. Both prolonged sitting time and physical activity were independently associated with the EQ-5D dimensions of mobility, self-care, and usual activity. Physical inactivity was not statistically signiﬁcant in the pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression domains of EQ-5D, independent of sitting time.\nHowever, prolonged sitting time was statistically signiﬁcant in the pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression domains of the EQ-5D, independent of physical activity.\nThe present study examined the combined impact of sitting time and physical ac- tivity on HRQoL by comparing four groups according to their sitting time and physical activity level. Our ﬁndings suggest that individuals with a prolonged sitting time and low physical activity levels had a worse HRQoL and that the high sitting time/active group had a lower risk of worse results for the usual activity and pain/discomfort domains of HRQoL than the high sitting time/inactive group. In other words, physical activity could weaken the negative association of prolonged sitting time on the usual activity and pain/discomfort domains of HRQoL. A cross-sectional study conducted in the US\n7 of 9 on adults (aged ≥20 years) reported that short sedentary time (< 438 min/day) and high moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (≥165 min/week) were associated with better a\nHRQoL, particularly the general health, physical health, and activity limitation compo- nents. However, there was no signiﬁcant combined association of sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with poor mental health [14]. Unlike the results of their study, the present study showed that individuals with a prolonged sitting time and low physical activity had problems associated with anxiety/depression, as well as problems associated with the mobility, self-care, and usual activity domains of quality of life.\nKorea has the fastest aging population among the Organization for Economic Coop- eration and Development (OECD) countries. By 2050, 71% of the population of Korea is expected to be aged 65 years or older [23]. Prolonged sitting time in the older population has become a major social issue because it causes various problems such as cardiovascular disease, sarcopenia, cognitive impairment, and mortality [8,10]. The reason for prolonged sitting time in the Korean elderly seems to be that more than 90% of them spend their leisure time watching TV or listening to the radio, and they often play sedentary Korean games such as hwatu, janggi, and baduk [18]. It is known that leisure activities in older people are associated with higher life satisfaction. In order to improve the HRQoL of older people, it is essential to develop outdoor leisure programs focusing on physical activities [24].\nThis study has some", "response": "Develop outdoor leisure programs focusing on physical activities"}

The pressure curve for the optimal three-stage injection strategy compared to base case.\nA little bit later combustion with an increasing of CD can be seen in Figure 24. The pilot\nROHR is lower than the base case, because the pilot fuel mass injection is lower.\nFigure 24. The rate of heat release curve for the optimal three-stage injection strategy compared to the base case.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\nDuring the numerical investigation, the optimal injection strategy was found: pilot SOI\n19.2 CAD BTDC; pilot injection fuel mass 12.25 mg; main SOI 3.7 CAD BTDC; main injection fuel mass 32.4 mg; post Ai 2 CAD ATDC, post injection fuel mass 3.5 mg (as can be seen in\nFigure 22). A three-stage injection strategy allows the indicated work near the base case level to be maintained, the pressure rise rate to decrease by 20% and the NOx emission to decrease by 10%. The 5% increase in PM emissions does not seem to be a signiﬁcant drawback of the chosen injection strategy, because the biodiesel fuel reduces PM emission drastically due to its chemical properties (it contains the oxygen).\nThe most signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the combustion process has the pilot injection parameters: the pilot SOI and the pilot injection fuel mass. The pilot SOI has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the type of combustion (premixed/non premixed) of the pilot injection, so there is opportunity to control the ignition delay. The parameters described above have an inﬂuence on the compression work, mostly via the AHR BTDC and the CO mole fraction, as there is a lot of fresh oxygen in the CC.\nDuring the combustion of the pilot injections, the fuel mass, the temperature and the pressure in the combustion chamber increase and the evaporating of the main injection fuel mass and the mixture preparation becomes faster, and the combustion of the main portion becomes fuller, hence the increase in the premixed combustion. Therefore, the pilot injection parameters control the temperature and pressure values for burning the main\n23 of 25 injection and can inﬂuence the ignition delay via the break-up and evaporation processes of main injection.\nThe post injection parameters mostly inﬂuence the emissions and the indicated work via the heat losses through the exhaust gases and through the cooling system.\nSplitting the injection allows the fuel portions to be burned separate from each other and improves the mixing and the oxygen use. In particular, it is important in the case of high loads when the amount of cycle injection is high.\nThe process of determining the optimal injection strategy is described above in detail and can be used for other ICEs, and other alternative fuels. The optimization of the injection strategy and the application of alternative fuels in conjunction is a powerful tool to improve the combustion process of any engine without changing the design of the engine itself or its systems. Further improvement of the results can be obtained with the minor change of the ICE design. For example, the optimization of the combustion chamber shape or the optimization of the injector nozzles. All these changes can be simulated using CFD models.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.K.; methodology, A.K. and N.Z.; validation, A.K.; formal analysis, N.Z. and A.K.; investigation, N.Z.; resources, N.Z.; data curation, A.K.; writing— original draft preparation, N.Z.; writing—review and editing, A.K. and U.A.; visualization, N.Z.; supervision, A.T.; project administration, A.T. and K.K.; funding acquisition, U.A., A.T.

{"question": "strategy for the second pilot SOI 19.2 CAD BTDC.\nFigure 6. The injection strategy for the second pilot SOI 10 CAD BTDC.\nThe reference value for each parameter (base case value) is marked by a dashed red line. Each of three lines on the graph in Figure 7 correspond to the SOI of the second pilot\n(the values are shown in legend and on Figures 3–5).\nAn increase in indicated work retarding the ﬁrst pilot SOI can be seen. The base value of indicated work for the second pilot SOI is equal to 45 CAD BTDC and at the ﬁrst pilot the SOI is equal to 10 CAD BTDC, but NOx emissions exceeded the base case level.\nThis tendency can be seen for other ﬁxed SOI values of the second pilot injection. The main purpose of the optimization was to decrease the NOx emissions, which strongly depend on the local temperature in CC, by retarding the pilot SOI.\nAdvancing the SOI of the ﬁrst pilot injection decreases NOx and increases PM emis- sions, as can be seen below in Tables 2 and 3. Advancing the ﬁrst pilot SOI leads to an increase in the CO mole fraction and a decrease in AHR. This means that the combustion process becomes less efﬁcient. It can be assumed that this is due to a relatively low efﬁciency evaporation process because of the low temperature and pressure values at the\nSOI. Moreover, advancing the ﬁrst pilot SOI means the compression work increases. It is not possible to simultaneously decrease the emissions and increase the efﬁciency of the combustion process at any time during the ﬁrst pilot SOI, or at least save the fuel efﬁciency at the base case level.\nFigure 7.

However, to analyze the reasons for the change of indicated work, it is necessary\n9 of 25 to describe the combustion process in detail. The main parameters of CP for the second pilot SOI 45 CAD BTDC are displayed in Table 2. Ai means the indicated work, and Acompr means the compression work (work BTDC), these parameters and AHR and CO mole fraction are relative. The start of combustion (SOC) for all cases of the three-stage injection is the same. It is important to note that the TDC of the compression stroke is at 720 CAD.\nThe three stage injection reduces the AHR and increases the CO mole fraction. This means that the use of fresh charge becomes less efﬁcient with the addition of the second pilot injection and the advancement of the SOI of the ﬁrst pilot.\nThe indicated work increases when the SOI of the ﬁrst pilot is retarded and becomes almost equal to the base case value despite an increasing CO mole fraction, combustion work, CD and a decreasing of the AHR. This can be explained by the earlier end of combustion (EOC) that causes decreased heat loss through exhaust gases and through the cooling system.\nThe main parameters of CP for the case with the second pilot SOI 10 CAD BTDC are described in Table 3. The combustion process is much more efﬁcient with the increase in\nAHR and indicated work and the decrease in the CO mole fraction, CD, compression work with the SOI retarded. The EOC does not exceed the base case level.\nThere are two main parameters which inﬂuence the indicated work: the compression work and the efﬁciency of the combustion process. The ﬁrst parameter depends on the SOC and the amount of fuel–air mixture ready to burn, the premixed charge, and the quantity of the air–fuel mixture burned before TDC (AHR before TDC). The second depends on the parameters displayed in Tables 2 and 3.\nThe ROHR for the second constant pilot SOI 19.2 CAD BTDC is depicted in Figure 8.\nFigure 8.

{"question": "the inﬂuence of the multiple injection strategies on the emissions. They have used two pilot injections with SOI variable from\n38 CAD BTDC to 28 CAD BTDC with increments of 5 degrees. They also varied the pilot mass injection. The researchers marked a decrease in the NOx and a slight decrease in the soot emissions with an improving combustion process.\nFigure 10. Pressure rise rate contour plot.\nFigure 11. Particulate matter contour plot.\n3.1.3. Pilot Injection Fuel Mass Optimization\nThe next step should be the optimization of the pilot injection fuel mass for two combinations of SOI:\n1–the ﬁrst pilot injection: SOI 45 CAD BTDC, the second: 19.2 CAD BTDC. The lowest\nNOx emissions and a relatively low indicated work value are achieved. It is expected that\n12 of 25 the indicated work will increase due to the reduction in the compression work value via the decreasing the fuel mass injected BTDC, but still the reserve of NOx emissions is necessary.\n2–the ﬁrst pilot injection: SOI 19.2 CAD BTDC, the second: 10 CAD BTDC. It is expected to decrease the NOx emissions due to a decrease in the pilot injection fuel mass.\nAs was mentioned above the fuel mass of the pilot injection is close enough to fuel the mass of the main injection in case of a three-stage injection. The pilot injections play an important role in the combustion process, and probably have the main inﬂuence on the local temperature in CC as long as the fresh oxidizer is available for the ﬁrst pilot injection predominantly. Further, the ﬁrst and the second SOI pilot injection sets.\nFigure 12. NOx concentration contour plot.\nThe results of the simulation are depicted in Figure 13. The ﬁrst pilot injection mass fuel is equal to the second. The varying range is from 3.5 mg to 15.75 mg with increments of 1.75 mg. The fuel mass for both pilot injections is the same.\nFor the ﬁrst SOI pilot injection set an indicated work is lower than the base case value in the range from 5% to 9%. A decrease in the rate of the pressure rise with a decrease in the pilot injection fuel mass can be seen. The PM emissions are higher than the base level in the range of the pilot injection fuel mass from 1.75 mg to 10.5 mg, and the increase in the pilot fuel mass injection decreases the PM emissions. The NOx emissions are lower than the base case level in the whole pilot fuel mass injection varying range, divided by factor 1.5.\nIn the second SOI pilot injection set the indicated work value is lower than base case level in the range of the fuel mass pilot from 1.75 mg to 7 mg, the increase in the pilot injection fuel mass leads to an increase in indicated work. The pressure rise rate does not exceed the critical value of 1.5 MPa/CAD. The PM emissions has a higher base case level in the range of the pilot injection fuel mass in a range from 3 mg to 9 mg. The NOx emissions lower base case level is in the range from 1.75 mg to 7 mg of the pilot injection fuel mass.\nLater increases in pilot injection fuel mass leads to an increase in NOx emissions.\nThe authors in [41,42] conducted an investigation where the analyses of multiple injection strategy on the combustion process was described. They mention that emissions strongly depend on the engine load.\nThe varying of the pilot injection fuel mass does not allow the purpose of the opti- mization to be reached.\nFigure 13. The pilot injection fuel mass variable inﬂuence on combustion process and emissions.\n3.1.4. Main Injection SOI Optimization\nThe next step of the optimization is to vary the main SOI. The main SOI optimization simulation should be completed with other injection parameters set constant. Thus, the ﬁrst pilot SOI is ﬁxed at a value of 45 CAD BTDC, the second pilot SOI is ﬁxed at a value\n19.2 CAD BTDC, the ﬁrst and the second pilot injection fuel masses are set equal to\n12.25 mg. This is expected to increase the indicated work by advancing the main SOI in the range from 15 CAD BTDC to 15 CAD ATDC with increment 5 CAD, as shown in Figure 14.\nThe negative SOI value on this ﬁgure means the injection ATDC. The optimal SOI range to increase the indicated work is from 11 CAD BTDC to 5 CAD BTDC compared with the base case level. Advancing the SOI out of the described range decreases the indicated work by 5%", "response": "Optimize pilot injection fuel mass for two combinations of SOI; Optimize main injection SOI with constant pilot injection parameters"}
{"question": "the base case level. The advancing pilot SOI decreases the indicated work. To maintain the indicated work not lower than base case level, the pilot SOI should be in the range from 20 CAD BTDC to 10 CAD BTDC. The maximum value of the pressure rise rate does not exceed the critical value of 1.5 MPa/CAD, so there is no limitation. The dependence of the pressure rise rate on the pilot SOI looks similar to that of the indicated work. The PM emission decreases with a retarding of the pilot\nSOI. Exceeding the base value can be seen in the range from 70 CAD BTDC to 20 CAD\nBTDC. The NOx emissions look fairly constant in the range of pilot SOI from 70 CAD BTDC to 30 CAD BTDC. Retarding the pilot SOI increases the NOx emissions; a maximum of\n400 ppm is achieved at 10 CAD BTDC. Increasing the local temperature leads to increasing\nNOx emissions, because of the local enrichment of the air–fuel mixture (the pilot injection becomes closer to main injection). The second reason is more efﬁcient combustion due to a higher temperature and pressure at SOI. As in can be seen from Figure 17, the optimal value of the pilot SOI is at 19.2 CAD BTDC.\n3.2.2. Pilot Injection Fuel Mass Optimization\nThe second step of the optimization is to vary the pilot injection mass in the range from 1.75 mg to 14 mg with increments of 1.75 mg. To exceed the pilot injection fuel mass value of 14 mg is not rational due to the increased compression work as the pilot injection fuel mass is increased. The results are presented in Figure 18. As can be seen, the indicated work increases with the increase in the pilot injection mass. The maximum value reaches\n12.25 mg of pilot injection mass; it is slightly higher (1.5%) than the base case value.\nFigure 18. The pilot injection fuel mass variable inﬂuence on combustion process and emissions.\nTo understand the CP in detail, the main parameters of combustion are presented in\nTable 4. The inﬂuence of the varying pilot injection fuel mass on a CP is complex. On the one hand, there is an increase in the compression work via an increase in the amount of the fuel burned before TDC. On the other hand, the temperature and pressure at the SOI are optimal for the fast evaporating and burning of the fuel. The fast evaporation leads to an increase in the premixed combustion part, hence this makes faster burning possible.\nThe CD decreases, as well as the heat loss. Faster combustion is possible via the excessive amount of oxidizer. The detailed combustion process of the pilot and main injections is\n18 of 25 described above (Figure 8), here the process is similar and there is no need to describe it once again.\nTable 4. Combustion parameters for the pilot injection fuel mass variation.\nPilot Mass, mg\nSOC, CAD BTDC\nCD, CAD\nAHR, %\nCO, %\nAcompr, %\nAi, %\n14 (base case)\nFor the pilot injection fuel mass 12.25 mg (Table 4), the CD is almost the same as for the base case, but the increase in the AHR and the decrease in the compression work, as well as the CO mole fraction compared with the base case leads to an increase in the indicated work.\nThe main inﬂuence on the combustion process is the use of the oxidizer in the burning zone which is characterized by the CO mole fraction and AHR. A higher AHR value or/and a lower CO mole fraction value means that the combustion process is more efﬁcient.\nThe increasing of the pilot injection fuel mass increases the pressure rise rate via increasing the amount of the fuel burned BTDC. The increasing of the pilot injection mass decreases the PM emissions, from the maximum value of 225 mg/kg of fuel at the pilot injection fuel mass equal to 1.75 mg to 92 mg/kg of fuel at the pilot injection mass of 14 mg.\nThe NOx emissions increase with an increasing pilot injection mass; the reason for this is the more efﬁcient use of the oxidizer, hence the local temperatures in CC increase. The pilot injection fuel mass is 12.25 mg. The 1.5% increase in the indicated work, the base case level of PM emissions, the 20% decrease in the pressure rise rate and the 4% decrease in the NOx emissions can be achieved compared with the base case level.\n3.2.3.

Calculated and experiment ROHR curves for biodiesel in an operated diesel engine at\n1450 rpm and 25% of the full load mode.\n3.1. Two Pilot Injections\n3.1.1. First Pilot SOI Optimization\nThe ﬁrst and the second pilot injection masses were the same and equal to 14 mg/cycle as can be seen in Figures 3–5, where the three-stage injection strategy is depicted. There were three constant SOI values chosen for the second pilot: 45 CAD BTDC, 19.2 CAD BTDC and\n10 CAD BTDC shown in Figures 3–5, respectively.\nFigure 4. The injection strategy for the second pilot SOI 45 CAD BTDC.\nThe ﬁrst pilot (variable) is shown by red dashed line, the SOI range is from 70 CAD\nBTDC to 10 CAD BTDC with an increment of 5 CAD. The fuel mass for each injection is shown in Figure 4 and is constant. It is interesting to note that the authors in [38] investigated split injection strategies with varying pilot SOI (one pilot injection) in the range from 30 CAD BTDC to 15 CAD BTDC, and they did not notice a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the pilot SOI on the emissions.\nIn Figure 5 the injection strategy for the second pilot SOI 19.2 CAD BTDC is depicted\n(orange line). The dashed red line is chosen to mark the ﬁrst pilot SOI variable and the range is the same as for the previous case.\nIn Figure 6 the injection strategy for the second pilot (green line) SOI 10 CAD BTDC is depicted in a similar way as for the two previous cases. The main SOI is depicted as a constant in Figures 3–5. The colors for the second pilot injection correspond to the colors in\nFigure 7. In Figure 7, an indicated work, the pressure rise rate, and NOx and PM emissions are depicted.\nFigure 5. The injection strategy for the second pilot SOI 19.2 CAD BTDC.\nFigure 6.

{"question": "mass is 12.25 mg. The 1.5% increase in the indicated work, the base case level of PM emissions, the 20% decrease in the pressure rise rate and the 4% decrease in the NOx emissions can be achieved compared with the base case level.\n3.2.3. Main SOI Optimization\nThe next step of the optimization is to vary the main SOI with the constant pilot SOI\n19.2 CAD BTDC and a pilot injection mass of 12.25 mg. Figure 19 displays the results of the simulation.\nThe range of varying the main SOI is from 10 CAD BTDC to 4 CAD ATDC (-4 CAD\nBTDC on the Figure 19) with increments of 2 CAD. The negative SOI value on this ﬁgure means the injection ATDC. The values of all the estimated parameters at main SOI 4 CAD\nBTDC are almost equal to those at the base case. Advancing the main SOI increases the indicated work and NOx emissions by 10% and 100%, respectively. There is no inﬂuence on the PM emissions and the pressure rise rate. The main SOI retarding up to 4 CAD\nATDC leads to an 18% decrease in the indicated work, a 52% decrease in NOx emissions, and about a doubled increase in PM emissions. There is no inﬂuence of the main SOI on the pressure rise rate. From the description above it can be seen that optimal main SOI is\n3.7 CAD BTDC.\n3.2.4. Post Injection Parameters Optimization\nThe range of post injection SOI is from 2 CAD ATDC to 14 CAD ATDC with incre- ments of 2 CAD. The results of the numerical investigation are displayed in Figure 20.\nThere wasn’t any pressure rise, because the post injection parameters have no inﬂuence on it.\nThe retarding of post SOI decreases the indicated work and NOx emissions. The in- creasing of the PM emissions with advancing the post SOI can be seen, but in the range\nFor the next variable parameter (the mass of the post injection), the post SOI should be taken equal to 2 CAD ATDC. The 10% decrease in NOx emissions, the 20% decrease\n19 of 25 in pressure rise rate, the 4% increase in PM emissions and the saving of the base level of indicated work can be received. In Figure 21, the post injection fuel mass variable is displayed. The decrease in indicated work and NOx emissions with an increasing of the post injection mass can be seen. At post injection the fuel mass is equal 10.5 mg. An almost\n4% decrease in indicated work and a 20% decrease in NOx emissions, but a 20% increase in\nPM emissions can be seen. The received results look similar to other researchers [45–48].\nFigure 19. The main SOI variable inﬂuence on combustion process and emissions.\nAt the post injection, a fuel mass of 1.75 mg, an almost base case level of indicated work and PM emissions, and a 5% decrease in NOx emissions can be seen. The parameters of the post injection have no inﬂuence on the pressure rise rate. In light of the above description, the 3.5 mg post injection fuel mass can be chosen as optimal.\nIn Figure 22, an optimal injection strategy is depicted and the parameters of the three-stage injection can be seen.\nIn Figure 23 the pressure curves for the base case and the optimal case are presented.\nThe peak ﬁring pressure for the three-stage injection is a little bit lower at 7.24 MPa, and the base case value is equal to 7.56 MPa. Post injection is burned during the expansion stroke, which is taken from the main injection fuel mass.\nFigure 20.

{"question": "fuel–air mixture ready to burn, the premixed charge, and the quantity of the air–fuel mixture burned before TDC (AHR before TDC). The second depends on the parameters displayed in Tables 2 and 3.\nThe ROHR for the second constant pilot SOI 19.2 CAD BTDC is depicted in Figure 8.\nFigure 8. ROHR for the 1st pilot SOI optimization.\nThe ROHR peak value decreases in the case of the three-stage injection compared with the base case (two stage injection). The burning of the pilot injection fuel mass becomes smoother when the ﬁrst pilot SOI is advanced.\nIn the range from 705 CAD to 710 CAD we can see the burning of the premixed charge for the three-stage injection (two cases with two pilot injections and one main; the ﬁrst pilot SOI 70 CAD BTDC and 40 CAD BTDC and the second is ﬁxed at 19.2 CAD BTDC for both). In the range from 708 CAD to 710.5 CAD we can see the burning of the premixed charge for the base case and for the three-stage injection with the ﬁrst pilot SOI 19.2 CAD\nBTDC and the second pilot SOI 10 CAD BTDC. In the last case, the burning of the pilot injection fuel mass is combined with burning the main injection fuel mass.\nThe maximum value of the ROHR can be decreased with advanced injection timing and by adding the second pilot injection. Similar results have been described in the re- search [39] where the inﬂuence of multiple injections on the ROHR curve were investigated.\nThe ﬁrst pilot SOI was varied in the range from 70 CAD BTDC to 10 CAD BTDC with increments of 5 for three different constant values of the second pilot SOI, and there was no opportunity to reduce the emissions and increase or save on the base case level\n10 of 25 of the efﬁciency. Therefore, the simulation strategy should be changed. The design of an experiment with a relatively large parameter grid should be created to evaluate all the SOI variations of the ﬁrst and the second pilots, and their inﬂuence on each other.\n3.1.2. The Design of the Experiment Simulation\nIn Figure 9 an indicated work contour plot in dependence of the SOI for the ﬁrst and second pilot injections is depicted. The range for the ﬁrst pilot SOI is from 70 CAD\nBTDC to 10 CAD BTDC with increments of 5 CAD. For the second pilot it is from 65 CAD\nBTDC to 15 CAD BTDC with increments of 5 CAD. Increasing or saving the indicated work base case level is possible using a retarded SOI for both pilot injections simultaneously.\nThe red-dotted reference line can be seen (base case level), and further on each contour plot.\nFigure 9. Indicated work contour plot.\nThe pressure rise rate ﬁeld (Figure 10) shows that exceeding the critical value of\n1.5 MPa/ACD is possible at a SOI range from 30 CAD BTDC to 15 CAD BTDC for both pilot injections. It is important to note that the red-dotted reference line on this ﬁgure means the highest allowable value for a diesel engine.\nTo decrease the PM emissions, the SOI range for the ﬁrst pilot injection should be in the range from 37 CAD BTDC to 10 CAD BTDC (Figure 11). At the same time, the SOI for the second pilot injection should not be less than 20 CAD BTDC (more retarded than\n20 CAD BTDC).\nNOx emissions exceeding the base case level can be achieved earlier than when the indicated work reaches the base case level, as it can be seen in Figure 12. The decrease in\nNOx emissions lower than the base case level can be achieved in the range of the SOI more than 20 CAD BTDC to 25 CAD BTDC for both pilot injections.\nIn conclusion, there is no such combination of SOI for both pilots at which the de- creasing of the NOx emissions, PM and at least saving the base level of efﬁciency can be achieved. Researchers [40] have investigated the inﬂuence of the multiple injection strategies on the emissions. They have used two pilot injections with SOI variable from\n38 CAD BTDC to 28 CAD BTDC with increments of 5 degrees. They also varied the pilot mass injection. The researchers marked a decrease in the NOx and a slight decrease in the soot emissions with an improving combustion process.\nFigure 10. Pressure rise rate contour plot.\nFigure 11.

{"question": "The subsequent phase of “fruit formation” follows flowering and occurs in spring or in summer. In individuals of Armeniaca sibirica, it was registered in the period from the end of May (2014–2015, 2017, 2019), as well as from the first decade of June (2016, 2018). In individuals of Corylus heterophylla, it was registered in the 2nd decade of May (with the exception of 2015–2017, when no fruiting was observed). In individuals of Euonymus maackii, it was registered at the end of June (2016–2019) and at the beginning of July (2014–2015). No fruiting in\nCorylus heterophylla can probably be associated with low temperatures (frosts in mid-May) or with a wet period at the time of flowering. It was found that with the highest amount of precipitation and relative air humidity, despite the mean daily air temperature above +10 °C, in individuals of this species, flowering was delayed until a more favorable time. Anemophilic pollen was released from anthers, which cracked under the influence of dry air. In May 2015, when the flowering continued, the highest amount of precipitation was recorded – 34.0 mm. In 2016–2017, the phase came earlier (in April); the amount of precipitation was 16.0 and 17.8 mm, respectively, which exceeded the indicators of this month in other years. In this regard, most likely in these years, the fruits were not formed. However, it is difficult to say unequivocally, since in May 2019, there was also a large amount of precipitation (35.1 mm), with low mean monthly air temperatures (9.3 °C); fruiting in individuals was noted.\nThis is followed by the “ripening of fruits and seeds” phase. In Armeniaca sibirica, maturation lasted from 80 to 100 days; in Corylus  heterophylla, it lasted up to 110 days; and in Euonymus maackii, it lasted 60 to 100 days.\nHowever, some fruits in Euonymus maackii did not fall over the winter and were recorded on the branches of the plants the following spring. In 2014 and 2015 fruit maturation was faster in all the studied objects; 2017 and 2018 were the years, in which this phase lasted longer.\nOne of the final stages of the growing season is the\n“autumn leaf color” phase. In 2014, 2016, and 2017, in all species it began earlier (at the end of August), and later leaf coloring (at the beginning of September) was noted in 2015, 2018, and 2019. In general, by the end of\nSeptember, the full color of the leaves of all the studied plants was recorded over the years, with a mean monthly air temperature in the range of 8.0–11.3 °C (below-zero values were noted only in 2014, in the third decade of\nSeptember). The influence of short daylight hours and low above-zero temperatures in autumn contributes to the intensity and variety of the color palette of the leaves (from bright red to purple shades). However, early frosts weaken the bright red color of the foliage. Rainy or cloudy days reduce the color intensity of the autumn leaves, and cool, dry, and sunny weather contributes to the autumn color scheme.\nThe final phase of the growing season is “leaf litter”. The East Asian forest-steppe species complete the growing season in late September – early October.\nThe Manchu-Daurian preboreal species turned out to be the most variable over the years. The years of 2014,\n2016, and 2017 were characterized by below-zero mean monthly temperatures in October (–2.4 °C; –3.9 °C; –0.7 °С, respectively). It was during these years that the individuals showed early leaf fall and the end of the growing season.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\nThe dynamics of seasonal changes in introduced plants under conditions of Eastern Transbaikalia indicates that the East Asian forest-steppe and ManchurianDaurian preboreal species exhibit phenological plasticity in response to sudden changes in air temperatures and insufficient precipitation in the region (Armeniaca sibirica,\nCorylus heterophylla).

In 2015–2016 and 2019, these individuals entered the growing season later, at a mean monthly air temperatures of 2.7, 1.2, and 2.0 °C, respectively. For the species Armeniaca sibirica, the earliest onset of the growing season was recorded in 2017–2018 (in mid-April), which is one decade earlier than in 2014. In 2019, the growing season began in the third decade of April, as opposed to\n2015–2016 (I decade of May). For individuals of Euonymus maackii, the onset of this phase remained unchanged from year to year (vegetation begins in the third decade of April and lasts for one decade).\nThe accompanying phases of “leaf bud budding” and “first leaf budding” occurred either systematically or in parallel to each other for one week. For example, for individuals of Corylus heterophylla, we registered a simultaneous swelling and rapid deployment of the first leaves during the third decade of May 2015, despite the large amount of precipitation and cool weather, compared to other years. In all other years, these two phases occurred one week earlier, successively replacing each other (I–II decade of May). Consequently, cold spring temperatures and humid air accelerate developmental stages of plants.\nIn individuals of Armeniaca sibirica, we observed a similar reaction to the weather in 2015–2016 and 2019, including the late opening of leaf buds and their deployment (from late May to mid-June) compared to 2017–2018 (II–III decade of May), with the gradual passage of two phases.\nThe phenospectrum of Euonymus maackii samples showed simultaneous swelling of leaf buds, and their flowering was stable from 2014 to 2019 in the third decade of April.\nHowever, in 2019, we registered a late consistent opening of the buds (from the 3rd decade of April to the 1st decade of May).\nIn general, the initial phenological phases of vegetation in the studied species fall on the period from mid-April to the end of May. At this time, there are frequent ground and atmospheric frosts with changes in air temperatures. Based on the data of the graph of meteorological parameters\n(by month) and the phenospectrum, individuals of\nCorylus heterophylla and Armeniaca sibirica were the most sensitive in spring to temperature extremes, in contrast to\nEuonymus maackii, which were stable. The duration of the phenophases was different over the years.\nIn parallel, the “onset of flowering” was recorded in the spring-summer period. It is known that Armeniaca sibirica and Corylus heterophylla according to the characteristics of phenological development is of the early spring type\n(generative buds bloom earlier than vegetative ones). The duration of the flowering phase varied: it was within 18–22 days for individuals of Armeniaca sibirica; 15–25 days for\nEuonymus maackii; and 10–15 days for Corylus heterophylla.\nThe subsequent phase of “fruit formation” follows flowering and occurs in spring or in summer. In individuals of Armeniaca sibirica, it was registered in the period from the end of May (2014–2015, 2017, 2019), as well as from the first decade of June (2016, 2018).

All objects under study complete a full cycle of phenorhythms – from lignification of shoots and to leaf fall. The observed small deviations in seasonal development (duration of phenophases) over the years are associated with the weather conditions in the region.\nAt the beginning of the growing season, atmospheric frosts with changes in air temperatures are rather common. Corylus  heterophylla and Armeniaca sibirica are most sensitive to temperature extremes in spring, in contrast to Euonymus maackii, which were stable.\nWarm and dry weather contributes to the early start of\nEkaterina A.

Low above- zero air temperatures in spring and a large amount of precipitation encourage plants to pass the development stages faster (phenophases) than in dry and warm weather\n(Corylus heterophylla, Armeniaca sibirica). At the same time, low temperatures (frosts) in spring with a wet period at the time of flowering negatively affect the further fruit formation in Corylus heterophylla individuals.\nBased on the hereditary and physiological characteristics, it was established that introduced plants are adapted to the conditions of Eastern Transbaikalia and are cold- and drought-resistant. According to the phenological development, the individuals have the following characteristics: early flowering (Armeniaca sibirica, Corylus heterophylla) and longer retention of foliage on the branches in the autumn (Corylus heterophylla), as well as retention of fruits in winter (Euonymus maackii,\nCorylus heterophylla). The influence of short daylight hours and low above-zero temperatures in autumn contributes to the intensity and variety of the color palette of the leaves\n(from bright red to purple shades). Rainy or cloudy days reduce the intensity of the color of the autumn leaves, and cool, dry, and sunny weather contributes to the autumn multi-color.

The longest growing seasons on the phenological spectrum were demonstrated in 2014 and 2018–2019 (in individuals of Corylus  heterophylla, it was 190 days), which contributes to the accumulation of greater phytomass.

{"question": "RESULTS\nThe sequence and duration of the phenological stages of the seasonal development of each plant are presented in the color graphic form – the phenospectrum (Fig. 2).\nWhen conducting observations in the arboretum for the growing season from 2014 to 2019 (April – October), we analyzed individual phenological variability of the studied objects in dynamics. The sensitivity of plants to the weather conditions of the region varies throughout the seasonal development.\nThe diagram (Fig. 3) shows an estimate of the weather data of the mean daily air temperature and precipitation for the months of the growing season (2014 – 2019) in the study area.\nFig. 3.

Phenological spectrum of the growing season of shrubby plant species in the arboretum of INREK SB RAS\nStatistical processing of the main meteorological parameters for the period from 2014 to 2019 showed that the months during the year are characterized by long- term variability. Thus, the highest precipitation variation coefficients recorded within the growing season reached their maximum in mid-summer. The temperature regime showed the greatest variability over the years in April and October and was slightly variable from May to June and from August to September; July was characterized by the greatest instability. It is known that one of the important components of climatic heterogeneity is the high variability of thermal conditions at the beginning and end of the growing season, which determines the different dates of the beginning and end of the growing season and the different time intervals by plants.\nStatistical processing of the data of the main meteorological parameters for the six years of the growing season (2014 – 2019) was performed in accordance with generally accepted methods (Table 1).\nWe analyzed the sum of the mean daily air temperatures above 10 °C for the period from 2014 to 2019. The highest sum of active temperatures (SAT) was recorded in 2015 and amounted to almost 2,182 °C; the lowest was recorded in\n(383.3 mm), the minimum was observed in 2017 (98.8 mm)\n(Fig. 4).\nEarlier, the authors (Obyazov and Noskova 2015;\nNoskova et al. 2019) analyzed the sum of active air temperatures (above 10°C) over the past decades in the entire Trans-Baikal Territory. According to these works, the\n°C are usually observed from mid-May to the first decade of September, and on average their number is 110, with the maximum values in the south-east of the region (more than 130 days) and the minimum in the north (less than 90 days)…”. Our research objects grow in the central part of the Trans-Baikal Territory and manage to complete the full cycle of their development in an average of 110 days.\nAn increase in air temperature in the spring period boosts vegetation. An increase in temperature (within the normal range) accelerates growth and decreases phenological intervals, while a decrease (within the normal range), on the contrary, slows down development and increases the phenological intervals (Schnelle\n1961; Larcher 1978; Shultz 1981). At the same time, the temperature  sufficient for vegetation of any species varies from year to year, depending on other conditions, such as, for example, the winter duration and weather or the endogenous dormancy of the plant (Schultz 1981). Let us consider in more detail the dynamics of seasonal changes in introduced plants by phenophases.\nThe initial phase of the growing season – “bud swelling” – changed over the years. For individuals of\nCorylus heterophylla, this phase began somewhat earlier in\n2014 (in the 3rd decade of April), compared to 2015–2019.\nThe highest air temperature for that April was 6.3 °C, and the total precipitation in April was 7.6 mm, which exceeds the indicators of 2015 and 2018–2019. The temperature in April of 2017 and 2018 was slightly less – 4.4 and 3.3\n°C, respectively, and there was less precipitation. Our\nEkaterina A.

{"question": "21; Soetaert et al., 2016).\nCold-water corals and most of the fauna associated with the deep-reef habitats rely on organic matter originating from close to the surface ocean (de Froe et al., 2022; van Oeve- len et al., 2018; Carlier et al., 2009). Our results underline that, at the Logachev cold-water coral mound province, con- ditions for cold-water coral reefs are better higher in the wa- ter column since a high reef cover was positively associated to shallower areas (Figs. 2 and 4), and depth explained a large part of the variation in benthic cover (Fig. 5). To deter- mine how coral mound engineering affects the conﬁguration of cold-water corals reefs, we investigated (1) the environ- mental control on cold-water coral reefs at multiple spatial scales and (2) which of the environmental factors are or are not engineered (i.e. affected) by the corals (coral mound en- gineering).\nVentilation and hydrodynamics that stimulate the verti- cal and lateral food supply have been identiﬁed as the most important drivers of cold-water coral reef growth over the past 20 000 years (da Costa Portilho-Ramos et al., 2022). In our analysis we included simulated hydrodynamic variables that indicate increased vertical or lateral food supply or ven- tilation. By including spatial variables (Moran Eigenvector\nMaps, MEMs) in our analysis, we were able to investigate whether these hydrodynamic variables had their largest inﬂuence on reef cover at the between- or the within-transect scale. We found that reef cover varied most at the scale of the study area (∼25 km), and this variation seems to be associ- ated most with non-engineered (i.e. not under coral control) downward velocities in winter (Sect. 4.1).\nBy explaining 45.1 % of the variation in benthic cover, our set of variables performed well in comparison to similar deep-sea studies using RDA: e.g. Vad et al. (2020) explained\n15.1 % of the variation in benthic cover, and Kazanidis et al. (2021) explained 26.7 % of macrofauna variation. Henry et al. (2013) explained 65 % of the variation in reef fauna us- ing a combination of MEMs, hydrography, and bathymetric variables. So the inclusion of both spatial factors (MEMs)\nFigure 4.

The x axis shows the value on the RDA axis. RDA axes 1 to 4 were signiﬁcant (p < 0.05), but axis 4 is not shown as it explained < 1 % of the variation in benthic cover (d). The benthic cover (response) variables are shown at the top (reef variables in white and non-reef variables in grey), and below that, the explanatory variables are shown in colour.

In particular, within-transect MEMs described a rela- tively large part of the variation in our benthic cover data that was not explained by the environmental variables. Henry et al. (2013) similarly found that community composition was structured mainly by broad-scale environmental forcings, but that ﬁne-scale MEMs described a signiﬁcant fraction of the variation in community composition. This within-transect variation in benthic cover can be related to spatial patterns of fauna (Henry et al., 2013), such as self-organized regular spatial patterns in coral reefs (van der Kaaden et al., 2023) and the typical reef zonation on cold-water coral mounds\n(Sect. 4.2).\nThe variation that remained unexplained in our study might be related to hydrodynamics at a ﬁner resolution or other food supply mechanisms that were not described fully by our set of hydrodynamic variables, such as enhanced surface productivity (Eisele et al., 2011; Wienberg et al.,\n2022, 2020); downward migration of zooplankton (Guihen", "response": "Evaluate all SOI variations of the first and second pilot injections and their influence on each other; Increase or save the indicated work base case level using a retarded SOI for both pilot injections simultaneously; Avoid SOI ranges from 30 CAD BTDC to 15 CAD BTDC for both pilot injections to prevent exceeding the critical pressure rise rate; Set the SOI range for the first pilot injection between 37 CAD BTDC and 10 CAD BTDC to decrease PM emissions; Ensure the SOI for the second pilot injection is not less than 20 CAD BTDC to decrease PM emissions; Achieve NOx emissions lower than the base case level with SOI ranges between 20 CAD BTDC and 25 CAD BTDC for both pilot injections."}

Still, for cold-water coral mounds that are not buried, it can be in- teresting to investigate the general hydrodynamic regime that arises around cold-water coral mounds and how this regime might explain reef zonation on mounds.\nCoral mound ecosystem engineering causes self-organized reef zonation\nHere, we demonstrated the effects of coral mound ecosys- tem engineering: bottom current speeds are accelerated at some parts of the mound and decelerated in other parts. At the mound ﬂank, upward velocities are enhanced, whereas at the mound summits, downward velocities are enhanced\n(Fig. 6). Previous studies (e.g. van der Kaaden et al., 2021;\nDavies et al., 2009; Findlay et al., 2013; Cyr et al., 2016;\nMienis et al., 2007) showed that cold-water coral mounds affect downward water motions. Our results also indicate that coral mounds inﬂuence downward velocities in Febru- ary (Fig. 6). However, the magnitude of this effect does not correlate to mound height, likely because of the prevailing inﬂuence of non-engineered, broad-scale environmental pro- cesses in winter (discussed in Sect. 4.1).\nThese ﬁndings are in line with hydrodynamic theory of water ﬂow passed an object (Juva et al., 2020; Dewey et al.,\n2005; Baines, 1995; Genin et al., 1986) and with other stud- ies reporting the hydrodynamics around coral mounds (e.g.\nGenin et al., 1986; de Froe et al., 2022; Findlay et al., 2013;\nDavies et al., 2009; Juva et al., 2020). Such a regime can be generalized as follows: (1) ﬂow acceleration at the mound side facing the incoming current and at the lee and (2) ﬂow deceleration at the other two mound sides, (3) ﬂow decel- eration at the summit if the summit is ﬂat, (4) upwelling along the lower mound ﬂanks, and (5) downwelling around the mound upper ﬂanks and summit. As these typical hy- drodynamic zones likely determine the typical benthic cover zones, we will argue in the following that reef zonation on cold-water coral mounds is self-organized.\nCold-water coral mounds show a typical, often-reported benthic zonation (Fig. 2), with mostly sediment cover at the mound foot, coral rubble at the lower ﬂank, dead-coral frameworks on the higher ﬂank, and living corals at the sum- mit (e.g. Cathalot et al., 2015; Davies et al., 2009; Genin et al., 1986; De Clippele et al., 2021; Maier et al.,", "response": "Evaluate all SOI variations of the first and second pilot injections and their influence on each other; Increase or save the indicated work base case level using a retarded SOI for both pilot injections simultaneously; Avoid SOI ranges from 30 CAD BTDC to 15 CAD BTDC for both pilot injections to prevent exceeding the critical pressure rise rate; Set the SOI range for the first pilot injection between 37 CAD BTDC and 10 CAD BTDC to decrease PM emissions; Ensure the SOI for the second pilot injection is not less than 20 CAD BTDC to decrease PM emissions; Achieve NOx emissions lower than the base case level with SOI ranges between 20 CAD BTDC and 25 CAD BTDC for both pilot injections."}

These fractions represent the variation in benthic cover that is explained purely by a (set of) variable(s), mean- ing that 14.1 % of the variation in benthic cover has a spatial conﬁguration that is not explained by depth or hydrodynamic variables. Of the spatial variables, 2.4 % of the variation in benthic cover is explained purely by between-transect MEMs\n1 and 2, i.e. related to variations at the scale of the study area, and 8.8 % by all within-transect MEMs 3 to 15, i.e. re- lated to variations on coral mounds.

(2021) showed that the presence of cold-water coral mounds causes an acceleration or deceleration of bottom currents near coral mound foots and a deceleration on some mound summits\n(Fig. 6a). Energy conversion rate to the internal tide is in- creased at those mound ﬂanks that face the tidal current and is decreased at the right side of mounds that face the incom- ing residual current (Fig. 6b).

This coral mound engineering also affects the hydrodynamics around coral mounds, possibly increasing the food supply towards the reefs (van der Kaaden et al., 2021; Soetaert et al., 2016).\nCold-water corals and most of the fauna associated with the deep-reef habitats rely on organic matter originating from close to the surface ocean (de Froe et al., 2022; van Oeve- len et al., 2018; Carlier et al., 2009).

The explained variance is separated in the variation explained purely by depth (brown), hydrodynamic variables (blue), or spatial variables (green). Spatial variables are further separated in MEMs describing the between-transect spa- tial scale (dark green) and the within-transect spatial scale (light green). The sum of the variance explained purely by the between- and within-transect spatial scale did not add up to 14.1 %, possibly because the combined spatial scales also explain a fraction of the variance.

Furthermore, all transects included in this study were located on cold-water coral mounds and not in between mounds. Since there are no reefs in between cold-water coral mounds (Rengstorf et al., 2014), extending transects to include the off-mound region would likely in- crease the variation explained by the within-transect spatial scale, and this could emphasize the coral mound engineering effect.\nBroad-scale environmental control on reef cover that is not engineered by cold-water corals\nReef cover (live coral and dead framework) varied most from north to south in the study area. Strong downward velocities in February favour a high reef cover (Fig. 4), likely through an accelerated downward transport of organic matter from near the ocean surface (Soetaert et al., 2016; Frederiksen et al., 1992; Davies et al., 2009; Findlay et al., 2013). Down- ward velocities in February are stronger with coral mounds present than without coral mounds (Fig. 6c). Modelling the hydrodynamics around one mound of different heights, van der Kaaden et al. (2021) also showed that vertical velocities increased as mound height increased, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism. However, when including all mounds at the Logachev cold-water coral mound province, the mag- nitude of the effect on downward velocities in February is not correlated to the height of a coral mound (Fig. 7). We thus argue that high reef cover is", "response": "Evaluate all SOI variations of the first and second pilot injections and their influence on each other; Increase or save the indicated work base case level using a retarded SOI for both pilot injections simultaneously; Avoid SOI ranges from 30 CAD BTDC to 15 CAD BTDC for both pilot injections to prevent exceeding the critical pressure rise rate; Set the SOI range for the first pilot injection between 37 CAD BTDC and 10 CAD BTDC to decrease PM emissions; Ensure the SOI for the second pilot injection is not less than 20 CAD BTDC to decrease PM emissions; Achieve NOx emissions lower than the base case level with SOI ranges between 20 CAD BTDC and 25 CAD BTDC for both pilot injections."}
{"question": "actual height above the seaﬂoor or depth in the water column. Here, we hypothesize that this Massenerhebung effect, whereby the distribution of organisms is determined by feedbacks between the mountain and the environment, applies to cold-water coral mounds too.\nSince depth is also an important variable explaining benthic cover, it is likely that the position of cold-water coral reefs on coral mounds is determined by the feedbacks between the mound and the hydrodynamics but that shallower mounds have a denser reef cover than deeper mounds.\nEcosystem-engineering effects on cold-water corals and climate change\nCold-water coral mounds seem to exhibit a zone with pre- dominantly upward water motions on the mound ﬂanks and a zone with predominantly downward water motions around the mound summit. The summit and upper ﬂank seem to be most suitable for cold-water coral growth, likely because downward water motions accelerate the downward transport of organic matter. In contrast, on the coral mound ﬂanks, coral rubble and dead-coral frameworks are more abundant than live corals. Nutrient-rich deep water is pushed up to- wards the lower mound ﬂanks (Cyr et al., 2016), and the community associated with the dead coral framework re- leases substantial amounts of nutrients (Maier et al., 2021).\nThese nutrients might be transported by the predominantly upward water motions towards the ocean surface (Soetaert et al., 2016; Findlay et al., 2014; de Froe et al., 2022). This might beneﬁt the coral reefs as a global review (Maier et al., 2023) and studies on millennial timescales (Eisele et al.,\n2011; Wienberg et al., 2022) show the beneﬁts of increased primary productivity for coral reef growth. The upward wa- ter motions around the mound ﬂanks likely also resuspend deposited particles. These particles are transported higher up the mound by lateral advection where they supply the corals with additional food (Findlay et al., 2013; Davies et al., 2009;\nMienis et al., 2009).\nFactors other than food supply also inﬂuence cold-water coral growth, such as biogeochemical seawater properties\n(Flögel et al., 2014; da Costa Portilho-Ramos et al., 2022;\nFink et al., 2012). Deep water that is upwelled around cold- water coral mounds typically has lower temperatures, oxy- gen content, and aragonite saturation than water from higher in the water column that is downwelled (Findlay et al., 2013,\n2014; Mienis et al., 2007; Flögel et al., 2014). The mound zone inﬂuenced by downward water motions therefore likely experiences higher temperatures, oxygen content, and arago- nite saturation state than the region of upward water motions.\nWhile higher oxygen content and aragonite saturation state would beneﬁt cold-water corals (Fink et al., 2012; Dodds et al., 2007; Tittensor et al., 2009), higher temperatures might have an adverse effect (Morato et al., 2020; Chapron et al.,\n2021). Currently, most cold-water corals occur within their thermal tolerance (Mienis et al., 2007; Chapron et al., 2021).\nA higher temperature may be beneﬁcial but only up to the up- per limit of the thermal tolerance range (Büscher et al., 2022;\nDodds et al., 2007).\nIncreased temperatures from global change increase the energy demand of cold-water corals (Dodds et al., 2007;\nDorey et al., 2020; Chapron et al., 2021). When not compen- sated for by sufﬁcient food supply, the framework-forming cold-water coral habitat is expected to move to deeper wa- ters (Morato et al., 2020). Our results show that this poses a problem to cold-water corals and their associated fauna liv- ing on mounds as the corals prefer the downwelling zone where they proﬁt from a higher vertical particle ﬂux, oxy- gen content, and aragonite saturation state. The temperatures in this zone, however, might become unfavourable in the fu- ture. Further down the mound ﬂank is the upwelling zone that seems less suitable for cold-water coral growth.

{"question": "Fig. 2), with mostly sediment cover at the mound foot, coral rubble at the lower ﬂank, dead-coral frameworks on the higher ﬂank, and living corals at the sum- mit (e.g. Cathalot et al., 2015; Davies et al., 2009; Genin et al., 1986; De Clippele et al., 2021; Maier et al., 2021;\nVertino et al., 2014; Freiwald and Roberts, 2005; Dorschel et al., 2005). van der Kaaden et al. (2023) found self-organized regular patterns in reef cover on the Logachev cold-water\n985 coral mounds, with overall reef cover varying along the tran- sects. This suggests that the overall reef cover along a coral mound is steered by environmental conditions that change along the mound, and that, within these benthic zones, cold- water corals self-organize into regular patterns.\nIndeed, we found that high cold-water coral reef and rub- ble cover correlated to the spatial scale from mound foot-to- summit (MEM 3 and 4) and to strong bottom current speeds\n(Fig. 4), suggesting that reef growth is more prominent on those mound ﬂanks where (engineered) bottom currents are accelerated (i.e. front and rear) than on the ﬂanks where (en- gineered) bottom currents are decelerated (Fig. 8b; Mohn et al., 2014). High coral rubble cover correlated to strong upward velocities in August (Fig. 4b), whereas high reef and sediment cover correlated to weak upward velocities in\nFebruary. This suggests that strong upwelling occurs mostly around the mound ﬂanks and not around the mound summit and foot (Fig. 8b).\nFlow induced up- and downwelling over coral mounds is often mentioned as an important food supply mechanism to cold-water coral reefs (Soetaert et al., 2016; Davies et al.,\n2009; Wagner et al., 2011; Findlay et al., 2014). During a tidal cycle, isopycnals are depressed at the mound ﬂank, and at the turning of the tide, an internal bore is formed that propagates over the mound ﬂank towards the summit (Legg and Klymak, 2008; Mohn et al., 2014). The vertical length scale of these excursions follows the length scale of the mound (van Haren et al., 2014; Cyr et al., 2016). Larger coral mounds generally have a larger effect on hydrodynamics than smaller mounds (Fig. 7; Lim et al., 2018; van der Kaaden et al., 2021). This underlines the mound ecosystem engineer- ing aspect of hydrodynamic zonation and benthic zonation: as the coral mound grows taller, the formerly higher ﬂank regions on the mound that were suitable for coral growth become unsuitable lower ﬂank regions, thereby maintaining the typical reef zonation and causing a so-called Massener- hebung effect (Fig. 8c).\nThe Massenerhebung effect was ﬁrst described for the zonation of ﬂora and fauna on terrestrial mountains (Frahm and Gradstein, 1991; Grubb and Whitmore, 1966). Terres- trial mountains exhibit zones with a typical ﬂora and fauna that are determined by various factors such as temperature, humidity, and solar radiation. These zones vary with rela- tive altitude on the mountain but not with the absolute height above the ground because of feedbacks between the size of the mountain and the environment (Grubb, 1971; Grubb and\nWhitmore, 1966). A perhaps surprising result of this effect is that, for example, the treeline lies higher on higher moun- tains than on lower mountains. Genin et al. (1986) report that cold-water coral presence is also related to the posi- tion on the mound rather than the actual height above the seaﬂoor or depth in the water column. Here, we hypothesize that this Massenerhebung effect, whereby the distribution of organisms is determined by feedbacks between the mountain and the environment, applies to cold-water coral mounds too.\nSince depth is also an important variable explaining benthic cover, it is likely that the position of cold-water coral reefs on coral mounds is determined by the feedbacks between the mound and the hydrodynamics but that shallower m", "response": "Evaluate all SOI variations of the first and second pilot injections and their influence on each other; Increase or save the indicated work base case level using a retarded SOI for both pilot injections simultaneously; Avoid SOI ranges from 30 CAD BTDC to 15 CAD BTDC for both pilot injections to prevent exceeding the critical pressure rise rate; Set the SOI range for the first pilot injection between 37 CAD BTDC and 10 CAD BTDC to decrease PM emissions; Ensure the SOI for the second pilot injection is not less than 20 CAD BTDC to decrease PM emissions; Achieve NOx emissions lower than the base case level with SOI ranges between 20 CAD BTDC and 25 CAD BTDC for both pilot injections."}
{"question": "c). Modelling the hydrodynamics around one mound of different heights, van der Kaaden et al. (2021) also showed that vertical velocities increased as mound height increased, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism. However, when including all mounds at the Logachev cold-water coral mound province, the mag- nitude of the effect on downward velocities in February is not correlated to the height of a coral mound (Fig. 7). We thus argue that high reef cover is associated with enhanced down- ward velocities, mostly due to broad-scale, non-engineered, environmental processes.\nSince downward velocities in February did not signiﬁ- cantly correlate to downward velocities in August (rS = 0.26, p = 0.18) and since downward velocities in August were barely associated to reef cover (Fig. 4), reef cover seems mostly steered by processes prevailing in winter and not in summer. At the Rockall trough, deep winter mixing extends as far down into the water column as 600 m (Holliday et al., 2000), and during winter months, dense water is created over the Rockall Bank that cascades down over the Rock- all trough margin (White et al., 2005). Both processes cause an accelerated downward ﬂow of organic matter that peaks near the winter–spring transition, at the onset of the phy983\nFigure 6.

These broad-scale, non-engineered, envi- ronmental processes offer a food supply mechanism for the cold-water corals during and shortly after the food-limited winter months (Maier et al., 2020b) and have a larger control on coral survival than food supply mechanisms in summer\n(Fig. 8a).\nThis ﬁnding suggests that broad-scale environmental pro- cesses exert a stronger control on cold-water coral cover than engineered environmental variables. However, the rather coarse resolution of the hydrodynamic simulations might cause us to overestimate the importance of broad-scale envi- ronmental variables. Variance partitioning showed that 8.8 % of the variation in benthic cover was explained solely by within-transect MEMs compared to only 2.4 % by between- transect MEMs. This signals that the variation at the within- transect scale might be related to environmental variables at a ﬁner resolution. Such ﬁne-scale variation in hydrodynamic variables is more likely to be caused by the interaction be- tween water ﬂow and ﬁne-scale topography, i.e. ecosystem engineering. Since MEMs 3 to 5, which describe the mound foot-to-summit spatial scale, play a role in explaining the variation in benthic cover, cold-water coral mound ecosys- tem engineering might cause self-organized variation in ben- thic cover.\nEnvironmental factors other than the hydrodynamic vari- ables investigated here might also affect coral reef growth and subsequent cold-water coral mound formation. For ex- ample, certain water masses (Schulz et al., 2020), the perma- nent pycnocline (White and Dorschel, 2010), internal waves\n(Wang et al., 2019; Wienberg et al., 2020), seawater density\n(Flögel et al., 2014), and (terrestrial) sediment supply (Pirlet et al., 2011; Vandorpe et al., 2017; Lo Iacono et al., 2014) have been suggested to restrain mound formation. Cold- water coral mounds can become buried following changes to the sedimentary regime (Lo Iacono et al., 2014), and for the Logachev cold-water coral mound province, it has been hypothesized that the mounds stopped growing when reach- ing the permanent pycnocline (White and Dorschel, 2010) or the WTOW upper boundary (Schulz et al., 2020). van der\nKaaden et", "response": "Evaluate all SOI variations of the first and second pilot injections and their influence on each other; Increase or save the indicated work base case level using a retarded SOI for both pilot injections simultaneously; Avoid SOI ranges from 30 CAD BTDC to 15 CAD BTDC for both pilot injections to prevent exceeding the critical pressure rise rate; Set the SOI range for the first pilot injection between 37 CAD BTDC and 10 CAD BTDC to decrease PM emissions; Ensure the SOI for the second pilot injection is not less than 20 CAD BTDC to decrease PM emissions; Achieve NOx emissions lower than the base case level with SOI ranges between 20 CAD BTDC and 25 CAD BTDC for both pilot injections."}
{"question": "RESULTS\nGeneral transect observations\nThere is variability in benthic cover within and between tran- sects (Fig. 2), but clear trends are not obvious. For instance, transect 3, located on the lower southern ﬂank of the north- ernmost mound, and transect 6, located at the western ﬂank of the highest mound (Fig. 1), have a relatively low live- and dead-coral cover overall. Transect 7, across the highest mound in the area, shows a relatively high dead-coral cover and low sediment and rubble cover overall.\nRedundancy analysis (RDA)\nWe investigated the relation between benthic cover and en- vironmental variables with a redundancy analysis (RDA) in which we studied the spatial benthic conﬁguration by includ- ing Moran’s eigenvector maps (MEMs) in the analysis. RDA axes 1 to 4 were signiﬁcant (p < 0.001). The ﬁrst axis of the redundancy analysis explains 27 % of the variation in ben- thic cover and separates frames with high reef cover (i.e. live corals and dead framework) from frames with low reef cover (i.e. rocks, sediment, and coral rubble cover; Figs. 3 and 4a). The most important variables explaining high versus low reef cover are downward velocities in February, the spa- tial variable between-transect MEM 2, and depth. Less im- portant variables are bottom current speed, upward velocities in February, between-transect MEM 1, and within-transect\nMEM 4. The other explanatory variables have only a minor contribution on the ﬁrst axis. In all, high reef cover is as- sociated with strong downward velocities, shallower water depths, strong bottom currents, and weak upward velocities.\nThe second RDA axis explains 11.5 % of the variation and separates frames with high coral rubble cover from frames with low coral rubble cover (Figs. 3 and 4b). The most impor- tant variable explaining high versus low coral rubble cover is the spatial variable within-transect MEM 3. Less important variables are between-transect MEM 1, upward velocities in\nAugust, between-transect MEM 2, depth, and bottom current speed. High coral rubble cover is associated with strong up- ward velocities in August, greater depths, and strong bottom current speeds.\nThe third axis explained 6.3 % of the variation in ben- thic cover (Fig. 4c). The third axis separates frames with high sediment cover from frames with low sediment cover.\nThe most important variables explaining high versus low sediment cover are between-transect MEM 1 and between- transect MEM 2. Less important variables are upward veloc- ities in February, downward velocities in August, and within- transect MEM 5. High sediment cover is associated with weak upward velocities in February and strong downward velocities in August. We do not discuss the fourth axis as it explained < 1 % of the variation in benthic cover.\nFigure 2. Stacked bar plots show the benthic cover (in percent of the annotated frame) of the seven transects. Each bar represents one annotated video frame. Note: for visibility, only frames at > 5.5 m distance apart are shown. Benthic cover types shown are the cover of live framework-forming corals (red), dead-coral framework (yellow), coral rubble (brown), rocks (grey), and sediment (green). Other cover types are not shown so bar plots might not reach 100 %. Black dots show the transect depth in metres (left y axis).\nTable 1.
