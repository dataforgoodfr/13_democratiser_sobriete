Other studies also showed that elevated levels of TyG index are a risk factor for reduced muscle mass or strength [21, 22], even in adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 [36]. In addition to evi­ dence from cross-sectional studies, post hoc analyses of a prospective study suggested that baseline lower hand­ grip strength levels were inversely associated with the three-year follow-up TyG index values, which indicate that handgrip strength can be a predictor of future insu­ lin resistance [23]. However, in contrast to our findings,\n",
      "Hu et al. claimed that TyG index was associated with a reduced risk of low muscle mass in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus [37]. The discordance might be partially due to the fact that T2DM subjects in the low muscle mass group showed significantly decreased TG levels compared to the normal muscle mass group [37], which resulted in lower TyG index levels. However, these results were based on studies investigating TyG index at a single time point, which may not reflect long-term exposure.\n",
      "With the results of this study, more prospective longitu­ dinal studies are required to explore the long-term rela­ tions of the TyG index trajectories and physical function.\n",
      "The elevated TyG index is associated with impaired\n",
      "β-cell function regardless of the glucose metabolic status\n",
      "[38]. Therefore, TyG index closely mirrors the status of insulin sensitivity. The biological mechanisms underlying the association between the trajectory of the TyG index and frailty have not been clarified to date. Skeletal mus­ cle is the principal place where the insulin regulates glu­ cose uptake [39]. The age-related loss of muscle mass has harmful effects on peripheral glucose absorption through reduced muscle mass for insulin-stimulated glucose dis­ posal, which further leads to hyperinsulinemia status and insulin resistance [40]. Meanwhile, declining physical activity in later life is regarded as one of the main influ­ ential factors in insulin resistance [41]. Age-associated metabolic and structural alterations involving chronic inflammation, glycogen synthesis and oxidative pathways also contribute to the malfunction of insulin regulation\n",
      "[42]. Interactively, poor insulin resistance weakens the protein breakdown of skeletal muscle, impairs muscle catabolism and quality, the ensuing sarcopenia is one of the main components of frailty [43, 44]. As a result, the vicious circle of insulin resistance and low muscle mass leads to impaired body energy regulation and physi­ cal performance, and subsequently increases the risk of frailty.\n",

      "TyG index and frailty risk are prominent in participants with BMI ≥ 24  kg/m2. The result was generally consis­ tent with those of other studies [20]. Kim et al. claimed that TyG Index is a potential indicator of sarcopenic obesity in older people [45]. Obese individuals run the risk of experiencing oxidative stress and chronic inflam­ mation, both of which affect the TyG index levels in ways including glucose absorption and adipokine secre­ tion [46]. A common syndrome of “sarcopenic obesity” has been proposed for that these individuals are at an increased risk of adverse events compared to those with obesity or sarcopenia alone [45]. There is evidence that insulin resistance and sarcopenic obesity are closely\n",

      "We cannot exclude that the relatively small sample size in the subgroup is a potential Influencing factor. Future research on a larger number of subjects with different clinical characteristics would be helpful in determining the association between TyG index and frailty risk. Sensi­ tivity analyses were conducted to confirm the robustness of the findings. In the analysis restricted to participants without using lipid-lowing medication and hypoglycemic agents, the population who follow the high-stable trajec­ tory of the TyG index bear the highest risk of frailty.\n",
      "This is the first study to observe a relationship between the TyG index and frailty through the use of frailty index with a ten-year follow-up. The GBTM statistical tool was used to investigate the heterogeneity of the population in the longitudinal observation of the TyG index, which enables us to obtain a reliable trajectory classification.\n",
      "Compared with the single point of information, long- term trajectories of TyG index measurements provided more robust and reliable results. The annual routine health assessment of older urban residents also ensured a consistent assessment of TyG index variability.

Firstly, the current study could not include insulin resistance index values, such as\n",

      "[15]. Secondly, in the prospective analysis, the measure­ ment of frailty status was substituted by ADL/IADL due to a lack of data, which might impact the results. Thirdly, we cannot rule out the possibility that residual confound­ ing factors could have biased the results. However, we applied progressive degrees of adjustment for potential confounders. Lastly, the older residents in our study were all from the downtown Fuzhou City, so extrapolations from our results to other populations require further variations.\n",
      "Long-term elevated levels of TyG index are indepen­ dently associated with an increased risk of frailty. High levels of TyG index could alert older residents to make early lifestyle changes that may reduce the risk of the pro­ gression or incidence of frailty. Relative vigorous control of traditional cardiovascular-metabolic risk factors would be highly beneficial for physical function management.\n",
      "The TyG index could be an alternative surrogate for iden­ tifying those elders who are at a high risk of low muscle mass, especially for residents with higher BMI. As a result, it is essential to maintain appropriate levels of TG and FBG within the desirable range and take better con­ trol of the long-term TyG index in late life.\n",
      "In conclusion, this current study found that older urban residents with long-term elevated TyG index levels have a higher risk of frailty. These findings also highlight the importance of monitoring serum glucose and lip­ ids to prevent the decline of physical capacity for older populations.\n",

A point of concern that emerged out of the estimates of ICOR and\n",
      "MEC is that the efficiency of capital use in agriculture has been declining over the years. It has been observed that there are instances where huge investment made on infrastructure in some areas ceased to serve its purpose due to lack of maintenance.\n",
      "Therefore, there is a need to keep the created capital stock functional so that it serves the intended purpose. Irrigation capacities should also be expanded to improve efficiency of investment in agriculture. The estimates of the simultaneous equation model revealed that agricultural productivity, state income, grants from union government and literacy level in the state were positive and significant determinants of public investment. However, allocation in the form of fertiliser subsidies and population growth has negatively affected public investment. On the other hand public investment, agricultural productivity, literacy level, terms of trade and per capita income have significantly contributed in the improvement of private investment. However, increasing proportion of marginal holdings was found to have negative and significant impact on private investment. Agricultural investment is instrumental in development of rural areas not only directly by alleviating poverty but, also indirectly by improving agricultural productivity and increasing non-farm employment. The estimates of marginal effect revealed significant role of public and private investment on poverty alleviation and agricultural growth. Moreover, the incremental impact of additional public investment on private investment reinforced positive association between these two types of investment. This finding is quite significant keeping in view the contemporary debate on economic liberalisation and structural reforms in the country.\n",
      "Considering the direct as well as indirect role of investment on overall rural development, the declining trend in public investment needs to be reversed.\n",
      "Investment in agriculture technology development and its dissemination, rural infrastructure, irrigation, rural development, market development, soil and water conservation and other social overheads amounts to a “win-win” strategy for reducing rural poverty directly as well as through creation of avenues of employment and higher rural wages. Private investment in agriculture must also be encouraged by providing the necessary support like credit, cheap power, tubewell subsidy, etc. In the case of resource poor groups investment needs to be encouraged. Whatever subsidies are to be provided should be targeted to the poor and backward regions, where productivity is lower and farmers are unable to invest more in agriculture.\n",

      "Both older and younger adults recorded a higher number of events related to emotional goals, relative to those of events related to knowledge-acquisition goals, indicating that events related to emotional goals are more likely to capture an adult’s attention in daily life relative to those related to knowledge- acquisition goals. This is consistent with the ﬁndings of previous studies indicating that emotional events attracted participants’ attention (Carstensen et al., 2000). In addition, Rovenpor et al.\n",
      "(2013) showed that participants of all ages selected a signiﬁcantly larger amount of emotional material relative to that of neutral material. The odds ratio for preference for events related to emotional goals, rather than knowledge-acquisition goals, observed for older adults was higher relative to that observed for younger adults. It should be noted that the ﬁnding that older adults recorded a lower number of events related to knowledge- acquisition goals, relative to that of events related to emotional goals, is understandable, as their primary tasks in daily life no longer involved learning. However, knowledge-acquisition events and emotional events were not a trade-oﬀcontinuum or components of the whole; therefore, a lower number of events related to knowledge-acquisition did not necessarily indicate that a higher number of events related to emotional goals would be recorded. Therefore, the ﬁnding that the odds ratio for preference for events related to emotional goals was higher, relative to that observed for those related to knowledge-acquisition goals in the older group was consistent with their emotional goals. Younger adults also recorded a high number of events related to emotional goals relative to that recorded for events related to knowledge- acquisition goals. While it did not reﬂect the prioritization of their social goals, this result is consistent with the results of research examining diﬀerences in emotional material, memory, and emotional experiences between older and younger adults in which both groups exhibited memory bias favoring emotional over neutral materials, (Carstensen and Turk-Charles, 1994) and expressed subjective levels of emotional experience that were equal in intensity (Labouvie-Vief et al., 1989; Levenson et al.,\n",
      "1991; Lawton et al., 1992; Carstensen et al., 1997). Therefore, when there is no competition between the two types of social goals in daily life, younger adults might not prioritize knowledge- acquisition goals.\n",
      "The Positivity Effect in the Context of\n",
      "Different Social Goals in Older Adults\n",
      "The term positivity eﬀect in previous studies refers to an observed age-related increase in the preference for positive over negative information in attention and memory (Charles et al., 2003;\n",
      "Mather and Carstensen, 2003). The positivity eﬀect in the present study mainly referred to whether older adults recorded more positive events and whether they rated events positively. This diﬀered from general research that focused on the positivity eﬀect for emotional well-being. From the perspective of quantity with respect to the positivity eﬀect, the results indicated that older adults showed greater preference for recording positive events, rather than negative events, related to knowledge-acquisition goals relative to that observed in younger adults. From the perspective of quality with respect to the positivity eﬀect, older adults’ ratings of events related both to knowledge-acquisition goals and emotional goals were more positive relative to those of younger adults. This ﬁnding indicates that older adults could have observed a higher number of positive aspects of events related to knowledge-acquisition and emotional goals.\n",
      "For example, an older woman wrote the following in her diary:\n",
      "“Today, I went to the Aging Lab at Beijing Normal University to take part in tests. It was a very happy thing and I acquired much knowledge constantly. It’s never too late to learn.” Her rating score for the emotional experience resulting from this event that was related to knowledge acquisition was 4. In contrast, a younger woman wrote the following in her diary for a similar event:\n",
      "“In the afternoon, I attended the multimedia courseware class.\n",
      "Unfortunately, after half of the class, I found that I did not quite agree with his teaching method. Most students were helpless in such a poor-quality class. They felt they had no choice but to skip the class.” Her rating score for the emotional experience resulting from this event was 2, and was more negative relative to the rating provided by the older woman. The results of a further analysis of the events showed that, relative to younger adults, older adults emphasized their emotional satisfaction more strongly.\n",
      "In addition, despite experiencing a decline in their cognitive resources, older adults maintained their optimism and had lower expectations. The reason why older adults’ emotional reactions to the acquisition of knowledge were more positive, relative to those of younger adults, could have been that the older adults focused on the positive aspects of negative events (Isaacowitz et al., 2008). Therefore, although older adults prioritize emotional goals, they could also exhibit the positivity eﬀect when confronted with knowledge-acquisition goals.\n",
      "From the perspective of quantity with respect to the positivity eﬀect, the ﬁnding indicating that there was no positivity eﬀect for events related to emotional goals in older adults could have occurred may be because they were unlikely to experience emotions involving high levels of arousal (e.g., excitement and pride; Lawton et al., 1992). Scheibe et al. (2013) reported that compared to younger adults, older adults’ experience of emotions involving low levels of arousal (e.g., calmness, peacefulness, and relaxation) increased. Another reason may be that younger adults may record more positive emotional events, leading to a relatively larger positivity index in the younger group. Thus, there was no positivity eﬀect from the perspective of quantity in the proportion of emotional goals. This may be because of cultural diﬀerences in goals and emotions. Chinese older adults are relatively traditional and conservative, and do not readily show high arousal, joy, and anger. Even so, the actual reasons why the perspective of quantity with respect to the positivity eﬀect was not observed for events related to emotional goals in older adults require further clariﬁcation. In brief, the diﬀerence in the results regarding events related to knowledge-acquisition and emotional goals suggested\n",

      "Directions\n",
      "The present study explored age diﬀerences in daily life events from the perspective of social goals. The results not only provided evidence to support the SST, but also indicated that relative to younger adults, older adults showed stronger preference for recording positive events related to knowledge-acquisition goals.\n",
      "However, there are still several limitations.\n",
      "First, to determine whether the SST was relevant in older adults’ daily life events, the events were classiﬁed as events related to knowledge-acquisition or emotional goals according to the content of the participants’ diary entries. However, we did not seek to determine whether older adults’ behavioral motivation resulted from knowledge-acquisition or emotional goals. Participants were neither ask to rate how each event related to the two goals. Future studies should examine the relationship between behavioral motivation and daily life events and ask participants to provide a subjective rating for each event related to the two goals so as to make the conclusion more convincing. Moreover, the sample size was also a limitation in the present study. Future studies should involve a larger sample size which may contribute to a power eﬀect size and more reliable conclusions.\n",
      "Second, the SST emphasizes the relationship between future time perception and behavioral goals. The current results provide only an indirect indication that future time perception was related to older adults’ behavioral goals. Further research should explore the relationship between future time perception and daily life events directly, and combine future- and present-oriented goals with emotional experience. Also, future research should focus on cognitive resources and its potential relationship with the positivity eﬀect.\n",
      "Third, using actual diaries can be considered a limitation of this study. Though reminders were sent periodically to maximize compliance, we were still not able to track compliance (e.g., completing events recording on time) and this issue may have been exacerbated in older adults given that they returned the diaries after 2 weeks. In contrast, online surveys oﬀer a major advancement in this regard. Given today’s technology, especially mobile technology, paper diaries were not the most optimal way of collecting data. If reminders were sent by email, diaries could have been presented via an online survey tool as well. Thus, diaries should be presented using modern technology in future studies.\n",

The findings found that, despite widespread awareness of the environmental concerns of HPW, inappropriate disposal is common, with significant gaps in safe disposal behaviors. Despite widespread recognition of the issue, only a tiny fraction of respondents participates in return programs, and many of them continue to dispose pharmaceutical waste in trash cans or toilets. The research's limitations include its dependence on self-reported information and the use of convenience sampling that limits the findings' generalizability. Future research should look into ways to enhance participation in return programs, make disposal options that is more accessible, and implement public education campaigns to close the knowledge-action gap, ultimately leading to more sustainable HPW management practices.\n",

      "The primary ﬁndings from this study were that circulating fasted leptin and acylated ghrelin concentrations responded quickly (within 24 h) to the HE-HFD in directions expected to help correct the energy imbalance. Appetite perceptions were not altered in the fasted state but exhibited similar compensatory responses during the OGTT on day seven. Finally, within 24 h, the HE-HFD reduced the participants’ desire and motivation to consume high-fat foods. These alterations in subjective, hormonal, and hedonic indicators of appetite were relatively modest and of small-to-moderate magnitude, despite the considerable energy surplus delivered in our overfeeding model.\n",
      "In this study, the HE-HFD did not alter any fasted subjective appetite ratings during the seven-day diet. Conversely, when mean responses were calculated across the 2 h OGTT, a small-to-moderate decrease in hunger, desire to eat and PFC, and a moderate-to-large increase in fullness was detected.\n",
      "These results suggest that the HE-HFD elicited compensatory appetite responses that emerged in response to glucose intake after several days of overconsumption. A few previous studies have investigated subjective appetite responses to one [11,22], two [26] and three [12,14] days of energy excess. With one exception [11], short-term overfeeding (+30–50% energy) led to compensatory appetite changes that would be expected to help correct the energy balance perturbation. In the exceptional case, where one day of overfeeding (+50% energy) had no impact on fasted or meal-related appetite, it is relevant that energy intake was covertly manipulated [11]. This may highlight the importance of psychological factors in the early appetite responses to overfeeding.\n",
      "The assessment of appetite using fasted ratings across the course of this study is a potential limitation as single assessments of appetite are less sensitive than average measurements taken over an extended period [36]. Instead, the characterisation of serial responses to a standardised meal challenge is regarded as a more sensitive and ecologically valid alternative. However, it has been reported that one day of overfeeding (+50% energy) a balanced macronutrient diet caused a marked reduction in fasted hunger (24%) and increase in post-meal satiety (74%) the next morning [37]. Similarly, overfeeding (+40–50% energy) a balanced macronutrient diet over three days was shown to reduce hunger and increase satiety, when calculated from pre-meal measurements averaged over the study duration [12,14]. These data suggest that if a robust response is genuinely present, fasted appetite assessments can detect subjective responses to dietary manipulation; however, these results contrast those documented in the fasted state at one and three days in this study.\n",
      "The contrasting appetite (fasting) ﬁndings between this study and previous investigations may be linked to the composition of the experimental diets. Speciﬁcally, balanced Western style diets (~50% carbohydrate, ~30% fat and ~20% protein) were implemented in the aforementioned studies, whereas we employed a diet especially high in fat (~65%) and low in carbohydrate (~21%).\n",
      "This diﬀerence in dietary protocol suggests that macronutrient content may be important in determining any compensatory appetite responses to overfeeding. This notion is consistent with the concepts of\n",
      "‘passive overconsumption’ [15] and ‘high-fat hyperphagia’ [38]. Speciﬁcally, the high energy density and palatability of high-fat diets, combined with their weak inﬂuence on satiety, may explain why our HE-HFD did not aﬀect appetite until day seven. However, given perceived appetite was altered in response to the OGTT (but not in the fasted state) on day seven of the HE-HFD, it is possible that earlier detection of appetite changes to overfeeding may have been precluded without an OGTT at one and three days.\n",
      "Within this study, fasted blood samples were taken after one, three and seven days to characterise appetite-related hormone responses to the HE-HFD. Our data show that circulating leptin concentrations increased rapidly (within 24 h) in response to high-fat overfeeding and remained elevated, at approximately the same level, whilst the diet persisted. This short-term response is consistent with previous overfeeding studies that described leptin responses during 1–5 days of overfeeding (≥+25% energy) balanced macronutrient [3,19,21,22] or high-fat [20,23] diets. In this study, it is notable that circulating leptin concentrations did not increase further at three or seven days despite the continuation of the HE-HFD. This may suggest that a ceiling for enhanced leptin production was reached in response to short-term overfeeding.\n",
      "A limitation of this study is that we cannot provide mechanistic insight; however, it is possible that augmented circulating insulin was responsible for stimulating leptin production from adipocytes [39].\n",
      "We have reported previously that fasted circulating insulin, and insulin responses to the OGTT, were elevated in response to the HE-HFD [30]. The physiological relevance of the leptin response to overfeeding is not clear. Given leptin has appetite suppressive eﬀects, the increase with overfeeding may represent a compensatory response seeking to maintain energy homeostasis. However, others have questioned this assumption [40], and argue that the satiety-promoting eﬀects of exogenous leptin\n",
      "11 of 15 may only be apparent in conditions of hypoleptinemia [41]. Further mechanistic studies are needed to understand the physiological relevance of changes in circulating leptin in response to overfeeding.\n",
      "In addition to leptin, we also measured acylated ghrelin and total PYY responses to the HE-HFD.\n",
      "Although distinct roles in the long-term regulation of energy balance have been described [42,43], these peptides are foremost thought of as short-term (meal-to-meal) modulators of appetite and eating [17].\n",
      "Speciﬁcally, acylated ghrelin is an orexigenic peptide harboring various roles in the cephalic phase of digestion [44,45]. Conversely, PYY promotes satiety and eﬃcient nutrient absorption via the ileal break mechanism [46,47]. In this study, fasted acylated ghrelin was suppressed rapidly after one day of high-fat overfeeding and remained lower throughout the HE-HFD, whereas fasted PYY was unresponsive to the HE-HFD.\n",
      "The acylated ghrelin ﬁndings in this study contrast the balance of previous investigations demonstrating that short-term (1–7 days) overfeeding (+25–60% energy) of balanced and high-fat diets do not aﬀect total [14,19,20] or acylated [11,21,24] ghrelin concentrations. The higher energetic and fat excess imposed by our diet over seven days is the most likely explanation for this discrepant outcome.\n",
      "However, it is notable that fasted acylated ghrelin concentrations remained unchanged after seven days of a similar HE-HFD [24]. This disparity likely reﬂects diﬀerences in the ELISA utilized and/or increased statistical power of a within-measures crossover design in the current study. Nevertheless, the suppression in fasted acylated ghrelin did not occur with congruent changes in fasted appetite perceptions, and the overall reduction in concentrations was modest despite the extreme overfeeding challenge. This may question the physiological importance of our acylated ghrelin ﬁnding.\n",
      "Previous studies have shown that fasted and postprandial total PYY are unresponsive to 1–3 days of balanced macronutrient energy excess (+40–50% energy) [11,14,22], whereas more prolonged overfeeding lasting 5–7 days elicited modest increases in fasted total PYY (+50–70% energy) [20,48].\n",
      "Given the similarity between study protocols, it is not clear why circulating PYY was not elevated in this study after seven days. Nonetheless, as PYY is a satiety-related peptide, additional research is needed to determine whether short-term overfeeding modulates PYY responses to nutrient challenges.\n",
      "In this study, the HE-HFD modulated LFPQ parameters associated with the hedonic control of eating. Speciﬁcally, the HE-HFD induced a reduction in the relative preference for high-fat vs. low-fat foods. Additionally, lower implicit wanting and explicit liking of high-fat vs. low-fat food items were identiﬁed (although these outcomes were not statistically signiﬁcant). Each of these responses were visually apparent after one day of the HE-HFD and persisted throughout the seven-day diet.\n",
      "The overconsumption of high-fat foods therefore appears to quickly attenuate the expected pleasure of, and motivation to obtain, foods that are high in fat.\n",
      "When seeking to situate these ﬁndings, it is important to note that although many studies have examined the eﬀects of short-term energy deﬁcits on food reward (food restriction and exercise) [6,29,49], the inﬂuence of positive energy balance (overfeeding) has received substantially less attention.\n",
      "Furthermore, reward-related outcomes have only been assessed using fMRI, and therefore direct comparison with our results is not possible. Nonetheless, data from two experiments have shown that two days of overfeeding (+30% energy) reduces the neural response to visual food cues in individuals who are lean [13,26]. In contrast, negative energy balance, when induced by extended overnight fasting\n",
      "(vs. the fed-state), increased the activation of reward-related brain regions (ventral striatum, amygdala, anterior insula, medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex) when participants were presented with high- vs. low-calorie foods [6].\n",
      "To date, no studies have assessed the impact of overfeeding on food reward using the LFPQ.\n",
      "Alternatively, two studies have employed the LFPQ to examine the acute eﬀects of energy restriction on food reward. Thivel et al. [29] recently showed that one day of fasting increased the preference and unconscious motivation (implicit wanting) to consume high-fat vs. low-fat foods. Others reported that one day of fasting increased the explicit liking of high-fat savory and low-fat sweet foods; and the explicit wanting of foods in all LFPQ categories (high-fat savory, high-fat sweet, low-fat savory, low-fat sweet) [28]. Collectively, the emerging evidence suggests that negative and positive energy balance\n",
      "12 of 15 may have opposing eﬀects on food reward that could facilitate energy homeostasis. It is important to note, however, that despite the excessive amount of energy and fat consumed in our HE-HFD, the resulting absolute changes in LFPQ parameters were subtle. Our results may therefore indicate that the magnitude of early hedonic responses to high-fat overfeeding is slight, and possibly less robust than responses to underfeeding/negative energy balance. Further head-to-head studies are needed to test this hypothesis, and to investigate how macronutrient content inﬂuences responses to overfeeding.\n",
      "The robust standardisation of dietary and experimental procedures is a key strength of this study; however, it is recognised that the experimental design could have been strengthened by the provision of all foods to participants in both trial arms (not just in the HE-HFD arm). A notable limitation is that subjective appetite perceptions and appetite-related hormones were examined using single fasting assessments, which are less sensitive than averaged responses over the course of standardised meal challenges. Finally, a homogenous sample of young, healthy males were recruited which limits the generalisability of our data.\n",
      "In conclusion, high-fat overfeeding (+50% energy, 65% fat) elicits early, albeit subtle, changes in metabolic (elevated leptin and reduced acylated ghrelin) and hedonic (reduced relative preference, explicit liking and implicit wanting for high-fat vs. low-fat foods) mediators of appetite within\n",
      "24 h. These responses were shown to persist at three and seven days whilst the dietary challenge endured. Conversely, fasted appetite perceptions were unaltered with overfeeding but exhibited compensatory changes during the OGTT after seven days. The modest alterations observed, and the potential disconnect between perceived appetite and purported modulating factors, challenges the extent that subjective, physiological, and hedonic appetite signals can counteract short periods of extreme energy surplus.\n",

      "4.1 Scaling relationships between leaf traits and relative beneﬁts\n",
      "The scaling relationships of leaf traits has been conﬁrmed by a number of empirical studies, which demonstrated that the habitat, developmental factors, and phylogeny affect the relationships between leaf traits (Niklas et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2020). A previous study by Sun et al. (2017) on ﬁve species of bamboos demonstrated a scaling relationship between LDM and LA under different conditions of light. Similarly, our results indicated that there was a scaling relationship between LDM and LA under different light condition, which supported the law of diminishing returns. Brieﬂy, as the LA increased, the LDM increased more rapidly, which consequently decreased the SLA. Interestingly, the scaling exponent (a) of the\n",
      "LDM and LA of Y. denudata under low light (a = 1.32) was larger than that of high light intensity (a = 1.09), whereas the scaling exponents of P. quinquefolia (a = 1.17 and 1.24, respectively, under low and high light) and W. sinensis (a = 1.11 and 1.13, respectively, under low and high light) showed a reverse trend. We speculated that this could be attributed to the differences in plant life forms and leaf forms (for instance simple and compound leaves). Y. denudata is a small tree, while the other two plants are woody lianas. There are signiﬁcant differences in the hydraulic structures of these plants, which may lead to differences in laminar and petiolar investment\n",
      "(Maréchaux et al., 2017). A considerable portion of the biomass of Y. denudata is contributed to strengthening the support system and petiolar transportation. In terms of leaf forms, both P. quinquefolia and W. sinensis have compound leaves, implying that apart from petioles, the laminar biomass of these plants is also invested in rachides (Xu et al., 2009). If a scaling relationship exists between petioles (rachides) and laminar biomass, plants with different leaf forms may have signiﬁcant differences in the investment of laminar biomass (Yang et al., 2009).\n",
      "In general, regions with high light intensity have lower water content in soils than regions with low light intensity; therefore, trade- offs between laminar water content and LDM during plant growth are more likely under high light intensity than under low light (Meng et al., 2014; Umaña and Swenson, 2019; Li et al., 2020). The relationship between LDM and LFM may reﬂect the variations in laminar water content, which is the basis of photosynthesis (Santiago et al, 2018; Dinesh et al., 2019). Our study also demonstrated the\n",
      "LDM and LFM increased at an equal rate (nearly 1:1) under almost all conditions, indicating that when the LFM increased, the LDM also increased gradually, while the water content of the leaves remained constant. These ﬁndings are inconsistent with the results of the study by Shi et al. (2020) on Fallopia multiﬂora. These variations are attributed to differences in the environment between these studies.\n",
      "Natural rainfall is the only source of water for wild plants; however, water is not a limiting factor for urban plants. Therefore, urban plants do not have a very strong demand for water storage during growth\n",
      "(Song et al., 2021).\n",
      "Plant SLA in low light habitat was signiﬁcantly larger than that in high light habitat, which was consistent with most other studies\n",
      "(Baird et al., 2017; Power et al., 2019). Plants in high light environments need to invest more in defense against heat and damage than shaded plants. Plants under shade may increase their\n",
      "LA to gain more light, which is consistent with the signiﬁcant difference in LA between different light habitats. We also observed that the PPI of SLA was the smallest compared with other traits, which also indicated that SLA was stable and could be used to refer to the photosynthetic capacity of plants (Liu et al., 2016; Dinesh et al., 2019).\n",
      "The trade-offs between pairwise traits in different habitats can more clearly illustrate the adaptation of plants to the environment.\n",
      "Only rarely studies have quantiﬁed plant habitat preferences using relative beneﬁts (Cheng et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). In general, P. quinquefolia and W. sinensis have greater relative beneﬁts under high light habitat, while Y. denudata have greater relative beneﬁts under low light conditions. This indicates that P. quinquefolia and W. sinensis can maximize the advantages of functional traits under high light conditions, while the reverse is observed in Y. denudata.\n",
      "This may also be the underlying reason why Y. denudata has a higher slope in low light. In contrast, the slope of the P. quinquefolia and W. sinensis varied little in different light conditions.\n",
      "4.2 Stoichiometric characteristics and strategy shift in leaves\n",
      "The adaptation of plants to different habitats not only manifests in leaf morphology but is also observed in the alterations in leaf inclusions. The results of this study conﬁrmed that the leaves of plants growing under conditions of low light had lower N and P contents and N:P ratios. However, this ﬁnding was not consistent with the results of the study by Niinemets et al. (2006), which reported that plants with larger SLA, corresponding to plants under conditions of low light in this study, have higher N and P content. Nevertheless, some studies have suggested that the N and P content of leaves are expected to increase with increasing light (Katahata et al., 2007;\n",
      "Puglielli et al., 2020). Compared to conditions of low light, high light conditions enhance photosynthesis to a certain extent, and also promote plant growth and development, thereby gradually increasing the N and P content in leaves. The N:P ratio of the three plants studied herein was less than 14 or 20 under different light conditions, indicating that the growth of these plants was restricted by N availability (Koerselman and Meuleman, 1996; Güsewell, 2004; Yan et al., 2017). The plants growing under conditions of low light were more severely restricted by N deﬁciency, compared to those growing under conditions of high light. We hypothesized that the lower light intensity restricted photosynthesis and leaf growth, and that the canopy intercepted most of the atmospheric N deposition in the soil. Low N deposition in the soil in which plants are growing can be an important factor limiting N uptake, especially for urban plants.\n",
      "The relationships between leaf traits enhance plant adaptability to the heterogeneous environment. As predicted by the LES (Wright et al., 2004), the dimensions of LFM, LDM, and LA are different from the N, P contents and N:P ratios, and their coordination may ensure the normal growth of plants under different conditions of light (Baird et al., 2017; Puglielli et al., 2020). It is worth mentioning that the three urban plants studied herein employed adaptive strategy shifting in environments with different conditions of light. The relative displacement of P. quinquefolia was found to be minimal, suggesting that it has a higher tolerance to conditions of low light than W. sinensis and Y. denudta. While certain plants are naturally\n",

      "09 capable of tolerating shade, most plants require sufﬁcient light for carbon gains. Among the six traits, P content appeared to be independent of the others, and the contribution of P to the PC2 axis was high. This is consistent with the result of signiﬁcant difference of P content in leaves under different light habitats, and also suggests that future research should pay attention to the change of P content.\n",
      "Adaptive strategy shifting is an important mechanism ensuring the survival of plants in heterogeneous environments. This study evaluated plant tendencies under different conditions of light by incorporating the relative beneﬁts of pairwise leaf traits, and the results demonstrated that plants perform adaptative strategy shifting in environments under different conditions of light. In general, the relationship between LA and LDM under different conditions of light supported the law of diminishing returns without exception, and there were signiﬁcant differences in the stoichiometric characteristics of leaves under different conditions of light. In future studies, the coupling relationship between leaf traits and elements should be clariﬁed, and the adaptation of plants to habitat changes should be more fully understood in combination with plant biomass and root or other traits.\n",

      "This investigation postulated that celebrity involvement influences Gen Y’s affective image. Data demonstrated that such variables had a significant relationship. Celebrity involvement in the travel programme positively influences their affective image towards the travel destination. After watching the travel television programme, the majority of Gen Y described the destination as pleasant and exciting. The valuable information on the travel destination was useful for them. Thus, celebrities can produce positive feelings or attitudes in the target customers to generate a favourable response towards the organization (Till, Priluek, & Stanley, 2008).\n",
      "5.1 Implications for Marketers\n",
      "This research affirms several practical implications for marketers. This study confirmed that a favourable affective image influences the visitation intention of Gen Y. The confirmation of this hypothesis is the most significant relationship in the context of the current conceptual framework. The present study verified that favourable affective image is directly linked to visitation intention and that they have a significant relationship\n",
      "24 with each other. High favourable affective image enhances the willingness of Gen Y to visit the travel destination.\n",
      "Hence, if people have a positive image, then they are more likely to visit the travel destination in future, as consistent with previous findings (Lee, Scott, & Kim, 2008). Hence, affective image is the most important factor to predict Gen Y’s destination choice.\n",
      "Hypothetically, celebrity involvement influences Gen Y’s visitation intention. Findings confirmed that celebrity involvement affects Gen Y visitation intention. However, several respondents indicated that they would not visit the travel destination because of celebrities. Therefore, celebrity involvement might not motivate Gen Y to go to the travel destination.\n",
      "For marketers, selecting the appropriate celebrities is crucial in addition to ensuring that the endorsement of the celebrities has a positive image and word of mouth. Doing so enables them to convince Gen Y to buy tourism products. Notice that tourism products and destination choice entail a high-involvement purchase intention in which the purchaser has limited product knowledge about an important decision. Therefore, choosing the right celebrity can provide the most salient characteristics in enduring involvement and lead to enhancing knowledge and activity in a destination. Although celebrity involvement might not be a main reason motivating Gen Y to visit a travel destination, it increases the perception level of acceptance towards the travel destination. Celebrities are also known as endorsers who are used to enhance people’s acceptance (Baker & Churchill, 1977). That condition explains why celebrity involvement exerts a certain significant level of influence in tourism advertisement.\n",
      "In terms of recommendations, destination marketers should invite a native celebrity of the travel destination for promoting the tourism products instead of a non-native counterpart. Such choice not only increases the attractiveness of the destination, but also generates a positive image and acceptance of the travel destination. For instance, Song Joong Ki, who was invited as an endorser by Jeju Air, expanded the exposure of the destination and promoted South Korea to South Asia. Choi, Lee, & Kim (2005) verified that domestic celebrities of the travel destination deliver a positive attitude and enhance the level of believability more effectively than other endorsers.\n",
      "Furthermore, results corroborated that Gen Y was familiar with celebrities as they observe them promote tourism destinations via TV and other social media platforms. Marketers must study the media habits and behaviours of\n",
      "Gen Y. Studies affirm that Gen Y is fond of using the Internet and social media platforms. Considering appropriate channels (e.g., Facebook and IG) to use as promotion tools is crucial for generating influence and creating extensive WOM and e-fluentials about the destination.\n",
      "Although celebrity endorsement was confirmed to affect Gen Y and their visiting intention, visiting intention may not transform into “real” purchase behaviour. Accordingly, marketers may need considerably in-depth analysis on how to apply appropriate marking mix activities to turn Gen Y visiting intention into purchase behaviour.\n",
      "6. Limitation and Future Research\n",
      "As this study was conducted in the end of the semester, a minimal sampling size was obtained. Moreover, data were collected at the Hong Kong International Airport, resulting in participants limited to Gen Y members who travel by air transportation. The respondents may not represent their Gen Y contemporaries who travel through other types of public transport. Opinions of the latter Gen Y travellers may also differ from those expressed in this study. Another limitation of the current research is that several respondents dislike To Yu Fung, the celebrity in the travel program. Hence, the attitude towards celebrity involvement and the affective image of those respondents might decrease.\n",
      "Celebrity endorsement affects destination image and visiting intentions, but turning visiting intension to purchase behaviour requires further investigation. Therefore, exploring how to turn their attitudes (visiting intention) to action (purchase behaviour) is a worthwhile future endeavour.\n",
      "In this research, Gen Y was chosen as a specific group for its potential as regards purchasing in the tourism industry. Materialism grows rapidly at present. Generation “2000” is believed to become future masters and spend additional money in leisure activities. Hence, the relationship between celebrity involvement and the visit intention of Generation “2000” should be investigated in future.\n",
      "Celebrity involvement affects the visitation intention of Generation Y. Celebrities influence the affective image of such group. A favourable affective image influences their visitation intention. Affective image towards the destination is a significant determinant for predicting the destination choice of Gen Y. Destination marketers\n",
      "25 must, therefore, invite a domestic celebrity for endorsing tourism products. Consequently, Gen Y would have positive perceptions and attitudes towards travel destinations.\n",

      "Some ways have been developed to improve the conditions for ensuring the quality preservation of grain during its long-term storage in a metal silo:\n",
      "1. It is necessary to load such a silo with grain completely, preferably up to the top, leaving free supergrannial space as small as possible. This helps to minimize the area of the inner surfaces of the metal silo, on which moisture condensation is possible to form, and its subsequent contact with the grain. It should be borne in mind that not all the designs of metal silos allow loading grain up to the top.\n",
      "2. Another effective method of reducing the possible condensation of moisture formation on the inner surface of the roof is the proper organization of its convective ventilation. In house-building technologies, such a problem is well known and has proven solutions that can be applied very well to provide ventilation of the under- roof space of a metal silo. The essence of such decisions is that in the under-roof space the directional movement of convective upward flows of external air is specially organized. Such free air convection in the under-roof space can be achieved by installing a set of special air supply and air discharge aerators, moreover, air discharge aerators must be installed at the top levels of the roof, and air supplying aerators are closer to the lowest roof cut.\n",
      "For some roof constructions manufacturers declare an annular gap along the lower perimeter of the roof – it could be considered as a distributed supply aerator. Due to the location of the discharge and air supplying aerators spaced apart in height and their corresponding distribution over the entire roof area, the air flow could be organized in direct contact with the inner surface of the roof, which can be defined as “draft” and which is less prone to condensation in its parameters on this inner surface.\n",
      "Based on the considered positions, then on the outer surface of the roof should be installed a calculated set of aerators – discharge and air supplying.\n",
      "However, this is a task for manufacturers of silos – such installation cannot be fully implemented by an operating organization. Manufacturers of silos do not pay enough attention to this problem. The standard air distribution devices installed on the roof of the silo should essentially solve the problem of air inlet / outlet from the silo / into the silo during loading / unloading of grain, as well as with active air ventilation of grain in the silo. Numerous materials at our disposal confirm that the practiced arrangement of such air-distributing devices on the silo roof does not provide full convective ventilation of the inner surfaces of the silo roof and, accordingly, does not help to reduce the risks of moistening grain with condensation moisture.\n",
      "3. Another passive technique that can reduce the risks of condensation moisture is the thermal insulation of the surfaces. Moreover, it is first of all advisable to carry out such thermal insulation precisely on the roof of the silo.\n",
      "Thermal insulation of the walls of the silo will give significantly less economic effect due to significantly higher costs (due to the larger area) and lower technological efficiency. The indicated technique also belongs to the category of recommended design solutions for silo manufacturers.\n",

      "The association of high CR with reduced AD risk existed only in young-old people. This study highlights the importance of lifelong CR in in maintaining late-life cognitive health even among people with limited education.\n",
      "In this population-based cohort study among Chinese rural-dwelling elderly with very limited education, we found that high lifelong CR capacity was associated with reduced risks of late-life dementia and MCI, especially AD and amnestic MCI, but not with vascular dementia and non-aMCI. In addition, the association between high lifelong CR capacity and reduced risk of AD existed only in young-old but not in old-old people. These results suggested the importance of high lifelong CR capacity in maintaining cognitive health and delaying cognitive aging even among people with no or very limited educational attainment.\n",
      "The association of high CR capacity with low risk of dementia has been well established mostly among urban or highly educated populations.3–5 In addition, most of the previous cohort studies have investigated individual CR proxies (e.g., education, mental activity, and social engagement) in association with cognitive outcomes.23–25 Our study targeted rural-dwelling older adults who had no or very limited schooling education. This is important because very few population-based cohort studies have clarified whether very low education could still benefit late-life cognitive function.26 Furthermore, our study used the composited CR capacity derived from lifespan cognitively stimulating factors, which could represent the CR capacity cumulated over the life course. Our study confirmed that lifelong composite CR capacity was a relevant determinant of late-life cognitive phenotypes even among rural older adults with no or very limited education. This is in line with the clinicopathological data from the Brazilian Aging Brain Study, which showed that even a few years of formal education could contribute to CR, and thus benefit late-life cognitive function.27\n",
      "Similarly, a cross-sectional clinic-based study suggested that high education might compensate for the detrimental effects of cortical thinning, but not cerebrovascular lesions (i.e., white matter hyperintensities and lacune), on cognitive function.34 Taken together, findings from the literature and our own study support the view that increased CR capacity could compensate mainly for the adverse cognitive consequences owing to neurodegenerative pathologies rather than vascular brain injury.\n",
      "Previously, the Rush Memory and Aging Project has linked higher lifespan CR capacity with a reduced incidence of MCI.6 Our study extended the previous findings by showing that higher CR capacity was associated with lower risk of aMCI, but not non-aMCI. This has important implications for understanding\n",
      "/20 the neuropathological mechanisms of CR because the underlying neuropathology, prognosis, and evolution of aMCI and non-aMCI differ. Clinico-neuropathological studies suggested that neurodegenerative lesions are the underlying pathology of aMCI,35 whereas cerebrovascular lesions play a pivotal role in non-aMCI.36, 37 Given that higher CR capacity could compensate for the cognitive consequence of neurodegenerative lesions, but not cerebrovascular lesions,28 32 it was reasonable that higher CR capacity could be preferably related to reduced risk of aMCI rather than non-aMCI.\n",
      "Notably, we found that the association of high CR capacity with reduced risk of AD was evident mainly in young-old but not old-old people. This could be partly explained by the view that cognitive benefits of high CR capacity might be gradually diminished with the progression and accumulation of brain pathology (e.g., amyloid and tau proteins) as people age; when the load of age-related brain pathology reached the advanced stage or threshold for manifesting symptoms of cognitive impairment, the high CR capacity might no longer be able to tolerate or compensate for the accumulated brain pathology and delay cognitive decline and dementia.29, 38 This could largely explain our finding that the association of higher CR capacity with lower risk of AD was less pronounced in old-old than in young-old people. These findings may have implications for determining the target population when designing the multimodal interventions that include CR components to delay cognitive decline and dementia.\n",
      "Our population-based cohort study targeted the rural-dwelling older adults who had no or very limited education, in which the composite CR capacity was quantified from multiple cognitive-enhancing indicators experienced over the lifespan, and MCI was defined by integrating clinical assessments with standard neurocognitive tests. However, our study also had limitations. First, we had no biomarkers of brain pathology (e.g., amyloid-β aggregation, tau-protein, and cerebral microvascular lesions), which limited the potential to investigate the underlying neuropathological mechanisms of CR capacity in maintaining cognitive function. Furthermore, our single-center study targeted the elderly population with very limited education from only one rural area in western Shandong province, which should be kept in mind when generalizing our findings to other populations, even rural populations.\n",
      "This population-based cohort study indicates that among rural-dwelling elderly with no or limited education, high lifelong CR capacity is associated with low risks of late-life dementia and MCI, especially\n",
      "AD and aMCI, but not vascular dementia and non-aMCI. In addition, the beneficial effects of lifelong CR capacity on reduced AD risk appeared to be evident only in young-old people (e.g., age < 75 years). These findings could inform the development of intervention strategies to maintain late-life cognitive health among rural populations who have very low literacy.\n",

This will eventually lead to more precise methane budget estimates and will enable research at less studied ecosystems with small methane ﬂuxes, such as lakes, forests, deserts, etc.\n",
      "Speaking of signal attenuation, the three closed-path in- struments had the attenuation generally in the range that can be expected for closed-path design (Fig. 6). The attenua- tion was larger from Prototype-7700, however, McDermitt et al.

      "This likely caused the attenuated cospectra, longer response time, and larger noise and random errors. The size of the open cell may have also contributed to the path averaging of the smaller eddies. Overall, these issues are more related to the measurement setup than to the instrument performance. The one of the main advantages that the open-path design is tra- ditionally thought to have over the closed-path design is that the high frequency attenuation and the resulting spectral cor- rections are smaller. This is because no intake or ﬁlters are required. However, this advantage comes with a drawback of an increased cell contamination, and thus, the increased need of cell cleaning in order to avoid reduced data cover- age, lower data quality and higher random errors.\n",

Therefore, even though the corrections were moderate for RMT-200 and G1301-f ﬂuxes on average, they might have bigger effect on the measurements, when methane ﬂux is low and water vapor ﬂux is high. For G1301- f these corrections can be done easier and with greater conﬁ- dence than for RMT-200, since the instrument measures wa- ter vapor simultaneously with methane, whereas for RMT200 the corrections have to be made using H2O from another instrument, such as LI-7000 in this study. This causes some uncertainty to RMT-200 methane ﬂuxes. However, the newer models by Los Gatos Research (LGR) measure also H2O and these early CH4 analyzers by LGR, such as RMT-200 in this study, can be retroﬁtted to include measurement and data re- porting of H2O (Doug Baer, personal communication).\n",

      "This finding is in line with a study by Kottwitz et al (21), which found that illegitimate tasks were associated with increased cortisol levels among male employees with poor self-rated health but not employees with medium or good self-rated health. The effect-modification by baseline health status may be related to psychological processes that render the individual more vulnerable to the effects of illegitimate tasks. Such processes may involve self-esteem, which is thought to be central to the development of depression (41–43). It is likely that individuals with poor self-esteem are more vulnerable to threats to their social esteem, of which unnecessary work tasks constitute an example.\n",
      "We also found a tendency towards a slightly stronger association between unnecessary work tasks and mental health among older compared to younger employees.\n",
      "This tendency was not explained by job tenure, suggest- ing that the underlying factor was not the duration of exposure. It is possible that age in this context acts as a status indicator and that employee expectations regarding the performance of unnecessary tasks differ according to age. This might explain why older employees possibly experience the performance of unnecessary tasks as more offensive to the self, and consequently more detrimen- tal to their mental health. The direction of such effect modification was, however, not hypothesized before analyzing the data and the result should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating rather than confirmatory.\n",
      "It is central to the concept of illegitimate tasks that the legitimacy of the work tasks is subjectively expe- rienced and linked closely with the professional role identity of the employee. Work tasks are unlikely to be experienced as illegitimate if they are in line with or affirm the core role of the employee – in this context the same tasks are likely to be interpreted as “part of the job” (18). Consequently, the evaluation of the neces- sity of work tasks, and their legitimacy, likely varies across organizational levels. It also seems unlikely that work tasks would be assigned were they not considered necessary from some perspective. The process of elimi- nating unnecessary work tasks, then, is likely to be two- dimensional: First, eliminating tasks that are actually considered unnecessary throughout the organization, and second, working towards a mutual understanding of the necessity of work tasks across organizational levels. Fur- ther research to identify specific interventions that may reduce the levels of unnecessary work tasks in different organizational contexts seems warranted.\n",
      "Strengths and limitations\n",
      "The strengths of this study include the prospective design, the adjustment for baseline mental health, and the relatively large dataset that allowed analyses of effect modification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has prospectively examined the asso- ciation of illegitimate tasks and mental health. These strengths should be weighted against the limitations of the study. First, we measured the exposure of unneces- sary work tasks with a single item and could not assess unreasonable work tasks. Because this study was a sec- ondary data analysis, we chose the exposure measure- ment from the data available. However, the single-item measurement may have decreased the precision of the analyses and increased random error (44). Further, the item phrasing includes an indication of frequency (“do you sometimes have to do…”) that does not correspond well to all response categories (eg, “seldom”). This may have confused some respondents and decreased the measurement reliability.\n",
      "Second, we measured both exposures and outcomes by self-report. Such analyses may raise concerns of common method variance inflating the associations (45,\n",
      "46). Although we addressed such bias by conducting prospective analyses accounting for baseline mental health (45), concerns regarding common method vari- ance remain a valid limitation of this study. However, it should be noted that, because the experience of unneces- sary work tasks is linked with the professional identity of the employee, it is the subjective experience that is of main interest rather than an objective assessment of whether or not the work tasks in question are necessary.\n",
      "Also, no fully objective assessments of mental health exist, as even expert ratings are based partly on the reporting of the individual. Consequently, it does not seem feasible to examine the relation between unneces- sary work tasks and mental health without relying on self-reported data.\n",
      "Finally, the study population consisted of employees in human service organizations primarily within the public sector. This may decrease the generalizability of the findings to organizations outside this field. As most research on illegitimate tasks has focused on public- sector employees, future research on this issue outside the public sector context seems warranted.\n",
      "Concluding remarks\n",
      "Our findings suggest that the elimination of unneces- sary work tasks may be beneficial for employee mental health, particularly among employees with pre-existing poor mental health. Such interventions could target the elimination of tasks that are experienced as unnecessary throughout the organization and the achievement of a joint understanding of the necessity of tasks that are experienced as unnecessary only at some organizational levels.\n",

      "According to the results obtained from the experiment, environmental factors such as climate and management practices have significant effects on botanical composition change. However, there have been obvious decreases in weeds in applications without control plots and these have been replaced by desired species. Among the results obtained, depending on the years of change and not under the pressure of grazing in the rangeland, the grass population increased. When the crude protein yield, relative feed value and weed density are examined, the best application is grubbing. However, fact that grubbing requires intensive human power, thus, this application is not economical for broad-scale applications. Glyphosate and paraquat herbicide applications, which will be applied locally as an alternative to this application, have been determined as applications to increase the yield and quality of rangeland.

      "Taking into consideration the properties and chemical structures of the starch hy- drolysates, the authors predicted two mechanisms of interaction of the biopolymer with the cement components as the most probable ones—speciﬁcally, the hydrophilic mechanism and the dispersing mechanism. The hydrophilic mechanism (Figure 11A) is related to the surface activity of the admixtures. Surface activity is the ability of surfactant molecules to aggregate, under adsorption, at the interface of a given system. Surface tension is the phys- ical phenomenon that occurs at the interface between a liquid surface and a gas, another liquid, or a solid. It is deﬁned as the energy per unit area, or as the work required to extend it by that unit. The change in surface tension is a result of the adsorption of substances on a given surface. The reason for the existence of surface tension is related to the forces of attraction between liquid molecules. The surface tension at the interface between two immiscible liquids is also known as interfacial tension.\n",
      "Figure 11. Diagrams of operation of (A) the hydrophilic mechanism and (B) the dispersant mechanism.\n",
      "Surfactants have a variety of abilities to reduce the surface tension of water and wetting that, in turn, lead to different degrees of plasticization of the cement composites. Reducing the water surface tension is related to the dipole structure of surfactant molecules. Such molecules consist mostly of a positively charged hydrophobic part and a negatively charged hydrophilic part. These molecules position themselves at the water–air interface, turning the hydrophilic part towards water and the hydrophobic part towards air. Because of this, an “elastic membrane”—an adsorption surface—is formed on the surface, the tightness of which depends on the surfactant material.\n",
      "The formation of adsorption layers is a required condition for the reduction of interfa- cial tensions that leads to an increase in the ﬂuidity of cement composites [35]. The effective17 of 19 ness of the liquefaction also depends largely on the structure of the macromolecules—i.e., the length of the polymer chains. For example, in the case of cross-linked biopolymers, a lesser concentration of short-chain particles is conducive to a greater adsorption of the liquid on the surface of the cement grains. Uchikawa [36] and Kim et al. [37] found in their studies that the liquefaction of the mixture is higher with less adsorption.\n",
      "Among the many commercially available admixtures (both plasticizing and liquefy- ing), there are also some that are not surfactants and that exhibit only a dispersing effect, thus increasing the liquefaction of cementitious composites. A schematic of the dispersing mechanism is shown in Figure 11B. The mechanism of action of such substances is based on the adsorption of admixture molecules on the surface of cement grains and dust particles, resulting in the neutralization of surface charges and the induction of a repulsive force between cement grains. The absorbed negatively charged molecules impart this charge to the entire surface. The formation of an electrical double layer (the so-called Helmholz–Stern layer) and a Zeta electrokinetic potential [38] at the phase boundary occurs. This leads to the creation of signiﬁcant repulsive forces, which cause the agglomerates of cement particles to break down into smaller fragments, releasing air and water which, so far, have been closed off.\n",
      "It is also worth noting that there is a clear difference in the course and nature of adsorption between naphthalene and melamine superplasticizers and surfactants. This is related to the fact that the use of plasticizers causes a signiﬁcant reduction of the surface tension at the interface, which leads to moderate air entrainment of the concrete mix.\n",
      "On the other hand, superplasticizers have a reverse effect, which practically does not change the surface tension, but rather signiﬁcantly reduces the interfacial energy at the solid–liquid interface, as a result of which there is practically no air entrainment in the concrete mix, with the simultaneous intense dispersing effect of these admixtures. On the other hand, by increasing the particle number, the cement accelerates its hydration.\n",
      "As presented, even a little amount of each studied dextrin increases the ﬂuidization of a cement mix and the compressive strength of mortar. The analysis of the strength and\n",
      "ﬂow tests demonstrated that the highest values of the above parameters were obtained for samples with the addition of dextrin d2; the minimum increase was obtained for cement mortar beams with the addition of dextrin d5. However, when dextrin is added to the slurry, it results in a signiﬁcant reduction of its yield point τ0, accompanied by a decrease in its plastic viscosity ηpl. The type of dextrin used is a parameter of secondary importance.\n",
      "The degree of polymerisation of added dextrin is seen as having an effect on the physical parameters of cement mortar: the shorter the polymer chain of the studied dextrin\n",
      "(the lower the DP value; see Table 1), the more packed the adsorbent layer (Figure 3C) and the greater the ﬂow diameter of the cement mortar.\n",
      "The study was conducted using white dextrin and yellow dextrin. The dextrins differed in terms of cold water solubility and viscosity parameters, which is due to the difference in the chain length of the various types of hydrolysates. This is directly related to the content of reducing groups and the degree of polymerisation of the starch derivative molecules.\n",
      "The analysis of strength tests demonstrated that the highest values of compressive strength for both the w/c = 0.50 and w/c = 0.45 ratios were obtained for samples with the addition of dextrin d2. The minimum increase in strength was obtained for cement mortar beams with the addition of dextrin d5.\n",
      "The addition of dextrin d3 allowed for a decrease in the w/c ratio to the value of 0.40, which resulted in an increase in compressive strength of 40%, compared to the reference value. Thus, the addition of each of the analysed dextrins increases the compressive strength of cement beams; however, in most cases, the use of a higher than 0.5% share value does not provide an optimum result from the viewpoint of strength.\n",
      "It was found that even a little amount of dextrin increases the ﬂuidization of the cement mix, which results directly from the fact that particles of dextrin include short carbohydrate chains, and possibly from their surface activity at a given range of concentrations.\n",

      "Healthy Sleep Behaviors Among Iranian Elderly results, among the healthy sleep behaviors, “avoiding eating heavy food before going to bed at night” and “controlling the proper bedroom temperature” were the most prevalent behaviors. However, “limiting consumption of drinks from evening onwards” was the least frequent behavior among the elderly. Consistently, in the study by Nakajima et al, “consuming heavy foods late at night” was considered an unhealthy habit and a risk factor that can cause obesity and type 2 diabetes in people (26). The results of another study also indicated a relationship between sleep disorders with heavy food consumption and indigestion\n",
      "(27). In many studies, the observation of healthy eating habits and modification of nutritional behaviors have been considered important factors in improving sleep health and physical and mental health (28). Therefore, it is necessary to design promotional studies to encourage a healthy lifestyle, modify unhealthy habits, and prevent metabolic diseases in communities.\n",
      "In addition, the increased frequency of proper bedroom temperature control in the elderly is among the other findings of the present study that can improve sleep hygiene and induce deep sleep in individuals. This result is consistent with those of Imagawa and Rijal (29). Therefore, promotional studies should be designed to promote a healthy lifestyle and sleep health in the elderly.\n",
      "The findings revealed an association between education level and healthy sleep behaviors, which is in line with the results of Thichumpa et al, demonstrating the association between education level and sleep quality (30). Luo et al also found that older people with a lower level of Chinese education living in Shanghai, China had lower sleep quality compared to more educated people (31), which confirms the findings of the present study. In general, the results of studies indicate that the level of education is an important predictor of the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, especially in the elderly (32). Further, the results of a similar study represented an association between education and health level (33). Overall, stakeholders, planners, and politicians must pay great attention to the socio-economic status of all individuals and all classes in society in order to improve health and prevent the spread of injustice and inequality in the health sector.\n",
      "Moreover, based on the results, a positive and significant correlation was found between healthy sleep behaviors and all constructs of the TPB. Similarly, the results of the study conducted by Strong et al (19) on the healthy sleep behaviors of adolescents based on the TPB confirmed the results of this study. It should be noted that based on evidence, the TPB can be used to understand and recognize many health behaviors, including healthy sleep behaviors (25,34).\n",
      "Our findings showed that perceived behavior control was the best predictor of behavioral intention. Likewise,\n",
      "Zhang et al concluded that the perceived behavior control construct had a predictive power of 29% for the healthy sleep behavior intention in students (35). Based on the results of many studies, the perceived behavior control construct, as an important predictor of the TPB, has a direct impact on sleep health (24,36). Therefore, promotional studies should be designed to increase perceived behavior control. The findings of the present study can be useful for the providers of healthcare to the elderly. In this regard, it seems that if interventions to create behavioral goals in the elderly are focused on enhancing the perception of control\n",

      "Taherpour et al over healthy sleep behaviors, they may lead to useful data on the promotion of healthy sleep behaviors and sleep quality among the elderly. Self-monitoring of behavior, cue alerting, and goal setting are among the methods that can be applied to improve the status of perceived behavior control (23).\n",
      "Furthermore, the findings demonstrated that the behavioral intention construct was a better predictor of healthy sleep behaviors among the elderly in comparison to the perceived behavior control construct. In the same vein, according to Zhang et al, sleep is a routine behavior, and a person’s intent plays an important role in maintaining sleep health, which is generally regarded as an intentional behavior. It was also noted that in the face of challenging situations, individuals’ intent to maintain sleep hygiene plays the most significant role in the absence of any planned coping strategy. Thus, the self-efficacy construct has no significant effect on maintaining and promoting sleep hygiene behaviors, and people’s intent is the only determinant of this behavior (35). It is recommended that other studies should be conducted to determine the mediating role of the intent variable in evaluating healthy sleep behaviors.\n",
      "Regarding the limitation of the present study, one can refer to the self-reporting method of data collection.\n",
      "Moreover, considering that data were collected only from retirement centers in Hamedan, Iran, the generalization of findings to all elderly populations in Iran should be conducted with caution. Finally, it is recommended that future studies examine the determinant role of the intent variable in healthy sleep behavior, which can yield useful the information in this area of research.\n",
      "Overall, the results represented the moderate status of healthy sleep behaviors among the elderly. It also seems that the design and implementation of educational programs for the improvement of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavior control can play a key role in promoting healthy sleep behaviors and sleep quality among the elderly. According to the findings, it seems that the improvement of the perceived behavior control should be the point of focus in educational interventions in the area of healthy sleep behaviors.\n",

      "5.1. Core Habitat Change in the Two Counties\n",
      "According to all the metrics, SLR affects the core habitats in the two counties in different ways. In St. Johns, the impact is relatively minor, with a more even distribution between inland and coastal areas (Figure 14). In contrast, in Chatham, the impact is severe, and the trend in core habitat loss is from east to west. Further studies could explore the threshold of wetlands, such as whether the 3-foot threshold applies to other study areas and whether different types of wetlands should be considered. It seems that there is ample room for further exploration of this topic. When the sea level rises to 3 feet, the wetlands experience significant changes, causing most of the landscape metric data to exhibit a drastic decline or increase. Among the core habitats, Chatham County is expected to be more susceptible to the effects of SLR compared to St. Johns County. This is because the majority of the wetlands in Chatham County are concentrated in the low-elevation and ocean-side eastern regions. The NP, PLAND, and PD metrics indicate a sharp decrease in the number of landscape patches, primarily due to the loss of wetlands.\n",

On the other hand, the impact on Chatham County is more dispersed. The metrics indicate that, as the urban built area diminishes, the number of urban patches increases, especially when the sea level rises from 2 to 3 feet. This suggests that the level of fragmentation in urban built areas progressively increases as the sea level rises. When urban built areas become fragmented, they tend to shrink and become more isolated. This will lead to the loss of green spaces within urban areas and can also exacerbate the urban heat island effect. Urban planning and management will face challenges as fragmented landscapes emerge, characterized by a variety of land ownership patterns and conflicting land uses.

      "Utilizing up-to-date and high-resolution remote sensing data and geospatial predic- tions of localized SLR data, the geospatial analyses, maps, and landscape metrics presented in this study offer an optimal foundation for urban coastal and landscape planning. Further- more, incorporating urban and landscape metrics into SLR studies can provide valuable insights and enhance the understanding of how coastal cities might respond to rising sea levels. Overall, assessing local changes in predicted impacts of SLR on landscapes and urban development can serve as a foundation for designing and implementing effective strategies, enabling us to respond to the challenges posed by rising sea levels with greater confidence and efficiency.\n",

      "The article examines the contribution of economic, social, demographic, behavioural and environmental factors explaining interregional differences in life expectancy at birth of the rural population in Russia. The results of the study revealed a high dependence of life expectancy at birth on the conditions, quality and lifestyle of people, as well as on the level of economic devel- opment, features of social organization and environmental condi- tions in the region. It was found out that availability of medical ser- vices for the rural population, housing quality, a high level of edu- cation are positively associated with the life expectancy of the rural population of Russia, while alcohol abuse, unemployment, low educational level of the population and high crime in the region have negative effect. Our research has confirmed the impor- tant role of the behavioural factors in the system of social determi- nants of health, which coincides with the conclusions of other authors. The number of patients with alcoholism per 100,000 peo- ple (β-coefficient –0.430) has the most significant negative effect; the crime rate in the region (β-coefficient –0.237) is the second negative significant factor, which is consistent with the results of studies by other authors. Scientists call alcohol mortality one of the explanatory reasons for the gap in life expectancy at birth in Russia and European countries (Shkolnikov et al., 2013). Rural territories in Russia are characterized by high mortality of the working-age population from external causes of death, a significant part of which is explained by alcohol abuse. Not only in Russia, but also in other countries, suicide mortality is associated more with alco- hol abuse (Yeom, 2019).\n",
      "The significant factor that positively affects life expectancy is the level of education. Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2010) explored possible explanations for the relationship between education and health behaviour, they showed that income, health insurance, and marital status can account for about 30 percent of the educational gradient, knowledge and cognitive ability explaining another 30 percent. A significant proportion of deaths in rural areas are asso- ciated with behavioural factors, which, in turn, depend on the level of education. In this study a high level of education has a positive effect on the life expectancy of the rural population. The impact of unemployment on life expectancy was noted in three groups of regions (first, second and fourth). Jobs creation and diversification of employment structure are important areas of rural development.\n",
      "At the same time having a job will not always protect physical and mental health: job quality is also important (Wilkinson and\n",
      "Marmot, 2003). The simulation results for the regions of the first group, where the life expectancy of the rural population is higher than the average of the Russian Federation, showed the positive impact of higher government spending on education and an increase in the share of the working-age population. The positive significance of the growth of investments aimed at the develop- ment of health care and the provision of social services was revealed in the fourth group.\n",
      "The authors’ study also revealed a positive effect of the hous- ing quality on the life expectancy of the rural population. It should be noted that the impact of indicators reflecting environmental liv- ing conditions on the life expectancy of the population will exert in the medium and long term. In addition to the considered factors, our study confirms the impact of the availability of health services for the rural population. In Russia, improving the availability and quality of health care is a priority area of the state social policy.\n",

      "There are some limitations in this study. Firstly, for individual variables, the lag structure of the regression equation could be more suitable, since it takes some time for social, economic and environmental conditions to affect the health, mortality and life expectancy of the population. However, for other variables that reflect, for example, the number of crimes, lag dependence is less preferable. Secondly, the study did not cover all socio-economic, demographic and environmental factors, but only a part of them that were approximated by twelve variables. At the same time, key factors that have a decisive influence on the life expectancy of the rural population were included in the regression equation, as evi- denced by the high values of the coefficient of determination in the models.\n",
      "Thus, the study found out high interregional differences in the life expectancy of the rural population. The obtained results con- firm our hypothesis about the significant role of not only environ- mental factors, but also behavioural factors, which depend on the\n",

In order to take into account the influence of interregional differences, a classification of the regions of the\n",
      "Russian Federation by the life expectancy of the rural population has been developed and four relatively homogeneous clusters have been formed. Regression models were constructed not only for the rural population of Russia as a whole, but for each of the four selected groups of regions. An important task of the study was to find out which socio-economic, demographic and environmental factors determine the risks of low life expectancy in a great mea- sure. We determined regions with a low life expectancy of the rural population, and identified factors among which the high number of patients with alcoholism, the unemployment rate calculated according to the ILO methodology, and emissions of pollutants into the air are the most significant. They have a negative relation with the life expectancy in the regions with a low life expectancy of the rural population. At the same time, investments aimed at the development of health care and the provision of social services, the improvement of residential premises (the proportion of the total area of residential premises equipped with gas supply), contribute to an increase in life expectancy. The results of the regression anal- ysis showed that the regions of the fourth group with the lowest life expectancy at birth should be the subject of special attention.\n",
      "Further research will be aimed at the development of spatial models, it is planned to conduct a spatial analysis of the determi- nants of the life expectancy of the rural population in 2010-2020, which will reveal patterns and key trends in the life expectancy of the rural population and the determining factors, the composition of which we plan to expand.\n",

It explains the contribution of economic, social, demographic, behavioural and environmental factors to the interregional differences in life expectancy at birth of the rural population in the rural Russia.\n",

      "The aim of this article is to describe the development and evaluation of a new assessment tool to measure the degree of empowerment in parents who participate in in-school parent associations aimed at engaging their communities in actions to address risky alcohol use in adolescents. Since empowerment is both conﬁdence in one’s own resources and tangible opportunities to generate inﬂuence within the community [3], we developed a scale to measure community self-eﬃcacy, namely the COmmuNity iNtervention SElf-Eﬃcacy SCale for ParenT LEaDers (CONNECTED). The internal consistency value of the scale suggests a good reliability. Regarding validity, the correlation between the scale and other tools assessing similar constructs was good. The CFA showed acceptable results, considering the limited sample size. All in all, the preliminary ﬁndings from our study seem positive in demonstrating that parents’ self-eﬃcacy to engage in community actions can be reliably assessed using quantitative techniques. This is an important achievement because it will help assess the eﬀectivity of empowerment interventions aimed to increase parents’ empowerment when they are in community networks, a line of environmental prevention which is increasingly the focus of research in recent years.\n",
      "The scale being presented in this paper was developed within the context of the evaluation of the\n",
      "EPOPS project (Empowering Parents’ Organizations to Prevent Substance Use). The EPOPS program presents a bottom-up prevention approach to mobilize parents and resources where local authorities,\n",
      "8 of 11 for several reasons, are not able to do so. This situation is consistent in most Spanish and Portuguese regions and is comparable to the situation that most Southern European countries face.\n",
      "Our behavior and socialization are very much driven by the regulatory, physical, and economic environment; the availability of alcohol; the ease of opportunity for unhealthy behaviors; and the perceived normality and acceptance of alcohol use. Alcohol use is common in adolescents’ environments in many European countries, and families can serve as a very important protective environment.\n",
      "However, although there is evidence that parents’ individual behaviors may reduce adolescents’ alcohol and substance use (e.g., clear, simple and neutral rules about the non-use of substances, or the supervision of adolescents’ leisure time or sharing family dinners), there are also other ways parents can inﬂuence other levels of the environment. In this framework, the Families in Network and Active\n",
      "(FERYA, in Spanish) and subsequently the EPOPS program were built from an exhaustive study carried out in six European countries [32,33] which showed that parenting styles work similarly across countries. The program oﬀers parents an innovative way to be actively engaged in prevention, thus inﬂuencing the economic, physical, and regulatory environments that have a potential impact on adolescents’ behaviors. In the current economic climate, where local administrations may be inﬂuenced by the leisure or alcohol industries, well-organized groups of parents may sometimes be the only stakeholders in civil society that could have an impact on decision makers, thereby protecting the development of adolescents’ health and social behavior.\n",
      "Some authors suggest that alpha values between 0.9 and 0.95 are excellent and higher than 8 is good [34–36]. Huh and colleagues [37] indicate that alpha values should be between 0.7 and 0.8 in conﬁrmatory studies. Taking into account these cut-oﬀs, our scale showed a good reliability.\n",
      "Families are an important social agent, especially when they associate and foster changes at the community and environmental levels in partnership with other social agents, such as policy and decision makers, mass media, or industry representatives. Whereas a lack of empowerment results in helplessness and dependency, high levels of parental empowerment result in resilience and conﬁdence in decision-making and proactive behavior [5]. A few examples of empowerment assessment tools that have been applied to speciﬁc ﬁelds such as users of mental health services [36] or families with children with emotional disabilities [9] can be found. The strength of this study is that it addressed both the design and the evaluation of a parent empowerment scale to assess parents’ engagement in community actions.\n",
      "However, a number of limitations have to be mentioned. First, due to the number of items of the questionnaire and the fact that some items are very similar, the alpha obtained in the analysis could have been increased artiﬁcially. Sample sizes for future studies need to be larger. Some authors [38] indicate that increasing the sample size or increasing the number of indicators would aﬀect the power of the results. This may be the case with this questionnaire, in which we have obtained a tendency for goodness of ﬁt in some indices despite bad results in measures aﬀected by sample size. We think that increasing the sample in future studies would help to better assess the quality of the questionnaire.\n",
      "Besides this, increasing the sample would allow us to randomly split the sample and perform EFA on one split and CFA on the other, as some authors suggest [39]. Second, the sample was composed of parents engaged in in-school parents’ associations. Therefore, they might have characteristics diﬀerent to those of parents not engaged in such organizations. As we did not measure the socio-economic factors and the participants were non-randomly recruited, potential social factors of empowerment may have inﬂuenced our ﬁndings. Future studies should aim for a more heterogeneous sample, including parents who are not members of parents’ organizations. This would then enable the comparison of empowerment in parents who are not part of parents’ associations to those who are. The studies should also control for socio-economic variables. Measurement invariance regarding gender and/or nationality should also be assessed. On the other hand, we assumed parents’ leadership because they belonged to and actively worked in the parents’ association. However, in some cases, parents may have felt compelled to take up these positions, especially if no one else was willing to do so.\n",
      "Future studies may assess the degree to which parents freely chose to have active positions in their\n",
      "9 of 11 associations and evaluate if this is related to their empowerment or self-eﬃcacy. Moreover, the validity of the questionnaire may have been inﬂuenced by social desirability. Future studies should use some measures to control for this potential bias. Finally, parental engagement in community life carries strong cultural inﬂuences. Taking into account that the CONNECTED Scale has been designed and validated in Spain and Portugal, its use in other cultures, such as Northern European countries, will require a process of cultural adaptation that takes into account the way in which parents are involved in the community.\n",
      "In conclusion, our ﬁndings present preliminary results indicating that parent self-eﬃcacy to engage in community actions can be assessed with the new scale developed. We believe that it captures the core features of parent community self-eﬃcacy and hope that parent empowerment could be examined in the future using this scale to replicate our ﬁndings in diﬀerent populations of parents and settings for the work of parent associations.\n",
      "Environmental and community prevention strategies supported by families to inﬂuence decision-making and improve their social environment constitutes a promising preventive approach, although assessment tools are needed in this ﬁeld. The developed scale could be a ﬁrst step to identify areas of need within a community, and to monitor the progress and evaluate the outcomes of the preventive interventions implemented.\n",

      "This study investigated the psychometric properties of the SOD-EO, a translated and culturally adapted version of the SDO-OB aimed for use within Spaniards. The SOD-EO satisfaction scale showed an acceptable internal consistency, as indicated by a Cronbach’s alpha at 0.751 and all corrected item total correlations (except for one item; satisfaction with housework = 0.281) being >0.30 [35].\n",
      "The activity level score is only based on the number of activities the person is engaged in and calculating internal consistency is therefore not relevant.\n",
      "Furthermore, the results showed that the SOD-EO activity level and satisfaction scale had the ability to discriminate between service users with mental health problems and adults without any health problems, thus demonstrating known-groups validity. As expected, participants without health problems reported signiﬁcantly higher activity levels and satisfaction scores than the group with mental health problems. These ﬁndings are in line with previous research on the SDO’s discriminating ability when comparing a healthy sample with a sample with illness/disability [23,37]. General occupational balance, however, did not discriminate between service users with mental health problems and adults without any health problems. The SDO-OB/SOD-EO [24] builds upon the most recent version of the\n",
      "SDO and uses the same 13 items, but also includes additional questions about occupational balance.\n",
      "Previous research on the SDO-OB targeted people with mental illness speciﬁcally, i.e., there was no comparison with another group [24]. Accordingly, this is the ﬁrst study of SDO-OB that uses the general occupational balance item to investigate known-groups validity, and future studies can explore this further.\n",
      "Regarding construct validity in terms of convergent validity, SOD-EO satisfaction and activity level were strongly related (p = 0.521), which is in line with other studies of SDO [38]. The correlation between the summed satisfaction score and general satisfaction was also signiﬁcant, although in the realm of moderate (p = 0.399), which is weaker than what other studies have reported [38,39].\n",
      "Regarding discriminant validity the correlation between SOD-EO summed satisfaction and self-rated health showed to be moderate at −0.332, and that between the SOD-EO activity level score and self-rated health was −0.258. This is similar to previous research in the SDO [20]. However, in the present study’s sample of persons with mental health problems, neither over-occupation nor under-occupation were associated with worse health, which deviates from previous research reporting worse self-rated health among people with mental disorders who saw themselves as under-occupied [24]. The analyses addressing construct validity thus yielded somewhat inconsistent results. These results taken together suggest that the construct validity of the SOD-EO in terms of discriminant validity should be investigated further in future research.\n",

      "Spanish occupational therapy will facilitate focusing eﬀorts beyond the improvement of abilities and address opportunities to achieve the well-being of people through occupational participation [40].\n",
      "People with mental health disorders tend to spend a lot of time passively, doing solitary activities, and spending less time at work and other productive activities, experiencing a clear risk of being underoccupied [41,42]. Moreover, disruptions or restrictions in activity engagement can negatively impact health and well-being [43]. Therefore, improving this situation of occupational imbalance becomes one of the aims of treatment in occupational therapy [44]. It is for this reason that SOD-EO can become a valuable tool to identify people’s occupational needs from a subjective point of view.\n",
      "The use of self-reported outcome instruments in health research has become increasingly important because the perspective of therapy users is an essential part of evaluating the eﬃcacy of a treatment [45].\n",
      "To determine the most eﬀective occupational therapy interventions, larger-scale studies are needed, including consistent outcome measures related to occupational aspects as well as physical and mental health outcomes [43]. Since occupational balance guides much of the clinical practice of occupational therapists [45] ﬁdelity measure that ensures consistency in the evaluation of interventions in occupational therapy in Spain.\n",

      "In this study, a differential of the initial moisture content of the paddy was dried in a cross-flow dryer at the parameters of the dryer suitably adjusted, then the operation was repeated by feeding the paddy with more and less IMC. The results showed that the paddy after drying operation with less IMC is suitable for storage or to keep for planting in the next crop year, but it is not suitable for selling. On the contrary, the paddy with more IMC after passing the drying operation would gain a better selling price, although the moisture content is not sufficient for storage or planting in the next crop year. Moreover, the appropriate parameters should be adjust- ed relatively with IMC. This study can be a guideline for the small community to use a dryer efficiently and the findings can be bene- ficial to design automatic drying operation systems in the future.\n",

      "HO2 and RO2 radical concentrations were modelled using the Master Chemical Mechanism and compared to the mea- sured campaign values, with and without the addition of HO2 aerosol uptake. Due to the low calculated value of γHO2, and the high levels of NO, the rate of destruction analysis showed the dominant HO2 loss pathway to be HO2 + NO for all NO mixing ratios, with HO2 uptake not contributing signiﬁcantly to the loss of HO2 (<2 %). However, at the lowest NO mix- ing ratios (i.e. < 0.1 ppb), HO2 loss onto aerosols contributed up to a maximum of 29 % of the total HO2 loss. Using the modelled HO2 and RO2 radical concentrations for model sce- narios with and without HO2 uptake showed that on average the O3 production regime was VOC-limited across the entire campaign, with the exception of several days with low NO mixing ratio where the regime tended towards NOx-limited, meaning that small changes in NOx would not have a large effect on the O3 production for this summer period in Bei- jing, though changes in HO2 uptake could. While the addi- tion of the calculated uptake coefﬁcient did not change the overall O3 regime across the campaign, with the O3 produc- tion regime remaining strongly VOC-limited, the transition from a VOC-sensitive to NOx-sensitive O3 regime occurs at higher NOx. This means that for Beijing, where the O3 production regime is strongly VOC-sensitive and NOx lev- els are high, any policy looking to reduce O3 via the reduc- tion of NOx needs to consider concurrent PM reduction poli- cies which may affect HO2 uptake. In cleaner environments, where NOx levels are lower, but aerosol surface area is still high, lower values of γHO2, i.e. less than 0.2, could have a more signiﬁcant effect on both overall HO2 concentration and the O3 production regime.\n",

      "The first hypothesis stated that there will be significant inverse relationship between burden of care and psychological health. The results showed that there was significant inverse relationship between burden of care and psychological health. The result implies that caregivers who are high on burden of care significantly report low psychological health. The finding showed a highly negative correlation between burden of care and psychological health. This simply means that caregivers are at risk of developing psychiatric illness/ poor psychological health. This findings support the work done by Dean and Gadd\n",
      "(1990), on the family caregiver alliance and many other previous research which indicate that extra demands of caregiving takes a  toll on a person’s physical and mental wellbeing and some of the health risks that face long-term caregivers includes -anxiety ,stress, depression, illness  and more threatening compared to non-caregivers. This is not surprising because the link between stress and personal health is very strong (Kiecolt-Glaser & Glaser, 1992).When exposed to stressors, we generally experience many physiological reactions and when confronted with a continuing set of demands, it reduces the ability to function and is capable of generating health problems. Caregivers experience burden/stress when the demands placed on them exceed the resources; they have available to meet those demands. Furthermore, caregiver’s interpretation of potentially stressful events will also contribute either to improve or negatively affect health. For instance, a caregiver who perceives his or her ability to cope as weak will experience more burden and vice-versa. This is similar to the findings of the burden experienced by family caregivers of patients with epilepsy (Nuhu, et al; 2010).\n",
      "In a study conducted by Ekwall, Sivberg and Hallberg (2005), it was evident that there was a significant relationship between loneliness, limited social network and decline in quality of life of family caregivers; who face increased stress and strain because of their participation in care giving activities and were more likely to have higher morbidity and mortality than caregivers who report little or no difficulty providing care to the patients.  Similar results have been found by study of\n",
      "Schulz and Beach (1999). Researchers have also shown that caregivers can suffer from physical ailments as well as anxiety and depression, strain in marital relationships, restrictions of roles and activities, and diminished physical health (Given et al, 2004)\n",
      "Though the aspects of care giving that caused burden may be generally similar, the experiences reported by relatives are often varied, depending on the nature of the illness, and effects of different psychological factors. Some earlier researchers had also found that the general experience of burden was moderate among most caregivers of psychiatric patients, with the feeling of being in danger being mildest and worry being most severe (Howritz and Reinhand, 1995). Another study also reported that more than half of the caregivers felt that their work load had increased due to illness in patient (de Silva & de Silva, 2001).\n",
      "The second hypothesis stated that there will be significant positive relationship between emotional intelligence and psychological health. The results revealed that there was positive significant relationship between emotional intelligence and psychological health. The result indicates that caregivers with high level emotional intelligence significantly relate to increase in psychological health. The hypothesis is thus accepted. This finding is in consistent with the studies done by Extremera, Salguero and Fernández\n",
      "Berrocal (2011), which revealed that higher EI is significantly correlated with psychological comfort and pleasure. An individual with high EI are likely to be more able to manage work stressors effectively.\n",
      "Also, Taylor (2001) also argued that emotionally intelligent people can cope better with life’s challenges and control their emotions more effectively, two abilities which contribute to good psychological and physical health. Individuals who can regulate their emotions are healthier because they ‘they perceive and appraise their emotional states accurately, know how and when to express their feelings, and can effectively regulate their mood states’. Therefore, a high level of emotional intelligence is necessary for caregivers who are under severe stress.\n",
      "Emotional intelligence (EI) has basic components including, self-awareness which helps the person to name and understand his emotions, and push him towards change (Mayer, Roberts, &Barsade,\n",
      "2008). Thus, self-awareness can help individual to find out the impact of his actions and the more important impact of his emotions on others. In caregiving practice, EI proved to create positive work dedication, to improve work outcomes and to enhance interpersonal conflict management abilities with the resulting decreased stress (Go¨rgens-Ekermans& Brand, 2012). This finding can be  explained by the fact that individuals with stressful jobs, such as caregiving, if have confidence in their abilities, have knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses, can understand their emotions when  they face them, and realize that their behavior  directly affects others, will perform better in stressful situations, better help sick relatives and keep them safe. This present finding could also be explained that caregivers who have good control over their emotions and consider a variety of possibilities before making a decision can be better suited to stress conditions.\n",
      "The third hypothesis stated that there will be significant positive relationship between social support and psychological health. The results revealed that there was significant positive relationship between social support and psychological health.  The result implies that caregivers who are high on social support significantly report high psychological health. The hypothesis is thus accepted. The finding is similar with other findings of Lahuerta, et al.; 2004 found that caregivers’ levels of social support have a likely impact on their psychological well-being.  The finding is similar with other findings). There is evidence that social support is very essential in predicting the well-being for everyone, ranging from childhood through older adults (Cohen & Wills, 1985). Caregivers with high social support tend to have the ability to use effective coping strategies to handle caregiving role. Vaux (2013) pointed out that social support from friends and family members   promotes good mental health. Friends as well do respond with concerns and it boosts confidence and self-esteem by offering reassurance and\n",
      "65 compliments. They show empathy and advice a person facing difficulties or loss. Social support offsets the negative effect of severe stressors like caregiving role and it protects one against the damaging effects. For instance, caregivers who have a good social support can cope and interpret an event as less stressful. They also act to improve self-appraisal and self-esteem. They are happier and healthier and live longer.  On the other hand, caregivers who have poor social support and interprets their relationships with others as not satisfactory, that is, they felt they are not cared or loved, may not have the ability to adjust appropriately or cope with the imposed demands of caregiving role. In most cases, it increases the level of depression, anxiety and poorer mental health of the caregivers.\n",
      "The fourth hypothesis stated that burden of care, emotional intelligence and perceived social support will jointly and independently predict psychological health. The result revealed that caregivers’ burden of care, emotional intelligence and perceived social support jointly predicted psychological health. When combined the respondents’ burden of care, emotional intelligence and perceived social support accounted for 44% of the change observed in the psychological health among caregivers of mentally ill patient. This revealed that the collective presence of burden of care, emotional intelligence and perceived social support has significant influence on the psychological health. The result also revealed that burden of care and perceived social support were significant independent predictors of psychological health. While emotional intelligence found to have no independent significant prediction on the psychological health. The result demonstrates that caregivers with high burden of care significantly reported low psychological health and caregivers with high level of perceived social support significantly reported high level of psychological health.\n",
      "The hypothesis was supported.  The result contrast the study by Studies by Martins, Ramalho and\n",
      "Morin (2010), suggested that higher emotional intelligence (EI) is linked to improved psychological and physical health, and a meta-analysis further emphasizes that the link between trait EI and mental health is very crucial. This set of characteristics, dealing with the perception, expression, and regulation of moods and emotions, suggests that there must be a direct link between emotional\n",
      "Intelligence and physical as well as psychological health (Salovey et al., 1999). An emotionally intelligent person can cope better with life’s challenges and control their emotions more effectively, both of which contribute to good psychological and physical health.\n",
      "Mental illness as already said, almost always alters a person’s life dramatically. People with severe mental illnesses experience distressing symptoms that can make it difficult to hold a job, go to school, interact freely with people and cope with ordinary life demands. Some individuals require hospitalization because they become unable to care for themselves or because they are at risk of committing suicide. Behavioural disturbance, physical and verbal abuse, threatening and other dangerous irresponsible behaviour are commonly found in psychiatric patients. There are several psychiatric symptoms, especially in people suffering from schizophrenia, that their care-givers find it difficult to deal with and which cause them to feel distressed and helpless.\n",
      "The psychological health of the family caregiver is negatively affected by providing care. Higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health effects are common among family members who care for a relative or friend. Studies have showed reliable evidences that the care- givers of individuals with mental illness suffer from a number of significant stresses and moderately high levels of burden (Grad & Sainsbury, 1963). Relatives of mentally ill people make great sacrifices in their role as care-givers. They tend to tolerate disturbed behaviour and rarely complain.\n",
      "Mental illness imposes an economic as well as a social cost to individuals, and to their families.\n",
      "Several studies have shown increased financial dependence and unemployment in people with psychiatric disorders (Rupp & Keith, 1993). Sometimes, a care giver has to give up work to look after their ill relative.\n",
      "The role of social support has been explored in the context of its effects on caregivers. Social support is the physical and emotional and financial comfort given to an individual’s by their significant others. It understands that we are part of a community of people who love and care for us, value and think well of us and it is one the ways of minimizing the negative outcomes of caregiving.\n",
      "The demand for caregivers continues to rise worldwide as a result of an increasingly health problems. This research study shows that people are connected in such a fashion that the health of one person is related to the health of another. As a result, caregiver health is quickly becoming a public health issue that requires more focused attention from health professionals and policy makers.\n",
      "The findings of the study showed that there is significant adverse effect in the psychological health of caregivers which ranges from the high burden of caring, poor social support and employment. It seems clear that a person's illness can have health consequences for others in his or her social network. This study therefore serves as awareness to increasing appropriate mental health services and medical care for family caregivers as an important step toward addressing caregiver health.\n",
      "Emotional Intelligence (EI) appears to be crucial for caregivers in the management of the mentally ill patients. It is refers to our ability to recognize our own feelings and those of  others and encompasses managing emotions effectively in ourselves and in our relationships. Emotional intelligence (EI) is featuring more prominently in health service literature and its importance is now being acknowledged in practice (Akerjordet and Severinsson, 2008). We need EI to manage relationships with family members and ill relatives. EI and failure to understand emotional issues can have significant negative outcomes on the health and wellbeing of caregivers.\n",
      "The findings of this study also suggest the need for caregiver education and support programs. EI needs to be acknowledged and included innovatively in the health talks at every out-patient clinic.\n",
      "As clinical psychologists, we have a responsibility to potential psycho-educate caregivers and the general public on the emotional challenges which arise in complex life situations which exist in caregiving practice. Huge number of clinical psychologists should be employed to work in every hospital in Nigeria most importantly in the mental health hospital where caregivers of mentally ill patients are more likely to be found. This will create an avenue to assess, administer psychotherapeutic intervention like group therapy involving cognitive behaviour therapy and relaxation training to manage both social and psychological challenges associated with caregiving.\n",

      "To the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst review to systematically analyse the published literature on the combined eﬀects of IF and resistance training on changes in LBM in recreationally active and non-elite trained individuals. The major ﬁnding is that, despite heterogeneity in study design, especially fasting method, LBM was generally maintained when IF and resistance training were undertaken concurrently during the short to medium term. Though four studies observed mean increases in LBM [24,26,29,31], only one study reported a statistically signiﬁcant increase\n",
      "(0.9–1.2 kg) [26]. Interestingly, the study that reported the statistically signiﬁcant increase in LBM also observed a mean increase in participants’ body weights, which is in contrast to all other studies, and indicates that energy balance may be a potential contributing factor. Thus, it remains unclear whether LBM accrual is possible when fasting, combined with resistance training, results in an overall energy deﬁcit. Additionally, the length of the intervention may also be a factor given most studies were only 4–8 weeks in duration. Therefore, further research is needed to examine the longer term eﬀects of these interventions, but also other forms of IF, with the majority of studies focusing on TRF and Ramadan style fasting.\n",
      "For many individuals, the primary goal of resistance training is to increase LBM, or at the very least, maintain it. Of the eight studies included and reviewed, only one study showed a reduction in\n",
      "LBM from baseline when IF and resistance training were undertaken together [28]. However, it should be noted that this reduction was small, and although signiﬁcant, was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent to the other experimental groups in the study [28]. This small reduction could be due to the addition of aerobic exercise (20 min) at the end of each resistance training session with evidence suggesting that concurrent training (performing both resistance and aerobic exercise together) may compromise resistance training-induced muscle adaptations due to the “concurrent training eﬀect” (CTE) [32].\n",
      "However, whether CTE is the reason for the LBM reduction in the Oh et al. [28] study is unknown.\n",
      "Whilst the majority of studies included suggest that LBM can be maintained when undertaking\n",
      "IF and resistance training together, it is less clear whether or not the accrual of LBM is compromised.\n",
      "A number of studies did report mean increases in LBM [24,26,29,31], however, only one study reported a statistically signiﬁcant increase (0.9–1.2 kg) [26]. This was evident by a main eﬀect for time, with no diﬀerence (interaction) between the TRF or normal diet groups. Of particular note is that, despite participants in this study being prescribed an energy deﬁcit of ~250 kcal per day, energy intake actually increased over the intervention period, which led to an increase in mean weight for all groups by the end of the study. Given this was the only study to show a meaningful and signiﬁcant increase in LBM, it does suggest that an apparent energy surplus (as evidenced by a mean increase in weight) could be a major determinant in supporting training-induced adaptations, such as muscle growth [33]. Therefore, it raises an important question of whether IF compromises growth of LBM when undertaking resistance training without an apparent energy surplus. Interestingly, changes in LBM were not statistically\n",
      "14 of 17 diﬀerent between intervention and ‘normal diet’ control groups in the studies that included such a comparative group [24–28,30]. This is somewhat surprising, given most, though not all, resistance training interventions lead to an increase in LBM [34]. It is possible the length of training (i.e., 4–8 weeks) used in the reviewed studies did not allow adequate time for signiﬁcant growth to occur. Although the time-course of muscle hypertrophy is poorly deﬁned, it is usually expected to begin within a couple of months for untrained individuals, with those with prior training experience observing the eﬀects later [35]. Furthermore, while most training programs were of similar frequency across studies\n",
      "(i.e., 3–4 sessions per week), the number of repetitions, load and whether or not participants worked to failure varied, which may have aﬀected total volume of work. Indeed, variation in overall volume, as opposed to frequency, seems to have greater impact on muscle growth [36]. Thus, it is likely that the relatively short durations and variations in volume/eﬀort of training programs used in the reviewed studies, rather than IF per se was an important determining factor in the observed eﬀects on LBM. It is clear that further research is needed that incorporates longer training programs (>8 weeks), to gain a better understanding of the impact of IF on training-induced adaptations.\n",
      "Protein intake is another major determinant of training-induced changes in LBM [37]. Of the six studies that reported it [24–27,29,30], protein intake ranged from 1.2 g/kg/day to 1.9 g/kg/day, which is close to or above the level recommended for LBM maintenance and accrual [37]. In the one study that reported a LBM loss [28], no protein intake was reported, and indeed no emphasis appeared to be given to protein intake for participants. While it is possible that insuﬃcient protein intake could be a contributing factor for the observed LBM loss, participants in this study also lost the most weight compared to all other included studies, possibly due to a combination of the more severe energy restriction protocol used and the extra aerobic exercise component included. Thus, larger weight reductions and periods of greater energy deﬁcit (though not directly measured) could also be a contributing factor.\n",
      "The observed eﬀects of IF and resistance training on fat mass and body fat percentage were less consistent. Five studies reported statistically signiﬁcant changes in body fat mass or body fat percentage [24,26–28,31]. The remaining three studies [22,26,27] reported no signiﬁcant changes. Body fat losses ranged from an average of 0.7 kg to 2.7 kg, while body fat percentage reductions ranged from 0.8–2.5%. The variability in fat loss is likely a reﬂection of intervention duration, total energy intake and participant characteristics, such as sex and baseline weight status. The modiﬁed ADF study [28] demonstrated the greatest weight and fat loss compared to other fasting protocols. This is to be expected given they prescribed the most severe energy restriction, included an extra aerobic exercise component and had the equal longest duration. However, weight loss does not appear to be a pre-requisite for changes in body fat or body fat percentage in the studies reviewed. While four of the\n",
      "ﬁve studies that showed changes in these measures resulted in (generally small) concomitant weight loss [24,27,28,31], one study showed a reduction in fat, despite a gain in weight [26]. This provides evidence that IF with resistance training can improve body composition (at least with regard to body fat loss) independent of large energy deﬁcits. Changes in metabolic fuel preference during fasting is a likely mechanism behind the enhanced fat loss, with a decline in carbohydrate oxidation and increases in fat oxidation, ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis evident [38,39]. However, whether these contribute to meaningful changes in body fat levels requires further investigation.\n",
      "There are several limitations associated with this review and the included studies.\n",
      "Firstly, our review only considered changes in whole body LBM, which does not capture local changes in muscle hypertrophy. Half of the included studies (all TRF studies) did use more sensitive assessments of muscle hypertrophy (i.e., muscle ultrasound). While two studies showed similar directional change in comparison to the whole body LBM changes assessed by DXA or a 4C model [24,27], the other two reported conﬂicting results [26,27]. Given the majority of studies comparing these diﬀerent techniques have been undertaken in clinical (i.e., sarcopenic) populations, it is clear that further work is needed in populations included in this review. Secondly, most studies did not include an IF only comparator group, making it unclear whether there is an additive eﬀect of resistance training on LBM\n",
      "15 of 17 compared to IF alone. Thirdly, the included studies were all of a short to medium duration, and results cannot be generalised to longer intervention periods. Finally, while the authors tried make our search comprehensive, we focused on the published literature only.\n",
      "Lean body mass is generally maintained when IF, including when followed for religious reasons, is combined with resistance training. However, whether or not IF inhibits LBM accrual is unclear, and may be contingent on the adequate provision of protein, and energy balance. The combination of\n",
      "IF and resistance training may also lead to a reduction in body fat, not only during apparent energy deﬁcit, but also energy surplus. Given low muscle mass and poor muscle strength are important risk factors for disability and potentially mortality, especially in older individuals, these ﬁndings may also have important clinical implications. Future research should aim to examine the longer-term eﬀects of various IF regimes with resistance training on LBM, incorporating varying levels of energy intake, and, where possible, appropriate non-exercise and non-fasting control groups. Furthermore, given the growing popularity of IF for weight loss, future research should also consider whether IF paired with resistance training is more or less eﬀective and sustainable compared to other traditional forms of energy restriction diets.\n",

      "The study took up estimating the Impact of the macroeconomic indicators shocks on KSA non-oil exports 1970-2019. The study employed two econometric models. The first technique is SVAR which allows imposition of three long run restrictions to examine the dynamic relationship among the choice variables. Result of the variance decomposition analysis indicate that macroeconomic indicators shocks have considerable contributions in explaining the shocks to non-oil exports both in the short-run and long-run, while non-oil exports have predictive power on macroeconomic indicators shocks only in the long-run. However, the predictive power of macroeconomic indicators shocks in explaining the shocks to the non-oil exports in KSA is much stronger even in the long-run. The second technique is NARDL which allows imposition of long run restrictions to examine the equilibrium relationship is short and long term.\n",

      "Earth system models in order to capture the impact of non- linear climate–biosphere feedbacks, biodiversity, and ecolog- ical resilience on the future dynamics of carbon sinks. How- ever, although the introduction of either TDR or ECO leads to opposing trends in POC export in response to warming, the overall impact on the ocean carbon sink is relatively mod- est. Our cGEnIE experiments simulate a decline in the ocean carbon sink capacity of around ∼6.5 PgC (∼0.06 PgCyr−1) during the 21st century under an RCP8.5 scenario when ac- counting for TDR. This can be compared to a previous esti- mate of a ∼18 PgC (∼0.18 PgCyr−1) decline in ocean car- bon sink capacity by 2100 CE in response to RCP8.5 made using a simpler NPZD-based ecosystem representation that differentiated silicifying plankton (Segschneider and Bendt- sen, 2013), and to the 2018 ocean carbon sink uptake rate of 2.6 ± 0.6 PgCyr−1 (Friedlingstein et al., 2019). This de- cline is partially countered when greater ecological complex- ity and ﬂexible stoichiometry is introduced as well, with a shift to smaller plankton classes in response to oligotrophi- cation leading to a 21st century ocean carbon sink reduction of ∼5.9 PgC. Other processes that are not resolved in this conﬁguration of ecoGEnIE could also substantially affect the biological pump, such as ballasting, calciﬁer–siliciﬁer trade- offs, nitrogen cycle and stoichiometry–acidiﬁcation feed- backs (Buchanan et al., 2019; Dutkiewicz et al., 2015; Lan- dolﬁet al., 2017; Riebesell et al., 2007; Somes et al., 2016;\n",
      "Tagliabue et al., 2011), deep chlorophyll maxima, and (on longer timescales) redox-dependent feedbacks (Niemeyer et al., 2017; Watson, 2016). Limited physical resolution can have signiﬁcant impacts on biogeochemistry (Sinha et al.,\n",
      "2010), also limiting our results. Further work is required to assess the impact of these features on our estimates.\n",
      "Few of the ESMs used in CMIP5 sufﬁciently resolve ma- rine ecology, instead relying on simple plankton ecosystems that are often highly parameterised with minimal or non- existent ecological and metabolic dynamics (Table 1). This reduces computational expense, allowing higher resolution of important physical processes, but it comes at the price of poorly resolving known biogeochemical and ecological feed- backs that can substantially affect carbon partitioning (An- derson, 2005; Ward et al., 2018). To date, gains in com- putational power have largely been allocated to improved resolution and physical process representation, whereas de- spite recent progress, biogeochemical parameters have re- mained too poorly constrained to allow greater biogeochemi- cal complexity in high-resolution ESMs. However, the devel- opment of trait-based ecological models could enable ESMs to include more complex marine biogeochemical modules without compromising the high-resolution representation of physical processes. An approach that focuses on functional traits and generic ecosystem rules potentially reduces the need for taxonomy-speciﬁc parameterisations and also al- lows for better representation of allometric effects. Devel- opment of biogeochemical models with higher physical res- olution would also allow more accurate representation of\n",
      "ﬁne-scale biogeochemical processes such as the interaction of stratiﬁcation, the nutricline, and deep chlorophyll max- ima in oligotrophic regions (Richardson and Bendtsen, 2017,\n",
      "2019), which are issues raised in this study that have not been possible to explore. EMICs with lower physical res- olution can more readily incorporate ecological complexity though, and they remain a crucial tool for further exploring these feedbacks in the interim (Chien et al., 2020; Frants et al., 2016; Kriest, 2017; Kriest et al., 2020; Niemeyer et al.,\n",
      "2019; Sauerland et al., 2019; Schartau et al., 2017; Ward et al., 2018; Wilson et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2019).\n",
      "In this study, we focus on the dominant soft tissue bio- logical pump, but the variable response of plankton classes with different shell types to climate change and ocean acidiﬁcation also has an impact on the biological pump. For in- stance, siliciﬁers with opal-based shells, such as diatoms, thrive in nutrient-rich waters. Segschneider and Bendtsen\n",
      "(2013) found that the increased nutrient recycling when TDR was introduced in their model initially drives an increase in diatom production and opal export in response to climate change. In their model, this soon leads to silicate-depleted surface waters and suppressed diatom production, allowing a subsequent increase in calcifying plankton and PIC export instead. This has the effect of reducing surface alkalinity and increasing surface pCO2, which drives a substantial propor- tion of the large ocean carbon sink reduction in their analy- sis. Despite the likely importance of this “hard-shell” mech- anism, ecoGEnIE does not currently allow independent rep- resentation of calciﬁers and does not represent siliciﬁers at all; thus, the potential impact of this mechanism is not re- solved by our results. However, the model of Segschneider and Bendtsen (2013) does not feature size classes or ﬂexible stoichiometry, which we have shown is important for deter- mining the soft tissue biological pump response, and their results did not account for the effects of ocean acidiﬁcation.\n",
      "In order to fully compare our results it will be necessary to re- peat these simulations with the siliciﬁer-enabled ECOGEM currently under development. Together, resolving plankton size classes, TDR, ﬂexible stoichiometry, and separate sili- ciﬁer and calciﬁer functional types will allow the response of the marine biological pump to climate change to be more fully diagnosed.\n",
      "Further development will also allow the potential impact of ballasting to be assessed. Using a different EMIC, Kvale et al. (2015, 2019) found that adding ballasting alongside calciﬁer functional types mitigated the biological pump re- sponse to ocean warming by facilitating increased calciﬁer production and, therefore, increasing nutrient export from the surface. In contrast, activating ballasting in ecoGEnIE without separating out a competitive calciﬁer functional type would likely result in greater surface water remineralisation in scenarios with reduced PIC production. However, empiri- cal observations have suggested that the ballasting effect on the ocean carbon sink is weaker than has been hypothesised\n",
      "(Wilson et al., 2012).\n",
      "The response of the biological pump to climate change is important for projecting climate feedbacks and the future be- haviour of the ocean carbon sink, but many of the most inﬂuential Earth system models fail to incorporate sufﬁcient metabolic or ecological complexity for this to be fully re- solved. In this study, we have investigated the impact of inte- grating temperature-dependent remineralisation, size-based biodiversity, and ﬂexible nutrient usage on the biological pump and ocean carbon sink in response to climate change.\n",
      "As expected, we found that adding temperature-dependent remineralisation to an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (ecoGEnIE) results in a greater weakening of the ocean carbon sink as a result of climate change. However, this actually results from a relative strengthening of the bio- logical pump itself as a result of shallower nutrient reminer- alisation, contrary to the common expectation that the direct effect of warming further ampliﬁes a weakening of the bio- logical pump. Conversely, adding trait-based ecosystem dy- namics instead results in an even weaker biological pump, as a result of oligotrophication favouring smaller plankton, and in turn a larger ocean carbon sink. Finally, combining both of these features results in a small relative strengthening of the biological pump and a modest reduction in the ocean carbon sink capacity relative to default simulations.\n",
      "Together, this implies that the biological pump positive feedback on climate change may be larger than CMIP5\n",
      "ESMs project but is potentially less than some more recent model projections (Segschneider and Bendtsen, 2013; Stef- fen et al., 2018). This study has primarily focused on the al- lometric aspects of dominant soft tissue components of the biological pump, and the results clearly illustrate the substan- tial degree to which ecological dynamics and biodiversity can modulate the strength of climate–biosphere feedbacks. These complex relations require further analyses and validation, but comparison of model studies is presently a challenge because today’s ESMs take such different approaches and simpliﬁca- tions. In future, trait-based ecological modules that go be- yond simple biogeochemical traits could enable ESMs to in- clude more ecological complexity without compromising the high-resolution representation of physical processes, allow- ing feedbacks such as the marine biological pump to be more fully resolved.\n",

      "A series of unfortunate events and human error coincided disastrously to cause the rig explosion. Lack of proper inspection and supervision of drilling, cost cutting and quick technical fixes contributed to the disaster. The explosion and subsequent oil spill has left a legacy of toxic pollution that will linger on for many years threatening many already endangered species. For some of the members of the Gulf coast, it will take decades for the effects of contaminated food to be felt in among population as a result of bioaccumulation and biomagnification of toxins in individuals and along the food chain respectively.\n",

It is envisaged that lessons learned from this accident will inspire great technological solutions, pragmatic policies and collective will to deal with future accidents effectively and efficiently.\n",
      "11. Recommendations\n",
      "Given the bitter lessons from this oil spill, proper government policies and monitoring mechanisms should be established and well qualified oversight committee should be set up to monitor the operations of oil companies in order to prevent such calamities. The oversight committee should be well trained, properly resourced and adequately funded to carry out effective and efficient supervision of oil drilling. Government environmental laws regarding oil drilling should be made more stringent and individual corporate employees who do not comply with these standards should be liable for criminal negligent charges.\n",
      "The most nerve-racking part of this disaster is how long it took BP to cap the well. The US government was equally helpless in the face of public outcry. This makes one wonder how and why permits for offshore oil exploration could be granted without prudent scrutiny of procedures for preventing and fixing accidents. Future permit conditions should include regular drills, acquisition of well-tested and workable stand-by technology for fixing broken oil wells. This should be backed by refined protocol, organization and management of accidents.\n",
      "BP should change its philosophy from ‘command and control’ to ‘cooperation and transparency’. BP needs to be open about its operations and affiliated companies should share information, knowledge and expertise before, during and after crises. There is the need for establishing an independent team of oil rig inspectors which should be made of representatives from industry, government, International Standards Organization (ISO), communities and non-government environmental organizations to undertake regular testing, monitoring and assessment of oil rig operations and offer recommendations where necessary.\n",
      "This will provide necessary checks and balances and avoid oversights.\n",
      "BP needs to put safety concerns first before costs because prevention is cheaper than cure.\n",
      "Careless and ill-conceived short-term cost-cutting measures could result in long-term recurring costs of clean up, claims, property losses etc. It is in the best interest of BP to do the right thing to avert a disaster and uphold its reputation rather than waste billions of dollars on remediation legal battles and reclaiming its image. Given that there were computing and telecommunication system failures prior to the oil rig explosion, BP management should undertake a complete overhaul of their early warning systems in order to install effective monitoring systems with equally efficient and effective back-ups. A well-qualified and dedicated expert should be employed full-time to ensure proper functioning of the safety and communication systems.\n",

The driest year (2017) had the second highest amount of carbon sequestered (−364 gCm−2yr−1). This indicates that the optimum temperature and moderate precipitation of the higher latitude region may be the driver of carbon sequestration of deciduous forests in the region. This aligns with the positions of other studies of the region [35,36,40], which observed variations from\n",

      "The year 2018 (the wettest year) had the lowest carbon sequestered (−144 gCm−2yr−1).\n",
      "A plausible reason for this may be that the year had more cloud cover due to higher precipitation than other years. This would decrease the amount of ambient light penetrating the forest ecosystem and therefore light use efficiency, leading to lower photosynthetic productivity [35,60].\n",
      "Further investigation of the literature across several regions also indicates that carbon sequestration potential is greatly modulated by the age of the forest, with very young forests—0 to 20 years—having higher NEE [61] compared to mature forests like that of this study (20–100 years), while old growth forests—above 100 years—have the lowest\n",
      "NEE rates [37,39]. Young forests’ trees’ rate of photosynthesis exceeds that of respiration comparatively, and therefore, more carbon is converted into energy and stored, hence resulting in higher carbon sequestration. However, as the forest grows, the NEE rate declines as the balance of gross photosynthetic productivity (GPP) to carbon respiratory use tilts to support more ecosystem respiration to support the tree structure. Also, respiration increases because of forest disturbances as the tree grows [62]. Therefore, the old growth trees expend more carbon to maintain their stands and store less carbon. Likewise, the extent of the interannual variability in NEE at similar colder regions can be influenced by forest management. Actively managed sites, as in a study in Iceland and Denmark [63],\n",
      "17 of 23 demonstrate that managed deciduous broadleaf trees can be a consistent carbon sink (−100 to −150 gCm−2yr−1), even at low temperatures (Table 8). Another reason for witnessing this annual NEE status is the seasonal pattern of forest carbon sequestration. In our study, a clear seasonal pattern of air temperature was observed. In the frigid winter months, ambient temperature and sunlight are low; hence, photosynthetic conversion is limited. Most deciduous trees in the area enter a dormancy period in this season by shedding their leaves to prevent water loss and using stored-up carbohydrates as an energy source [64–66]. The mean RE (117.62 g C m−2 season−1) was higher than the GPP (−25.76 g C m−2 season−1), leading to more carbon loss. During this period, more of the carbon stored in the previous season is expended. As the year progresses towards spring and summer seasons, the NEE rate also improves, peaking in summer (−468.16 g C m−2 season−1), where GPP is almost twice the ecosystem respiration on average. It is important to point out that within the summer months, NEE reached its peak (−0.254 g C m−2 h−1) in June (21.9 ◦C), before the hottest month, July (23.9 ◦C). This shows the level of heat stress the trees can withstand, as trees shut down at above-threshold temperatures, affecting both photosynthesis and carbon sequestration [67]. As temperature increases beyond an optimum point, cellular respiration increases, reducing carbon sequestration potential. However, as seen at the study site, the plant closes its stomata when air temperature becomes excessive [68–70] to conserve water for plant use, which invariably limits its CO2 absorption and, eventually, causes GPP to start to decline (July). As summer temperatures dwindle, so too does the photosynthetic rate.\n",

This study’s findings revealed that light largely influenced the extent of NEE through gross productivity. This is true because photosynthesis occurs in the presence of light. It has been established that in the study area, this governs the year-round carbon productivity, although it is variable. The winter months had the lowest photosynthetic rates compared to the highly productive summer months.\n",
      "Also, light use efficiency for the deciduous forest was poor in the winter, as opposed to higher efficiencies in other months, except for May.\n",
      "While we did not quantitatively assess the impact of cloud cover on photosynthesis in this study, the observed pattern in May 2016 aligns with established knowledge that cloud cover diffuses incoming shortwave radiation from reaching the trees, which is essential for photosynthesis [79,80].

Year-round respiration was non-zero, showing that metabolic processes occur all the time at the study area, even during the cold winter months, although at a lower rate. When examined, an exponential relationship was inferred from the response in terms of respiration to the temperature increase. The temperature sensitivity showed that respiration doubles with every 10-degree temperature increase for the deciduous trees of the Daniel Boone National Forest.\n",

This is because the total precipitation in the growing season 2016 (May–June, 666.72 mm) was higher than for the other years studied. This suggests that the higher latitude region’s optimum temperature and moderate precipitation may drive carbon sequestration in deciduous forests. However, the wettest year, 2018, had the lowest carbon sequestration, likely due to increased cloud cover reducing ambient light and photosynthetic productivity.\n",

      "Mountain streams provide a habitat for aquatic animals and clean water for human consumption downstream. The stream water passes the adjacent terrestrial ecosystem which largely affects the water quality [16]. The condition of mountain streams reﬂects the processes and activities occurring within the upstream part of the watershed.\n",
      "Before the construction of the new ski slope, atmospheric precipitation was among the predominant factors affecting the chemical composition of the Remiaszów stream [17]. The presence of calcium and magnesium in rainwater is a factor aiding the neutralization of acid rain [18]. In general, the chemical composition of precipitation water is largely formed by dissolving particulate matter in the atmosphere [17]. Regardless of the predominant ions in the rainwater, it needs to be stressed that it was characterized by low levels of all chemical compounds, as evidenced by low TDS value. This suggests that after the construction of the ski slope, increased concentrations of some ions in the water of this stream could be expected as a result of the production of artiﬁcial snow and the resulting surface runoff or increased inﬂow of artiﬁcial snow-melt water, as well as the operation of the accompanying infrastructure.\n",
      "The quality of water in the Remiaszów stream was variable throughout the study period, particularly in the case of microbiological indicators of fecal contamination, as evidenced by a very high coefﬁcient of variation, even higher than the one observed in the Białka river. This was most probably caused by the fact that during the study period, the surrounding environment of the stream has undergone considerable changes. For the purpose of the construction of the new ski slope, 12% of vegetation was removed [13], and intensive earthworks were conducted, followed by the changes in the amount of water in the watershed, i.e., inﬂow of melt water from artiﬁcial snow and treated sewage from the ski slope-related infrastructure. However, as shown by Fidelus-Orzechowska et al. [13], the environmental impact of the construction of both ski runs in the catchment of the\n",

Additionally, in terms of the concentration of bacteriological indicators, this site can be classiﬁed as having water of excellent quality [19]. Moreover, the mean concentration of microbiological indicators of pollution in the Remiaszów stream was smaller than the one recorded for the Białka river (intake for the production of artiﬁcial snow). This is because along the river Białka, there are numerous sources of pollution, situated upstream of the intake site, affecting the quality in the investigated location [20].\n",
      "The chemical composition and the amount of indicator bacteria in the water used for the production of artiﬁcial snow indicate that the water in the Białka river is contaminated.\n",
      "The prevalence of the examined microbiological indicators is characterized by a consider- able variation. This was discussed in previous papers, demonstrating that waters of the\n",
      "Białka river are contaminated by numerous point and nonpoint sources, including surface runoff from the surrounding hills, feces of sheep grazing on the slopes but also the inﬂow of treated and untreated sewage both from households acting as private guesthouses and from the municipal treatment plant [20,21]. It is worth noting that Białka is the largest river draining the only high mountain range in Poland. According to Rutkowska et al. [22], the catchment to the Trybsz water gauge has an area of 202 km2 and ﬂood quantile Q (m3 s−1) of return period T = 100 years is 431.7 m3/s. In the winter, water resources are scarce therefore, to ensure the proper amount of water for artiﬁcial snow production, retention reservoirs were built. Additionally, the temperature of the water in Białka ﬂowing from the Polish and Slovak Tatras is low, approx. 5 ◦C and during the winter, when the air temperatures are low, the water temperature sometimes drops to 0 ◦C, which means that it partially freezes. This results in water resources being particularly low in winter [23].\n",

      "The land cover changes, caused by the construction of the ski slope, i.e., among other things—tree cutting, soil cover violation and destruction of meadow vegetation leading to increased leaching of K+, Mg2+, NO3−and SO42−ions, together with bacteria, i.e., total coliforms, total E. coli, fecal E. coli and mesophilic bacteria. This caused an increase in the concentration of these parameters in the water of the Remiaszów stream during the construction works. Such phenomenon of increased leaching due to changes in the land cover and disturbance of the soil cover has often been described in the literature. Many authors [25–28] indicate that the removal of vegetation, most importantly trees, decreases nutrient assimilation, particularly NO3−. The observed increase in the concentration of cations: Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ in stream waters is also associated with the disturbance of the soil cover and the resulting increased erosion, which affects faster leaching of these compounds from the catchment [25,27,29–32]. However, over time and with the recovery of the plant cover, the ion concentrations drop to the level recorded before the land cover change [33,34]. Similarly, in studies conducted by Wang et al. [27], the chemical composition of the water had already returned to the condition recorded before the forest clearance after approximately one year after the initiation of the harvest. It was also observed that the\n",
      "SO42−concentrations still grow, while the level of the remaining ions decreases. Similar results were obtained by Nodvin et al. [33], who associated the results with acidiﬁcation and sulfate adsorption processes in the soil.\n",
      "Construction of the new ski slope and, in particular, the production of artiﬁcial snow made of water from the river Białka, resulted in increased values of pH, EC, TDS and the concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3−in the water of the Remiaszów stream. This is caused by the supply of melt water from artiﬁcial snow, which is much more mineralized than natural atmospheric precipitation. On the other hand, the concentrations of Na+, K+,\n",
      "Cl−and NO3−returned to the ones observed before the construction of the slope and violation of the plant–soil cover. This may evidence their retention in the catchment by the reviving vegetation on the mentioned slope.\n",
      "The disturbance of the soil cover also increases the amount of suspension in the water, resulting in elevated numbers of bacterial indicators of poor water quality. It was demonstrated by numerous authors that the number of bacteria in water is signiﬁcantly associated with the amount of suspended solids [35,36]. Another factor affecting the increased number of bacteria in water can be related to sheep grazing on the ski slope. For instance, Martinsen et al. [37] demonstrated that on the slopes where sheep are grazed, increased leaching of coliform bacteria occurs, whereas this effect was not observed in the case of nitrogen compounds. Additionally, the fresh feces of grazing animals is one of the two main non-human sources of waterborne fecal indicator microorganisms [38]. Another important issue, concerning the potential contamination of surface water with sheep feces- derived bacteria, is that both Escherichia coli and fecal enterococci not only survive in animal feces even for c.a. 60 days after deposition, but also their number increases signiﬁcantly over the ﬁrst three weeks, with quite a considerable impact on the quality of surface water in the close proximity to the sites where sheep are grazed [39].\n",
      "Finally, the ability of natural streams for self-puriﬁcation is yet another factor affecting the observed decrease in the concentration of the examined parameters of water pollution.\n",
      "The self-puriﬁcation ability of stream waters is the combination of various physical, chemi- cal and biological processes, including sedimentation, adsorption, biological mineralization or assimilation [40]. The rate of the self-puriﬁcation process is affected by the temperature, solar radiation, dissolved oxygen, ﬂow rate, water depth, pH, the content of toxic com- pounds, sediment load as well as human activity and living organisms in the river [41].\n",
      "What also should be mentioned here is that it would be valuable to refer the observed numbers of bacterial indicators of water quality and concentrations of physico-chemical parameters to the streamﬂow data in order to obtain the loads of the examined parameters.\n",
      "Thus, evaluating load differences could allow a fuller assessment of the net effect of the development of a ski resort on water quality.\n",
      "What needs to be remembered, is that—apart from its undisputable impact on the natural environment—mountain tourism also has many economic beneﬁts [42]. With regard to the fact that the mountain regions in Poland are mainly rural, economically under-developed areas, mountain tourism, and especially winter tourism resulting from ski resort development, is an important source of jobs [14]. Therefore, the creation of new and the development of existing ski resorts, including the construction of new ski runs, slopes, lifts and related infrastructure, is inevitable in the mountain regions in Poland. An important aspect of this development is to bear in mind that maintaining natural resources in their best shape is also essential for the future development of mountain areas, as a clean environment, including stream waters, is the best showcase of mountain regions, attracting crowds of tourists.\n",
      "As the development of ski resorts in the mountain regions in Poland is unavoidable and brings clear beneﬁts, it is important to assess the impact of newly constructed investments on local water resources.\n",
      "Our study shows that the processes involved in the construction of the new ski slope deteriorated the quality of water in the nearby stream both in terms of physico-chemical parameters and bacteriological indicators of water quality. Undoubtedly, the operation of the newly constructed ski slope also provides a considerable change in the environmental conditions, with numerous aspects. One of the most important of these aspects is the production of artiﬁcial snow, which changes the amount of water in the watershed and provides higher concentrations of ions and bacteriological contamination. Additionally, the change of the land use (from forests to ski slopes, which in spring changes into meadows where sheep are grazed) considerably affects leaching of ions from the soil cover and adds even more bacteriological contaminants to the surrounding streams.\n",
      "However, most importantly—when the construction works in the studied region were\n",
      "ﬁnished, i.e., during the operation and maintenance of the ski slope—the properties of the nearby stream returned to the condition observed before the ski slope construction. This could indicate that the analyzed stream has quite large self-puriﬁcation abilities and could also be the result of revegetation.\n",
      "Such studies, involving the assessment of the local surface water quality and factors affecting it, covering the period before, during and after the construction of new ski run runs, should be conducted in every case of such investments.\n",

      "2010). Moreover, corner entrances to apartments appeared to be problematic for adaptability aims in larger apartments. This is because such design resulted in dark entrance spaces with long, often L-shaped corridors that are not only difficult to furnish and use, but also difficult to adjust to suit other uses. The change of plan shape also revealed an important relationship with entrance access and building services: removing wasted corridors in the entrances, by placing the entrance more centrally, made it possible to enlarge the ’main living spaces’, which is also highly valued by residents (Finlay et al., 2012).\n",
      "In summary, the alternative adaptability scenarios illustrated that it is pos- sible to design solutions that are more adaptable for the same sites, in the same apartment sizes. These changes also have other consequences, which will need to be considered to fully assess the implications. For example, the alternatives scenarios increase the thermal envelope, and at the same time provide better daylighting, and depending on orientation, better solar access that could lead to increased solar gain. These factors may offset each other and need to be explored with an energy model to be fully understood. The alternative scenarios might increase construction costs for material and labour, and operational (in-use) costs related to potential increased heat loss. Yet, previous research suggests residents value flexible layouts and good daylighting (Finlay et al., 2012; Kuoppa et al., 2019).\n",

      "‘urban design‘ level, as the city plan enables or hinders certain housing design possibilities (Habraken, 1998). While a city plan indicates where a building can be placed, the developer does not need to build to the extreme edges of this plan.\n",
      "Nevertheless, high land prices encourage the developer to use all of the build- ing rights, leading to deep building types, which proved problematic in this study. Hence, acknowledging this reality in policy decision-making, through different proportioned city plans, or by including other criteria that safeguard good living environment conditions, would better promote housing quality now and in the future. Considerations of living environment qualities need to be embedded at all scales and design stages. This is illustrated by case 1, where building proportions were more supportive of better living environments, though this potential was not fully utilised in its housing design.\n",
      "Finally, of concern is that deep buildings with middle corridors made up around 40% of the 60 mapped cases in this study. This building type is a rela- tively new entrant to the Finnish residential urban building typology, but it is currently popular, possibly due to its plan efficiency and reduced construction costs associated with a deep building depth along with a single stair and lift core (Pitkänen, 2009). However, this building typology was shown to be problematic in terms of dwelling quality and adaptability aspects. If these findings are representative of the wider (future) housing stock, this risks ‘locking in’ poorly daylit housing that is unable to accommodate user changes for years to come.\n",
      "It is worth remembering that dwellings affect their residents’ health and well-being and are valuable property, not only to their users, but also to society: the housing stock forms a significant part of the wealth of nations, outlasting human generations. The findings of this paper highlight that through certain design considerations, housing can enable changes in time to support dwell- ers’ different life stages and needs, while simultaneously improving the living environment.\n",

      "Papers I & II – mapping supply operations from forest to mill\n",
      "Concluding comments\n",
      "Many research perspectives have been used to examine the economic performance for individual operations within silviculture, harvesting and transportation, however few studies have been aimed at the wider selection of goals and performance demanded of the whole supply chain.\n",
      "4.1 Papers I & II – mapping supply operations from forest to mill\n",
      "Supply chain strategy as defined by UPS (2005), how the supply chain should operate in order to compete, is a simple but useful concept when examining the goals and performance of wood supply. According to the framework of supply chain terminology introduced in Table 1, SCS is the end result of many specific supply management strategies (particular ways of doing things) which are nested within the supply strategy (series of plans based on a segmentation of decisions on strategic, tactical and operational levels). In relation to this framework, forest operations management represent many of the specific supply management strategies supporting an overall supply strategy. Simple metrics should be able to evaluate the degree to which forest operations management support the goals expressed in the supply chain strategy.\n",
      "The main results of Paper I consist of a selection of simple metrics. The results for annual supply fulfillment were surprisingly low in both cases (17.8 and 21.9 % for the efficient and flexible enterprises).  A comparison of  lead times showed that the biggest difference was observed in relation to product’s value. The enterprise with efficient approach showed a low variation between assortments (from 38 to 52 days) while the enterprise with a flexible approach clearly prioritized high value products (19 days), leaving low value assortments longer in the forest (67 days).\n",
      "The study sample for Paper I consisted of two typical state forest enterprises situated in the same region and with similar distance to key customers. The sample cases represent about five percent of the total number of such enterprises. Seen from the current day perspective a larger study sample (at least two enterprises per SCS) would be necessary to generalize typical metrics per enterprise type. The metrics chosen (delivery precision and lead times) were meant to be indicators of reliability and flexibility. There were however, some limitations regarding the way they were measured in this study. The analysis of monthly delivery precision, for example, was limited by the data collection methods. The monthly distribution of volumes within annual supply agreements are typically adjusted and confirmed as time progresses. In this study information on monthly adjustments and confirmed orders were not available and delivery precision has therefore been calculated in relation to the initial monthly prognosis. In the case of the flexible enterprise, the lack of any indication of quarterly variations makes the monthly prognosis particularly imprecise. In addition, follow-ups of delivery precision are normally applied per assortment, whereas Paper I applies these on the total volume per customer.\n",
      "The use of the term lead time in Paper I is also simplified. Lead time in this study includes only the time for the wood to pass through harvesting and transport to the mill. Lead time is typically defined as the time from ordering until the time when the goods are delivered. In theory it refers to the decoupling point concept described by Wikner and Rudberg (2005) as ‘’the point in the flow of goods where forecast-driven production and customer order - driven production are separated’’. In wood supply, where the main variable is the rate of wood flow and not a single order of a specific volume, the term lead time can then be redefined as the time from when the customer orders an adjustment in flow and to the time when the customer experiences the effect of the adjustment. Seen in this light, the study´s definition of lead time does not capture the time required for customer’s information to penetrate the supplier´s organization and influence harvesting or transport activities. In addition, the lead time defined in this study includes time for both harvesting and transport. A direct communication from the receiving mill to the forest operations managers could enable an quicker flow adjustment by re-directing transport directly from road-side stocks, resulting in a shorter lead time than indicated in this study.\n",
      "Paper II examined the coordination of wood supply to sawmill processing and sales. By quantifying monthly variations it enabled a baseline for the actual level of variation which can be expected by sawmills in both up- and downstream flows. The supply variability quotient (ω) for mills focusing on main products demonstrated twice the monthly variation in roundwood supply when compared to sawnwood sales. The 46 day inventory cover time\n",
      "(roundwood and sawn wood together) for these mills provides some insight as to how the supply variability is handled, however most (68 %) of the total inventory was accumulated as sawnwood products.  The cross-correlation coefficient (ρ=0.60) quantified the degree of dynamics between  received roundwood and sawnwood sales and is an indication of a correspondence between sawn wood sales driving the need for replenishment from wood supply.\n",
      "The study sample for Paper II is considered to be representative as it examined 5 state owned sawmills out of 20. It would have been desirable to have data on inventory levels at roadside as well. This was not available for this study but would enable a broader scope of echelons and would fill the gap in understanding the adjustment of flows from harvesting versus transport. The choice of metrics in Paper II gives a basis for insight into wood supply system dynamics. In order to compare flows between products before and after processing some measure of relative variation is necessary.  The definition of the supply variability quotient based on Fransoo & Wouters (2000) has functioned well for this purpose. The degree of correspondence between variations in up- and downstream flows as indicated by the cross-correlation coefficients appears to have demonstrated some differences between different situations. The lack of similar measures from other studies, however, makes interpretation vague. Future development of better measures and methods should improve interpretation possibilities.\n",
      "A number of studies have quantified related metrics for other wood supply situations (Table 12). Audy et al. (2012b) quantified lead times for 6 case studies in North America, South America and Europe. Lead times from forest to mill varied between 57 and 67 days where 54 days were associated with harvesting and 5 days with transport. Carlsson and Rönnqvist (2005) documented a reduction of lead times for pulpwood in Sweden from 79 to 50 days. Haartveit et al. (2004) documented variation in lead times from forest to sawmill in Canada between 210 and 36 days where the longest lead times were associated with coastal sawmills supplied via maritime transport while the shortest lead times were associated with interior mills supplied via road transport.\n",
      "Table 12. Comparison of lead times (days) and inventory levels (inventory cover times in days) from Paper II with other case studies.\n",
      "Haartveit et al. (2004) also documented inventory levels (in terms of inventory cover times) along the supply chain from the forest to mill. Roundwood inventories at the mills varied from 60-71 days which was considerably more than the 10-14 days in Paper II. On the other hand, sawn wood inventories at the mill varied from 15-35 days which was similar to the results (12-31 days) in Paper II.\n",
      "Inventories may be classified according to both location and purpose but their main function is to allow the different parts to operate at full capacity without disturbance from upstream or downstream flows. Short lead times typically enable lower inventory levels. Following this logic an interesting statistic which can be calculated from Table 12 is the ratio between the mill roundwood stocks and the lead time for harvesting and transport. In the\n",
      "Canadian cases this ratio varies from 1.9 to 0.3 and in the Lithuanian cases from 0.31 to 0.24. This can be compared to figures for Swedish and Finnish mills where typical values for mill roundwood stocks are 1-2 weeks and lead times 4 weeks, yielding a corresponding ratio of 0.25-0.5. At least in theory, a low ratio should indicate a reliable wood supply. The results from Paper II regarding monthly delivery precision indicate higher reliability for the efficient enterprise than the flexible enterprise. The results for annual supply fulfillment, however, indicated a weak commitment between suppliers and customers.\n",
      "However, the low order fulfillment rate might just be a result of the supply contract formats and their lack of any control mechanism or incentive system for fulfillment. While the actual deliveries for the studied enterprises were not closely linked to initial prognosis, the analysis of lead times demonstrated that the flexible enterprise had higher product-specific responsiveness. The focus on certain assortments demonstrates the enterprise’s willingness to utilize their\n",

      "A number of authors have examined flexibility for manufacturing industries\n",
      "(e.g. Mandelbaum 1978). However, the agility framework developed specifically for wood supply by Audy et al. (2012b), is a step towards identifying ‘’how the supply chain processes shall be structured and coordinated in order to achieve business objectives’’. Ideally, future studies should both map specific configurations of supply chain processes and their supporting metrics and customer service indexes. In the discussion of flexibility Lundmark’s (1977) differentiation between operational, tactical and strategic flexibility may also be of use. Depending on if disturbances in the supply system are random, seasonal or permanent, different types of flexibility are required. Given the relatively low number of assortments in wood supply and focus on flow rates per assortment a simple measure of volume flexibility according to Lundmark’s segmentation could give a good base for metrics relevant to the operational and tactical issues in wood supply. Ideally, tactical and operational flexibility metrics could also be related to different typologies for tactical and operational agility. This, again, requires further development of typologies specifically for wood supply and its diverging product identities.\n",
      "4.2  Papers III & IV - improving coordination of transport from forest to mill\n",
      "Paper III showed that the geographical distribution of forest resources and mills presented a potential for reducing roundwood transport costs by truck. Up to 30 % of volumes for the studied period could be theoretically included in a backhaul flow with a potential 6-11 % reduction of transport costs. Reducing the planning period or increasing the minimum flow required for a backhaul reduced the number of relevant supply/demand nodes resulting in a lower proportion of possible backhauls. The study covered 13 state forest enterprises and a total delivered volume for the studied period of 15,000 m3. This constitutes 5 % of the total monthly volumes delivered by state forest enterprises and is considered to be a representative sample.\n",

      "Carlsson and Rönnqvist (1998) can also be used to determine each mill’s optimal catchment area, within the supply and demand restrictions, without backhauling. The model then generates potential backhauls which are added to the master flow optimization problem. Paper III, however, was based on the historical non-optimized flows and the effect of backhauling alone was examined. Studies on wood transport planning issues in Sweden by Carlsson and Rönnqvist (1998) showed potential savings from 0.4 to 3.0 % for flow optimization alone (without backhauling) and from 5 to 7 % for flow optimization with backhauling (Table 13). To compare, Puodžiūnas (1998) indicated that the potential costs savings for better flow planning alone\n",

(2014a), who found that children engaged highly in play with toys and materials inside and outside but were rarely involved in MVPA. Previous reviews have indicated that materials and toys that are associated with high PA (e.g. wheeled toys) may be more suitable for boys’ preferences\n",
      "(Hodges et al. 2013; Todd et al. 2017; Tonge et al. 2016), and may explain why boys engaged more in material play and gained more MVPA in it compared with girls. Further studies are needed to explore the toys and materials that would generate MVPA in girls. The size and weight of the toys should be explored, also, for example, whether the common toys and materials (bricks, shovels and buckets, etc.) could be PA promoters if bigger and heavier, so that children could exert themselves when using them.\n",
      "Children develop their pre-academic skills often during task or seatwork and reading, which were very sedentary and poor in  arousing MVPA. Interestingly, as in routines, boys engaged less than girls in task or seatwork. However, as suggested earlier (Tonge et al. 2016; Ward et al. 2009), integrating PA across the curriculum would promote MVPA in both genders. In reading sessions (the least active activity), the educators could, for example, invite children to role play, adapted to the story. When doing mathematics within task or seatwork, physical exercise should be frequently integrated into the tasks being performed and in reading – not only for the PA itself but also for its positive consequences for children’s on-task behaviour, involvement, academic achievement and cognition (e.g. Diamond 2015; Fedewa &\n",

      "MVPA in rule play, it can be considered a very important source of MVPA in girls too. It is possible that educators’ own beliefs and behaviours – with gender stereotyping – may inadvertently influence the activities children take part in (Hesketh, Lakshman & Van Sluijs 2015) or even educators may support highly activating rule play more in boys than in girls (Pate et al. 2004). We believe that girls’\n",
      "MVPA could be increased if they were equally encouraged to be highly active, for example, by teacher-led organised rule play (Olesen et al. 2014; Sansolios & Mikkelsen 2011).\n",
      "Rule play was contradictory because it included both sedentary and physical play and games with rules, but overall, it was very efficacious in arousing MVPA.\n",
      "However, age appropriate and physically active rule play can be considered valuable in enhancing MVPA.\n",
      "Pellegrini and Smith (1998) stated that girls tend to revolve around domestic and dramatic fantasy play, which may explain why girls engaged more in role play compared with boys, whilst the proportion of MVPA was similar in both genders. Brown et al. (2009) found no significant association between children’s PA and sociodramatic props, but it is possible that girls would benefit from a variety of highly activating materials in role play because they obviously favour  it. We believe that the available role play material provokes especially boys’ MVPA and should be regarded in relation to its ability to provoke MVPA in girls too. In addition, girls could be guided to more exerting role play instead of the traditional gender-stereotyped activities.\n",
      "Certainly, a good finding was that action not allowed proved to be rare, but interestingly it was amongst the best MVPA generators, as found earlier by Reunamo et al. (2014a).\n",
      "Instead of denials, training of educators to encourage children in safe PA would be more advantageous for children’s well-being. Boys have been reported to participate more in risk-taking behaviours and rough and tumble play (DiPietro\n",
      "1981; McIntyre & Edwards 2009; Pellegrini & Smith 1998), which are often forbidden in ECEC. In this study, boys engaged more in action not allowed than girls did. However, consistent with Reunamo et al., it was one of the best MVPA generators in both genders. We believe that there are many unnecessary denials impeding children’s PA. Educators should discuss the practices in their own ECEC environment.\n",
      "Perhaps some of the actions not allowed should be allowed.\n",
      "Some MVPA was discovered in hanging about, which is in line with previous findings of peers provoking MVPA (Reunamo\n",
      "& Kyhälä 2016; Ward et al. 2016). In the present study, it awoke MVPA specifically in girls (fourth most efficacious action in girls and fifth in boys). Consistent with Olesen et al.\n",
      "(2014), our findings (girls’ higher time spent in and higher\n",
      "MVPA level in hanging about) suggest that girls’ MVPA might benefit from the presence of their peers. On the other hand, the high proportions of time spent in hanging about and no focus support the idea that children spend large proportions of their time unoccupied (Early et al. 2010) or in non-goal-directed activities (Winsler & Carlton 2003). This issue should be observed. If the length of a child’s ECEC day is 6 h, he or she spends about 30 minutes without focus.\n",
      "For example, there could be an activity dice or an activity card that tells children what to do.\n",
      "Finally, boys and girls spent different proportions of time in various activities as found earlier (Early et al. 2010; Reunamo et  al. 2014a; Reunamo & Kyhälä 2016). Consistent with previous studies (e.g. Lindsay et al. 2017; Tonge et al. 2016), boys obtained more MVPA than girls did, in total. Boys engaged more in the most efficacious actions, except for role play. Therefore, educators should consider their own action modes and promote high PA in both genders. Because of the high percentage of girls’ observed MVPA in physical activities, the educators should encourage girls to engage frequently in physical activities. Both boys and girls should be steered into physical activities, rule play and role play during all general activities in ECEC.\n",

      "57 881 observations.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the present investigation has limitations.\n",
      "Firstly, accelerometer-based measurements would have offered more accurate information. Secondly, it is possible that some MVPA has not been recognised because of the observation epoch of 1 minute. However, the observers were instructed to select the most prevalent intensity level in the epoch. Thirdly, there were more observations in the mornings in comparison with the afternoons. More resting in the afternoons may have resulted in more MVPA in the morning.\n",
      "The emphasis on the morning observations may bias the results considering that children may spend the whole day in preschool. To check this the effect to the statistical significance, we weighted the afternoon observations by six.  The statistical significance did not change after the weighting. Fourthly, the municipalities participated differently in this study, which might have biased the results. A limitation may be that we  included sedentary and physically active behaviours in rule play and material play. Separating them would have enabled more conclusions about the results.\n",
      "Our results supported the previous findings that children spend much of their ECEC time waiting, following instructions and doing what they need to do. Three prevalent actions: routines, material play and task or seatwork, with insufficient proportions of MVPA, accounted for over half of the children’s ECEC day, being responsible for over two-thirds of VLPA. As boys seemed to find more occasions for MVPA than girls did, girls should be helped and encouraged to see opportunities for it, too. However, these data do not explain to what extent the proportions of all observations or MVPA are caused by either children’s own preferences and selections or the teachers’ decisions and gender stereotypes.\n",
      "We assume that children’s MVPA could be increased and\n",
      "VLPA decreased in two ways: (1) through increasing opportunities to engage in the most efficacious activities: physical activities, role play and rule play (scarce but efficacious) and (2) by modifying the least effective but prevalent activities to be more physically activating. Young children need MVPA throughout the day, and the ECEC educators are crucial in promoting it. To enhance professional development, the educators need more knowledge of MVPA and skills in implementing MVPA activities across the curriculum.\n",

The port must modify all three subsystems (berthing subsystem, storage area and handover area), with focus on berthing subsystem. At berthing subsystem, it is important to ensure adequate depth of the seafloor, the height and carrying capacity of the shore and the length of the operational shore.

      "The findings from the analysis of workplace injury reduction strategies demonstrate a strong and consistent relationship between structured safety interventions and decreased injury rates, supporting the broader literature on occupational safety management. The descriptive analysis indicated that employees perceive safety training programs, safe work procedures (SWPs), and behavior-based safety (BBS) interventions as highly effective strategies for reducing workplace injuries. This perception aligns with prior research by Neal and Griffin (2006) and Mullen et al. (2017), who highlighted that comprehensive safety training improves hazard recognition, compliance, and ultimately lowers accident rates. The high mean ratings for combined strategies and organizational support further emphasize that an integrated approach—where multiple interventions are implemented alongside managerial commitment—is perceived as the most impactful, corroborating findings by Vredenburgh (2002).\n",
      "Regression analysis reinforced these perceptions by quantifying the predictive relationship between safety strategies and injury rates. Safety training programs emerged as the strongest predictor, followed by SWPs and BBS interventions. This indicates that while all strategies contribute to injury reduction, training serves as the foundational mechanism for improving knowledge, skills, and hazard awareness. The results mirror international studies by Amoako and Hu (2020) and Choudhry et al. (2007), which found that training and procedural adherence significantly reduce errors and prevent accidents. Behavior-based safety interventions, although slightly less predictive, still significantly reduced injuries, underscoring the importance of observation, feedback, and reinforcement in cultivating safe behavior. These results collectively support the notion that multi-layered interventions are more effective than singular strategies, consistent with the systems-based approach to occupational safety.\n",
      "Hierarchical regression further contextualized these findings by controlling for demographic variables such as age, gender, and years of experience. While these factors had minimal impact on injury rates, the addition of safety strategies explained a substantial proportion of variance, confirming that organizational interventions are more influential than employee characteristics in predicting workplace safety outcomes. This outcome aligns with Cooper (2009), who emphasized that safety culture and management commitment are critical determinants of effective occupational safety. The results also suggest that focusing solely on individual employee traits or demographic factors is insufficient; instead, attention must be directed toward organizational systems and strategy implementation to achieve meaningful reductions in workplace injuries.\n",
      "Interestingly, while the study demonstrated clear benefits of structured interventions, the analysis also highlights potential limitations and counterpoints. For instance, behavior-based safety interventions rely heavily on consistent monitoring and feedback, which may be resource-intensive for some organizations. Moreover, the effectiveness of SWPs depends on employees’ adherence, which can be influenced by workplace culture, perceived workload, or resistance to change. These challenges resonate with critiques by Hale et al. (2010) and Hopkins (2012), who argue that safety strategies, while effective in controlled settings, may face practical limitations when implemented in complex, high-pressure workplaces. Therefore, the findings suggest that organizations must not only implement safety interventions but also foster an enabling environment, provide sufficient resources, and actively monitor compliance to ensure sustained impact.\n",
      "Overall, the study provides strong empirical support for the effectiveness of multi-faceted workplace injury reduction strategies.\n",
      "Safety training, SWPs, and behavior-based safety interventions collectively reduce injuries, with training serving as the cornerstone for promoting knowledge and safe behavior. The hierarchical analysis confirms that organizational strategies outweigh individual demographic characteristics in determining safety outcomes. However, practical limitations, including resource demands and compliance variability, highlight the need for ongoing organizational commitment, continuous evaluation, and integration of strategies into the broader safety culture. These findings reinforce the value of a holistic, system-oriented approach to occupational safety and offer actionable insights for managers, safety officers, and policymakers seeking to enhance workplace safety outcomes.\n",
      "The findings of this study indicate that workplace injury reduction strategies, including safety training programs, safe work procedures (SWPs), and behavior-based safety (BBS) interventions, play a pivotal role in enhancing occupational safety and minimizing employee injuries. Descriptive, regression, and hierarchical analyses collectively show that these strategies are highly effective, with safety training emerging as the most influential factor. The study also demonstrates that integrated approaches, supported by strong organizational commitment, yield greater reductions in injury rates than isolated interventions. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and years of experience had minimal influence on injury outcomes, emphasizing that organizational strategies and safety culture are primary determinants of workplace safety.\n",
      "Moreover, while the results confirm the overall effectiveness of these strategies, they also highlight practical limitations. Behavior- based safety interventions require consistent monitoring and feedback, which may strain organizational resources. Similarly, adherence to SWPs depends on employee compliance and engagement, which can be affected by workplace culture, workload pressures, or resistance to change. These findings suggest that the success of injury reduction strategies is contingent not only on their design but also on the organizational environment, resource allocation, and leadership support.\n",
      "Based on these findings, the study recommends that organizations adopt a holistic, multi-layered approach to workplace safety.\n",
      "First, comprehensive and continuous safety training should be implemented to enhance employees’ hazard awareness and skillsets.\n",
      "Training programs should be interactive and scenario-based to ensure practical understanding. Second, safe work procedures must be clearly documented, communicated, and regularly reviewed to ensure relevance and compliance. Third, behavior-based safety interventions should be integrated into the organizational culture, with structured observation, feedback, and reinforcement mechanisms to promote sustained safe behavior.\n",
      "Additionally, organizations should foster a strong safety culture by demonstrating leadership commitment, allocating sufficient resources for safety programs, and establishing clear accountability mechanisms. Regular audits, monitoring, and evaluation of safety strategies can help identify gaps and inform continuous improvement. Policymakers and regulatory agencies should encourage organizations to adopt integrated safety systems, provide incentives for compliance, and promote knowledge sharing across industries.\n",
      "In conclusion, workplace injury reduction strategies are most effective when implemented in a coordinated and well-supported manner. Organizations that invest in training, enforce safe work procedures, and promote behavior-based safety, while fostering an enabling environment, are better positioned to protect employees, reduce injuries, and enhance overall productivity. The study underscores the importance of both strategic design and organizational commitment in achieving sustainable occupational safety outcomes.\n",

In previous work, DPC either was not included in physician surveys, or was reported only in combination with other alternative payment models, which obscured model-specific physician views of DPC.30 The variation in perspectives may be relevant to how broadly suitable DPC is for various physicians and patient populations, and thus its growth potential and its applicability in various settings.22,26  By highlighting these differences, we aimed to understand the extent to which DPC models are understood and its perceived benefits to physicians and patients. Overall, we found that family medicine physicians who responded to this survey share a high level of familiarity with DPC, with 85% of respondents having heard of the model and 79% correctly identifying the overall goal of the model. Beginning with this highly knowledgeable group, we demonstrated fairly consistent perceptions of the benefits but with a few key distinctions by whether or not they practiced in a\n",
      "DPC model.\n",
      "First, we found that family physicians broadly agree that DPC has the potential to improve patient health outcomes.  More time with patients, improving the doctor-patient relationship and getting to the root of problems were tied as the most significant benefit of the model, while the statement that patient health outcomes won’t improve in DPC received high disagreement.  This finding supports studies that show a positive association between improved doctor-patient relationships and improved patient health outcomes.16,17,19\n",
      "Second, we found that family physicians generally agree that administrative burden is less in a DPC model, which will improve physician satisfaction.  Improved physician satisfaction due to lower administrative burden and less paperwork was tied as the most significant benefit of the model.  This finding supports what other studies have found regarding physician burnout and dissatisfaction resulting from high levels of administrative burden.7-12\n",
      "Third, family medicine physicians think that DPC is beneficial for both patients and physicians; this, along with limited concerns about physician shortages and access for vulnerable patients, may suggest potential success of bottom-up physician-driven models more generally.  In particular, respondents did not perceive that patient outcomes or quality would likely suffer without the additional documentation and reporting tasks that are required by typical top-down centralized health care delivery reform initiatives.  Respondents expressed high disagreement to the statement that DPC will result in low quality such as over-treatment or under-treatment.  This view is shared by physicians and scholars who say that primary care does not lend itself to meaningful performance measurement due to its complexity and uncertainty.  More than a third of health concerns initially encountered in primary care do not lend themselves to a diagnosis, and about half are unlikely to result in a definite diagnosis that would trigger a standard care pathway.31  Complex interactions and interdependencies emerge in primary care due to the many hundreds of decisions that must be made each day for patients with unique clinical concerns and personal circumstances.32  Typical performance measures cannot address the breadth and depth of comprehensive primary care delivery; simply measuring individual elements of care is an inadequate reflection of the value of primary care.33\n",
      "Finally, this study adds to the literature by showing significant variation in the perspectives of family medicine physicians who practice in an insurance-based model and those who practice in a DPC model.  DPC physicians are likely to be highly select in this sample, with both experience and perceptions of the model. DPC physicians expressed more disagreement with all of the statements, and the differences were statistically significant for four of the six statements.  As all statements were negatively worded, this suggests that DPC physicians were more confident about the DPC model than their non-DPC colleagues. In addition, the finding that DPC physicians were much less focused on the perceived benefit of reduced administrative burden than the non-DPC family physicians may indicate that administrative burden is less a part of their day to day practice of medicine than it is for non-DPC physicians.\n",
      "The study has several limitations.  First, the survey respondents are likely to be a highly select group. While we found very similar demographic profiles to the overall membership, the results may not be generalizable to all family physicians or to the AAFP membership. AAFP’s\n",
      "Member Insight Exchange is a marketing platform in which respondents self-select to receive surveys and may choose to answer or ignore any survey provided; these results are likely not representative of overall family physicians’ views of DPC. Physicians who are familiar with DPC or who have a strong opinion about DPC may have been more likely to respond to the survey than physicians who are unfamiliar with the model or who have not yet formed an opinion.  For example, these results differ from results of AAFP’s 2017 Practice Profile Survey, which showed that one-third of family physicians (33%) were unfamiliar with the DPC model, a small portion\n",
      "(3%) practiced in a DPC model, and a small portion (1%) were in the process of transitioning their practice to a DPC model.26  Given the limited scope of this survey and that it was available to a small subset of AAFP members, further research is needed to gauge family physician views of DPC more broadly and to improve the generalizability of these findings.  However, this study offers insights beyond generalizability.\n",
      "First, it allows us to understand perceptions from a group that both understands the model and has ostensibly strong feelings (both positive and negative) about the model. While the study is not comprehensive, these respondents are potentially the individuals more likely to propose or resist a move to a DPC model.\n",
      "Second, this study was focused on the primary perceived benefits of a DPC model.\n",
      "Clearly, there are also strong challenges associated with this model that need to be addressed in future studies. Additionally, our list of benefits was not comprehensive, but rather, was consistent with previous literature’s suggested benefits.3,16,18  By focusing on these perceptions, we determined what areas and topics are agreed to by both DPC and non-DPC physicians.\n",
      "This study revealed variation in perspectives about DPC between family physicians who practice in a DPC model and those who do not.  While the survey does not allow us to determine why perspectives differ by practice model, there are several possible explanations.\n",
      "Non-DPC physicians may have limited familiarity with how DPC works in practice, and their lack of familiarity may cause them to be cautious about the model’s benefits. Conversely, DPC physicians and particularly those who responded to the survey were more likely to advocate the benefits of the model. Both perspectives should be approached with caution.  Also, it is possible that the patient panels of non-DPC physicians are different from those of DPC physicians in ways that would affect the perceived success of the model for those physicians.\n",
      "Observed differences in responses may only reflect differences in perceptions and may not be indicative of how care is objectively delivered in a DPC model compared to a traditional delivery model.  It is also possible that variations in physician perspectives by model reflect real differences in patient outcomes and physician satisfaction due to the model.  Additional studies are needed to test these conjectures.\n",
      "In general, respondents perceive that Direct Primary Care offers more time with patients and improved doctor-patient relationships, which may lead to improved patient outcomes and lower health care spending.  Despite concerns about physician shortages and access for vulnerable patients, respondents perceived the potential of DPC to reduce administrative burden, resulting in greater physician satisfaction and lower practice costs.  They believe that these patient and physician benefits are available in DPC without negative impacts to quality such as over-treatment and under-treatment.\n",
      "Compared to non-DPC physicians, views of family physicians practicing in a DPC model were found to differ in several areas.  DPC physicians exhibited statistically significantly higher disagreement with statements that DPC only benefits the healthy and wealthy, it will worsen the PCP shortage, it will not lead to improved patient health outcomes, and quality will be poor.\n",
      "Additionally, DPC physicians focused more on perceived benefit to patients (enhanced access to primary care, resulting in improved patient health outcomes) while non-DPC physicians focused more on perceived benefits to physicians (less administrative burden and insurance paperwork, improved physician satisfaction).  Our survey is the first to compare the views of physicians by practice model but further research is needed to understand the nature and causes of these differences.\n",
      "These results are important initial findings about a growing model of primary care delivery.  Additional research is needed to determine whether DPC delivers the kinds of benefits that are integral to the rationale and structure of the model, and to illuminate DPC’s potential to address access, cost and workforce-related problems facing primary care and family medicine today.\n",

      "In our opinion, the reason for this situation lies not so much in the gaps and shortcomings of legal regulation of this issue, as in the inefficiency of state management of external labor migration. Migration policy in a legal democratic country must necessarily include as a component respect for the rights and legitimate interests of migrant workers. Research have always noted the low effectiveness of legal mechanisms for ensuring and protecting rights: \"The state often shows its inability and unpreparedness for strategic migration planning, acting situationally, closing the social \"holes\" and gaps formed with hasty laws that immediately become inefficient or ineffective.\"\n",
      "We believe that at the present stage of the development of migration processes, a fairly complete regulatory legal framework has been formed both at the international and domestic levels.

      "(1) Through statistical analysis of the data collected from four sites, it is found that the skewness and peakedness values are all above 0. The wind speed distributions are all right-skewed and unimodal, and have a steep peak. Thus, five unimodal distributions are selected for wind speed probability analysis.\n",

Hence, the Weibull distribution is used as the wind speed probability distribution model for the studied regions.\n",

      "Our study revealed declines in SWB and outdoor activity participation that may be casualties of community health initiatives aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19.\n",
      "Adolescents’ SWB dropped during the pandemic, as did participation in outdoor activities.\n",
      "Adolescents with high participation rates in outdoor play activities prior to the pandemic had smaller decreases in their SWB, and those that continued to participate in outdoor play and nature-based activities during the pandemic were buffered against declines in SWB.\n",
      "Adolescents who reported that spending time outdoors in nature helped them deal with the stress associated with the pandemic experienced smaller declines in both their SWB and their self-reported mental health.\n",
      "Declines in adolescents SWB identiﬁed in this study highlight an underlying and largely unexplored COVID-19 related health risk. Our SWB ﬁndings support previous research pointing to the negative impacts of pandemics, natural disasters, and large-scale emergencies on the mental health of adolescents [14,21], further elucidating risks posed by the expanding scale and frequency of global change events [1]. This is concerning, as decreases in adolescents SWB hamper social, emotional, and academic development [89].\n",
      "Additionally, an increase in stress and trauma at a young age can have long-term impacts that affect SWB later in life [25,90], and may lead to other health disorders [91], hinting at the potential for a health crisis that may unfold for years to come. The potential impacts of declines in SWB measured in this study lend further support to the importance of identifying and promoting resilience-enhancing factors that allow adolescents to better cope and adapt to global change events [4].\n",
      "The decline in adolescents’ outdoor activity participation may be an artifact of where and how adolescents engage in outdoor activities, as pandemic related closures reduce access to recreation spaces and remove outdoor activities built into daily routines. Some outdoor play and outdoor family activities were likely accessible to adolescents before and during the pandemic, as they can be conducted near home while maintaining social distancing. Despite this, concerns regarding the safety of all outdoor activities may have contributed to the decline in participation, as well as closures or overcrowding in available public outdoor spaces [18,61,70]. Safety concerns coupled with the loss of structured recreation opportunities (e.g., school sports) may help explain the large decline in outdoor play activities. Other research has indicated a drop in physical activity and a rise in sedentary behaviors when school is not in session [92]. The smaller decline in outdoor family activities may be attributed to the broad nature of this outdoor activity group, as well as the relative safety of recreating with family units versus the risks associated with interacting with other individuals. Declines in nature-based activities could be explained by limited access to natural areas due to park closures [70] and the increased risk associated with traveling further to reach natural areas [93]. The low participation rates in nature- based activities versus other activity groups even before the pandemic, may also point to barriers such as access to natural areas, which may have been exacerbated during the pandemic [61]. Declines across all outdoor activities identiﬁed in this study represent disturbing trends with potentially long-term adverse effects [52], as adolescence is a key life stage where lifestyle habits develop and shape outdoor recreation patterns and preferences in adulthood [94–96]. Offering and promoting recreational opportunities that facilitate\n",
      "COVID-19 appropriate outdoor activities at or near home (e.g., keeping municipal park spaces open, closing city streets for pedestrian use) may improve participation rates [70,97], particularly while recreation opportunities adolescents routinely participate in (e.g., school programs, organized sports, clubs and summer camps) are unavailable. Such programs could build on other research highlighting the health beneﬁts of “nearby nature” and outdoor recreation experiences [44,45,98].\n",
      "Our results indicate that frequent participation in outdoor play activities prior to the pandemic provided lasting resilience against drops in SWB during the pandemic.\n",
      "Several studies with adults suggest that regular outdoor recreation may provide mental resiliency to stress [18,99]. For instance, an experimental study in the United Kingdom found that adults participating in a 10-week outdoor walking program had improved mental health for at least one year [100]. Another study found that regular outdoor recreation in both neighborhoods and nearby natural areas was associated with long- term well-being and psychological resilience [99]. Our results indicate that similar trends may hold for adolescents, with those who participate in frequent outdoor play having increased resiliency to declines in SWB under stress. Future research should continue to explore this possibility, as well as measure, and mitigate detrimental impacts of pre- existing outdoor play deﬁcits on SWB [101]. As continued participation in each of the outdoor activity groups provided some relief from negative impacts on SWB during the pandemic, adolescents may reap the beneﬁts of outdoor activity participation regardless of pre COVID-19 outdoor activity participation.\n",
      "Differences in levels of exposure to nature, physical activity, and social interactions between outdoor activity types may account for the variation in each activity’s capacity to buffer against declines in SWB during the pandemic. Continued participation in outdoor play and nature-based activities during the pandemic buffered adolescents against declines in their SWB, resulting in post COVID-19 SWB scores similar to pre COVID-19 scores.\n",
      "Outdoor play was particularly effective at reducing the decline in SWB, nearly doubling the efﬁcacy of nature-based activities. Outdoor play activities tend to be more accessible than nature-based activities, and are therefore engaged in more frequently. These activities also provide the potential for exposure to nature and are often more physical ﬁtness-oriented.\n",
      "Prior to COVID-19, outdoor play activities also provided adolescents with opportunities for social interaction [56,102]. Social interactions likely persist during the pandemic, but they may be limited to family and small groups of neighbors [62]. In contrast, participating in nature-based activities during the pandemic is less frequent for adolescents and may be limited to immediate family. Outdoor family activities are not mutually exclusive and can include any of the other activities but within a family context. However, the weaker relationship between outdoor family activities and SWB may be due to being isolated with family during the pandemic, resulting in an increased amount of time being spent together, which some studies have shown has heightened family-level stress in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [103,104]. Accordingly, although outdoor family activities are important [54], within the context of COVID-19 it may be beneﬁcial to spend time away from family. These differences between activity groups help to explain the effectiveness of outdoor play activities during COVID-19 and demonstrate the potential of nature-based and outdoor family activities for improving SWB outside of the COVID-19 context.\n",
      "Our ﬁndings suggest COVID-19 negatively impacts adolescents SWB and outdoor activity participation regardless of race, gender, age, household income, community type, and geographic region. Further, we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant disparities in activity participa- tion or SWB based on these demographics. We ﬁnd this latter result particularly surprising and encouraging, given the well-documented disparities in both access to nature [68,105] and more serious health impacts of COVID-19 felt by Black, Hispanic, and other racial and ethnic minority communities [65]. However, restrictions on outdoor activities related to COVID-19 have been largely geographic rather than demographic (e.g., entire states imposing mobility restrictions), and previous research indicates that demographic variables have a relatively weak impact on life satisfaction compared to environmental factors [106].\n",
      "Although all adolescents have been affected by COVID-19, outdoor activity-focused inter- ventions might help promote SWB for all, demonstrating a need to promote adolescent participation in such activities and increase equitable access to nature and recreational spaces [107,108]. This appears to be particularly true for nature-based activities, as pre\n",
      "COVID-19 participation rates were less than half that of the next closest activity group.\n",
      "Initiatives such as Blue Sky Funders Forum’s Rethink Outside [109] and Sierra Club’s\n",
      "Outdoors for All [110] are working towards this goal, but additional research highlighting nature as essential to human health and well-being is needed to leverage the potential of such initiatives.\n",
      "Recommendations for Future Research\n",
      "This study highlights a need for additional research exploring the potential for outdoor activities as a means of building adolescents resilience against global change events. Future studies should continue to aim for large, representative samples and consider including respondents outside of the United States. These additions would highlight pandemic impacts on youth in other regions and illustrate how trends found here may hold or change across cultural contexts. Additionally, research on how these trends may change as the pandemic progresses could shed light on both the immediate and cumulative beneﬁts of outdoor activities on SWB during times of crisis. Continued exploration of different types of outdoor activities and their health beneﬁts, the “dosage” of nature required to generate beneﬁts [30], as well as motivations for participation in such activities would also be valuable, both during times of stress and times of relative normalcy. As recalled measures of mood, emotions, and SWB can diminish in intensity and become unstable over longer periods of time [80,111], longitudinal studies that feature moment-in-time\n",
      "SWB assessments and integrate other measures of psychological well-being could facilitate tracking of mental health outcomes. Studies focused on other outcomes such as physical health would also contribute to our understanding of the impacts of pandemics and broader global change events. Additionally, the incorporation of qualitative methods in future studies may provide a deeper understanding of the salutogenic aspects of outdoor activity participation not evident in self-report survey responses.\n",
      "This study provides evidence that raises concerns regarding declines in adolescent\n",
      "SWB and mental health associated with the COVID-19 pandemic [15,16]. However, re- sults also demonstrate the potential effectiveness of outdoor activity-based interventions in promoting improved SWB for all adolescents regardless of their demographic back- ground [26]. In addition to highlighting the importance of engaging in outdoor activities during COVID-19, this study also illuminates the potential value of outdoor activities as a proactive means of building resilience to stressors associated with future public health challenges and other global change events. As the magnitude and frequency of global crises increases [1], adolescents will face ongoing exposure to stressors that negatively impact their SWB. Facilitating adolescent participation in outdoor activities through policy and infrastructure development, particularly activities that provide opportunities for exposure to nature, physical activity, and social interaction, can be a key step in promoting adolescent health and resiliency during times of crisis.\n",

      "In the present study, the association between gastroesophageal reflux and brushing was simulated, whereas other external factors that could contribute to tooth and restorative material erosion were eliminated.\n",
      "Thus, despite the limitations of an in vitro study, this was advantageous, because it allowed control of the erosion time, pH and the applied erosive agents.\n",
      "The first null hypothesis was rejected, since surface roughness value was higher for specimens immersed in hydrochloric acid compared with those that were not subjected to acid challenge. The main explanation for this is that restorative materials tend to undergo degradation after subjected to acid conditions (2), due to polymeric matrix wear, leading to the exposure of filaments and loss of filamentous particles (9).\n",
      "In addition, abrasion plays an important role in restorative material wear (7,18), causing the chemical dissolution of composite resin (7). Toothbrush abrasion modifies the balance between the organic matrix and filamentous particles, damages the bond between components, leading to loss of the inorganic portion and exposure of particles (10). Oliveira et al. (2011) showed the high surface roughness of restorative material after brushing. Moreover, studies have reported that abrasion and erosion act synergistically in restorative material wear (3).\n",
      "However, as the present study did not evaluate the brushing effect alone, it is not possible to affirm that brushing is responsible for material surface alterations.\n",
      "With regards to the material, the second null hypothesis was rejected, since the results suggest that its composition plays an important role in wear resistance. Since previous studies have shown that surface roughness is determined by hardness, size and quantity of filler particles immersed in the matrix (19,20), it is supposed that the findings are mostly related to the inorganic components of composite resin.\n",
      "Nanofilled composite showed a lower surface roughness compared with microhybrid resin. However, the composites presented similar results when immersed in hydrochloric acid. The smaller the particles, the higher will be the wear resistance of material, since it will present greater homogeneity and less prominent particles on surface\n",
      "(21). Thus, microhybrid composite may have undergone a higher degree of degradation by brushing due to its large particles, which protrude more easily through the surface\n",
      "(22). Nevertheless, acid challenge resulted in a higher wear in both composites during the first time interval, leading to fillers being pulled out and greater susceptibility to degradation by brushing.\n",
      "Furthermore, the properties of composite resin will be influenced by type and volume of the filler particles (23).\n",
      "With regards to the volume and arrangement of inorganic particles in a composite containing a high volume of fillers, agglomeration of particles may occur with subsequent deterioration of wear resistance (24).\n",
      "In the present study, the results showed that the nanohybrid composite presented the lowest surface roughness both in the absence and presence of acid challenge. As the composite has smaller volume of fillers compared with the other composites, it may be assumed that there was a uniform dispersion of particles, which leads to an improvement in composite properties.\n",
      "An important factor to consider with regards to erosion is the role of saliva protecting the restorative material surfaces from erosion, since it dilutes and neutralizes the acid solution (1,4,16). The specimens were stored in artificial saliva at 37 °C, allowing protection of the restorative material.\n",
      "The specimens were immersed in acid for 1 min during each cycle. However, saliva neutralizes the acid up to 3 min after its permanence in the oral cavity (3). Similarly, the 50- min abrasive cycle is equivalent to 1 year of toothbrushing, considering that under clinical conditions the material would be in contact with the toothbrush for 10 s during each brushing session (3). Considering the short period of the acid contact with the surface of composite material in a clinical situation, the present study was designed with a long period of tooth erosion followed by brushing.\n",
      "Although restorative material usually displays a greater resistance to dental erosion in comparison with the tooth\n",
      "(6), a short period was sufficient to change the composite resin surface. Intrinsic factors may cause dental erosion according to how frequently they will occur (17). Although\n",

      "In summary, the smaller the particles, the higher will be the wear resistance of the material, since it will present greater homogeneity and less prominent particles on the surface (21). Nanotechnology allows a smaller contraction, higher resistance and less polishing (25). Thus, considering that nanohybrid composite resin has smaller particles, it might be preferable when performing procedures in patients with gastroesophageal reflux.\n",
      "Within the limitations of an in vitro study, it was possible to conclude that a high frequency of exposure to hydrochloric acid promotes increase in surface roughness of composite resin subjected to brushing. Nanoparticle resins may be preferable to use in the treatment of patients with gastroesophageal reflux due to their higher wear resistance.\n",

      "The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of transdiagnostic treatment based on cognitive-behavioral therapy, schema therapy, and meaning therapy on the psychological well-being and marital burnout of women experiencing emotional divorce. The findings of this research regarding the effectiveness of transdiagnostic treatment based on cognitive-behavioral therapy, schema therapy, and meaning therapy on the psychological well- being and marital burnout of women involved in emotional divorce are significant. This study aligns with the results of previous research (Fahimi & Taghvaei, 2022; Goudarzi et al., 2022; Hatami et al., 2021; Jalalvand et al., 2023; Nazari et al., 2015; Rezaei & rezaei, 2018; Zarenezhad et al., 2019;\n",

      "In explaining the effectiveness of transdiagnostic treatment based on cognitive-behavioral therapy on psychological well-being, it can be stated that women experiencing emotional divorce can select or create situations that pursue their personal needs and ideals.\n",
      "Individuals who possess a high level of this aspect feel a sense of well-being. Given this, active participation of women experiencing emotional divorce in well-being is an important element and reflects a positive psychological response of the individual. Therefore, clients participating in transdiagnostic treatment sessions based on cognitive- behavioral therapy can better manage challenges they face and manipulate, change, or in other words, enhance their psychological well-being over their environment.\n",
      "Additionally, transdiagnostic treatment based on cognitive- behavioral therapy, by correcting cognitive errors, enables the individual to think better, plan, and make appropriate decisions. Thus, the transdiagnostic treatment program based on cognitive-behavioral therapy, through developing skills such as positive expectations, purposefulness, activity, realism, goal setting, internal communications, and coping with difficult situations, increases the well-being of women experiencing emotional divorce, thereby facilitating their growth. Cognitive-behavioral training assists individuals in effectively dealing with conflicts and life situations, helping them to act positively and adaptively towards other humans, society, culture, and their environment, thereby ensuring their mental health. In this way, cognitive-behavioral therapy leads to the strengthening or changing of attitudes, values, and human behaviors (Ammari et al., 2023;\n",

      "In explaining the effectiveness of schema therapy on psychological well-being, it can be stated that schema therapy leads to changes in cognitive and experiential, emotional and emotional, and behavioral areas. This approach has been effective by challenging maladaptive schemas and ineffective responses, replacing them with more appropriate and healthier thoughts and responses.\n",
      "Therefore, by providing and facilitating insight into the deep roots of current behaviors in relationships of women experiencing emotional divorce, it increases their awareness and insight into the importance of schemas and their role in maintaining problematic interpersonal situations.\n",
      "Identifying the developmental roots of each schema, women involved in emotional divorce realize that the cause of their current behaviors is thoughts and attitudes previously formed in them, which can be changed with specific training and strategies. Also, the techniques used in this treatment help women experiencing emotional divorce to reduce the activation of maladaptive primary schemas and learn effective coping methods with them. Schema-focused training increases the understanding and comprehension of women experiencing emotional divorce that they come from different family environments. Consequently, schema therapy, with a multidimensional perspective alongside considering the impact of cognitions and attitudes, delves into the roots of the problem in the past, aiming to raise awareness and create insight in women experiencing emotional divorce.

      "Furthermore, in explaining the effectiveness of meaning therapy on psychological well-being, it can be stated that meaning therapy, by emphasizing positive aspects and various dimensions of individuals' lives, creates thoughts and ideas indicative of purposefulness in life and strengthens this feeling in individuals that life is meaningful for those with a purpose, thereby encouraging and strengthening them in setting goals for their life. Consequently, individuals make organized efforts to manage their thoughts, feelings, and behavior towards achieving a goal, directing their purposeful activities over time and changing conditions. Therefore, meaning therapy, through increasing feelings of satisfaction, autonomy, purposefulness, worthiness, appropriate connection with others, being in control, and personal progress, can lead to an increase in psychological well-being\n",

      "In explaining the effectiveness of transdiagnostic treatment based on cognitive-behavioral therapy on marital burnout, it can be stated that the cognitive-behavioral approach for bored couples, who often have cognitive errors, irrational and destructive beliefs in marital life, has caused couples' awareness of irrational attributions and beliefs to increase. Also, through exercises in training sessions and tasks outside of sessions, they address and correct the beliefs and attributions that have led to their burnout. Correcting beliefs, unreasonable expectations, and wrong attributions of spouses' behavior towards each other has led to a reduction in unnecessary grievances and an increase in the recognition of positive aspects of each other's behavior, ultimately leading to a reduction in couples' marital burnout. The likely logic behind the effectiveness of transdiagnostic treatment based on cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing marital burnout is that everyone's marital relationship quality is the result of their beliefs, thoughts, behavior, and actions and is related to their past decisions and performance. The absence of happy, positive, and favorable relationships between couples leads to the occurrence of fatigue and physical weakness. This approach helps women experiencing emotional divorce to bring more hope and joy into their relationships and start rebuilding their past relationships with their spouses with more determination, which in turn reduces marital burnout in them (Parsakia & Darbani, 2022;\n",
      "Salehian & Moradi, 2022).\n",
      "In explaining the effectiveness of schema therapy on marital burnout, it can be stated that the presence of maladaptive schemas is one of the primary stress factors and disruptors of marital life. Therefore, schemas rooted in an individual's childhood can influence their adulthood and relationships. According to the perspective of schema therapy for women experiencing emotional divorce, individuals learn during schema therapy to identify and change maladaptive schemas and mindsets that are blocked and use more adaptive tools to satisfy their fundamental needs. Moreover, schema therapy for women experiencing emotional divorce leads to deep personality changes and can help avoid deadlock in the relationship between spouses, resulting in win-win discussions between them and ultimately reducing marital burnout (Ammari et al., 2023;\n",
      "Salehian & Moradi, 2022). From the perspective of schema therapy, behaviors such as marital burnout, aggression, dependency, avoidance, lack of consideration for each other, commitment shortage, and resistance are considered important pieces of information that provide clues to underlying schemas that trigger behavior. Consequently, modifying underlying schemas and mindsets along with ineffective coping responses causes changes in behaviors like marital burnout, commitment shortage, dependency, etc.\n",
      "Additionally, schema therapy for women experiencing emotional divorce can affect personality issues and resolution of couple conflicts, promoting marital commitment and self-respect in women to effectively reduce emotional divorce.\n",
      "This research was fundamentally conducted on women eligible for emotional divorce; therefore, caution should be exercised in generalizing the results to normal couples. In this study, self-report tools were used for data collection; thus, researchers should be aware of the flaws and limitations of such tools. Considering the different family structures in terms of demographic characteristics, caution should be exercised in generalizing the results to dissimilar groups. It is suggested that this package be used in family counseling centers to enhance the communication skills of women experiencing emotional divorce, reduce emotional inhibition, marital burnout, and marital conflict, and increase psychological well-being in pre-marriage education, couples therapy, and divorce prevention. Given the effectiveness of\n",
      "E-ISSN: 3041-8515 all three treatments on the variables of psychological well- being, marital burnout, and marital conflict, it is suggested that a combination of all three treatments be used in the therapeutic process to improve the communication skills of women experiencing emotional divorce. Furthermore, given the impact of combining transdiagnostic treatment based on cognitive-behavioral therapy, schema therapy, and meaning therapy on increasing psychological well-being, reducing marital burnout, and marital conflict, it is recommended that psychology professionals use these therapeutic methods in their various interventions.\n",

      "One of the primary objectives of the current study was to determine the mediational effect of the intrinsic motivation between the relationship ethical leadership, organizational citizenship behavior and organizational commitment of the employees, in the developing country context, especially in Pakistan. The empirical analysis found that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between EL and OCB, while it has no indirect effect on the relationship between EL and OC. It can be induced that employee’s intrinsic motivation plays important part in motivating them to adopt organizational citizenship behavior while ethical leadership is the most important factor in citizenship behavior and organizational commitment of the employees. However, intrinsic motivation has no significant mediational role in increasing the organizational commitment of the employees. So, the employees with intrinsic motivation will adopt more organizational citizenship behavior as compared to employees without intrinsic motivation, but to enhance organizational commitment particularly in banking sector of Pakistan, leadership of the organization must come up ethical guidelines and ethical leadership is the key to enhance organizational commitment. Not surprisingly, the results show that like developed countries ethical leadership has an positive impact on the organizational citizenship behavior and organizational commitment (Caniago and Hayati, 2012, Galletta et al., 2011) in the developing countries aspect as well, so the second objective is also fulfilled which was to determine the direct impact of ethical leadership on organizational commitment and citizenship behavior of the employees.\n",

The change of watershed area is jointly influenced by meteorological factors and human activities, in which temperature and precipitation are negatively correlated with watershed area, and human activities mainly include urban expansion and the development and utilization of urban water resources. In this paper, we conducted a systematic study on the change of watershed area in Kunming City from three aspects, namely, time series, spatial distribution and driving force analysis, which reveals the law and mechanism of watershed area change and provides scientific basis and reference for the protection and management of ecosystems and water resources in Kunming\n",

      "Kunming, but there are still some shortcomings that need to be further improved in future research:\n",
      "(1) In this paper, Landsat TM/ETM+ remote sensing images were used as the data source, but due to the orbit period of Landsat series satellites is 16 days, and affected by cloud and fog and other factors, the available image data is less, which is difficult to reflect the high-frequency change of the watershed area in Kunming City. In the future, we can try to use remote sensing images with high resolution and high revisit frequency, such as Gaofen series and Sentinel series, to improve the monitoring accuracy and timeliness of the change of water area in Kunming.\n",
      "(2) The watershed extraction method used in this paper is relatively simple, based on the spectral differences between water bodies and non-water bodies for discrimination, and the effects of water body edges, water depth, water quality and other factors are not considered. In the future, we can try to use the watershed extraction algorithm based on machine learning, deep learning and other methods to improve the accuracy and robustness of watershed area extraction in Kunming.\n",
      "(3) In this paper, two methods, correlation analysis and regression analysis, are used for driving force analysis, but both methods are performed based on the assumption of linear relationship, and the ability of portraying nonlinear relationship is weak. In the future, we can try to use the driving force analysis model based on complex system theory, gray system theory and other methods, in order to reveal the intrinsic mechanism and dynamic process of the change of the watershed area in Kunming.\n",
      "In addition, future research directions in the current study, such as data quality, quantitative assessment of influencing factors, and the impact of watershed area change on the ecological environment, are pointed out in the expectation that they can provide reference and inspiration for subsequent studies.\n",

      "This research work concludes that environmental conservation is dependent on three major, important and inter-twined areas: environmental statutes enacted by the legislative authority, ethics and academics & education. Of these three domains, every domain contributes its part towards the building of an enviro-legal regime of a country, and moulding it from time to time. The inter-play of these factors also influences the judicial decisions and general behaviour of society at large towards the cause of environment. For environmental justice to be converted into reality from mere paper existence, society needs to evolve these three domains and work on the inter-relationship between them that will lead the environmentalism movement in the country.47\n",
      "Today, what is required is the adoption of a wholesome approach towards the ecological issues, right from the optimum natural resource management to addressing the issues concerning such resources like pollution and wastage etc. This approach demands a pro-active role to be taken up, rather than passively responding to the particular challenges. Thus, the idea of environment conservation should be the guiding factor in the policy-making process and not only in the legal structure of the country. It is recommended to have a democratic process for decision-making over policies by incorporating the concerns of various stakeholders, relevant governmental agencies, representatives of multifarious industries,\n",

In addition, this study has highlighted a number of issues that are of major concern in the sustainability of local pig rearers, of importance is feeding, marketing and breeding. There is need to address these for full realization of the sectors potential. One of the possible ways that could reduce production costs is by farmers using locally available feedstuffs that would balance the nutrient requirements of the pig. Confinement of pigs would reduce the public health risks associated with pigs. Pig farming, with proper management, will provide pig farmers with an additional source of income. There is need to increase producer awareness on healthy husbandry practices through strengthened extension services. These coupled with additional research would promote healthy pork production and meet the local demand for the increasing pork consumption in Bangladesh. In order to disseminate the technology among the farmers trained person is essential in pig farming system. Combined feed formulation (concentrate feed with roughage) can minimize cost effectiveness and also promote more production. The traditional pig farmers are not concerned about the hygienic pig farming but after visiting our demo farm and trial shed they were encouraged to make their farms and sheds hygienic. The study pointed that the pig farming in the study area enabled producers to generate additional income which in turn helps in achieving food security self-employment for landless and unemployed people in the study area.\n",

      "Increasing structured MVPA can improve young children's emotional symptoms and physical morphology, and increasing the proportion of\n",
      "MVPA in structured activities has higher health benefits.\n",
      "This study is the first isochronous alternative study of structured-unstructured activity behaviours affecting young children's mental and physical health. It aims to explore the combined effects of S-MVPA, US-MVPA, S-LPA, US-LPA and other behaviours affecting young children's mental and physical well-being in the same temporal space. This study addressed two issues: ① revealed the combined association between structured-unstructured activity behaviour and mental and physical health in young children; ② addressed the problem of covariance in traditional statistics through an isotemporal substitution model of component analysis. The findings are consistent with existing research and support the positive benefits of MVPA on young children's physical and mental health28–30, i.e., significant positive effects of either SMVPA or US-MVPA on young children's emotional symptoms and internalising difficulties, as well as positive effects of S-MVPA on young children's physical shape. In addition to this, there are several key findings in this study.\n",
      "1) SB and SP are relatively independent components of young children's 24-hour activity behaviour and do not easily translate to PA. As with previous studies, this study indicated that SB and SP are independent risk factors for young children's health31–35. In terms of the one- dimensionality of time, a change in the duration of any one activity inevitably brings about a change in the duration of the others36,37. And increasing the duration of PA and decreasing the duration of SB are currently the dominant health-promoting measures32,38. Based on the results of this study, increasing PA levels in young children should be prioritised for conversion between LPA and MVPA, which is more likely to increase the health benefits of PA for young children.\n",
      "2) Numerous studies have confirmed that MVPA has good support for young children's mental health3,39,40. Meanwhile, longitudinal studies have found that high levels of PA in young children can predict their future mental health problems41. This study further argues for this conclusion that both S-MVPA and US-MVPA had a significant positive effect on young children's emotional symptoms and internalising difficulties, while there was no significant association with the externalizing difficulties and total difficulties score, a finding consistent with previous research42–45.\n",
      "In addition, inactivity or LPA has been shown to have negative outcomes with emotional difficulties and depression in young children46,47.\n",
      "This study further found that US-SB, S-LPA, and US-LPA had significant negative effects on young children's emotional problems. Specifically,\n",
      "SB generated during unstructured activities in real contexts is mostly free and undisciplined screen time conducted by young children, who are not able to filter and carry out educationally meaningful screen content, and are more attracted by the form and have difficulty in receiving positive guidance48. The cause of the negative effects of S-LPA and US-LPA in young children may be related to the inhibition of\n",
      "MVPA effects. The relatively fixed daily activity time of young children was accompanied by a relative increase in the proportion of LPA and a relative decrease in the proportion of MVPA, which suppressed the dosage effect of MVPA on young children's mental.\n",
      "Unlike the mental indicators, for the physical indicators, only S-MVPA had a positive effect on Physical Shape in young children. Previous studies have supported the favourable effect of MVPA on young children's body49,50. And this study further found that S-MVPA had a significant positive effect on young children's Physical Shape, while US-MVPA did not show a significant effect. It is suggested that the health effects of MVPA on young children's fitness are mainly due to structured activity components with specific purposes and clear rules.\n",
      "In contrast, the more random unstructured activity component with no specific purpose and diverse forms and rules did not play a significant role, which may be related to the clustering characteristics of US-MVPA. Due to the constraints of the structured activity programme in kindergartens, young children's unstructured activities often take place in between lessons of short duration, and US-MVPA occurs sporadically and briefly on top of US-LPA, which needs to be accumulated over a longer period of time in order to have a significant benefit on physical health51,52.\n",
      "3) Results of the isotemporal substitution model show that. Both internalizing difficulties and Physical Shape were significantly improved in young children using 10min S-MVPA isotemporal substitution for S-LPA, S-SB in structured activity behaviour. From the results of this study, it is critical that young children's interactive and physical education programmes, as the main carriers of S-MVPA, rationally allocate the activity time for their different intensity contents. For the interactive curriculum, the creation of S-MVPA signalled that young children invested a higher level of energy in interacting with their teachers or peers. This MVPA is directly linked to young children's internalising difficulties53. Meanwhile, SB was restricted during the interactive sessions. When SB was controlled, MVPA showed a significant correlation with internalisation difficulties42. Therefore, how to increase young children's motivation during interactive sessions is an effective way to improve young children's internalising difficulties. And for young children's physical education curriculum system. With a relatively fixed curriculum time, increasing the relative proportion of S-MVPA in S-PA and decreasing the relative proportion of S-LPA and S-SB remains an optimal solution for improving young children's bodies. Among the other isotemporal substitutions for S-MVPA, both US-SB and US-LPA and\n",
      "SP, young children's internalising difficulties were significantly reduced and Physical Shape was significantly enhanced. This further illustrates the importance of S-MVPA for young children's body and mind. The trend of isotemporal substitution effect shows that the\n",
      "/19 amount of health effect of S-MVPA on young children's body and mind gradually increased with the increase of substitution time. A rapid decline was observed at reverse substitution. This trend is consistent with the previous trend of MVPA-based isotemporal substitution, which shows an asymmetry of isotemporal substitution benefits6–8. Meanwhile, when the time of S-MVPA substitution for S-LPA was increased to 25 min, the internalising difficulties score and Physical Shape score of young children showed a sharp inflection point. This suggests that 25 min may be the \"health threshold\" for S-MVPA isotemporal substitution and S-LPA.\n",
      "This study has several notable strengths. Firstly, it is the first study to objectively measure the structured and unstructured activity behaviours of young children. Secondly, this study combines the investigation of structured and unstructured activity behaviours with the assessment of physical and mental health within a 24-hour activity behaviour context. This combination aids in understanding the significance of structured and unstructured activity behaviours in influencing the physical and mental well-being of young children and allows for more precise inferences. While this study rigorously adhered to the study design and employed scientific and detailed statistical analyses to create models, there are certain limitations to be acknowledged. On one hand, the regional characteristics and environmental backgrounds of the sample participants may limit the generalizability of the study findings, suggesting a need for broader sample representation. On the other hand, this study analysed cross-sectional data results, necessitating longitudinal research to establish causal relationships between structured and unstructured activity behaviours and the physical and mental well-being of young children.\n",
      "Structured MVPA has been shown to effectively enhance emotional symptoms, internalizing difficulties, and physical shape in young children. By maintaining the duration of structured activities and increasing the proportion of MVPA within those activities, while simultaneously reducing the proportion of LPA or SB, it serves as an effective approach for optimizing early childhood curricula and improving internalizing difficulties and physical shape outcomes. Adding unstructured MVPA could further improve young children's internalizing difficulties. It is recommended that teachers and caregivers should encourage young children to engage in energizing activities as much as possible in their academic lives, rather than waiting, teaching them how to do it, limiting risk, and engaging in other activities that hinder MVPA development.\n",

This result indirectly proves that energy infrastructure has a strong endogenous effect on regional economic growth [30].\n",
      "China is a large country with an uneven energy structure across regions. The upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Zone have rich hydropower, coal and gas resources and are key areas for energy infrastructure investment [29]. Energy infrastructure investment can promote the efﬁciency of cross-regional resource distribution, and with the characteristics of large scale and a long period of return, such investment can promote global economic growth in the medium and long terms. However, because of the large investment associated with the construction of a single project, energy infrastructure investment may have a “crowding-out effect” on other types of ﬁxed asset investment, distort the allocation of resources, reduce production efﬁciency, and thus reduce the growth of the regional economy [31].\n",

Moreover, the vertical transfer payment and the horizontal compensation are insufﬁcient, as in the short and medium terms, there is a conﬂict of interest between the investors and the actual beneﬁciaries of this type of investment.

      "Another explanation for the disagreement between the measured and estimated MRRDs is the diﬀerence of aluminium sheet emissivity used in the theoretical model and measurements. Theoretically, aluminium is an ideal conductor and the waves transmitted to a smooth aluminium sheet will be totally reﬂected [34]. Therefore, the emissivity of the aluminium sheets should be zero at any observation angle or frequency. In the theoretical model, the emissivity of aluminium were set to be zero. Obviously, they are about 0.01 ~ 0.03, which may be caused by the surface oxidation of the aluminium sheets in the experiment (as shown in Figure 11, when the soil thickness is zero, the measured emissivity is not zero). These results were also found in our other ﬁeld experiments [35].\n",

Finally, the parameterized model was validated using experimental data. Some interesting conclusions can be made regarding the MRRD of frozen soil. The soil temperature, frequency, and soil texture are the three main variables aﬀecting the MRRD. The MRRD is negatively correlated with soil temperature, frequency, and speciﬁc surface area.

Cu was detected, though also in relatively low concentrations in all samples. Concentration ranged from 0.001 to 0.014 mg/l. This also is well below the WHO standard limit of 2 mg/l. We again conclude that Cu concentrations in domestic water sources in the study areas would pose no health risk to the locals. However, the distribution map (figure 4) of Cu concentration shows a strong congruence between preferential Cu concentration and the regional geologic strike of the suite of rocks within the area. Strikes measured on outcropping rocks in the area indicate an approximately WNW – ESE trend. This strongly coincides with a low Cu concentration path seen straddling the area in a nearly NW – SE. This straddle appears as a low concentration barrier which separates higher concentration regions to the NE and SW of the area. This would indicate that Cu concentrations and possibly migration trends in the area is controlled by geologic strike. In the event therefore, of heavy ion contamination in the area, it can be expected that plume migration will be along the predominant WNW – ESE geologic strike direction. This insight could prove valuable for contaminant containment and remediation future.\n",

      "Twenty water samples taken from various locations in Okeagbe-Akoko and representing different sources of domestic water utilized by the inhabitants of the area have been subjected to analyses to determine the physico-chemical characteristics and the suitability of the water sources employ for domestic use vis. a vis. the WHO standard. TDS and conductivity values obtained and the heavy metal concentrations of Zn and Cu detected are well below the current WHO acceptable limit for water safe for domestic consumption. However, pH values obtained for half of each of the stream and HDW samples fall outside the WHO acceptable limit for safe drinking water. These sources make up about 80 % of available water sources in the area and could indicate potential health risk for locals who utilize them. On the whole, we conclude that water sources within OkeagbeAkoko Township are relativity safe for consumption and have not been adversely impacted by contamination sources such as inadequate waste disposal, and industrial and agro-Allied chemical release into the environment.\n",
      "The Cu concentration distribution gives us insight into possible immigration pathways for heavy metal ions contaminants in the event of an impact. As the town grows and industrializes, such a scenario becomes increasingly plausible. It therefore is imperative that further development and waste management plans take into cognizance this indicated migration trend.\n",

      "Our findings suggest that there is room for improve- ment in both primary and secondary school completion for OSCA in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya, regardless of care environment. While most school-aged OSCA were currently attending school, many had not achieved the educational milestones expected for their age. This was particularly pronounced in OSCA over the age of 18, of whom only a third had completed high school.

Educa- tional outcomes were self-reported by participants and are subject to recall bias and reporting bias. We were also unable to measure education quality or achieve- ment. In addition, follow up time was shorter for OSCA from CCIs compared to those from family-based settings due to difficulties in following youth once they aged out of care. Thus, these results reflect the participants who remained in the OSCAR study long enough to complete at least one Phase 2 visit.\n",
      "In conclusion, our results demonstrate that OSCA liv- ing in institutional environments are significantly more likely to complete primary school and attend secondary school but are somewhat less likely to complete second- ary school than OSCA living in family-based care. For these children and youth who already face discrimination and very little to no support from their families, educa- tion may be especially important for future success. Fur- ther action is needed to reduce barriers to secondary school and improve completion rates among all OSCA.\n",

      "Additionally, institutional quality plays a significant role in poverty in South Asia, with a 1% increase leading to a 2.61% increase in poverty. This finding aligns with assertions by Aracil et al. (2022) that institutional deterioration in developing nations fails to stimulate economic performance and, consequently, poverty reduction. Although the impact of GDP per capita growth (GDPPPC) is modest, it is pro-poor, as indicated by its opposing sign. Furthermore, a 1% increase in GDP per capita growth correlates with a 0.12% decrease in poverty. Poverty is lessened in part by the acceleration of economic growth. The findings drawn by Egena et al. (2014) align with this. Inflation (INF) and trade openness (TOP) are likewise unimportant. Trade openness benefits the poor, as evidenced by its negative value, which indicates that it reduces poverty in South Asia. This was not wholly unexpected since trade liberalization frequently lowers poverty in countries with powerful institutions, solid financial sectors, and high levels of education.\n",

This research examines how financial development influences poverty levels across several South Asian nations while also considering how the association between the financial sector and institutional framework may affect results by potentially biasing omitted variables. Through the use of fixed effects and random effects models, the study investigates these relationships. The main findings of this empirical study can be summarized as follows: Firstly, it was found that poverty is negatively influenced by advancements in financial development, economic development, inflation, and trade openness, indicating that higher financial improvement, economic development, inflation, and trade openness reduce poverty in South Asian countries, with this relationship being statistically significant. It is also evident from the estimate that poverty is significantly increased if institutional quality increases.\n",
      "The study's empirical findings significantly impact theoretical understanding and practical policymaking. To combat poverty effectively, policymakers should prioritize initiatives that bolster financial institutions, promote robust economic growth, and facilitate trade liberalization. Strengthening institutional frameworks can enhance the benefits of economic development for the marginalized. Policymakers should focus on reforms that strengthen governance, uphold the rule of law, and mitigate political instability. Supporting economic openness, skill training, and human capital development is crucial. Prioritizing policies that enhance labour market flexibility can facilitate resource reallocation, stimulating growth and poverty reduction.\n",

In diﬀerent initial states, regardless of the health status of the elderly in the base period, continuing to the next stage, the elderly population is primarily in keeping with the original health status, and the probability of maintaining the status quo in the next phase of the elderly population is above 30% percent for each health condition.\n",

      "Third, the health status of the elderly population is directly related to family, personal medical treatment, and medical expenditure. On the one hand, the poorer the health status of the elderly, the higher the rate of medical treatment and medical expenditure. On the other hand, diﬀerences in individual characteristics of the elderly population lead to diﬀerences in medical treatment and medical expenditure between families and individuals. The poorer the health of the elderly, the more family and personal medical expenses, and personal medical expenditure accounts for more than 50% of the family’s medical expenditure. In addition, the medical treatment and medical expenditure of the elderly population of diﬀerent age groups basically support that the better the self-rated health status, the lower the family and personal medical expenditure.\n",

Good dispersion was achieved for nano composites up-to 10 wt.% CNT loading. The mechanical properties (elastic modulus and tensile strength) of all the un-weathered composites improved because of the presence of fibrous MWCNTs aligned with the direction of extrusion. For weathered composite samples, MWCNTs aided in suppressing the matrix damage, which resulted in superior mechanical properties as compared to neat HDPE.

The model is computationally efﬁcient and scalable and can be used to pre- dict ﬂood hazards over relatively large regions. Training and image prediction were run in 1 h on a high-end desktop com- puter; in comparison physical models can run for 20 min or up to 10 h for an area 0.15 % of the size of the study area\n",
      "(Apel et al., 2009). Overall, the model demonstrates strong predictive power for estimating historic damages and accu- rately represents the spatial distribution of the ﬂood hazard across those 40 years of ﬂood damages. When compared against similar studies using machine learning approaches to predict ﬂood hazards (Dodangeh et al., 2020; Janizadeh et al., 2019), our model demonstrates lower sensitivity. The differences are likely attributed to the high topographic re- lief of these regions where ﬂuvial ﬂood hazards predomi- nate (Tehrany et al., 2019b), likely contributing to the pre- dictive capacity of the models. In contrast, southeast Texas is characterized by little topographic relief where ﬂooding may emanate from pluvial, ﬂuvial, and marine sources, mak- ing ﬂood prediction more complex. In fact, when comparing model sensitivities across the study region, we ﬁnd that the model performance increases in more steeply sloped inland areas than ﬂat coastal areas.\n",
      "Another aspect impacting model performance was sample selection. A systematic approach that identiﬁes areas that did not ﬂood (Darabi et al., 2019) can be important to increas- ing model performance (Barbet-Massin et al., 2012). While the model is based on a comprehensive record of observed\n",

      "One option would be to randomly sample areas that have no claims; however this would not control for bias in the ab- sence data and would come at the expense of model perfor- mance (Wisz and Guisan, 2009). To overcome this potential bias, we generated pseudo-absences by randomly selecting a sample of non-ﬂooded structures by watershed and year to minimize this selection bias (Phillips et al., 2009). Based on the calibration plot (shown in Fig. 5), this is an appropriate assumption.\n",
      "Another source of bias comes from how contextual vari- ables were associated with the claims dataset. That is, the contextual variables that were attached to the claims came from the closest year for which the data were made avail- able. However, this can cause some skewed behavior, partic- ularly for the older claims, because some of the contextual variables only start in 2001, whereas the claims date back to\n",

By using historic losses, the random forest model accounts for extreme events that have occurred, but projecting future hazard is currently limited. The model does not currently incorporate precipi- tation patterns. Future work should examine the sensitivity of the model to precipitation as an input. With precipitation added to the model, there is still potential for error by under- estimating the probability of future extreme events.\n",

      "Sadly, the majority of locals are ignorant of the substantial impact solid mineral mining has, either directly or indirectly, on the ecology and way of life of the host communities. The factors affecting farmers' knowledge of the effects of solid mineral extraction on the production of yam and cassava in Southeast Nigeria were investigated. This study is subject to several limitations. First, data availability and quality may vary across regions, potentially affecting the accuracy of correlations drawn between mineral extraction activities and crop yields. Second, the study may not fully account for confounding variables such as weather variability, pest outbreaks, and differences in agricultural practices, which also influence crop production. Third, spatial and temporal limitations in sampling could constrain the generalizability of the findings. Lastly, the study primarily relies on observational data, which limits the ability to establish direct causality between mineral extraction and agricultural outcomes in the study area.\n",
      "According to the results in Table 1, the average farmer is 51 years old, has about 21 years of farming experience, has been a cooperative member for about 7 years, has an average family size of about 8, and has an average farm size of about 2.41 hectares. The most common secondary source of income in the study area is participation in solid mineral mining-related activities. The socioeconomic parameters that influence farmers' understanding of the detrimental effects of solid mineral extraction in the three states that were chosen are shown in table 2. The models appear to account for a moderate to significant amount of the variation in awareness, according to the Pseudo R2 values (0.3988 for Abia, 0.5923 for Ebonyi, and 0.5957 for Enugu).\n",

Increased lobbying, mobilization, and sensitization are needed to raise awareness of the detrimental effects that solid mineral mining has on the socioeconomic well-being of host communities so that they can take more proactive measures to combat this threat. Furthermore, the government and interested parties should make sure that reliable mineral mining firms strictly follow all applicable national and international laws, rules, and regulations.

      "This research paper is conceived to provide some practical recommendations for the implementation of the pushover analysis. The traditional pushover analysis was initially conceived as nonlinear static procedures where force targets were assigned in the structure.\n",
      "By gradually incrementing the intensity of the force, the algorithm would provide the function of base shear versus the assigned control node’s displacement. This approach is valid for deﬁnitive loads that are fully known. However, the seismic loads are of inertial nature and they depend on the response of the structure. Any assumption of the seismic loads’ distribution in the structure would be only an approximation or at least the one that would bring the structure to a certain limit state. The most accurate assumption would be to apply accelerations with a spatial distribution mimicking the eigenmodes, and this acceleration would be incremented gradually. For practical purposes, by using an advanced FE software package, the best-recommended approach would be to conceptualize a nonlinear dynamic analysis with a user-deﬁned shape distribution of the acceleration in a quasi-static fashion. When compared to other methods, this approximation is quite reliable, and it provides the seismic assessment’s required information according to a pushover analysis.\n",
      "A most rigorous and speciﬁc application of such an assumption would permit an increase of the acceleration even the capacity of the structures to withstand those actions is exceeded, thence the compounding bodies of the structure would follow a kinematic motion and the numerical simulation would continue. However, such analysis would require a very advanced model, which would count for geometrical nonlinearities and large displacements. Such approaches are not practical, and they exceed the requirements for seismic assessment. However, from a theoretical point of view, their exploration would be beneﬁcial.\n",
      "Pushover analysis is one of the most popular analysis for the seismic assessment of existing structures. The evolution of instruments and the advancement in the masonry modeling approaches that are suitable for nonlinear analysis are seen as a very useful tool.\n",
      "Despite the structural regularity, the pushover analysis is still not an easy task. This is not directly related to the complexity of the model itself, but regarding the accuracy of the obtained base shear-displacement capacity curve. The role of the geometry, material properties, load pattern, and type of analysis (force-controlled vs. displacement-controlled) have been raised in this research. Three case studies, three materials, and ﬁve load patterns are the object of this study. From the conducted analysis and obtained results, the most noteworthy remarks to be drawn are.\n",

      "Second, according to the research findings, the participants positive CER changed significantly after the intervention. This suggests that they progressed after the intervention in positive CER and benefited more from the positive strategies. The most effective subscales that are affected by the intervention are re-focusing on planning, putting into perspective, positive reappraisal, positive re-focusing respectively. Actually, all positive CER are reinforced by SIT. The most important is the SIT effects on planning, organizing, focusing or in the other words, it effected on meta-cognition which called cold cognition. It seems that immunizing against stress will grow up brains information processing sys- tem; nevertheless, its effect on rumination was not significant. Wells believed in rumination as the most important part of negative moods etiology [19]. Our findings are in contrast with this theory and are in line with Lee et al. [14] and\n",
      "Khorsandi, et al. [11].\n",
      "Third, negative CER turned slightly. Self-blame and blame the others are the subscales that decreased significantly against the other negative subscales. It could be explaining that, when a vulnerable adolescent girl drops into a marriage without real rational support, she blames herself and her parents against the stressful marriage necessity. These negative CERs brings her more stressful against spousal tasks. As a result, she feels inefficient and become more negative in emotional regulation. We cannot change cultural structures immediately.\n",
      "However, it is possible to reinforce adolescent women to control their negative emotions and to upgrade their metacognitions. These will help structural con- version in future for they will be the next mothers. Moreover, there has been no change in the acceptance of participants because catastrophizing and rumination did not improve significantly. It seems these subscales intertwine, and as long as\n",

      "335 the participants do not improve their schema of catastrophizing and rumination, they cannot increase their acceptance.\n",
      "Finally, it is likely that the participants could find improvement faster in posi- tive strategies for it is related to their moods. While negative emotions are re- lated to their childhood and schemas. Consequently, it would be slowly im- proved. Therefore, positive CER are associated with superficial mental layers of the human; whereas, negative CER are correlated with deeper mental layers of the brain [20]. Hence, the research question was confirmed and SIT was effective on increasing positive CER and negative CER. Accordingly, the control group did not show significant differences in positive CER and negative CER levels in the post-test. In this research, we attempted to enhance women’s CER by teach- ing SIT cognitive-behavioral methods. The findings indicate the effect of this method on increasing CER and its subscales, which can be explained based on the cognitive and behavioral strategies considered in this study. The au- to-negative thoughts, cognitive distortions and the replacement of reasonable thoughts play an important role in CERs. Specially, the participants learned to assess their abilities and talents properly. Based on this correct assessment, they should have reasonable thoughts and expectations to be successful in their ma- rital intra and inter-relationships. These reasonable thoughts and expectations reduce the negative experienced emotions, increase the level of positive strate- gies and thus increase the mental health. Notably, using behavioral techniques, participants could show physical signs of emotions and the sense of increased control. This finding is congruent with the research findings of Khorsandi, et al.\n",
      "[11], Kraaji & Garnefski [5], and Lee et al. [14].\n",
      "The present study has several strengths. It also has several practical implica- tions. First, since there are a few research in this field, the results of this study can be indirectly consistent with studies indicating the effectiveness of SIT treatment on improving the psychological health of vulnerable married women.\n",
      "Second, the results of this study can be consistent with a small number of studies that show the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral treatments on improving the psychological problems of married female adolescents. Both in the literature re- view in Iran and overseas, there are few research which examine the effectiveness of SIT on married female adolescents between 17 - 19. In this intervention, the concept of adolescent women stressful life has attracted the attention of women community in Iran. Finally, the present study showed that if women become skilled, ignoring the effect size, CER will improve and possibly, we could see cultural conversion in future.\n",
      "Regarding the limitations of this work, the present study has several implica- tions. First, one of the limitations is that it was done only in the female married adolescents so its generalization to the single adolescents needs further research in this regard. Second, low socio-economic level was considered in this study and therefore, other socio-economic levels were not considered. Finally, and unfortunately, it has not been possible to compare the results obtained in this\n",

      "336 study with the results of previous studies. Because, the participants did not have any training about life and marital skills, and they are considered as children in accordance with UNICEF. In addition, the lack of follow-up stage due to admin- istrative constraints prevented the possibility of examining the effectiveness of the intervention in the long term. Therefore, supplementary studies on gender, age and socio-economic levels are recommended in the field of SIT therapies with follow-up stages. Moreover, charities and women’s rights activists have to establish community-based organizations that can take effective action to sup- port the empowerment of the psychological skills of girls and women.\n",
      "Generally, SIT training course, relaxation skills, identifying auto-negative thoughts and cognitive distortions, replacing reasonable thoughts, learning problem solving methods, and other SIT skills control stress in vulnerable mar- ried female adolescents. These skills could reinforce the positive CER and con- sequently, decline the negative CER. SIT training could reduce self and the oth- ers blaming and increase planning, focusing, and organizing the emotions of vulnerable married female adolescents.\n",

A great many researches assert that what matters most in healthy seedling production is using supplementary agents just after germination. To this end, various chemical and synthetic materials are exploited. As far as the organic farming regulations are concerned, the outlaw of such supplementary chemicals or growth regulators bears a great hurdle standing before cultivation, causing grave economic losses. If the growth phases of the lettuce seedlings are taken into account, statistical discrepancies between the applied materials and their doses emerge. Especially the increase in the dry weight of the root and leaves after the individual uses of seaweed and vermicompost reveals the direct and positive outcomes of the fertilizing materials on the seedling growth.\n",
      "The fact that both materials promote the absorption of the nutrients in the soil necessarily assures the root to thrive better. Much as seaweed provided the lowest root weight ratio, it yields the highest leaf weight. The lowest root weight ratio is 0.1671 in SW2 application, whereas the highest leaf weight is 0.8329 in SW2. As a result of the trials, SW3 application shines out on the basis of the total dry weight (0.3125) of the lettuce seedlings. The study highest QI was determined in SW3 applications (0.1787).\n",

Although it is clear that the Newlands valley did not undergo significant development until relatively very late, its steep terrain is likely to have been more susceptible to flashy storm run-off, and efficient sediment delivery compared with the more undulating Derwent sub-catchment.

Decreases in AP percentages (particularly oak) between 4.8 and 4.2 kyr BP reflect increased human activity and forest clearance, with the archaeology indicating most activity within the more accessible Derwent sub-catchment. Climatic and vegetation conditions in the mid-Holocene were likely to have been favourable for magnetic enhancement in cambisols (Maher, 1998; Maher et al., 2003); increased topsoil erosion linked to deforestation episodes may explain increased fining of the lake’s magnetic minerals at this time, and evident in the coarse silt fraction possibly due to incomplete particle size separation (e.g. Sartori et al., 2005). The magnetic properties of the lake sediments display statistical affinity with the Derwent rather than Newlands Beck at this time (figure 6a) reflecting the uneven concentration of human activity.

Increased archaeological finds (ADS, 2008) and an interval of increased lake sediment flux from the Newlands valley appears to support this.  However, rates of sediment flux decrease almost immediately and the Derwent is reinstalled as the major lake sediment source. Roman occupation significantly impacted vegetation and/or erosional flux in many Lake District catchments (Oldfield, 1963; Wimble et al., 2000; Chiverrell, 2006).

Despite onset of these late changes in the Newlands valley, the Derwent remained the main sediment source through most of this time interval. More intense post- medieval activity was initiated through mining, first of copper and then, much later, of lead (Postlethwaite, 1913).  Increased pollen percentages of Erica indicate higher proportions of moorland development, coupled with conversion of heath at lower altitudes to pasture for sheep grazing, particularly in riparian areas. Sediment fluxes show little increase at this time, however.\n",

Doubling of herb and grass pollen percentages and a further 10 % reduction in AP indicate increased deforestation, large-scale establishment of pasture, and increasingly intensive pastoralism as the dominant land use in the upland areas. When upland vegetation cover is converted from relatively deep-rooted woodland and ferns to shallow-rooted pasture, markedly increased rates of soil erosion result (Wilmshurst, 1997; Wilmshurst & McGlone\n",

In addition to these intensified agricultural activities, mining and deforestation in the Newlands valley in the 18th and 19th centuries appear to have resulted in major erosional activity and sediment delivery to the lake.  Not only is sediment supply likely to have been increased but also sediment delivery, since artificial straightening and river bank revetment along the Newlands Beck was undertaken during and post – World War 2.  Another major ‘pulse’ of sediment flux coincides with renewed farming intensification during the 1960s.  Most recently (and ongoing), a further interval of increased sediment flux, again Newlands-sourced, has been initiated within the last ~ 10 years.\n",
      "Evidence from these multiproxy records indicates a stepwise increase in human impacts on sediment dynamics in the Bassenthwaite catchment only within the last 150 years, despite pollen and archaeological evidence for human activity and occupation through the last ~ 5.5 kyrs. Either this activity was insufficient to alter catchment sediment dynamics and/or sediment storage and redistribution has until recently ‘buffered’ sediment influx to the deep lake basin. Any such buffers appear to have been exceeded by recent, intense land use and river channel changes in the Newlands catchment. The combination of increased sediment supply and decreased sediment storage (on floodplains and in channels) has resulted in rapid and ongoing acceleration of sediment influx to the lake. Given predictions and observations of increased rainfall and storm intensity linked to global warming (Hulme et al., 2002; Malby et al., 2007), the ecological status of\n",
      "Lake Bassenthwaite, already progressing towards eutrophy (Bennion et al.,\n",
      "2000), is likely to deteriorate further and rapidly, unless accelerated sediment supply is mitigated (e.g. by land use change, such as reafforestation) and sediment storage capacity restored (e.g. by restoration of river channels).\n",
      "• From the mid-Holocene onwards, sedimentation rates at Lake\n",
      "Bassenthwaite have been low (~ 0.05 cm/yr), despite increased rainfall and slightly declining temperatures.  Catchment disturbance by human activity has been relatively limited and late. Newlands Beck-sourced sediment dominated the early part (5.5 – 4.5 kyr BP) of the deep lake basin record.  Sediment source then shifted to the River Derwent, with sediment accumulation rates of ~ 0.05 - 0.1 cm/yr from ~ 4.5 kyr BP, until the last ~ 500 years when Newlands sources became dominant, in association with major (> 3 x) increases in sedimentation rate.\n",
      "• Pollen analysis, allied with published archaeological finds data, indicates increasing human activity and environmental impact from the midHolocene onwards but increases in rates of sedimentation only occur in recent times, particularly reflecting the late and intense land use changes in the Newlands Beck subcatchment.\n",
      "• Sediment storage processes are important in the Bassenthwaite catchment, with Derwent-sourced sediment probably preferentially deposited in the shallower areas of the lake, especially at the aggrading pro-Derwent delta.\n",

      "This study determined the relationship between work-life balance, social competence, and employee psychological well-being and whether social competence moderates the relationship between work-life balance and employee psychological well-being. These concerns were expressed and tested in three hypotheses. Hypotheses 1 and 2 expressed the central effect relationship, and the data supported them. For Hypothesis 1, the work-life balance was positively correlated with employee psychological well-being. This finding confirmed several existing studies (Okeya et al.,\n",
      "2020; Prasad & Sreenivas, 2020). The reported pattern of findings was expected for two main reasons. First, the work-life balance indicates a satisfactory alignment between an employee's work and other life roles. This experience can potentially breed contentment, satisfaction, and happiness representing employee psychological well-being.\n",
      "Second, work-life balance symbolises an acceptable conflict between the work domain and other life activities. The literature has shown that several conflicts (e.g., work-family conflict, family-work conflicts, leisure–work conflict) damage employees' psychological well-being. Work- life balance creates a conflict-free environment where employee psychological well-being thrives by curtailing conflict at work. Data analysis also supported Hypothesis 2: social competence positively correlates with employee psychological well-being, confirmed in previous studies\n",
      "(Gómez-López et al., 2022). Social competencies plausibly positively relate to employee psychological well-being because it is a composite of social skills such as social adaptability, emotional intelligence, and social intelligence that have the potential to improve interpersonal relationships (Holopainen et al., 2012; Onyemaechi & Ikpeazu, 2020). People in cordial relationships with others are likely to express joy and happiness, fundamental components of psychological well-being.\n",
      "Hypothesis 3 on moderation was confirmed. Social competence moderated the positive relationship between work-life balance and employee psychological well-being. However, the slope analysis result revealed that social competence's effect on the work-life balance and employee psychological well-being relationship was stronger when social competence was low than when it\n",

      "High (+SD)\n",
      "Social competence\n",
      "65 was high. This finding is unexpected, as the opposite seems more logical since social competence embodies social intelligence with positive implications for effective interpersonal functioning.\n",
      "However, a plausible explanation for the greater influence of a low level on the high level of social competence in the relationship between work-life balance and employee psychological well-being is that a low social competence implies a lessened social network, which is essentially about the relationship. The relationship comes with costs, such as time, finances and energy. Therefore, the more positive an individual experiences, the greater the responsibility for the individual.\n",
      "Friendship-induced responsibility can interfere with the balance between work and other life activities. It is argued here that low social competence indicates less interference of social networks on work-life balance, a state of being that allows the work-life balance to exert its full influence on employee psychological well-being.\n",
      "Employee psychological well-being is associated with desirable and organisationally valued outcomes; consequently, improving it on the job is necessary. The present study investigated the relationship between work-life balance and social competence with employee psychological well- being. Importantly, this study revealed that work-life balance and social competence are precursors of employee psychological well-being. The study builds the literature on work-life balance, social competence and employee psychological well-being. The study has some practical values as it identifies and points out the importance of work-life balance and social competence in enhancing employee psychological well-being. However, a caveat from the moderation result is that the two should not be improved for a particular intervention to strengthen employee psychological well- being, work-life balance, or social competence.\n",
      "Theoretical Contribution\n",
      "Several theoretical contributions were made in this study. This research answers\n",
      "Thilagavathy and Geetha's (2021) observation, which asks for more research into the work-life balance and employee psychological well-being in developing nations. This concern is because national culture can influence organisational culture, work-life balance, and employee psychological well-being (Adnan et al., 2021; Ansah & Louw, 2019; Stankevičienė et al., 2021).\n",
      "Second, this research was the first to respond to Jafri and Batra (2014)'s call for research on third variables in the work-life balance and employee psychological well-being relationship. This study investigates the role of social competence moderation in work-life balance and employee psychological well-being relationships, addressing concerns (Jafri & Batra, 2014). When considering moderation in a connection, you may figure out \"when\" the variables are related. This knowledge is beneficial for the development of theories and practice. Third, while there is considerable research on work-life balance, social competence, and employee psychological well- being, no study has examined all three variables simultaneously.\n",
      "Several studies have been conducted on the relationship between social competence and psychological well-being; this research contributes to the few studies that examined the relationship between social competence and employee psychological well-being. Previous research has focused primarily on adolescents and student populations (Gómez-López et al., 2022;\n",
      "Holopainen et al., 2012). Fourth, the results of this study were consistent with previous research.\n",
      "Both work-life balance and social competence predict employee psychological well-being, and social competence moderates the link between work-life balance and employee psychological well- being. As a result, this study's findings contribute to the literature's accumulation, ecological validity, and practical utility. Finally, the work-life balance, social competence, and employee psychological well-being measures were established in a situation unrelated to the current\n",
      "66 investigation. However, the reliability and validity of the scales were examined during the adoption process. The study's findings added to the body of knowledge on the psychometric features of the scales and their applicability in the Nigerian setting.\n",
      "Practical Implications\n",
      "The present study has some implications for organisational practices. Direct and simple effect statistics revealed that work-life balance and social competence were positively associated with employee psychological well-being. Both work-life balance and social competence independently and collectively have the potential to trigger employee psychological well-being.\n",
      "Psychological well-being is a highly sought-after employee experience associated with individual and organisational performance (Aryanti et al., 2020; Haddon, 2018; Harshitha & Senthil, 2021;\n",
      "Thevanes & Harikaran, 2020). Importantly, this study has implicated work-life balance and social competence in improving employee psychological well-being. Therefore, practitioners in public sector organisations are responsible for encouraging work-life balance and improving the social competence of their employees. Several organisational policies and procedures could lead to a work-life balance, while training and coaching could improve social competence. The effect size statistics revealed that social competence has tremendous potential to improve employee psychological well-being more than work-life balance. This observation for human resource professionals implies that social competence should be the option between work-life balance and social competence to improve employee psychological well-being. Simple slope statistics revealed that work-life balance positively correlates with employee psychological well-being. The interaction statistic shows that a low level of social competence strengthens the positive effect of work-life balance on employees' psychological well-being. The take-home message here for organisational practitioners is that the commitment to enhancing psychological well-being through work-life balance should have social competence deemphasised.\n",
      "LIMITATION & FURTHER RESEARCH\n",
      "Using a single source for data collection is a current limitation. Despite the precautions used in the study design, there is a chance that some common-method bias will affect the outcomes; as a result, future studies should include multi-source data (self-report and reports from others). This study's employee psychological well-being measure is limited to the idea's hedonic (pleasure) part.\n",
      "Future research should consider the hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of employee psychological well-being, as they might be accomplished using Ryff and Keyes's (1995) psychological well-being model, a predictor, a moderator, and a criterion variable from the study's conceptual framework.\n",
      "The framework is simple and could be considered underspecified, despite controlling several demographic variables. As a result, for future research, more inclusive models in terms of variables are recommended. The employees of government-owned companies make up most of the study sample. Similar studies should be conducted among private sector personnel for comparison.\n",

      "This paper has discussed the concept and practice of social inclusion policy in Australia from a critical standpoint where substantial differences are seen to exist between multi‐dimensional government pronouncements on social inclusion‐exclusion and a rather more narrow emphasis on paid employment in major social policy initiatives. What we have argued is that the social inclusion policy agenda pursued by the previous ALP Government failed to escape the moral imperative around paid employment enshrined in the institutional legacy of the exclusionary tendencies within the ‘male wage earner’s welfare state’ (Bryson 1992: 89). As such the policy agenda is likely to have suffered from similar shortcomings and unequal outcomes, particularly for women, Indigenous Australians, low‐skilled workers, and the long‐term unemployed. It is too early to tell whether the National Disability Insurance Scheme, paid maternity leave, and school education reforms will mute the productivist paradigm. At this stage, our assessment is that despite much initial fanfare about the social inclusion policy agenda, the policy frames and reforms introduced during this period were often a case of old wine in new bottles.\n",
      "In part, this critical account highlights the importance of the connection between politics, public administration, and policy outcomes. Unlike the UK, Australia did not embed social inclusion targets in all federal government departments and the now defunct Social Inclusion Board was not central to social policy decision making (Saunders 2013). And despite some sophisticated developments in social and economic indicators of disadvantage, the social inclusion policy agenda did not fully embrace the multiple dimensions of exclusion/inclusion put forward by researchers. All of this is not to say that the ‘weak’ policy discourse of social inclusion could not be refashioned into a framework that has the analytical and practical capacity to address the structural inequalities that create and contribute to various forms of social and economic marginalisation. First, we need more public debate and deliberation about the quality and depth of inclusion that acknowledges the harsh realities of the working poor who ‘earn’ their poverty with multiple low‐paid and insecure jobs (Novak 1997). In a labour market with a significant share of casual and insecure work, it is income that is in fact the key material measure of inclusion, not whether someone has a paid job. However, even this recognition does not get us far enough in acknowledging the important role that non‐market forms of inclusion play in creating the conditions for security and human flourishing.\n",
      "Refurbishing a connected and embedded model of social citizenship and social justice is a worthwhile aim as it acknowledges the dialectical relationship between political and social rights (Scott 2006). Addressing social inequality requires clarifying value debates, mobilising collective agents, and expanding opportunities for voice in the public polity. This in turn will help to define and shape a form of citizenship that is authentically connected to social, cultural and economic modes of participation, not a model whereby people are forced into being one‐ dimensional ‘responsibilised risk managers’ in a narrowly defined ‘job holder’ society. In contrast, the social citizenship and social justice envisaged here is, as Tilly (1999: 56) notes,\n",
      "‘thick’ in terms of rights and equal status – as opposed to ‘thin’ citizenship, loaded with responsibilities and conditional allowances.\n",
      "Constructing and implementing a vision for a more inclusive society requires acknowledging the contradictions of the present, such as the way in which the welfare state is both an enabling and disabling political‐economic force and the fact that in cultural terms ‘included’ groups have always required ‘excluded’ groups in order to defend social norms that preserve established economic interests. We also need to acknowledge that conflict, inequality and competition are integral features of capitalist economies. These structural dynamics cannot be wished away by weak social inclusion talk that both reflects and reinforces unquestioned truths. We need policy metaphors and research that is able to sharpen, rather than blunt social realities in order to transcend the present and envision what Erik Olin Wright (2010) calls ‘real utopias’, which means not only articulating the architecture of a fairer future, but also developing a more fully fledged social diagnosis of problems in the present.\n",
      "Notes\n",
      "1 Rhetorical claims about passive welfare have been greatly exaggerated; given that the receipt of benefits in countries with highly ‘targeted’ income support policies have always had an element of conditionality (Marston, 2008). What has changed in the past two decades, in Australia and the UK, is the linking of conditionality to broadly defined ‘activities’, rather than to a specific work test.\n",
