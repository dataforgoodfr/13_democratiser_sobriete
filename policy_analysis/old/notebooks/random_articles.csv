Investigation on Combined Inhalation Exposure Scenarios to Biocidal Mixtures: Biocidal and Household Chemical Products in South Korea,"Global regulations of biocides have been continuously enhanced for protecting human health and the environment from potentially harmful biocidal products. Such regulations consider the combined toxicity caused by mixture components in a biocidal product of which approval and authorization are to be enhanced. Although the combined exposure scenarios of components in mixtures are firstly needed to conduct the mixture risk assessment, systematic combined exposure scenarios are still lacking. In this study, combined inhalation exposure scenarios of biocides in household chemical and biocidal products marketed in South Korea were investigated based on the European Union (EU) and Korean chemical product databases and various data sources integration. The information of 1058 biocidal products and 675 household chemical products that are likely to cause inhalation exposure with two or more biocides was collected, and mixture combination patterns were investigated. Binary mixtures occupied 72% in biocidal products. The most frequently appearing binary mixture was phthalthrin and d-phenothrin. Based on the frequency of use, we suggested a priority list of biocide mixture combinations which need to be firstly evaluated for identifying their combined toxicity for the mixture risk assessment. This study highlights that the derived combined inhalation exposure scenarios can support and facilitate further studies on priority settings for mixture risk assessment and management of potentially inhalable biocides.","['Manufacturing', 'Household employment, goods/services for own use']",2021,10.3390/toxics9020032,
PI制御器による分散型電源の負荷追従制御,"Recently, there has been growing interest in utilizing dispersed generation systems, which are grouped into micro turbine systems, co-generation systems, etc., as a substitute for fuel oil energy and a technology to prevent a global warming. Since start-up time of dispersed generation systems is short, it is possible to operate systems to supply load power corresponding to a demand. Moreover, PPS(Power Producer and Supplier) can participate in power retail sales company, since deregulation of electric utilities has been started from 2000. However, PPS have to keep instantaneous generating power commissioning rule, to maintain supply and demand balance between customer and supplier. Therefore, in this paper, we examine instantaneous generating power commissioning for dispersed generators that start-up time is short and is possible to operate systems to supply power load corresponding to a demand. We adopt a PI controller as a controller. The system is composed of double control loop in inner loop and in outer loop. In inner loop electric power are controlled and in outer loop electric energy are controlled. The controller parameters are designed with using the pole-placement technique. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is confirmed by simulations.","['Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning']",2002,,
Multi-level effects of human resource bundles on the performance of aging employees,"Previously, scholars have studied the need for implementing different human resource (HR) configurations that foster aging employees' outcomes, but there is a lack of evidence at the group level. Using the framework of Social Exchange Theory, coupled with the Selection, Optimization, and Compensation theory, we examine associations between bundles of HR practices, age (measured both as calendar age and proportion of an aging workforce), and performance, at both the individual and group levels. First, the outcomes of our multi-level analysis show that bundles of maintenance-enhancing HR practices are positively related to performance at both levels, whereas bundles of growth-enhancing HR practices associate with performance only at the group level. Second, age relates positively to performance, both at the individual and group levels. At the group level, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the proportion of an aging workforce and group performance, such that a group's performance benefits from the participation of older employees up to a maximum proportion of 56%. Finally, age negatively moderates the association between growth-enhancing HR bundles and performance at both the individual and group levels. Results highlight the value of older employees for working organizations, and the importance of adopting HR practices that consider maintenance and growth-related needs across the life-span, while also providing useful theoretical and practical implications for Human Resource Development scholars and professionals.","['Professional, scientific, technical services']",2024,10.1002/hrdq.21501,
IT2 Fuzzy-Based Multidimensional Evaluation of Coal Energy for Sustainable Economic Development,"The aim of this study is to determine the impact of coal energy on the economic development of countries. For this purpose, similar studies in the literature have been examined and nine different criteria have been determined for three dimensions affecting the use of coal energy. In order to determine the most important factors, an analysis is performed with IT2 fuzzy DANP method. The most important contribution of this study to the literature is that a proposal can be made for the use of coal energy by considering both positive and negative opinions related to this energy. On the other hand, IT2 fuzzy DANP method has been taken into consideration in this study for the first-time regarding coal energy and it is believed that methodological originality has been achieved. It is identified that social factors have the most importance in the use of coal energy. In this context, environmental pollution, health problems and demographic factors resulting from the use of coal energy should be taken into consideration in the use of this energy. Thus, problems arising from the use of coal energy far outweigh the economic benefits of using this energy. Therefore, factors that may prevent air pollution, such as carbon capture technology, should be considered in the use of coal energy. In addition, the use of high-quality coal will contribute to the reduction of the problems caused with this energy. In addition, investing in renewable energy sources that do not have negative impacts on the environment is also important for the sustainability of future energy policies.","['Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning', 'Mining and quarrying']",2020,10.3390/en13102453,
"Optimal Design and Performance Analysis of a Hybrid Off-Grid Renewable Power System Considering Different Component Scheduling, PV Modules, and Solar Tracking Systems","The concept of introducing hybrid off-grid systems has made electricity accessible to areas that are far or have no access to grid network. This paper evaluates the techno-economic and environmental characteristics of a hybrid renewable energy system considering three different scheduling approaches, four different solar tracking systems, two different PV modules and eight scheduling scenarios to supply sustainable electricity to a rural community in Sierra Leone. Each scenario consists of a solar tracking system, a specific type of PV module and a scheduling approach. The aim is to find the most efficient and cost-effective scenario that meets the electrical demands of the village. Results revealed that the 'Two axis tracking system' generated the highest PV power, 28.8% additional power compared to the 'No tracking system' confirming the superiority of using a tracking system though it comes with initial cost repercussions. Also, systems that employed the use of Canadiasolar Dymond CS6K-285M-FG PV module tend to be more efficient and cost-effective than those that employed Sharp ND-250QCS PV module even with the same solar tracking technology and scheduling approach. From the best scheduling approach (third scheduling), Scenario 7 (SC#7) gives the lowest net present cost (NPC) of $1.53M with $0.173/kWh cost of energy (COE) and CO 2 emission of 8.54 kg/yr making it the optimum scenario. A daily operation of the optimum scenario on both a sunny and rainy day confirms that the system is capable of supplying the required electricity for both rainy and dry seasons. Sensitivity analyses explain the high reliance of the system cost on the erratic inflation rate, discount rate and PV derating factor. Maintaining a healthy and sustainable environment depends on the minimum load ratio of both the biogas and diesel generators.","['Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning']",2021,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3075732,
Nuclear Power Plant Location Selection in Vietnam under Fuzzy Environment Conditions,"The demands for energy in general and electrical power in particular in the process of industrialization–modernization in Vietnam are increasing. Although other renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power have been prioritized, they cannot compensate for the shortages of electricity in Vietnam; moreover, traditional energy sources in Vietnam are not endless and will soon reach exhaustion. Nowadays, the government has chosen a solution to maximize domestic energy resources, i.e., develop renewable energy combined with importing coal and gas in appropriate proportions with the construction of nuclear power plants (NPP), which may be the optimal solution to ensure energy security, environmental protection, and sustainable development. However, site selection for construction of a nuclear power plant is one of the most difficult decisions that management faces. Thus, the authors proposed multicriteria decision-making (MCDM), including a fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) and technique for order preference by similarity of an ideal solution (TOPSIS) for NPP location selection in Vietnam. In the first stages of this research, the weight of all criteria and subcriteria will be calculated by an ANP model using fuzzy logic. A TOPSIS model is proposed for ranking all potential locations in the final stage. The results reveal that Binh Thuan is the best place for building an NPP in Vietnam. The contributions of this research include a fuzzy multicriteria decision-making (F-MCDM) approach for NPP site selection in Vietnam. This research also utilizes the evolution of a new approach that is flexible and practical for the decision-maker and provides useful guidelines for NPP site selection in countries around the world.","['Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning']",2018,10.3390/sym10110548,
Instrumental social support for the rural elderly: study of a rural block of a costal district of Odisha,"India witnesses an increasing trend of growth in the number and proportion of elderly population (age 60 and above). The absolute number had reached over 103 million (8.58 percent of the total population) and it is expected to go up to 173 million by the year 2026 and is projected to touch 324 million by the year 2050. Odisha also registers a similar pattern of demographic shift in the elderly population. The number of elderly population in the state of Odisha was 2.281 million in 1991 (7.23 percent); 3.04 million (8.26 percent) in 2001 and 3.98 million (9.49 percent) in 2011. As per the Census 2011, a majority of the elderly persons of the state, 3.44 million, constituting 86.33 percent of the total elderly live in the rural Odisha. The increase in the number and proportion of senior citizens is accompanied with higher old age dependency, higher sense of insecurity, higher disease and disability burden with inadequate public health care facilities. The old age dependency ratio in India has increased from 12.19 percent in 1991 to 13.08 percent in 2001, and finally to 14.23 percent in 2011. If one compares the figure of Odisha the percentage are 12.74 (1991), 14.14 (2001) and 15.45 (2011), respectively, which is higher than the national average. This has important implications for the quality of life and healthcare of the elderly at the household level.",['Health and social work'],2017,10.18203/2394-6040.ijcmph20172818,
COMPARISON OF INVESTMENT FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS WITH GRAVITY AND PUMPING SYSTEMS AT SPAM IKK MOTHER WEST HALMAHERA DISTRICT,"Water is a basic need for all living things on this earth, not least for individual humans themselves, that water is the support of daily activities for human survival. The average household water usage in Indonesia is 60 liters per day per person or 45% of the total usage is for drinking, cooking, washing clothes, cleaning houses and vehicles and performing worship. Kecamatan Ibu has a population of 12. 241 people who have not been covered by access to drinking water in the West Halmahera Regency area, but have a Drinking Water Supply System (SPAM) for the Sub-district Capital (IKK) which was built in 2004 supplying 700 house connections (SR) in 2 villages, namely; Maritango Village and Akeboso Village which is taken from Akeboso Spring of 20 L/Det, Since 2017 SPAM IKK Ibu has not functioned due to damage to the piping network due to road widening work, damage to generators and pumps, in this study the authors will analyze the feasibility of investment for 9 villages that will get water with a total population of 1. 102 people by estimating the Budget Plan Cost (RAB) using the PermenPU No. 1 of 2022 guidelines and calculating investment feasibility by calculating Net Present Value (NPV), Internal of Return (IRR), Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) and Payback Period (PP) and the results obtained in the gravity system have a greater investment value of Rp 13,524,301,000 compared to the pumping system which is Rp 11,919,456,000 from the calculation of the Budget Plan Cost (RAB).","['Water, sewerage, waste']",2023,,
Optimal Load Shedding for Maximizing Satisfaction in an Islanded Microgrid,"A microgrid (MG) is a discrete energy system that can operate either in parallel with or independently from a main power grid. It is designed to enhance reliability, carbon emission reduction, diversification of energy sources, and cost reduction. When a power fault occurs in a grid, an MG operates in an islanded manner from the grid and protects its power generations and loads from disturbance by means of intelligent load shedding. A load shedding is a control procedure that results in autonomous decrease of the power demands of loads in an MG. In this study, we propose a load shedding algorithm for the optimization problem to maximize the satisfaction of system components. The proposed algorithm preferentially assigns the power to the subdemand with a high preference to maximize the satisfaction of power consumers. In addition, the algorithm assigns the power to maximize the power sale and minimize the power surplus for satisfaction of power suppliers. To verify the performance of our algorithm, we implement a multi-agent system (MAS) on top of a conventional development framework and assess the algorithm's adaptability, satisfaction metric, and running time.","['Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning']",2017,10.3390/en10010045,
Control strategy of a novel energy recovery system for parallel hybrid hydraulic excavator,"With the high fuel prices, the demands for energy saving and green emission of engineering machinery have been increased rapidly. Due to the complex working condition and frequent load changing, the efficiency of the hydraulic excavator is low. The aim of this article is to propose a control strategy for energy recovery system of hydraulic excavator driven by the parallel hybrid system. The mathematical models of the main components and the simulation models of the proposed system and a conventional energy recovery system are built. Then, according to the load characteristic, a control strategy based on the working condition and state of charge of the battery is given. The co-simulation for the hybrid hydraulic excavator system is established. The results show that the proposed energy recovery system and control strategy can not only improve the energy recovery efficiency but also reduce fuel consumption and emission of the power system.","['Construction', 'Manufacturing']",2015,10.1177/1687814015613769,
A Conceptual Framework to Understand the Dynamics of Rural–Urban Linkages for Rural Flood Vulnerability,"Rural areas are highly vulnerable to floods due to limited social, economic, and physical resources. Understanding rural vulnerability is vital for developing effective disaster risk reduction strategies. Even though rural areas and cities are intrinsically linked, rural vulnerability was assessed without considering its relation to cities. Numerous theoretical frameworks on systemizing and assessing vulnerability were developed with varying level of scope and depth in terms of scale, dimensions, and components. Nevertheless, these frameworks did not explicitly mention the impact of flood or other hazards on the linkages between spatial units i.e., rural and urban. This study aims to understand and conceptualize the rural vulnerability with respect to the dynamics of rural–urban linkages in the case of flood events. To do so, current literature on rural–urban linkages, vulnerability, as well as factors that influence them were critically reviewed. Taking into account the main elements of rural–urban linkages (flow of people, information, finances, goods and services), components of vulnerability (exposure, susceptibility, and capacity), and factors (social, economic, institutional, infrastructural, spatial, and environmental), a unified framework is proposed. The framework underscores that the role of rural–urban linkages is essential to fully understand rural flood vulnerability. Moreover, the framework highlights the role of spatial factors—city size and proximity to the city—as crucial to comprehend rural vulnerability. This framework can be used as a tool for understanding multifaceted rural vulnerability for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction considering spatial development perspective. In this context, empirical investigations can be made to validate the proposed framework and policies can be introduced accordingly. Overall, the proposed framework can help recognize concepts and links of vulnerability, rural–urban dependencies, and rural development dynamics.","['Agriculture, forestry, fishing', 'Public administration, defence, social security', 'Education', 'Health and social work']",2020,10.3390/su12072894,

Forward optimization of integrated energy system scheduling considering economy and environment,"Given the finite nature of fossil fuels and their adverse environmental impacts, establishing a new sustainable energy system has become an urgent issue today. In order to reduce the carbon emissions of integrated energy systems(IES) and optimize the operational costs, this paper proposes an optimized scheduling of comprehensive energy systems considering both economic and environmental factors to meet the demand for renewable energy generation regulation and improve energy utilization efficiency. In the paper, a comprehensive demand response model of user energy consumption behavior is first constructed to ensure the safe operation of the power system. Based on this model, a joint operation model of Power-to-Gas (P2G) and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) systems, as well as operational constraints of natural gas and hydrogen mixed P2G devices, are considered. By introducing a carbon trading mechanism and minimizing total costs as the objective, a day-ahead low-carbon economic scheduling model for the system is established. To address the uncertainty of customer demand response, robust optimization theory is adopted, and the problem is reformulated as a linear programming problem using duality theory for solution using commercial solvers. Simulation results demonstrate that this scheduling strategy can improve the economic benefits of power plants while reducing renewable energy consumption and power plant risks, promoting the sustainable development of integrated energy systems.","['Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning']",2024,10.21203/rs.3.rs-4323084/v1,
Modelling the management of an invasive species at landscape scale: are oral contraceptives the missing ingredient for success?,"Context. Invasive non-native species are on the rise worldwide, exacerbating already significant environmental and economic impacts. Concurrently, public attitudes towards methods of controlling these species are changing, with greater demand for non-lethal solutions. This has fostered research into developing new, effective technologies and strategies for wildlife management. Aims. On the basis of a case study focusing on the eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) in the UK, this study aimed to understand the potential for population management, using either live trapping or oral contraception. First, assuming completely coordinated landscape-scale control, and then, coordinated control only on parts of the landscape, accounting for the potential that landowners' attitudes towards alternative methods may differ and reflect those of the wider public. Methods. We used an existing spatially explicit individual-based modelling approach applying various parameterisations to define management. We varied the density of traps or hoppers delivering contraceptives, the duration of deployment, contraceptive efficacy, initial population size, and the probability of landowner participation. The latter was based on a previous public survey, suggesting that 40% of the respondents were open to management using trapping and 64% to using contraception. Key results. With complete coordinated control, trapping was generally faster and more cost-effective than was contraception. However, when differences in social acceptance were considered, reducing participation and, consequently, the spatial coverage of management, contraception was found to maintain greater population reductions than was trapping with similar effort, assuming a contraceptive efficacy of 75% or higher. Conclusions. This study added another layer of complexity to managing invasive non-native species, namely the potential effect that landowners' attitudes to different methods of population management might have on the level of coordinated control at landscape scale. In a situation such as the one modelled by this study, where management is not a legal requirement, this human dimension must be considered alongside cost-effectiveness, to develop successful control in line with management goals. Implications. Further work is required to establish the actual attitudes of landowners, and in different contexts (e.g. urban, rural areas), how this may change as new approaches become available, and then how spatial variation (clustering) in the resulting wildlife population control may affect outcomes.","['Agriculture, forestry, fishing']",2024,10.1071/WR22194,
Assessing the Spatiotemporal Patterns and Impacts of Droughts in the Orinoco River Basin Using Earth Observations Data and Surface Observations,"Droughts impact the water cycle, ecological balance, and socio-economic development in various regions around the world. The Orinoco River Basin is a region highly susceptible to droughts. The basin supports diverse ecosystems and supplies valuable resources to local communities. We assess the spatiotemporal patterns and impacts of droughts in the basin using remote sensing data and surface observations. We use monthly precipitation (P), air temperature near the surface (T2M), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from Earth observations, and average daily flow (Q) data to quantify drought characteristics and impacts. We also investigated the association between drought and global warming by correlating the drought intensity and the percentage of dry area with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Pacific (Niño 3.4 index), Atlantic (North Atlantic Index [NATL]), and South Atlantic Index [SATL]) oceans. We evaluate the modulating effect of droughts on the hydrological regime of the most relevant tributaries by calculating the trend and significance of the regional standardized precipitation index (SPI) and percentage area affected by dry conditions. El Niño events worsen the region's drought conditions (SPI vs. Niño 3.4 index, r = −0.221), while Atlantic SST variability has less influence on the basin's precipitation regime (SPI vs. NATL and SATL, r = 0.117 and −0.045, respectively). We also found that long-term surface warming trends aggravate drought conditions (SPI vs. T2M anomalies, r = −0.473), but vegetation greenness increases despite high surface temperatures (SPI vs. EVI anomalies, r = 0.284). We emphasize the irregular spatial-temporal patterns of droughts in the region and their profound effects on the ecological flow of rivers during prolonged hydrological droughts. This approach provides crucial insights into potential implications for water availability, agricultural productivity, and overall ecosystem health. Our study underlines the urgent need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of droughts on ecosystems and human populations. The insights derived from our study have practical implications for developing strategies to address the impacts of droughts and ensure the protection of this ecologically significant region.","['Agriculture, forestry, fishing', 'Water, sewerage, waste']",2023,10.3390/hydrology10100195,
"Soil respiration across a variety of tree-covered urban green spaces in Helsinki, Finland","As an increasing share of the human population is being clustered in cities, urban areas have swiftly become the epicentres of anthropogenic carbon (C) emissions. Understanding different parts of the biogenic C cycle in urban ecosystems is needed in order to assess the potential of enhancing their C stocks as a cost-efficient means to balance the C emissions and mitigate climate change. Here, we conducted a field measurement campaign over three consecutive growing seasons to examine soil respiration carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at four measurement sites in Helsinki representing different types of tree-covered urban green space commonly found in northern European cities. We expected to find variation in the main drivers of soil respiration – soil temperature, soil moisture, and SOC – as a result of the heterogeneity of urban landscape, and that this variation would be reflected in the measured soil respiration rates. In the end, we could see fairly constant statistically significant differences between the sites in terms of soil temperature but only sporadic and seemingly momentary differences in soil moisture and soil respiration. There were also statistically significant differences in SOC stocks: the highest SOC stock was found in inactively managed deciduous urban forest and the lowest under managed streetside lawn with common linden trees. We studied the impacts of the urban heat island (UHI) effect and irrigation on heterotrophic soil respiration with process-based model simulations, and found that the variation created by the UHI is relatively minor compared to the increase associated with active irrigation, especially during dry summers. We conclude that, within our study area, the observed variation in soil temperature alone was not enough to cause variation in soil respiration rates between the studied green space types, perhaps because the soil moisture conditions were uniform. Thus, irrigation could potentially be a key factor in altering the soil respiration dynamics in urban green space both within the urban area and in comparison to non-urban ecosystems.","['Public administration, defence, social security']",2024,10.5194/egusphere-2023-3031,
"Seasonal changes in the behaviour and respiration physiology of the freshwater duck mussel, Anodonta anatina","For low-energy organisms such as bivalves, the costs of thermal compensation of biological rates (synonymous with acclimation or acclimatization) may be higher than the benefits. We therefore conducted two experiments to examine the effect of seasonal temperature changes on behaviour and oxygen consumption. In the first experiment, we examined the effects of seasonal temperature changes on the freshwater bivalve Anodonta anatina, taking measurements each month for a year at the corresponding temperature for that time of year. There was no evidence for compensation of burrowing valve closure duration or frequency, or locomotory speed. In the second experiment, we compared A. anatina at summer and winter temperatures (24 and 4°C, respectively) and found no evidence for compensation of the burrowing rate, valve closure duration or frequency, or oxygen consumption rates during burrowing, immediately after valve closure or at rest. Within the experimental limits of this study, the evidence suggests that thermal compensation of biological rates is not a strategy employed by A. anatina. We argue that this is due to either a lack of evolutionary pressure to acclimatize, or evolutionary pressure to not acclimatize. Firstly, there is little incentive to increase metabolic rate to enhance predatory ability given that these are filter feeders. Secondly, maintained low energetic demand, enhanced at winter temperatures, is essential for predator avoidance, i.e. valve closure. Thus, we suggest that the costs of acclimatization outweigh the benefits in A. anatina.","['Agriculture, forestry, fishing']",2014,10.1242/jeb.093450,

"Education and Self-Reported Health: Evidence from 23 Countries on the Role of Years of Schooling, Cognitive Skills and Social Capital","We examine the contribution of human capital to health in 23 countries worldwide using the OECD Survey of Adult Skills, a unique large-scale international assessment of 16-65 year olds that contains information about self-reported health, schooling, cognitive skills and indicators of interpersonal trust, which represents the cognitive dimension of social capital. We identify cross-national differences in education, skill and social capital gradients in self-reported health and explore the interaction between human capital and social capital to examine if and where social capital is a mediator or a moderator of years of schooling and cognitive abilities. We find large education gaps in self-reported health across all countries in our sample and a strong positive relationship between self-reported health and both literacy and trust in the majority of countries. Education and skill gradients in self-reported health appear to be largest in the United States and smallest in Italy, France, Sweden and Finland. On average around 5.5% of both the schooling gap in self-reported health and the literacy gap in self-reported health can be explained by the higher levels of interpersonal trust that better educated/more skilled individuals have, although the mediating role of trust varies considerably across countries. We find no evidence of a moderation effect: the relationships between health and years of schooling and health and cognitive skills are similar among individuals with different levels of trust.","['Health and social work', 'Education']",2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0149716,
Anorectal Function and Quality of Life in Patients with Early Stage Rectal Cancer Treated with Chemoradiation and Local Excision,"Background— Little is known about anorectal function and quality of life after chemoradiation followed by local excision, which is an alternative to total mesorectal excision for selected early rectal cancer patients. Objective— Prospectively assess anorectal function and health-related quality of life of T2N0 rectal cancer patients treated with an alternative approach Design— Prospective phase II trial Settings— Multicentric study (ACOSOG trial Z6041) Interventions— Patients with stage cT2N0 rectal adenocarcinomas were treated with an oxaliplatin/capecitabine-based chemoradiation regimen followed by local excision. Main Outcome Measure— Anorectal function and quality of life were assessed at enrollment and 1 year postoperatively with the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life scale and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal questionnaire. Results were compared, and multivariable analysis was performed to identify predictors of outcome. Results— Seventy-one (98%) patients were evaluated at enrollment and 66 (92%) at 1 year. Compared to baseline, no significant differences were found on Fecal Incontinence Severity Index scores at 1 year. Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life results were significantly worse in the lifestyle (p<0.001), coping/behavior (p<0.001) and embarrassment (p=0.002) domains. There were no differences in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy overall score, but the physical well-being subscale was significantly worse and emotional well-being was improved after surgery. Treatment with the original chemoradiation regimen predicted worse depression/self-perception and embarrassment scores in the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life, and male sex was predictive of worse scores in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy overall score and trial outcome index. Limitations— Small sample size, relatively short follow-up and absence of information before cancer diagnosis. Conclusion— Chemoradiation followed by local excision had minimal impact on anorectal function 1 year after surgery. Overall quality of life remained stable, with mixed effects on different subscales. This information should be used to counsel patients about expected outcomes.",['Health and social work'],2017,10.1097/DCR.0000000000000758,
Environmental evaluation of high-value agricultural produce with diverse water sources: case study from Southern California,"Meeting agricultural demand in the face of a changing climate will be one of the major challenges of the 21st century. California is the single largest agricultural producer in the United States but is prone to extreme hydrologic events, including multi-year droughts. Ventura County is one of California's most productive growing regions but faces water shortages and deteriorating water quality. The future of California's agriculture is dependent on our ability to identify and implement alternative irrigation water sources and technologies. Two such alternative water sources are recycled and desalinated water. The proximity of high-value crops in Ventura County to both dense population centers and the Pacific Ocean makes it a prime candidate for alternative water sources. This study uses highly localized spatial and temporal data to assess life-cycle energy use, life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, operational costs, applied water demand, and on-farm labor requirements for four high-value crops.","['Agriculture, forestry, fishing']",2018,10.1088/1748-9326/aaa49a,
Oxygen Demand Forecasting and Optimal Scheduling of the Oxygen Gas Systems in Iron- and Steel-Making Enterprises,"Due to the imbalance between the supply and demand of oxygen, the oxygen systems of iron- and steel-making enterprises in China have problems with high oxygen emissions and high pressure in the pipelines, resulting in the energy consumption of oxygen production being high. To reduce the energy consumption of oxygen systems, this study took a large-scale iron- and steel-making enterprise as a case study and developed a two-stage forecasting and scheduling model. The novel aspect and progressiveness of this work are as follows: First, an oxygen demand forecasting model was developed based on the backpropagation neural network with genetic algorithm optimization (GABP) and is driven only by historical data. Compared with some complex models in the literature, although the accuracy of this model has been reduced, the model does not need to consider production plans for other process steps, making it more practical and feasible. Second, different from the existing literature, an oxygen production scheduling model was developed for load-variable ASUs with an internal compression process, and both the oxygen emissions and pipeline pressure are included in the objective function. The case study showed that based on the oxygen demand forecast and optimal scheduling, the oxygen emissions and pipeline pressure in the studied iron- and steel-making enterprise can be significantly reduced, thereby achieving considerable energy-saving effects and economic benefits. Specifically, the following conclusions were obtained: (1) For the oxygen demand forecast, the prediction accuracy of the GABP model was better than that of the ARIMA model. The average MAPE of the 12 sets of data of the ARIMA and GABP models was 23.8% and 20.2%, respectively. (2) By comparing the scheduling results and the field data, it was found that after scheduling, the amount of oxygen emissions decreased by 6.32%, the pipeline pressure decreased by 0.61%, and the energy consumption of oxygen compression decreased by 1.6%. Considering both the oxygen emission loss and the energy consumption of oxygen compression, the total power consumption of the studied oxygen system was reduced by 1.38%, resulting in electricity cost savings of approximately 9.03 million RMB per year.",['Manufacturing'],2023,10.3390/app132111618,
Short-term health co-benefits of existing climate policies: the need for more ambitious and integrated policy action,"Climate change and air pollution are two interconnected major risks for human health. The sources of greenhouse gases—namely, the combustion of fossil fuels—are the main sources of harmful air pollution. The literature has extensively analysed the health co-benefits of lowered air pollution associated with alternative decarbonisation strategies. However, these studies have been focused on stylised or cost-optimal scenarios with long-term optimistic and uncertain assumptions about future mitigation efforts. The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow increased the ambition for the 2030 emission reduction targets compared with the 2015 pledges, and several countries presented their commitment to achieve net zero emissions by the second half of the century. Nevertheless, there are several alternative strategies to achieve net zero economies, which would result in very different emission pathways.","['Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning', 'Manufacturing', 'Transport and storage']",2023,10.1016/S2542-5196(23)00106-8,
The development of inflow discharge for the karian multipurpose reservoir in the pursuit of reservoir management optimization,"Climate change and land cover modifications result in alterations in hydrological regimes. The demand for water and electrical energy continually rises along with population growth. Consequently, optimizing the Karian Multipurpose Reservoir (Hydroelectric Exploitation) operation requires considering hydrological regime changes. The Karian multipurpose reservoir is designed to meet water needs in Banten Province. The strategic policy for the Reservoir is to provide raw water at a rate of 14.6 m3/s. Of this, 9.1 m3/s is diverted to Tangerang Regency, and 5.5 m3/s is directed to Serang City through Ciujung River. Before being released into the Ciujung River, a flow of 5.5 m3/s is channeled through turbines to generate 1.8 MW of electricity. This study compares two models for estimating discharge to support Karian Reservoir management: (1) The Rainfall Conversion Ratio (CR) and Catchment Area, and (2) The Continuous model. The Rainfall CR and Catchment Area has a correlation value of 0.523 with CR KOICA, Absolute Relative Error (ARE) of 0.54, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 10.61. Meanwhile, the continuous model has a correlation value of 0.877 with CR KOICA, ARE of 0.18, and RMSE of 3.64. The results indicate the continuous model is the most effective in estimating input discharge.","['Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning', 'Water, sewerage, waste']",2024,10.1051/e3sconf/202448504009,

Exploring the effect of inclusive leadership on psychological distress through organizational climate mediation and moderation,"A new leadership approach called inclusive leadership has emerged in response to today's crises and disasters used by different organizations. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the effectiveness of inclusive leadership and organizational climate in reducing the widespread prevalence of this symptom among 423 secondary school teachers. Field research data collection was manually analysed using the International Business Machine-Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM-SPSS) with moment structure (AMOS) analysis and Jamovi software. The results of the inclusive leadership study are significantly related to organizational climate. The organizational climate is significantly and inversely related to psychological distress. The relationship between inclusive leadership and psychological distress was found to be positive but not significant. Nevertheless, organizational climate fully mediates the relationship between inclusive leadership and psychological distress. However, organizational climate has partially moderated the relationship between inclusive leadership and psychological distress. The study is beneficial to organizational leaders especially the ministry of education and school principals who face diverse secondary school teachers. Finally, it contributes to the development of leadership, management and psychology.",['Education'],2024,10.18488/73.v12i2.3787,

Smart Building Energy Management using Nonlinear Economic Model Predictive Control,"Owing to the call for energy efficiency, the need to optimize the energy consumption of commercial buildings–responsible for over 40% of US energy consumption–has recently gained significant attention. Moreover, the ability to participate in the retail electricity markets through proactive demand-side participation has recently led to development of economic model predictive control (EMPC) for building's Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. The objective of this paper is to develop a price-sensitive operational model for building's HVAC systems while considering inflexible loads and other distributed energy resources (DERs) such as photovoltaic (PV) generation and battery storage for the buildings. A Nonlinear Economic Model Predictive Controller (NL-EMPC) is presented to minimize the net cost of energy usage by building's HVAC system while satisfying the comfort-level of building's occupants. The efficiency of the proposed NL-EMPC controller is evaluated using several simulation case studies.","['Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning']",2019,,
MEDICAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF FLOODS AND THEIR MEDICAL RISK MANAGEMENT,"Currently, there is a steadily increasing trend in losses due to flooding. Nevertheless, global warming, followed by an inevitable overuse of river valleys might further contribute to an increase in the frequency and destructive power of floods. It is quite important to trace the cause and effect chain of the economic, social and ecological impacts during the flood hazard. A bibliographic research was carried out by using historical and descriptive methods based on the keywords, underlining the medical, social and economic significance of the present issue. There are 57 natural lakes and about 3 400 artificial water reservoirs found on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, including 90 amounting to over 1 million m³ per each. The accumulation basins help in preventing and combating overflows and flooding during spring and summer periods. Most of the dams do not comply with the technical norms, as they do not have channels of respite and drainage, thus, a dam failure on top dike might generate the collapse of the others at the lower watercourse, resulting in disastrous consequences. Therefore, individual health protection measures and appropriate population behavior are vitally important in catastrophic floods. Over the last decades, the floods occurring in the Republic of Moldova have conditioned the need to increase interventions for prevention and reduction of both economic and human losses both at national and international levels.","['Water, sewerage, waste', 'Public administration, defence, social security', 'Health and social work']",2020,10.5281/zenodo.3701200,
The Price Elasticity of Natural Gas Demand in China: A Meta-Regression Analysis,"Since natural gas has become a new star in China's energy mix, a reliable estimation of the price elasticity of natural gas demand is crucial if we are to understand how energy price changes affect natural gas consumption. In this paper, we conduct a Meta-regression analysis to quantitatively synthesize empirical estimates of the price elasticity of natural gas demand reported in previous studies, provide true underlying values, and explain the heterogeneity of the aforementioned estimates. The Fixed-effects model and ordinary least squares (OLS) are applied to estimate the regression models. As a result, this paper reports a mean elasticity of −1.521 and 0.410 for the short- and long-run own-price elasticity, separately; −0.762 and 0.008 for the short- and long-run cross-price elasticity-coal to natural gas, respectively; 2.122 and 1.884 for the short- and long-run cross-price elasticity-electricity to natural gas, separately; and 2.267 and 1.275 for the short- and long-run cross-price elasticity-oil to natural gas, respectively. Our results suggest that natural gas consumption increases with the decrease of its own and coal prices in the short term and rise of electricity and oil prices. It also shows that almost all heterogeneity can be explained by the type of data, sample period, models of analysis, geographical region, and type of consumer.","['Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning']",2018,10.3390/en11123255,
Estimated and forecasted trends in domain specific time-use and energy expenditure among adults in Russia,"Examination of historical trends and projections in estimated energy expenditure in Russia is important given the country's economic downturns and growth. Nationally representative data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) from 1995-2011 was used to determine the metabolic equivalents of task (MET)-hours per week from occupational, domestic, travel, and active leisure physical activity (PA) domains, as well as sedentary leisure time (hours per week) among adults 18-60 years. Additionally, we projected what these values would be like in 2020 and 2030 if observed trends continue. Among male adults, the largest contributor to total PA was occupational PA followed by travel PA. In contrast, domestic PA followed by occupational PA contributed most to total PA among female adults. Total PA was 282.9 MET-hours per week in 1995 and declined to 231.7 in 2011. Total PA is projected to decrease to 216.5 MET-hours per week in 2020 and to 193.0 MET-hours per week in 2030. The greatest relative declines are occurring in travel PA. Female adults are also exhibiting significant declines in domestic PA. Changes in occupational and active leisure PA are less distinct. Policies and initiatives are needed to counteract the long-term decline of overall physical activity linked with a modernizing lifestyle and economy among Russian adults.","['Public administration, defence, social security', 'Health and social work']",2014,,
Climate Impacts on Natural Capital: Consequences for the Social Cost of Carbon,"The effects of climate change on natural systems will be substantial, widespread, and likely irreversible. Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have already contributed to forest dieback and pushed some species toward extinction. Natural systems contribute to human welfare both as an input to the production of consumption goods and through the provision of nonuse values (i.e., existence and bequest values). But because they are often unpriced, it can be difficult to constrain these benefits. Understanding how climate change effects on the natural capital stock affect human well-being, and therefore the social cost of carbon (SCC), requires understanding not just the biophysical effects of climate change but also the particular role they play in supporting human welfare. This article reviews a range of topics from natural capital accounting through climate change economics important for quantifying the ecological costs of climate change and integrating these costs into SCC calculations.","['Agriculture, forestry, fishing', 'Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning', 'Water, sewerage, waste', 'Trade; vehicle and motorcycle repair', 'Transport and storage', 'Financial and insurance services', 'Professional, scientific, technical services', 'Public administration, defence, social security', 'Education', 'Health and social work']",2022,10.1146/annurev-resource-111820-020204,

"Gender and minority background as moderators of teacher expectation effects on self-concept, subjective task values, and academic performance","Two developments in teacher expectation research formed the basis for the current study. First, researchers have begun investigating the self-fulfilling prophecy effects of teacher expectations on a variety of psycho-social outcomes in addition to the effects on academic achievement. Second, researchers have started to realize that some groups of students appeared to be more vulnerable or susceptible to teacher expectations. The current study aimed to investigate whether students' gender and minority background were moderators of teacher expectation effects for both academic outcomes and self-concept and subjective task value in the mathematics domain. The study is based on a sample of 1663 students (Grades 6 and 7) in 42 classes from three intermediate schools in New Zealand. Multilevel modeling was applied using MLwiN software. First, after controlling for students' beginning-of-year mathematics achievement, teacher expectations were higher for Asian and lower for Māori, compared with New Zealand European students. Expectations within the domain of mathematics, however, were higher for girls than for boys. Second, teachers' beginning-year expectations were predictive of achievement and self-concept of students at end-of-year, after controlling for beginning-of-year achievement and self-concept. Teachers' expectations were, however, not predictive of end-of-year intrinsic and utility value. Third, we did not find evidence for moderation effects of students' gender and minority background. These findings imply that despite the roughly similar magnitude of teacher expectation effects for various student groups, teacher expectations may contribute to gaps in students' achievement and self-concept because of differential expectations at the beginning of the year.",['Education'],2023,10.1007/s10212-022-00650-9,
DESIGN OF SHAKE TABLE TESTS OF MULTI-LEAF MASONRY WALLS BEFORE AND AFTER RETROFITTING,"A significant proportion of the built heritage in historic centres is constituted by rubble stone masonry structures. Collapses by leaf separation and disaggregation observed after earthquakes highlight their dramatic vulnerability, especially under out-of-plane loads. Nevertheless, their dynamic response still needs to be fully investigated and their capacity may be overestimated by assessment approaches based on rigid-body mechanics. Effective retrofitting solutions are also needed to protect human lives and safeguard the built heritage, while ensuring the conservation of its architectural value. This paper describes the design of a shake table investigation on stone masonry walls, whose materials and arrangement reproduce those surveyed in the villages of central Italy struck by the 2016-2017 earthquake sequence. The test setup was conceived to induce out-of-plane vertical bending under earthquake base motion and investigate the dynamic response of multi-leaf rubble stone masonry and the gain in seismic capacity that can be achieved with mortar-based composite reinforcements, designed to prevent the leaf separation and disaggregation of the wall without compromising its fair face.",['Construction'],2020,,

Assessment of the impact of local energy policies in reducing greenhouse gas emissions,"The present work investigates the potential energy savings coming from a careful and detailed local energy policy. The paper analyzes and assesses from technical, economic and environmental viewpoints different initiatives in the energy sector aimed at increasing energy efficiency in end-uses and reducing overall carbon emissions. The results are based on energy planning for five Italian urban areas sized at about fifty thousand inhabitants. The analysis has been developed with the aim of reaching generally applicable criteria suitable for evaluating the local energy policy contribution to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. Several initiatives for the private and public sectors have been considered, such as: (i) the introduction of combined heat and power generation based on useful thermal demand, suitable for the industry and service sectors (swimming pools, large distribution organizations); (ii) generation of electricity from renewables (solar energy, biomass); (iii) thermal insulation of private and public buildings, such as schools; (iv) introduction of micro-combined heat and power generation in the residential sector. For each solution the primary energy reduction and the consequent reduction in GHG emissions have been evaluated and a feasibility analysis has been developed in order to assess the profitability of the investment. Great attention has been paid to the public sector, which has an important role in providing leadership and driving changes in other sectors; furthermore, a rational use of energy combined with the exploitation of country-based incentives is able to reduce the public administrative expenditure. The results show that local energy policy can give an important contribution to gas emission reduction targets, and underline the fundamental role of public sector initiatives.","['Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning', 'Public administration, defence, social security', 'Education', 'Health and social work', 'Arts, entertainment, recreation']",2010,10.2495/EEIA100051,
A New Computational Tool for the Development of Advanced Exergy Analysis and LCA on Single Effect LiBr–H2O Solar Absorption Refrigeration System,"A single effect LiBr–H2O absorption refrigeration system coupled with a solar collector and a storage tank was studied to develop an assessment tool using the built-in App Designer in MATLAB®. The model is developed using balances of mass, energy, and species conservation in the components of the absorption cooling system, taking into account the effect of external streams through temperature and pressure drop. The whole system, coupled with the solar energy harvesting arrangement, is modeled for 24 h of operation with changes on an hourly basis based on ambient temperature, cooling system load demand, and hourly solar irradiation, which is measured and recorded by national weather institutes sources. Test through simulations and validation procedures are carried out with acknowledged scientific articles. These show 2.65% of maximum relative error on the energy analysis with respect to cited authors. The environmental conditions used in the study were evaluated in Barranquilla, Colombia, with datasets of the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (IDEAM), considering multiannual average hourly basis solar irradiation. This allowed the authors to obtain the behavior of the surface temperature of the water in the tank, COP, and exergy efficiency of the system. The simulations also stated the generator as the biggest source of irreversibility with around 45.53% of total exergy destruction in the inner cycle without considering the solar array, in which case the solar array would present the most exergy destruction.","['Manufacturing', 'Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning']",2021,10.3390/lubricants9080076,
Improved Air-Conditioning Demand Response of Connected Communities over Individually Optimized Buildings,"Connected communities potentially offer much greater demand response capabilities over singular building energy management systems (BEMS) through an increase of connectivity. The potential increase in benefits from this next step in connectivity is still under investigation, especially when applied to existing buildings. This work utilizes EnergyPlus simulation results on eight different commercial prototype buildings to estimate the potential savings on peak demand and energy costs using a mixed-integer linear programming model. This model is used in two cases: a fully connected community and eight separate buildings with BEMS. The connected community is optimized using all zones as variables, while the individual buildings are optimized separately and then aggregated. These optimization problems are run for a range of individual zone flexibility values. The results indicate that a connected community offered 60.0% and 24.8% more peak demand savings for low and high flexibility scenarios, relative to individually optimized buildings. Energy cost optimization results show only marginally better savings of 2.9% and 6.1% for low and high flexibility, respectively.","['Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning']",2021,10.3390/en14185926,
Aquatic Exercise Positively Affects Physiological Frailty among Postmenopausal Women: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial,"Frailty is a risk factor associated with aging. Physical exercise is an important lifestyle factor that can help to avoid risks associated with aging. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effects of aquatic exercise for 12 weeks on body composition, cardiovascular disease risk factors, insulin resistance, and aging-related sex hormones in elderly South Korean women. Twenty-two women aged 70–82 years were randomly assigned to groups that participated or did not participate (controls; n = 10 in aquatic exercise for 60 min, three times per week for 12 weeks (n = 12). Exercise intensity defined as the rating of perceived exertion (RPE), was increased from 12–13 to 13–14, and to 14–15 during weeks 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12, respectively. Body composition (skeletal muscle mass, ratio (%) body fat, and waist circumference), cardiovascular disease risk factors (total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), insulin resistance (glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]), and aging-related sex hormone changes (dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate [DHEA-S]) and sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG]) were assessed. Aquatic exercise safely improved body composition, reduced insulin resistance, and positively affected the sex hormones DHEA-S and SHBG as well as blood lipid profiles. Our findings suggested that the aquatic exercise program positively altered blood lipids, regulated glucose levels, and sex hormone levels.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in the smart grid environment: an economic model of load management by demand response,"Environmental concern regarding the consumption of fossil fuels is among the most serious challenges facing the world. As a result, utilisation of more renewable resources and promotion of a clean transport system such as the use of Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) became the forefront of the new energy policies. However, the breakthrough of PHEVs in the automotive fleet increases concerns around the stability of power system and in particular, the power network. This research simulates the aggregate load profile of the UK with presence of PHEVs based upon different price scenarios. The results show that under the fixed rate and time of use programmes in the current grid, the extra load of the electric vehicles intensifies the consumption profile and also creates new critical points. Thus, there should always be excess standby capacity to satisfy peak demand even for a short period of time. On the other hand, when the consumers do not pay the price based on the actual cost of supply, those who consume less in peak hours subsidise the ones who consume more and this cross subsidy raises a regulatory issue. On the contrary, a smart grid can accommodate PHEVs without creating technical and regulatory problems. This positive consequence is the result of demand response to the real time pricing. From a technical point of view, the biggest chunk of PHEVs' load will be shifted to the late evening and the hours of minimum demand. Besides, from a welfare analysis standpoint, real time pricing creates no deadweight losses and corresponding demand response will limit the ability of suppliers to increase the spot market clearing price above its equilibrium level.","['Transport and storage', 'Electricity, gas, steam, air conditioning']",2012,10.1051/epjconf/20123304008,

A review on the potentials of using feeds rich in water-soluble carbohydrates to enhance rumen health and sustainability of dairy cattle production,"Cows are adapted to degrade structural plant carbohydrates (SC), such as cellulose and hemicelluloses, prevailing in grasses. Yet, the need for energy-dense diets in many intensive dairy production systems has shifted the dairy cattleʼs diet from SC-rich to high levels of starch. Feeding of starch-rich diets increases the risk of ruminal acidosis in cows, and feeding starch in the form of grains intensifies the competition over cereal grains and arable land among different livestock species, as well as between livestock and humans. Besides cellulose and hemicelluloses, grasses are also often rich in water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), which comprise mono-, di-, oligo- and polysaccharides (fructans). Although the ruminal fermentation profile of mono- and disaccharides resembles that of starch, the degradation of oligo- and polysaccharides is slower, and their fermentation elicits a rather protecting effect on ruminal pH. When harvested in an early phase (i.e. ear emergence), grass hay and silages can reach WSC levels up to 150–200 g kg⁻¹ dry matter and energy levels close to starch-rich diets, allowing a significantly reduced inclusion of concentrate supplements. By doing so, this will enhance both rumen health and the sustainability of milk production. However, because the WSC are chemically very heterogeneous, the patterns and extent of their ruminal fermentation are difficult to predict without a clear analytical characterization. This review article aims to summarize both the benefits and potentials, as well as the challenges, with respect to using WSC-rich feedstuffs in the nutrition of dairy cattle and their effects on ruminal fermentation characteristics and milk production.","['Agriculture, forestry, fishing']",2021,10.1002/jsfa.11358,
Toxic Habits and Well-Being Measures in Spanish Healthcare University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: Unhealthy lifestyles are strongly entrenched in healthcare universities and have sometimes been linked to stress or lack of sleep. This study investigated the prevalence of toxic habits (smoking, patterns of harmful alcohol use, and illicit drug use), stress levels, perceived health status, and sleep duration and assessed the connections between toxic habits and said well-being measures, as well as healthcare students' perception of the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on these health-related behaviors. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, healthcare students from Alfonso X University (Spain) completed a health survey composed of Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), self-perceived health status, and the number of hours of sleep. Results: A total of 997 healthcare students completed the survey, of which 982 were analyzed. Being a smoker (32.2%) was associated with worse health status and insufficient sleep. Risk drinkers (33.2%) were associated with being female, and the consumption of cannabinoids (6.7%), with being male. These three toxic habits were related to each other. High levels of stress (28.2%) were correlated with worse ratings in the perception of health status (29.2%) and with insufficient sleep (45.8%), and all of them were associated with the female sex. Respectively, 49.3% and 44.2% of students recognized a worsening in their perception of stress and their sleep habits during the pandemic.

Deviating from the Plan: Assessing the Impact of Forest Management Delays on Ecosystem Function,"Forests are under increasing stress due to changes in disturbance regimes, such as wildfire and pest or disease outbreaks, an increase in more severe and prolonged drought, and changes in land use. These stressors are already having an observable impact on forests in the western United States. Many forests within the western US are managed by the US Forest Service. Forest management is important as a tool for increasing a forest's ability to withstand or recover from these stresses. Additionally, because of the forest's influence on interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere, forest management has implications for future energy, water, and carbon cycles. However, management is driven by socio-economic, political, and ecological needs which can influence the timing of management activities. Forests are dynamic ecosystems, and changes to the timing of management through delays could lead to unanticipated impacts on a forest's structure, productivity, and ecohydrological function. Land surface models (LSMs) are one tool used to investigate land surface processes and land-atmosphere interactions. LSMs represent vegetation dynamics in different and increasingly sophisticated ways. While the fidelity of plant biophysical and biogeochemical process representation has increased in many of these models, the representation of forest management is still very simplistic. Until recently, the temporal aspects of management have rarely been included in studies using LSMs. Here, we addressed this challenge by including the temporal details of representative timber harvest activities from the western USA within LSM simulations. We hypothesized that changes in the timing of management activities can have long term impacts on the structure and functioning of a forest. To test this hypothesis, we quantified vegetation management activities in the western USA and investigated the role specific project characteristics have on potential project delays. As a proof-of-concept, we used this data to inform the timing of single point scale logging simulations using the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator of the Community Land Model (CLM-FATES) for a ponderosa pine dominated forest in southern Idaho. A challenge encountered in simulating realistic forests was a bias towards smaller-diameter trees (i.e., <50 cm diameter at breast height), relative to observations. In overcoming this challenge, we expanded on current work within the CLM-FATES and greater LSM community to better parameterize the model for temperate, evergreen forests. We developed methods to generate multiple parameter ensembles and simulated these ensembles under different climate forcing and coexistence conditions. Over the course of this work, we developed significant and important overarching findings about critical facets of simulating managed forest ecosystems. First, we found that environmental regulations (here the type of NEPA analysis required for a project), the length of time to complete that analysis, and the type of management activity had the biggest impact on the probability of project implementation. Second, from logging simulations, we found that the timing of treatments can have long term impacts on the resulting forest size-structure, but timing has less of an impact on the long-term functioning of the forest as indicated by the model. Third, more complex ecosystems - as represented by the addition of an additional plant functional type - can lead to more realistic distributions of tree size classes, although this added ecosystem complexity does not appear to assist in identifying optimal sets of model parameters in CLM-FATES. This work makes an important contribution to deploying sophisticated, demography based LSMs in western US forests by demonstrating how models can now capture legacies of human interventions and that calibration of model parameters is complex and constrained by the existing structure and makeup of these systems. These results highlight the importance of representing different aspects of human systems in ecosystem models as well as highlighting the tension between a need to improve model calibration without increasing model complexity.","['Agriculture, forestry, fishing', 'Public administration, defence, social security']",2022,,
