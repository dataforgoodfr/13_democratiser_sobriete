APPLICATION OF ESG IN dEVELOPING A REGIONAL STRATEGY,"New trends in the economy involve not only stable profit maximization and sustainable cost minimization, but also taking into account such factors as the natural, social and spiritual environment, which has become a fundamental basis that must withstand serious degradation. Global climate change, gender and social inequality lead to a revision of the world view and awareness of the importance of sustainable development, which is necessary to solve systemic crises and global challenges. The state of the environment is the basis of food security, which depends on the efficiency of agricultural production and the improvement of agro– and biotechnologies, these issues are based on the policy of sustainable development and are translated into the development strategies of regions and countries. Population growth, an increase in anthropogenic impact, and environmental degradation require each individual organization to choose a concept for achieving sustainable development goals, which should be reflected in the development strategy of the region. These new rules, uncharacteristic for the business turnover of many organizations, contain a sufficient number of debatable issues, primarily due to the lack of regulatory regulation of these issues. This article is intended to systematize the variety of sources of information on this issue and determine the requirements dictated by modern trends in the field of the ESG agenda for existing regional development strategies. An important part of the region's strategy is the creation of a carbon polygon, an experimental site for monitoring the circulation of carbon in nature, its presence in forests, cities, ecosystems, in order to be able to assess how much carbon is absorbed by domestic ecosystems, to be able to influence the trans-carbon tax and direct its funds to protection environment. The creation of carbon landfills should help determine how much of which tree species should be planted to offset harmful greenhouse gas emissions, which must necessarily be accompanied by monitoring of greenhouse gas fluxes in ecosystems. © E.A.

"Urban expansion, economic development, and carbon emissions: Trends, patterns, and decoupling in mainland China's provincial capitals (1985-2020)","In 2020, the Chinese government set the objective of achieving carbon neutrality, making it essential to understand the urbanization process in order to effectively implement future sustainable development strategies. Here, we demonstrate the urbanization development of 31 provincial capitals in mainland China from 1985 to 2020, including changes in impervious surfaces, socio-economic development, carbon emissions, and population. Using elasticity coefficients and the carbon emissions causal equation for quantitative analysis, we explore the relationships among these factors. We found that the national urban expansion rate experienced rapid growth, followed by a slowdown, with the peak occurring between 2000 and 2005. In just 40 years, total urban area expanded from 11,280 km2 to 40,429 km2, with eastern cities growing faster than those in the west. Despite similar trends, different cities displayed four distinct spatial characteristics, shaped by factors such as topography, transportation, and policies. Moreover, urban economic development is gradually decoupling from carbon emissions, accompanied by a declining reliance on urban area expansion and a reduced growth rate of carbon emissions. A strong decoupling trend between economic growth and carbon emissions has already emerged in the South & Central and Northwest regions, offering a preliminary explanation for the observed slowdown in carbon emissions. The study provides a comprehensive overview of the urbanization process in mainland China, highlighting low-carbon urban transformations and revealing how government policies have significantly shaped the development patterns of Chinese cities. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers to further promote sustainable development goals.",About Sufficiency
A strategy for green infrastructure network based on multifunctional synergy,"The multifunctionality of green infrastructure (GI) has become an important component of sustainable urban development, influenced by the pressures associated with climate extremes and agglomeration of populations. The protection and construction of urban GI is an essential way of adapting to the national policy of high-quality development at the current stage. However, how GI is developed needs to be further discussed. In this study, Zhengzhou City, a centre city in China, as a case. We proposed an analytical framework of ""functional assessment - correlation analysis - corridor network"" in this study. It specifically refers to the assessment and the trade-off and synergy analysis of the six GI functions, namely stormwater management, climate regulation, landscape recreation, air quality, biodiversity and social vulnerability. This is based on the bivariate local indicators of spatial association and circuit theory methods. We found that the urban GI construction areas do not match the built-up areas of the city. Moreover, most of the GI functions were found to show synergistic effects, except for the trade-off with air quality. In addition, we constructed a GI network containing 12 GI hubs and 24 GI corridors to address the inequality in geospatial distribution of GI due to spatial heterogeneity. This paper provides a reliable strategic foundation for the relevant decision makers to optimize GI planning in Zhengzhou. It also provides a scientific reference for GI planning in similar areas to support sustainable habitat development in metropolitan areas.",About Sufficiency

"Food waste and its associated environmental impacts in workplace buffet-style canteens in Beijing, China","Introduction: Food waste is a significant global challenge, with critical implications for food security, ecosystem services, biodiversity, and human health. Despite growing attention to food waste in food service sectors, workplace buffet-style canteens—particularly in China—remain understudied. This research addresses this gap by quantifying food waste and evaluating its environmental impacts in workplace buffet-style canteens in Beijing, China. Methods: Field surveys were conducted in four workplace buffet-style canteens in Beijing during August and September 2021. Systematic sampling yielded 656 valid samples. Food waste was measured using a direct weighing method, categorized into eight food types, and analyzed for its environmental impacts using carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, water, and ecological footprint metrics. Conversion factors were applied to translate cooked food into raw agricultural equivalents for consistent impact assessment. Results: The study found an average daily per capita food waste of 158.4 g, with lunch contributing the highest waste (78.8 g) compared to breakfast and dinner. While vegetables were the largest contributors by weight, livestock products, though comprising only 29.9% of waste, accounted for the majority of environmental impacts, including 96.7% of the ecological footprint and 85.7% of the water footprint. Self-run canteens generated less waste across all meals compared to outsourced ones, and higher food and cuisine diversity were associated with increased food waste. Discussion: The findings underscore the influence of dietary habits, management models, and food diversity on food waste generation. Livestock product waste poses disproportionate environmental burdens, highlighting the need for targeted interventions such as portion control and educational campaigns on sustainable dining practices. These results provide valuable insights for policymakers aiming to align food waste reduction strategies with Sustainable Development Goal 12.3.

Effect of Nature Space on Enhancing Humans’ Health and Well-Being: An Integrative Narrative Review,"With the progress of science and technology, humans’ ability to transform and create has been greatly enhanced, but so have the physical and mental ailments associated with environmental degradation and urbanization. Human survival and health are strongly linked to nature, and there is growing evidence that exposure to nature promotes health and well-being. However, there is currently a lack of synthesis among empirical studies on these aspects for the findings to be sufficient for informing public health strategies and social policy. Here, following basic guidelines for systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases in January 2023. The results of our search and analysis show that nature can improve people’s health and well-being from two aspects: physical (reduces CVDs, increases immunity, improves autonomic nervous system function, and improves sleep quality) and psychological (restores attention, improves mood, reduces stress, and improves cognitive development). The ways in which people derive health from nature are varied, and tailored, personalized, symptom-specific exposure can further increase the health benefits. More importantly, it seems that people can gain the health benefits of nature by only being exposed to it for a short time. We incorporate the existing scientific evidence in our review and develop a new heuristic point of view on the necessity of exposure to natural environments for the health of individuals. © 2024 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
MMD-TSC: An Adaptive Multi-Objective Traffic Signal Control for Energy Saving with Traffic Efficiency,"Reducing traffic energy consumption is crucial for smart cities, and vehicle carbon emissions are a key energy indicator. Traffic signal control (TSC) is a useful method because it can affect the energy consumption of vehicles on the road by controlling the stop-and-go of vehicles at traffic intersections. However, setting traffic signals to reduce energy consumption will affect traffic efficiency and this is not in line with traffic management objectives. Current studies adopt multi-objective optimization methods with high traffic efficiency and low carbon emissions to solve this problem. However, most methods use static weights, which cannot adapt to complex and dynamic traffic states, resulting in non-optimal performance. Current energy indicators for urban transportation often fail to consider passenger fairness. This fairness is significant because the purpose of urban transportation is to serve people’s mobility needs not vehicles. Therefore, this paper proposes Multi-objective Adaptive Meta-DQN TSC (MMD-TSC), which introduces a dynamic weight adaptation mechanism to simultaneously optimize traffic efficiency and energy saving, and incorporates the per capita carbon emissions as the energy indicator. Firstly, this paper integrates traffic state data such as vehicle positions, velocities, vehicle types, and the number of passengers and incorporates fairness into the energy indicators, using per capita carbon emissions as the target for reducing energy consumption. Then, it proposes MMD-TSC with dynamic weights between energy consumption and traffic efficiency as reward functions. The MMD-TSC model includes two agents, the TSC agent and the weight agent, which are responsible for traffic signal adjustment and weight calculation, respectively. The weights are calculated by a function of traffic states. Finally, the paper describes the design of the MMD-TSC model learning algorithm and uses a SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) v.1.20.0 for traffic simulation. The results show that in non-highly congested traffic states, the MMD-TSC model has higher traffic efficiency and lower energy consumption compared to static multi-objective TSC models and single-objective TSC models, and can adaptively achieve traffic management objectives. Compared with using vehicle average carbon emissions as the energy consumption indicator, using per capita carbon emissions achieves Pareto improvements in traffic efficiency and energy consumption indicators. The energy utilization efficiency of the MMD-TSC model is improved by 35% compared to the fixed-time TSC. © 2024 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
"Public perception and preferences of small urban green infrastructures: A case study in Guangzhou, China","With the growing demand for small urban green infrastructures (UGIs), knowing the public perception of small UGIs is important for future urban planning and decision-making. This study focusing on three small UGIs (a green roof, green wall, and small green lane in Guangzhou) explored residents' willingness to pay (WTP) for the maintenance of small UGIs and estimated their nonmarket value via travel cost method (TCM). Among 409 respondents from different neighborhoods, 80% were willing to pay for using and maintaining these UGIs. The aggregated annual WTP for investigated UGIs was approximately RMB 72.3 million per household, and the annual nonmarket value that the UGIs provided to human well-being was about RMB 74.5 million per household. Young respondents who might have lower incomes would like to pay more compared to elderly respondents. Among the five environmental issues investigated, people took air pollution as the most severe issue, and they preferred to pay more for air quality regulation services. To improve public understanding of small UGIs and their urban ecosystem services, education and publicity programs should be launched for various groups of people in the future. These findings will help city planners identify more effective designs for small UGIs, thus meeting societal preferences and demands.",About Sufficiency
Novel Irrigation Technologies for Urban Landscaping,"Trees are a natural biofilitration approach to managing stormwater runoff for the development of green infrastructure that provides many community benefits as our urban areas expanding. These benefits include stormwater retention, erosion and pollution reduction, biodiversity and habitat restoration, esthetic and other environmental and social benefits. But growing a tree in the over-saturated soil (typical case during storm time) could kill a tree, too. On the other hand, 80% of the U.S. territory suffers at least a seasonal drought annually according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Trees and plants typically suffer much during droughts. This presentation will review the new irrigation technologies that are suitable for urban landscaping, which are quite different from farm fields. Conventionally, development of irrigation technologies is driven by agriculture industry so that these technologies are more suitable for farm use than for typical urban settings. For example, road median plantings are too difficult to use drip irrigation system because of legislation and logistics reasons. Irrigation systems can also be very cost inefficient compared to farm fields where acres of plants can share a system, while road median is the opposite in terms density of plantings. In addition, harsher environment and vandalism may cause damages. Novel irrigation technologies that are best for urban plantings and cope with the harsher growing urban environment will be discussed with case studies. The goal of this session is to educate and to recommend the best technologies for urban environments. The criteria include making best usage of natural precipitation water, stormwater holding and slow releasing capability, reducing labor cost, saving water, suppressing invasive species, and protecting plantings against harsher growing conditions than farms: heat island effect, excessive sunlight from reflections from buildings and road surfaces, limited soil volume, compacted soil, pollution from road maintenance and emission, vandalism, more flooding (within in the concrete forest), etc. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",About Sufficiency
"Impacts of urban expansion on ecosystem services in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, China: A scenario analysis based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways","Understanding the impacts of urban expansion on ecosystem services (ESs) is important for sustainable development on regional and global scales. However, due to the uncertainty of future socioeconomic development and the complexity of urban expansion, assessing the impacts of future urban expansion on ESs remains challenging. In this study, we simulated the urban expansion in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration in China from 2013 to 2040, and assessed its potential impacts on ESs based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and the Land Use Scenario Dynamics-urban (LUSD-urban) model. We found that urban land in the BTH urban agglomeration is expected to increase from 7605.25 km2 in 2013 to 9401.75–11,936.00 km2 in 2040. With continuing urban expansion, food production (FP), carbon storage (CS), water retention (WR), and air purification (AP) will decrease by 1.34–3.16%, 0.68–1.60%, 0.80–1.89%, and 0.37–0.87%, respectively. The conversion of cropland to urban land will be the main cause of ES losses. During 2013–2040, the losses of ESs caused by this conversion will account for 83.66–97.11% of the total losses in the whole region. Furthermore, the ES losses can cause considerable negative impacts on human well-being. The loss of FP will be equivalent to the food requirement of 3.68–8.61% of the total population in 2040, and the loss of CS will be 2.55–6.01% of the total standard coal consumption in 2013. To ensure sustainable development in the region, we suggest that effective policies and regulations should be implemented to protect cropland with high ES values from urban expansion. © 2017",About Sufficiency
Evaluating the life cycle net benefit of low impact development in a city,"Low impact development (LID) practices (e.g., green roofs, bioretention systems, and porous pavements) offer multiple benefits to urban eco-systems. They reduce the expenses associated with water treatment, grey infrastructure, and energy consumption and thus generate economic benefits. They also benefit the environment by mitigating air pollution and climate change, and they provide social benefits such as enhancing livability, urban green space, and educating and improving the health of the public. Many studies have attempted to calculate the monetary value of these benefits. However, few have considered all three types of benefits (i.e., economic, environmental, and social) or considered all of the different LID practices at a city-scale. This study develops a life cycle quantification framework to determine the monetary values of the three types of benefits and the life cycle net benefit of LID practices for a city. Applying the proposed framework to a case study of Hong Kong, the 30-year economic and environmental benefits are 5.3 billion USD and 1.2 billion USD, respectively. The mean and median social benefits are 35.1 billion USD and 49.6 billion USD, respectively. Subtracting the 30-year LID implementation cost (55.8 billion USD) produces a median positive net benefit of 2.3 billion USD with an annual unit value of 1.05 USD/m2 yr, and a mean negative net benefit of 12.2 billion USD with an annual unit value of −5.58 USD/m2 yr. Sensitivity analyses show that the net benefit is sensitive to the willingness to pay (WTP) of Hong Kong people, especially the WTP of the private sector, and the land cost of green roofs. Overall, this study provides a framework for quantifying and evaluating the life cycle cost, benefits, and net benefit of LID practices. The assumptions in the framework can be modified based on local information and applied to many other cities worldwide. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH",About Sufficiency
"Evaluating Trade-Off and Synergies of Ecosystem Services Values of a Representative Resources-Based Urban Ecosystem: A Coupled Modeling Framework Applied to Panzhihua City, China","Following significant urban expansion, the ecological problems of resource-based cities are gradually exposed. It is of great significance to study the ecosystem services of resource-based cities to achieve their sustainable development goals and to alleviate the conflicts between environmental protection and the utilization of the surrounding resources. However, in the current research on resource-based cities, few scholars have combined multiple minerals and multiple ecosystem services to explore the impact of mineral resources on the ecosystem. In this study, based on the historical data spanning from 2002 to 2018, we used the CA–Markov model to project the land use of Panzhihua City to 2030. Based on future land use projection, we quantified four ecosystem services (ESs) variables, including water yield, carbon storage, habitat quality, and soil conservation, using the InVEST model from the perspective of land use evolution in Panzhihua City. In addition, we explored the trade-offs and synergies of different ecosystem services and the correlations between different mineral species and ecosystem services using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Results showed the following: (1) During 2002–2018, water yield service, habitat quality service, and carbon storage service of Panzhihua City decreased year by year, and soil conservation service showed significant fluctuations; most of the low ESs areas were distributed in the central region of Panzhihua. On the contrary, most high ESs areas were located in the forest region. (2) The trade-offs and synergistic relationships among different ecosystem services showed significant spatial variations. There were synergistic relationships among ESs and weak trade-offs between water yield services, soil conservation, and habitat quality services. There was also significant spatial variability in the trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services, with water production services showing “east trade-offs and west synergies” with soil conservation and habitat quality services, and most of the rest showing trade-offs in urban areas. (3) ESs in mining areas showed trade-offs in general, mainly between water production services and carbon storage services, with clay as the major negative factor of mineral species, and iron ore mines that have undergone ecological protection construction showed the lowest negative impact on ecology. © 2022 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
The Consequences of Landscape Fragmentation on Socio-Ecological Patterns in a Rapidly Developing Urban Area: A Case Study of the National Autonomous University of Mexico,"Fragmentation of natural landscapes during urbanization processes has been well-linked to biodiversity loss and changes in ecological and ecosystem function. Fragmentation can also have profound effects on provision of ecosystem services and on human social dynamics and well-being within cities. The ways in which ecological, ecosystem service, and social factors and the interactions among these are affected by fragmentation is not well-studied. Understanding these relationships is particularly important in cities where high densities of human population create intense and dynamic interactions within green spaces. Using the rapidly developing campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City as a case study, we examine the effects of natural area fragmentation over time on ecosystem services, human well-being, and biodiversity. We compare fragmentation of the campus natural areas between 1954 and 2015 to non-native plant species distribution maps, models of water infiltration, and mobility and citizen-science data. We found that the loss and fragmentation of the campus's natural areas has had varied effects on ecosystem services, and negative effects on human well-being and biodiversity. The relationships between fragmentation and ecosystem services depends on the ecosystem service being measured; water infiltration was negatively impacted by fragmentation but engagement with biodiversity was greatest in areas with a mix of natural and urban land covers. Our human well-being variable, mobility (the average travel time within the campus of walkers, bicyclists, and cars), was negatively affected by fragmentation. Walkers and cyclists spent significantly more time traveling across campus in 2015 compared to 1954. Finally, the most fragmented areas of the campus's natural areas support large populations of invasive exotic species, indicating negative effects of fragmentation on biodiversity. Although campus urban development is necessary for supporting the academic community at this growing university, we suggest a renewed focus on sustainable campus development in which land sparing in emphasized; connecting instructional, research, administrative, and other campus facilities within urban clusters and providing sustainable transport systems. Thus, eliminating further loss and fragmentation of the natural areas on campus, supporting both human well-being and the unique biodiversity of the region.",About Sufficiency

Evaluating urban climate resilience in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration: A novel method integrating the DPSIR model and Sustainable Development Goals,"The interplay between climate change and socio-economic activities has placed cities at the forefront of climate-related threats. Evaluating and enhancing urban climate resilience are widely regarded as effective strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change. This study aims to develop a more logical, comprehensive, and replicable urban climate resilience assessment framework to accurately evaluate and enhance urban climate resilience, thereby supporting urban growth and development in climate change. Specifically, the study focused on the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA), a region with typical climate risks, using the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) model to construct an urban climate resilience assessment framework and selecting evaluation indicators based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including a new index: government climate policy concern. Subsequently, spatial autocorrelation, geographically and temporally weighted regression model, the coupling and coordination degree model, and the super-SBM model were applied. This approach revealed the spatial and temporal evolution trends, driving factors, coupling coordination degree, and construction efficiency of urban climate resilience in the YRDUA from 2013 to 2021. The results show that: (1) Urban climate resilience levels exhibited significant regional disparities, with a mean resilience score of 0.256 and an average annual growth rate of 1.21%. (2) A notable spatial correlation was observed in urban climate resilience, with the radius of the High-High cluster area expanding, while the radius of the Low-Low cluster area contracted. (3) The key factors driving urban climate resilience included water and forest coverage areas, climate policy concern, and investment in municipal public facilities construction. The impact of these factors displayed notable spatial heterogeneity. (4) The coupling coordination degree between resilience subsystems increased by 7.96%, yet remained on the verge of imbalance. Additionally, the average technical efficiency and scale efficiency of urban climate resilience construction rose by 7.43% and 5.44%, respectively, though significant room for improvement remains.

Why is it crucial to evaluate the fairness of natural capital consumption in urban agglomerations in terms of ecosystem services and economic contribution?,"The issue of ecosystem service (ES) decline due to the unfair consumption of natural capital in urban agglomerations (UAs) has been neglected. This study analysed the spatio-temporal differences characteristics of the three-dimensional ecological footprint and ES value. The Gini coefficient was used to construct a fairness evaluation framework based on physical and value accounting of natural capital consumption. Taking the Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration (GPUA) as a case, the results show the GPUA consistently generated an ecological deficit. The natural capital stock is gradually being consumed. The natural capital consumption of a city matches its ecological carrying capacity and contributes to economic growth, the Gini coefficient of ES reached 0.4 in 2015 and 2017, indicating that the degree of unfairness is increasing. The ES-based evaluation more objectively reflects the fairness of natural capital consumption and ecological supply among cities. Using coefficient of ecological supply, ES value coefficient, economic contribution coefficient, and contribution coefficient of per capita income as the classification of city types helps to judge the fairness of the natural capital consumption of UAs. This framework helps deepen understanding of the coordinated relationship between UAs' socio-economic systems and ecosystems from the perspective of ecological supply and demand balance.",About Sufficiency
Health effects of urban green spaces: An empirical analysis,"In addition to its benefits for air quality, climate protection and biodiversity, the potentials of urban green space for human health are also often highlighted in the literature.

The Role of Nature Reserves in Ecosystem Services and Urban Ecological Sustainable Development,"With the acceleration of global urbanization, the ecosystem services (ES) and ecological balance of nature reserves have been significantly impacted. However, quantitative assessments of the multiple contributions of nature reserves to urban ecological sustainability are still lacking. This study selects Panjin, a wetland city in China (3788 km2), as the study area, utilizing the InVEST model to quantify ES (water yield, carbon storage, soil retention, and habitat quality), and employing redundancy analysis to explore the influencing factors. Ecological source areas were identified, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) score was calculated to systematically evaluate the contribution of nature reserves. The results indicate that from 1990 to 2010, the built-up area of Panjin increased by approximately 159%, leading to a reduction in carbon storage, soil retention, and habitat quality by 20%, 4%, and 14%, respectively. From 2010 to 2020, ecological restoration policies resulted in a 63% increase in ES compared to 2010. Nature reserves played a crucial role in maintaining ecological stability, providing over 40% of the ecological source areas while occupying only 24% of the city’s area and contributing more than 30% to the overall urban ecological sustainability.

Building soil by building community: How can an interdisciplinary approach better support community needs and urban resilience?,"Given the interrelated problems of climate change, energy and resource scarcity, and the challenge of supporting critical natural systems in cities, urban dwellers may be exceptionally vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. While a number of programs and policies have been developed and implemented to help reduce the environmental and social impacts of climate change on communities, we argue that effective and sustainable programs must not only consider how the changing environment impacts communities, but also how communities interact with and impact the environment. Specifically, drawing on a case study of the needs assessment of the Healthy Soils for Healthy Communities Initiative conducted in Los Angeles (LA) County, CA as a model for a Virtuous Cycle Framework, we attempted to better understand how urban residents interact with land, green spaces, and soil as a means of finding ways to address some of the environmental and health disparities that many urban residents experience, while also exploring ways to improve soil health to support its capacity to provide essential ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration, water filtration, food and biomass production). A unique feature of our approach is that it involved an interdisciplinary and multi-level partnership composed of a well-established environmental organization dedicated to urban forestry, environmental justice, and climate resilience, university faculty researchers who study human behavior and human-nature relationships, government partners, and, most importantly, community members, among others. The first step in understanding how community members interact with their environment involved collecting survey and focus group data from residents of LA County to assess attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors around land and soil. Results were used to explore strategies for deepening community engagement, addressing knowledge gaps, and shaping policies that would benefit not just people who live/work in LA, but also the soil and other natural systems that rely on soil. This article integrates our previously published survey and focus group findings with new results that pertain specifically to the Virtuous Cycle Framework, and demonstrates how the data are being used to inform our community-based interventions (e.g., policy change, public education and community engagement, and demonstration projects).",About Sufficiency
A game theory analysis of green infrastructure stormwater management policies,"Green stormwater infrastructure has been demonstrated as an innovative water resources management approach that addresses multiple challenges facing urban environments. However, there is little consensus on what policy strategies can be used to best incentivize green infrastructure adoption by private landowners. Game theory, an analysis framework that has historically been under-utilized within the context of stormwater management, is uniquely suited to address this policy question. We used a cooperative game theory framework to investigate the potential impacts of different policy strategies used to incentivize green infrastructure installation. The results indicate that municipal regulation leads to the greatest reduction in pollutant loading. However, the choice of the ""best"" regulatory approach will depend on a variety of different factors including politics and financial considerations. Large, downstream agents have a disproportionate share of bargaining power. Results also reveal that policy impacts are highly dependent on agents' spatial position within the stormwater network, leading to important questions of social equity and environmental justice.",About Sufficiency
Regional and Urban-Rural Differences in Carbon Emissions of Chinese Residents: Dynamic Evolution and Structural Decomposition,"Promoting energy conservation and emission reduction and achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality is a systematic project that requires the joint efforts of the whole society. Accurate measurement and analysis of the basic state and spatial correlation of urban -rural carbon emissions is the basic prerequisite for formulating the ""double carbon"" policy. This study aims to analyze the regional disparities in urban -rural carbon emissions in China from 2005 to 2021 and to assess the degree of inequality in such emissions. The IPCC methodology was employed to calculate the carbon emissions of urban and rural areas in each province. The Theil coefficient was utilized to delineate the spatial evolution of urban -rural carbon emission disparities in China. The decomposition of the Theil index was adopted to investigate the sources and shifts in spatial disparities. The local Moran's I was applied to analyze the spatial correlation of urban and rural carbon emissions in China. Additionally, the Theil index was employed to measure the degree of urban -rural carbon emission inequality in each province. Based on the natural breakpoint grading method, the spatial heterogeneity of the urban -rural carbon emission inequality across various Chinese provinces was scrutinized. Findings: China's urban -rural carbon emission inequality exhibited a three-phase transformation, predominantly influenced by intraregional factors, with the Northeast region making a significant contribution. Spatially, eastern coastal and inland provinces like Hebei and Shandong exhibited higher carbon emissions, whereas western provinces such as Gansu and Qinghai showed lower levels.

"Spatio-temporal evolution characteristics and driving mechanisms of Urban-Agricultural-Ecological space in ecologically fragile areas: A case study of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, China","Ecologically fragile areas, which are vulnerable to human disturbances, are facing development dilemmas due to the contradiction between economic development and environmental degradation. Examining the driving mechanism and future trends of land use transitions can inform territorial planning and land use policies to address the contradiction. However, research into the mechanisms governing the interaction between ecological and social factors driving land use transitions in ecologically fragile areas is currently limited. Considering the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (URYREB), a typical ecologically fragile area in China, as an example, this study discussed the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics and driving mechanisms of UrbanAgricultural-Ecological Space. The results indicated that ecological factors influence the direction, location, and scale of spatial evolution, while social factors dominate the direction and scale of spatial evolution. The interaction between ecological and social elements drives spatial evolution due to the endogenous development needs of the social-ecological system (SES), in conjunction with external policy guidance and economic development. In the future, urban function space may continue to expand and threaten surrounding agricultural function space, thus, corresponding land use policies are necessary to ensure food security. This study unveils the impact of multifactor interactions on land use transitions and offers insights for optimizing territorial space planning in ecologically fragile areas.",About Sufficiency
Comprehensive evaluation of urban garden afforestation based on PLS-SEM path,"The paper has comprehensively studied and evaluated urban garden afforestation, which integrated a comprehensive index-system to evaluate including ecological environment benefit, economic benefit, and social benefit, as well as deduced the Algorithm of PLS-SEM (Partial least squares – structural equation modeling) path evaluation model about comprehensive assessment. Afforestation in urban areas results in the reduction of local biodiversity, the potentially invasive species, and lost revenue from agriculture. Advanced planning and management could allow the coexistence of urban forestry and nature. The paper took the urban garden afforestation in Harbin as a case study and conducted a single-dimensional test and reliability and validity test on the construction of evaluation index system, and also verified its scientificity. On this basis, we obtained relevant parameters of middle-external structure and internal structure in the PLS-SEM path model, as well as the integrated level of urban garden afforestation in Harbin. The observational outcomes study the comprehensive evaluation of urban garden afforestation and the evaluation index system of urban garden afforestation is constructed. © 2022",About Sufficiency

Urbanization can benefit agricultural production with large-scale farming in China,"Urbanization has often been considered a threat to food security since it is likely to reduce the availability of croplands. Using spatial statistics and scenario analysis, we show that an increase in China's urbanization level from 56% in 2015 to 80% in 2050 would actually release 5.8 million hectares of rural land for agricultural production-equivalent to 4.1% of China's total cropland area in 2015. Even considering the relatively lower land fertility of these new croplands, crop production in 2050 would still be 3.1-4.2% higher than in 2015. In addition, cropland fragmentation could be reduced with rural land release and a decrease in rural population, benefiting large-scale farming and environmental protection. To ensure this, it is necessary to adopt an integrated urban-rural development model, with reclamation of lands previously used as residential lots. These insights into the urbanization and food security debate have important policy implications for global regions undergoing rapid urbanization. Using spatial statistics and scenario analysis, Wang et al. identify the rural land most suitable for crop production in more than 2,800 Chinese counties. They estimate that a targeted increase in China's urbanization level could release almost 6 million hectares of rural land for agriculture.",About Sufficiency
Spatial patterns of urban green infrastructure for equity: A novel exploration,"Urbanization processes spur the need for urban green infrastructure (GI) to support the well-being of urban dwellers and underpin a sustainable planning strategy. It is a challenge for urban planning to make cities equitable in a socio-spatial way for which strategic planning are demanded based on measured gradients of spatial equity for GI. Strategically, urban GI planning should pay tribute to the inherent spatial patterns and foster a fair distribution of GI towards spatial equity. Our aim is hence to investigate the spatial patterns of urban GI and disclose how spatial patterns affect spatial equity of GI in typical residential areas. The sample sites are in a central European city, Leipzig, the fastest growing city in Germany at present, with high pressure on urban growth. To elaborate an innovative approach, this study draws up a cascade of three methodological stages: 1) deploy the approach of an urban Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) to compare urban GI patterns in three typical residential local districts, 2) use the GI-adapted Gini coefficient to measure spatial equity of GI distributions, and 3) explore the relationships between GI spatial patterns and spatial equity of GI for each residential type. In the context of three typical residential areas in Leipzig (i.e. (semi-)detached houses, linear multistorey housing estates, and perimeter blocks), a combination of the MSPA and a spatial equity measurement assists our novel exploration to disclose the relationships between the spatial patterns and the equity of GI distributions. Thus, we can prove strong similarities on the characteristics of spatial patterns in each residential type and observe a tendency of increasing equity from (semi-)detached houses to linear housing and further to perimeter blocks. As significant findings for the support of strategic urban GI planning, we discover that GI cores provide a restricted increase of spatial equity that limited to the lack of space. Furthermore, we suggest more GI bridges to enhance structural connectivity as well as spatial equity. This paper depicts the spatial equity of GI distributions in typical residential areas from morphological perspective, and thus further underpins urban GI planning for strategic networks as a key principle of the urban GI concept.

How Ecosystem-Based Adaptation to Climate Change Can Help Coastal Communities through a Participatory Approach,"Coastal rural communities worldwide face many challenges not only related to climate change but also extreme events, environmental degradation, population growth or aging, and conflict usage of the ecosystem. Historically, the economies of coastal communities have been based on the exploitation of natural resources, thus shaping its socioeconomic development. This has led to some limitations in the way these communities can now adapt to climate change. In Canada, coastal communities are increasingly dealing with climate change consequences. Sea level rise, coastal erosion, and increasing frequency in storm surges threaten the fragility of both natural and human systems. Various approaches have been used to try to reduce the vulnerability and improve adaptive capacity of communities. One approach, promoted by many organizations including the United Nations, is ecosystem-based adaptation. This approach is part of the series of nature-based solutions that help social-ecological systems become more resilient; by promoting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, this approach also relates to principles of community engagement and supports adaptive governance and social inclusion. This paper describes and analyzes these principles and considers strategies for ensuring community engagement. Combining ecosystem-based adaptation with a strong community engagement can enhance the long-term sustainability of the social-ecological system.",About Sufficiency
"Implications of Urban Sustainability, Socio-ecosystems, and Ecosystem Services","This paper has the aim to analyze the implications that urban sustainability, socio-ecosystems, and ecosystem services have as the bases to design the urban green growth strategies. The method used is the analytic based on the theoretical and conceptual literature reviews on the topics described. A qualitative analysis offers better knowledge outcomes than a quantitative analysis using models that are based on a limited subset of implications between sustainability, socio-ecosystems, and ecosystem services with strong limitations because uncertainties and ambiguities are difficult to quantify if not impossible. Urban sustainability and environmental performance integrates biodiversity and socio-ecosystems for the provision of better quality ecosystem services supported by green infrastructure design into the green projects aimed to achieve economic and environmental benefits. It is concluded that the ecosystem services and human well-being may suffer irreversible severe declines if sustainability is not built based on biodiversity of socio-ecosystems, green infrastructure, and natural capital. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",About Sufficiency
An action framework for the participatory assessment of nature-based solutions in cities,"Impact assessment is a key step in mainstreaming urban nature-based solutions (NBS). Yet, it remains unclear if and how assessment frameworks influence urban planning, design and management. We contend that the potential of current NBS assessment frameworks is not fully exploited due to: (1) limited contextualisation of monitoring and assessment to place-specific contexts and (2) the depoliticisation of co-production. To address this, we present a practical five-step action framework to guide inclusive participation across different stages of monitoring and assessment of urban NBS, including indicator selection. Unlike previous approaches, applying selection criteria at the level of individual indicators, we also use criteria at the aggregate level of the indicator set. We conclude that participatory assessment contributes to mainstreaming urban NBS for sustainable and just cities, provided data is contextualised to local decision-making contexts and the process is designed to amplify marginalised voices.",About Sufficiency
Urban heat island mitigation in the Global Covenant of Mayors: insights from over 7500 local actions,"This study examines the over 7500 urban heat island (UHI) mitigation actions that cities and local authorities included in their action plans as signatories of the Global Covenant of Mayors. The analysis reveals that the majority of the actions deal with greenery and water-based technologies, with very limited use of combinatorial approaches that may deliver higher and longer lasting positive effects by tackling different sources of urban heat. Costs vary according to the category of action, while the timeline for implementation is typically between 4 and 10 years. A number of cities that indicate extreme heat as a hazard of growing intensity and/or frequency are not reporting any precaution against UHI which calls for prioritization in the near future. The analysis further unveils that, while UHI actions typically target a variety of hazards (e.g. extreme heat, droughts, wildfires) and sectors (e.g. buildings, biodiversity, land use planning), limited is the attention to specific vulnerable population groups. We argue that, in light of a just transition to climate resiliency, specific and consistent adaptation plans are of utmost importance.",About Sufficiency
Promoting ecosystem and human health in urban areas using Green Infrastructure: A literature review,"Europe is a highly urbanised continent. The consequent loss and degradation of urban and peri-urban green space could adversely affect ecosystems as well as human health and well-being. The aim of this paper is to formulate a conceptual framework of associations between urban green space, and ecosystem and human health. Through an interdisciplinary literature review the concepts of Green Infrastructure, ecosystem health, and human health and well-being are discussed. The possible contributions of urban and peri-urban green space systems, or Green Infrastructure, on both ecosystem and human health are critically reviewed. Finally, based on a synthesis of the literature a conceptual framework is presented. The proposed conceptual framework highlights many dynamic factors, and their complex interactions, affecting ecosystem health and human health in urban areas. This framework forms the context into which extant and new research can be placed. In this way it forms the basis for a new interdisciplinary research agenda. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Review of the relationship between urban greenspace accessibility and human well-being,"Urban greenspace (UGS) provides residents with various ecosystem services, which contribute to improving the quality of life and health of urban residents. Therefore, UGS plays an important role in urban livability and sustainability. We reviewed studies of UGS accessibility and the effects of UGS on the well-being of urban residents, focusing on the methods for evaluating UGS accessibility, major findings on the relationship between UGS accessibility and residents' PGS use, health, and socioeconomic status, and evaluations of greenspace provisioning in terms of meeting the demand of residents. We found that the major approaches for estimating UGS accessibility include methods based on administrative or census units, distance to the nearest UGS, service area, and gravity-based models. Numerous studies have confirmed the positive relations between accessibility of UGS and its use by residents and its effect on human health. However, the spatial distributions of UGS across a city, especially the urban-suburban gradient, are often uneven. Some studies have found that socioeconomically disadvantaged residents have a lower UGS accessibility, but this finding does not necessarily hold true across the world. We then put forward several suggestions to improve these studies. Future research should quantify the characteristics of UGS, including biodiversity and landscape patterns, and investigate the effects of these factors on the well-being of residents. Studies should include other types of UGS besides parks, and other aspects of human well-being besides health. Numerous case studies should be undertaken in different regions and at different scales to enable comparisons between different socioeconomic and cultural context. Longitudinal studies based on multi-temporal UGS patterns and cohort studies witll provide insights into the dynamic relationship between UGS and the well-being of residents. Furthermore, such studies will clarify how socioeconomic processes affect this relationship, which will support urban planning and management. © 2019 Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica.

Urban gardens as a solution to energy poverty and urban heat island,"In a highly structured environment, as an urban centre, there are impacts for both humans and the environment. The urban heat island effect and energy poverty are impacts of this situation. A common way to deal with the last two impacts is to reduce the temperature by using bioclimatic design. This research is the subject of a project at the Technical University of Crete about the use of urban gardens as a way to reduce the air and surface temperature in Chania, and more specifically in the district of Chalepa. The threats to biodiversity and the idea of urban gardens are presented. In this research, a scenario with absence of vegetation, the current state and two scenarios with different vegetation in urban gardens are analyzed. The first scenario involves horticulture species and the second one the cultivation of aromatic and medicinal species. These scenarios were examined using the numerical model Envi-met after the collection of data needed such as the height of buildings, vegetation characteristics, the location of the area etc. Finally, the scenarios of urban gardens decreased the surface temperature by 10 degrees C from the scenario with absence of vegetation and 5 degrees C from the current state in days of high temperature. However, the differences between these two scenarios were not of great importance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Green infrastructure space and traits (GIST) model: Integrating green infrastructure spatial placement and plant traits to maximize multifunctionality,"Vegetated green infrastructure (GI) is used as a sustainable complement to traditional stormwater infrastructure in many cities and is reported to provide additional benefits such as heat island mediation, crime reduction, increased property values, improved air quality, improved human well-being, improved aesthetics, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration. However, we hypothesize that the simultaneous provisioning of multiple benefits - multifunctionality - is not guaranteed yet may be achieved by planning two critical components of GI: the spatial placement of GI within a city and the traits of the plant species used to vegetate GI. We propose the Green Infrastructure Space and Traits (GIST) model, a new planning tool for evaluating and maximizing GI multifunctionality based on optimizing both site selection and plant traits in GI design to promote urban planning with higher sustainability and benefits to humans. GIST involves identifying priority areas for GI placement and using plant species with traits that maximize benefits and multifunctionality in priority areas. As a case study, we apply GIST to Philadelphia, USA, and identify new locations for GI and plant traits that would increase multifunctionally across the city. For the nine benefits we examined, GIST indicates high potential for multifunctionality for the Philadelphia GI system. An assessment of the GI planning in Philadelphia to date indicates that the actualization of this multifunctionality has not been fully realized and could be improved with strategic GI placement and plant species selection. Further, we identified a cluster of correlated benefits which may be a common pathway for multifunctionality across cities. Overall, our work supports the hypothesis that multifunctional GI is possible when proper planning tools that integrate spatial placement and plant traits are used.",About Sufficiency
Carving out space for community gardens in Australia: Exploring the potential of community gardens as social movements for urban change in Sydney and Canberra,"Australia is one of the world’s most urbanised countries, with 90% of its population residing in cities and towns. Sydney and Melbourne alone have populations with over 4 million; and by 2030 this figure is expected to reach 6 million. Australia is vulnerable to food supply shortages and inequalities, especially in cities. Its ability to feed itself, alongside its share of the global population, is already challenged, and this is expected to become even more so given population growth trends. A 2010 Senate inquiry into food security and the Prime Minister’s Science, Engineering and Innovation Council (PMSEIC) have both drawn attention to these issues. These reports identified that Australia already imports much of its food supply, and a “just in time” supply chain from global producers to local supermarkets is vulnerable to global shocks in production and distribution. The combined impacts of global warming, soil erosion, desertification, drought and population increase are also significant challenges for securing Australia’s food system, leading to continued loss of arable land (Lawrence et al., 2012). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Lynda Shevellar and Peter Westoby; individual chapters, the contributors.",About Sufficiency
"Blue-space availability, environmental quality and amenity use across contrasting socioeconomic contexts","Over 60% of the global population are expected to live in urban areas by 2050. Urban blue spaces are critical for biodiversity, provide a range of ecosystem services, and can promote human health and wellbeing. Despite this, access to blue space is often unequally distributed across socioeconomic gradients, and the availability of quality blue space could extend to environmental justice issues. Three stages of analysis were carried out in Mexico City, Mexico and Bristol, UK to (i) assess associations between blue space and socioeconomic metrics at a regional scale, (ii) apply a rapid assessment tool to assess amenity, access and environmental quality, (iii) consider local quality across socioeconomic gradients at a regional scale. Still water availability was indicative of higher socioeconomic status, but contrasting city evolutions underpinned differences. Locally, there were environmental gradients from more complex to disturbed habitats that influenced potential wellbeing and amenity benefits. In combination, this may exacerbate inequalities and risk increasing ecosystem disservices. If cities are to be socially, and environmentally resilient to higher levels of disturbance in the future, healthy ecosystems will be key. However, further research is needed to address various dimensions of injustice in urban areas beyond blue space distribution. © 2022 The Authors",About Sufficiency
An Ecosystem Service Approach to Assessing Agro-Ecosystems in Urban Landscapes,"Creating sustainable urban landscapes in light of growing population pressures requires interdisciplinary multi-functional solutions. Alternative agro-ecosystems described as food forests, permaculture gardens, and/or edible landscapes among others could offer potential ways to address the social, economic, and ecological goals of various stakeholders simultaneously. Current research is lacking a comprehensive tool that can assess the performance of alternative agro-ecosystems that have both functional and aesthetic values. The present research uses a novel rubric, the Permaculture and Agro-ecosystems Sustainability Scorecard (PASS) that combines agricultural sustainability and ecosystem services (ES) indicators in order to assess alternative agro-ecosystems. The rubric evaluates provisioning, regulating, supporting, economic and cultural ES and includes benefits such as pollinator presence, increased biodiversity, alternative pesticides and fertilizer use, carbon sequestration, food security, and human interactions. Based on the concepts and principles drawn from four popular frameworks and sub-disciplines, namely, SAFE, SITES, permaculture, and agroecology, we identify sixteen broad ES indicators and 59 sub-indices and measure them using data collected through site observation, survey, interviews, and documentary research. For easy comparison across different urban agriculture sites, the above sub-indices are further aggregated into five ES criteria using stakeholder-informed weights. The weights are developed through pair-wise comparison of criteria by sample survey respondents. The PASS framework is used to score twelve sites in South Florida that meet specific criteria in the small farm, residential, and public space categories. Sample respondents place the highest weight on cultural services. Contrary to the popular notion of promoting urban agriculture for food security, the results show that the majority of the sites score highest in the supporting services provided, followed by regulating and cultural services, and lowest in the economic services category. The supporting service for most of the sample sites score consistently very high, close to the highest possible level of 5.0. There is a wide variation in provisioning and economic values across the study sites. The paper offers several ideas for mainstreaming the ES indicators into urban planning and decision-making and some of the practical difficulties one might face along the way. We conclude that in order to realize the broader ES benefits of urban agriculture in particular and agro-ecosystems in general, a multi-pronged policy and planning approach is necessary.",About Sufficiency

"Ecosystem services and tradeoffs in the home food gardens of African American, Chinese-origin and Mexican-origin households in Chicago, IL","With increasing urbanization and environmental degradation, urban landscapes are increasingly expected to provide a wide range of ecosystem services typically associated with rural areas, including biodiversity conservation and food production. Because residential landscapes constitute the largest single urban land use, domestic gardens have emerged as a topic of research interest and planning concern. The ecosystem services (or disservices) these landscapes provide, however, have not been rigorously measured, nor have tradeoffs between the services they provide been assessed. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 59 African American, Chinese-origin or Mexican-origin households with on-lot or vacant lot food gardens in Chicago. Crop plants and cultivated ornamental plants on the lot were inventoried and mapped at the species level. A total of 123 edible plant taxa from 25 families and 288 ornamental plant species from 85 families were identified, for a combined total of 387 species from 90 families. Cumulatively, the gardens of African American households were relatively rich in ornamental plant species and families, while those of Chinese-origin households had a depauperate flora. Crop plant richness was more even across sample types. Shade trees and a developed shrub layer were absent from most gardens, possibly representing a trade off in ecosystem services in favor of food production.

"Mapping the evolution patterns of urbanization, ecosystem service supply-demand, and human well-being: A tree-like landscape perspective","Ecosystem services (ESs) are closely related to human well-being (HWB). Recently, urbanization has increased worldwide, which has had a significant impact on the ecosystem service supply-demand (ESSD) and HWB. However, previous studies have primarily focused on the spatiotemporal pattern of ESSD and HWB, while ignoring their evolutionary pathways, especially in karst areas. We aimed to quantify the optimal trade-offs of ESSD under the constraints of urbanization and the nonlinear relationship between ESSD and HWB, further constructing a tree-like framework to explore the evolutionary pathways of urbanization, ESSD, and HWB from a landscape evolution perspective. We used the production possibility frontier (PPF) to quantify the optimal trade-offs of three ESSDs, the generalized additive model (GAM) to fit the nonlinear relationship between ESSD and HWB, and the geographic evolution tree model (Geotree) to construct the tree-like structure of urbanization levels, comprehensive ecosystem service supply-demand (CESD), and HWB. There is a trade-off between the deficit of carbon storage services (CS) and water yield services (WY), but a synergy between the deficit of WY and the surplus of FS. Further, there is a synergy between the deficit of CSs and the surplus of food supply services (FS). The response of HWB to the ESSD of CS is not obvious, but the response to the ESSD of WY and FS is obvious.

The urban heat island and its impact on heat waves and human health in Shanghai,"With global warming forecast to continue into the foreseeable future, heat waves are very likely to increase in both frequency and intensity. In urban regions, these future heat waves will be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, and will have the potential to negatively influence the health and welfare of urban residents. In order to investigate the health effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in Shanghai, China, 30 years of meteorological records (1975-2004) were examined for 11 first- and second-order weather stations in and around Shanghai. Additionally, automatic weather observation data recorded in recent years as well as daily all-cause summer mortality counts in 11 urban, suburban, and exurban regions (1998-2004) in Shanghai have been used. The results show that different sites (city center or surroundings) have experienced different degrees of warming as a result of increasing urbanization. In turn, this has resulted in a more extensive urban heat island effect, causing additional hot days and heat waves in urban regions compared to rural locales. An examination of summer mortality rates in and around Shanghai yields heightened heat-related mortality in urban regions, and we conclude that the UHI is directly responsible, acting to worsen the adverse health effects from exposure to extreme thermal conditions. © ISB 2009.",About Sufficiency
"Evaluating the sensitivity of the i-Tree Eco pollution model to different pollution data inputs: A case study from Warsaw, Poland","Urban trees provide a range of ecosystem services, including air purification. This specific ecosystem service can be quantified using i-Tree Eco software, but the software has some limitations. One limitation is that the pollution model used in the software cannot take into account spatial differences in pollutant concentrations, which occur in every city due to the diversity of polluters. This study aimed to investigate to what extent this limitation of the i-Tree Eco pollution model can influence the results obtained. The study was conducted in such a way that the i-Tree Eco project was broken down into four sub-projects, in which data on the concentration of selected pollutants from different air quality monitoring stations were analyzed using the coefficient of variation (CV). Three stations were designated as ""urban background"" type stations and one was a ""traffic"" type station. The study revealed relatively low variation (0.05 < CV < 0.23) in estimated quantities obtained based on concentrations of pollutants retrieved from different air quality monitoring stations of the same type (""urban background"" type stations) and relatively high variation (0.24 < CV < 0.57) in estimated quantities obtained on data retrieved from different types of stations (""urban background"" versus ""traffic""). When data on air pollutant concentrations used in the model is from the ""traffic"" station type, trees provide air purification ecosystem services with an annual value almost twice as high (EUR 310 000) as when the data used is from ""urban background"" stations type (EUR 165 000).

Introduction to Green Roof Ecosystems,"Green roofs have been heralded as a ""sustainable building practice"" in cities throughout the world as one response to mounting environmental stresses. A range of stressors plus erosion of aesthetics and human well being in urban areas have initiated policies and practices often with incentives to develop green infrastructure such as green roofs. They provide a suite of public and private benefits most of which map onto services generally provided by the ecosystem. Green roof development imbeds in environmental design processes and is constrained by both human and environmental factors. As relatively small, simple, anthropogenic ecosystems, green roofs relate to several existing conceptual and applied ecological ideas. Understanding and applying from ecology and ecosystem studies, ecological engineering, managed ecosystems, construction ecology, urban ecology, landscape ecology, restoration ecology, reconciliation ecology, soil ecology and community ecology show green roof ecosystems can be created to cycle energy and nutrients. Furthermore, green roofs can be constructed to model an ecosystem and may provide a setting for testing ecological concepts.

Prioritizing urban nature-based solutions to support scaling-out strategies: A case study in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Nature-based solutions (NbS) can synergistically improve human well-being and biodiversity in urban areas by enhancing ecosystem functions and services. Scaling out NbS, understood as the widespread application of NbS in multiple contexts, is an important policy ambition to increase the number of people and regions benefiting from NbS. However, designing scaling-out strategies requires considering critical aspects of the nexus between NbS and ecosystem services (ES) supply to yield large-scale benefits effectively. The aim of the study is twofold: (i) to simulate the stepwise implementation of multiple NbS and (ii) to quantify their cumulative impacts on ES supply and beneficiaries. The NbS implementation was guided by a method that prioritizes different NbS types in multiple sites, by combining spatial information on ES demand and land suitability with a qualitative description of ES supply by NbS type. The cumulative impacts were computed stepwise using GIS modeling. The study was conducted in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain), focusing on five types of NbS (urban forests, urban parks, community gardens, infiltration ponds), and five ES (runoff mitigation, stormwater treatment, soil erosion control, recreation, and food supply). Overall, 179 NbS were simulated in 130 sites distributed in the city. The findings showed an improvement in all services, albeit significant increments occurred only for certain services. We observed a non-linear relationship between NbS and impacts, including constant, positive, and negative trends. We discussed several factors that were determinants of impacts, providing insights on how to design scaling-out strategies from the biophysical perspective. Moreover, we reflected on the role of multifunctionality, social preferences, and economic feasibility as prioritization criteria for NbS.

None of pesticide residues were found in the crop products. The crops from peri-urban farming of the Great Bandung were safely consumed. Meanwhile, the sustainability of urban farming in the peripheral areas of Great Bandung might be lasted so far as the upstream river pollution from the city could be well-maintained. © 2023 WITPress.

Using crowdsourced data to estimate the carbon footprints of global cities,"Cities are at the forefront of the battle against climate change. However, intercity comparisons and responsibility allocations among cities are hindered because cost- and time-effective methods to calculate the carbon footprints of global cities have yet to be developed. Here, we establish a hybrid method integrating top-down input–output analysis and bottom-up crowdsourced data to estimate the carbon footprints of global cities. Using city purchasing power as the main predictor of the carbon footprint, we estimate the carbon footprints of 465 global cities in 2020. Those cities comprise 10% of the global population but account for 18% of the global carbon emissions showing a significant concentration of carbon emissions. The Gini coefficients are applied to show that global carbon inequality is less than income inequality. In addition, the increased carbon emissions that come from high consumption lifestyles offset the carbon reduction by efficiency gains that could result from compact city design and large city scale. Large climate benefits could be obtained by achieving a low-carbon transition in a small number of global cities, emphasizing the need for leadership from globally important urban centres. © 2022 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency
Bridging the land use gap: Examining tree canopy cover and connectivity by land use in 10 U.S. cities,"Areas of high tree canopy cover, especially connected tree canopy cover, provide habitat to support biodiversity and cooling to ameliorate the urban heat island effect. However, the nature-based solutions provided by trees are not distributed equally; land use contributes to this systematic inequality because the places where it is easiest to plant trees are often not where trees are needed most. To better understand the gaps and opportunities for tree planting across the urban landscape, we examine the distribution of tree canopy cover and connectivity by land use in 10 U.S. cities. We find that parks have the greatest tree canopy coverage followed by single-family residential areas, multi-family residential areas, and industrial land uses. On average, single-family neighborhoods had 8.5 % points more tree canopy coverage than multi-family neighborhoods, with gaps as high as 18.6 % points. Looking at the size of connected tree canopy, we find that residential land uses are home to more small contiguous tree canopy patches (>1 ha in area), while parks have more large contiguous tree canopy (>12 ha in area). We compare the contiguous tree canopy findings to tree planting policy in each city to examine the influence of intentional planning for tree connectivity, and close with policy-oriented implications of our results. Namely, we suggest: 1) closing the gap between single-family and multi-family tree canopy cover, 2) factoring connectivity into tree planting and preservation, and 3) taking a context-specific approach to increase tree cover in industrial areas in order to more equitably distribute the climate, ecological, and health benefits of trees. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH",About Sufficiency
Policy Options to Support Climate-Conscious Urban Water Planning,"Urban water systems are increasingly vulnerable to climate change. Traditional planning, often based on past conditions, fails to address these new challenges. We suggest policy options for integrating climate scenarios into urban water planning, which will enhance the resilience of drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater systems. The policy options are (1) requiring climate scenario analysis in planning processes, (2) developing climate-resilient infrastructure standards, (3) promoting low-impact development and nature-based solutions, (4) creating regional planning bodies, (5) educating professionals for climate-responsive planning, and (6) securing funding for climate adaptation. We discuss our experience in the state of Utah, USA, and summarize case studies in Copenhagen, New York, and Melbourne. The policy options align with Sustainable Development Goals and offer a roadmap for building adaptable, sustainable urban water systems.",About Sufficiency
"Urban Wetlands as EcoHaven Oasis: Hydrogeochemical Insights from the Inciralti-Cakalburnu Urban Wetland (ICUW) in Izmir, Turkiye","Urban wetlands provide vital ecological services, yet their hydrogeochemical dynamics and associated risks remain insufficiently explored, especially within urban contexts. This study aims to evaluate the Inciralti-Cakalburnu Urban Wetland (ICUW) in Izmir, Turkey, as a case study for understanding the complex interactions between water quality, contamination risks, and urban development. The ICUW, a unique example of a natural coastal urban wetland, offers critical services such as flood regulation, water purification, and carbon sequestration, while also being vulnerable to contamination from agricultural runoff, seawater and geothermal water intrusion. Key findings include significant variations in water quality parameters: pH values range from 6.73 to 9.00, electrical conductivity (EC) from 911 to 61,700 μS/cm, and total dissolved solids (TDS) from 631 to 42,935 mg/L. Notably, concentrations of heavy metals such as arsenic (0.002–0.0048 mg/L), boron (0.060–39.6 mg/L), bromide (0.100–80.8 mg/L), fluoride (0.130–4.2 mg/L) and nitrate (0.5–193 mg/L) exceed recommended levels, posing health risks. The Water Quality Index (WQI) classification shows a wide range from ""excellent"" to ""unsuitable for drinking,"" indicating significant spatial variability. Health Risk Assessments (HRA) identify B, Br, F, and NO3 as the primary contaminants of concern, especially in areas impacted by seawater intrusion, agricultural activities and natural geothermal fluids mixing. The use of stable isotope analysis reveals marine and freshwater interactions, which influence the water's chemical composition. This study underscores the importance of sustainable management practices to mitigate contamination risks, safeguard public health, and preserve the multifunctional role of urban wetlands in enhancing urban resilience and climate adaptation. © The Author(s) 2025.",About Sufficiency
Cross-country variation in people's connection to nature,"Enhancing pro-nature behavior across societies is a key sustainability challenge, with people's connection to nature recognized as a primary driver. Understanding how this connection varies across countries and regions and the factors influencing it is, therefore, a crucial step in addressing this challenge. However, this remains poorly understood due to the scarcity of cross-country studies, particularly outside the Global North. Using data from a survey spanning 23 countries worldwide, we identified substantial variations in individuals’ psychological (cognitive) and physical (experiential) connections to nature. These differences are influenced by several country-level factors, such as socioeconomic development and the extent of cultivated land, alongside individual-level factors like education level and social status. The broad variation in connection to nature revealed by our study provides valuable insights for predicting large-scale spatial patterns of this connection and identifying regions where targeted efforts are most needed to strengthen it effectively. © 2025 The Authors",About Sufficiency

Nature-based Solutions in Bangladesh: Evidence of Effectiveness for Addressing Climate Change and Other Sustainable Development Goals,"Many lower-income countries are highly vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters and climate change, due to their geographical location and high levels of poverty. In response, they are developing climate action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones, relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty, supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors: support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines. More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed. Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in national planning policies.",About Sufficiency
Ecosystem services in cities: Towards the international legal protection of ecosystem services in urban environments,"Biodiversity provides many ecosystem services in cities that are beneficial to human well-being including adaptation to the effects of climate change and positive effects of nature on human health. Rapid urbanization however is causing an adverse impact on biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. Protecting and restoring urban biodiversity and ecosystem services can increase human well-being of the rapidly increasing urban population. Today, however, the international biodiversity conservation practice mainly focuses on rural areas, and not on urban conservation and restoration. Within city scale, there are several opportunities to green urban living, such as green infrastructure and urban parks and nature reserves. This paper investigates the current scientific practices for promoting and protecting ecosystem services in urban areas. Secondly, the authors review and assess the legally binding instruments on biodiversity at the international and EU level in order to see if there are sufficient existing mechanisms for protection of ecosystem services in urban areas.

Plant-pollinator interactions in urban ecosystems worldwide: A comprehensive review including research funding and policy actions,"Urbanization has rapidly increased in recent decades and the negative effects on biodiversity have been widely reported. Urban green areas can contribute to improving human well-being, maintaining biodiversity, and ecosystem services (e.g. pollination). Here we examine the evolution of studies on plant-pollinator interactions in urban ecosystems worldwide, reviewing also research funding and policy actions. We documented a significant increase in the scientific production on the theme in recent years, especially in the temperate region; tropical urban ecosystems are still neglected. Plant-pollinator interactions are threatened by urbanization in complex ways, depending on the studied group (plant or pollinator [generalist or specialist]) and landscape characteristics. Several research opportunities emerge from our review. Research funding and policy actions to pollination/pollinator in urban ecosystems are still scarce and concentrated in developed countries/temperate regions. To make urban green spaces contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services, transdisciplinary approaches (ecological-social-economic-cultural) are needed.",About Sufficiency
Urban forest visitors’ perceptions of biodiversity and its effects on their well-being,"The rapid loss of biological diversity due to human activities has increased interest in understanding the interdependencies between humans and biodiversity. The evidence base for the health and well-being effects of nature-based recreation is strong, but less is known about the role of biodiversity. This qualitative study explores the complex relationship between perceived biodiversity and well-being through the following questions: 1) how do visitors of an urban forest perceive different aspects of biodiversity, and 2) how do the different aspects of biodiversity affect their perceived well-being? These biodiversity aspects applied are species encountering, diversity and abundance, interactions between species, natural processes, sounds, colors, shapes, textures, smells, and seasonal changes. The data consists of semi-structured interviews of participants (n = 12) on two guided visits in the Lahti Health Forest, Finland. The participants paid effortlessly attention to sounds, colors, and strong natural smells, whereas processes, textures, and shapes required more focus. Perceptions were affected by intentionality, activity, mindset, ecological knowledge, quality, and familiarity with a forest. The findings indicate that the multisensory experience of biodiversity is significant for the restorative and stress reduction potential of a recreational forest. At the same time, processes, seasonal changes, and textures are meaningful regarding spiritual well-being. The findings emphasize the potential of biodiverse nature to improve well-being comprehensively. By paying attention to the perceivable attributes of biodiversity in urban areas and promoting the recreational use of biodiverse natural environments, mutual benefits could be achieved for both biodiversity protection and human well-being. © 2025 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Mapping human health risks from ecosystems (EHRs) based on vegetation census data,"Ecosystem benefits and services assessments are widely used in the current urban ecological management strategies to enhance benefits of ecosystems to urban residents, but ecosystems are not benign entities that exist solely for human benefit. Plagues, diseases, and other ecosystem-generated health risks (EHRs) have caused huge losses of life and property. In promoting systematic and comprehensive urban development and the quality of life for residents, Risk reduction for EHRs cannot be ignored. As existing studies of EHRs mapping remain relatively few. This paper proposed a mapping method based on vegetation census data for two EHRs: human-bat contact infection risk (HBCIR) and human-pollen contact sensitization risk (HPCSR). Results showed that: (1) The bat distribution risk (SBR) and the pollen sensitizing plant distribution risk (ROSDmean) were higher in woodlands and areas around reservoirs where habitat conditions are better across the city. (2) The areas with higher HBCIR and HPCSR were mainly located in the central and western parts of Shenzhen, especially in the surrounding densely populated areas with better habitat conditions. (3) All streets differed significantly from each other in HBCIR and HPCSR distribution characteristics, three streets, Huafu, Meilin and Donghu, had higher risk values. The results can provide guidance to policymaker in their work on biodiversity conservation, health risk control, and tree species application. Additionally, the methodology adopted in this study may inspire future researches on the spatialization of other EHRs. © 2024",About Sufficiency
Towards sustainable urban water management: an ecological compensation framework for sponge cities,"Rapid urbanization and climate change have intensified water-related challenges in urban areas, requiring innovative solutions for sustainable water management. This study critically examines China’s sponge city initiative, which integrates green infrastructure and ecological principles to enhance urban water resilience. The research identifies key challenges, including inadequate planning, design inconsistencies, and financial sustainability issues, which hinder the full realization of ecosystem service benefits. To address these gaps, we propose a novel ecological compensation framework that integrates the ecosystem services framework with urban planning and public payment mechanisms. Our four-step methodology leverages low impact development practices to enhance policy efficacy, aligning urban development with ecological integrity and sustainability. By transitioning from ecosystem service recognition to a publicly funded compensation model, this approach ensures the financial viability of sponge city projects, fosters broad societal participation, and supports resilient urban development. Importantly, the developed framework is adaptable, making it applicable to sponge city initiatives worldwide. It offers a flexible, evidence-based strategy for cities facing similar water management challenges, promoting ecological resilience while ensuring long-term financial sustainability. This study contributes to global urban water management discourse, providing a scalable model that supports integrated, community-backed urban planning and sets a new standard for sponge city development. © 2024 The Author(s).

Emotional State as a Key Driver of Public Preferences for Flower Color,"Flowers, as integral elements of urban landscapes, are critical not only for aesthetic purposes but also for fostering human-nature interactions in green spaces. However, research on flower color preferences has largely been descriptive, and there is a lack of exploration of potential mechanisms influencing flower color preferences, such as economic and social factors. This study created visual samples through precise color adjustment techniques and introduced the L*, a*, and b* parameters from the CIELAB color system to quantify the flower colors of the survey samples, conducting an online survey with 354 Chinese residents. The complex aesthetic process's driving factors were unveiled through a comprehensive analysis using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM), a piecewise Structural Equation Model (SEM), and linear regression models. The results show that the public's flower color preference is primarily related to the a* and b* parameters, which represent color dimensions in the CIELAB color space, and it is not significantly related to L* (lightness). Factors such as age, annual household income level (AI), personal income sources (PI), nature experience, and emotional state (TMD) significantly influence color preferences, with emotional state identified as the most critical factor. Lastly, linear regression models further explain the potential mechanism of the influencing factors. This study proposes a framework to assist urban planners in selecting flower colors that resonate with diverse populations, enhancing both the attractiveness of urban green spaces and their potential to promote pro-environmental behavior. By aligning flower color design with public preferences, this study contributes to sustainable urban planning practices aimed at improving human well-being and fostering deeper connections with nature.",About Sufficiency

Urban ecosystems assessment: An integrated approach to maintenance of habitats and their biodiversity,"Natural habitats and their biodiversity are usually associated with protected areas, incompatible with direct anthropogenic influence. Is there a biodiversity in urban environment, what is the role of peri-urban areas to the provision of species richness and is their potential being properly utilized? These are current issues that deserve the attention of decision-makers because the human's need of natural environment in cities is expressed more intensely than in any previous period in history. Green and blue infrastructure elements, being part of the larger system of urban ecosystems, provide an essential and proven benefits to the city dwellers, like health improvement, opportunities for nature-based daily outdoor recreation, strengthening sense of place etc. The main objective of this research is to assess this part of the landscape elements in urban and peri-urban environment, which are most supportive to the maintenance of habitats and their biodiversity. Selected Functional urban area with center city of Burgas is choosen for a case study. The urban ecosystems are assessed in GIS environment with unified indicator (based on City Biodiversity Index approach) according to 5 criteria: hemeroby index, share of protected areas, fragmentation index, presence of water and species richness. The assessment is performed on two spatial levels: within Functional urban area by Urban Atlas spatial units and within urban core – by grid cells (local climate zones). The final higher scores identify areas that provide the greatest extent the maintenance of habitats and their biodiversity. The results could support the urban planning and help to optimize the link between the natural elements within the Functional urban areas, providing ecological, economic and social benefits to the regions through the enhancement of the urban ecosystem’s functions and their services. © L.

Modeling air quality regulation by green infrastructure in a Mediterranean coastal urban area: The removal of PM10 in the Metropolitan City of Naples (Italy),"The amelioration of air quality represents one of the most complex challenges that the European Union is facing today. Although a successful strategy to improve air quality should decisively act on pollution sources, Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) may provide a huge contribution to tackle air pollution, while delivering a wide range of Ecosystem Services and enhancing the Natural Capital. In this paper, we analyzed, in both biophysical and monetary terms, the role of the Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) in improving air quality in the Metropolitan City of Naples (Southern Italy) by implementing an accounting model of PM10 removal. Our findings indicate that about 1,148 Mg of PM10 were annually removed by the UGI, for a monetary value of 36 million euros per year. We also assessed the impact of a devastating wildfire that occurred in 2017 in the study area, which resulted in a loss of PM10 removal of about 97 Mg and led to an estimated monetary loss of 3 million euros per year. The results also showed that PM10 removal efficiency largely varies seasonally and across different functional groups of vegetation, highlighting the role of functional biodiversity in the provision of Ecosystem Services under Mediterranean climate conditions. In conclusion, we maintain that the biophysical and economic assessment of Ecosystem Services can support local managers and policymakers in charge of developing urban planning strategies aimed at ensuring sustainable development and human well-being in metropolitan cities.",About Sufficiency
"Enhancing ecosystem management through social-ecological inventories: Lessons from Kristianstads Vattenrike, Sweden","Environmental policy increasingly emphasizes involvement of local users and land owners in ecosystem management, but conservation planning is still largely a bureaucratic-scientific endeavour of identifying biological values for protection. Neither biological inventories nor stakeholder analyses, that tend to focus on conflicting interests, capture human resources in the landscape or the social structures and processes underlying biological conservation values. Social-ecological inventories are therefore proposed during the preparation phase of conservation projects as a means to identify people with ecosystem knowledge that practise ecosystem management. The method presented here focuses on local steward groups acting outside official management plans. In a social-ecological inventory of a river basin of southern Sweden, local steward groups, their ecosystem management activities, motives and links to other actors involved in ecosystem management were identified through interviews, participatory observations and a review of documents and other written material. Several hundred active local stewards were organized in 10 local steward groups that managed and monitored a range of ecosystem services at different spatial scales. Contributions of local stewards included on-site ecosystem management, long-term and detailed monitoring of species and ecosystem dynamics, local ecological knowledge, public support for ecosystem management and specialized networks. Two conservation projects are used to illustrate how local steward groups came together in multi-level networks and collaborated around specific conservation issues. The projects have been linked to ecosystem management at the landscape level through a flexible municipality organization, the Ecomuseum Kristianstads Vattenrike (EKV). EKV has acted as a 'bridging organization', coordinating and connecting many of the local steward groups to organizations and institutions at other levels. The process has been guided by social capital and shared visions for the whole landscape. The study shows that ecosystem management likely relies on multi-level collaboration and social-ecological inventories may help identify actors that are fundamental in such management systems. Social-ecological inventories should be employed in any attempt to develop and implement ecosystem management. © 2007 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.",About Sufficiency
Nature-based Solutions (NbS) for addressing water scarcity in the Mediterranean Ecoregion of Chile,"Natural-based Solutions (NbS) allow us to face socio-environmental challenges and risks through the protection, restoration and sustainable management of ecosystems, providing human well-being and increasing biodiversity.

For this, conflicts associated with water scarcity in the CME were collected and NBS were identified to face similar conflicts in other regions of the world. Three categories of NBS were identified: (i) watershed restoration and green infrastructure, (ii) ancestral and natural infrastructure, and (iii) integrated agricultural practices. This analysis indicates that the simultaneous use of these three strategies can contribute to the resolution of water conflicts in CME. NBS are projected as an efficient and integrating option to face the problems of water scarcity, since they are considered within national policies and designed according to the environmental conditions and social context of each sector in conflict.",About Sufficiency

"Eco-Efficiency Assessment and Food Security Potential of Home Gardening: A Case Study in Padua, Italy","In the expanding urban agriculture phenomenon in Europe, home gardens are a traditional form that have kept agriculture within cities, even becoming crucial in certain historical periods (e.g., war periods). However, horticultural practices in home gardens can also have negative consequences. The goal of this paper is to assess the eco-efficiency of home gardens as a type of urban agriculture. To do so, a case study in Padua (Italy) was evaluated following life cycle assessment and life cycle costing methods. A home garden of 30.6 m(2) and 21 crop cycles were evaluated. The functional unit of the assessment was 1 kg of harvested fresh vegetable at the consumption point, and the ReCiPe method was employed for impact assessment. Environmental assessment indicated that organic fertilization, use of tap water, mineral fertilization and pesticides were the most contributing elements of the entire life cycle. Furthermore, the relevance of garden design and crop selection was a determinant in the eco-efficiency results.

Contribution of Home Gardens to Sustainable Development: Perspectives from A Supported Opinion Essay,"Home gardening has a long history that started when humans became sedentary, being traditionally considered an accessible source of food and medicinal plants to treat common illnesses. With trends towards urbanization and industrialization, particularly in the post-World War II period, the importance of home gardens as important spaces for growing food and medicinal plants reduced and they began to be increasingly seen as decorative and leisure spaces. However, the growing awareness of the negative impacts of agricultural intensification and urbanization for human health, food quality, ecosystem resilience, and biodiversity conservation motivated the emergence of new approaches concerning home gardens. Societies began to question the potential of nearby green infrastructures to human wellbeing, food provisioning, and the conservation of traditional varieties, as well as providers of important services, such as ecological corridors for wild species and carbon sinks. In this context. and to foster adaptive and resilient social–ecological systems, our supported viewpoint intends to be more than an exhaustive set of perceptions, but a reflection of ideas about the important contribution of home gardens to sustainable development. We envision these humble spaces strengthening social and ecological components, by providing a set of diversified and intermingled goods and services for an increasingly urban population. © 2022 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
"Exploring connections among nature, biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human health and well-being: Opportunities to enhance health and biodiversity conservation","We are at a key juncture in history where biodiversity loss is occurring daily and accelerating in the face of population growth, climate change, and rampant development. Simultaneously, we are just beginning to appreciate the wealth of human health benefits that stem from experiencing nature and biodiversity. Here we assessed the state of knowledge on relationships between human health and nature and biocliversity, and prepared a comprehensive listing of reported health effects. We found strong evidence linking biodiversity with production of ecosystem services and between nature exposure and human health, but many of these studies were limited in rigor and often only correlative. Much less information is available to link biodiversity and health. However, some robust studies indicate that exposure to microbial biodiversity can improve health, specifically in reducing certain allergic and respiratory diseases. Overall, much more research is needed on mechanisms of causation. Also needed are a re envisioning of land use planning that places human well-being at the center and a new coalition of ecologists, health and social scientists and planners to conduct research and develop policies that promote human interaction with nature and biodiversity.

Descriptive information about each site, the biodiversity of the selected plots and soil samples from different depths and locations were collected and analysed for chemical and biological parameters. Seven metals, total and plant-available (Colwell) phosphorus and available nitrogen were measured in soils. A glasshouse bioassay was also conducted to determine the abundance of beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soils and the change of root colonization after inoculation with the mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Results showed a generally high biodiversity of plants that correlated with site activity (commercial or community garden) and which could potentially be used for urban biodiversity conservation. Metal concentrations in soils were below national guidelines levels for all samples, although sites with previous industrial history showed elevated levels when compared to sites without industrial history. The use of raised beds with introduced soils eliminated differences in previous land-use history, thereby providing a good option to support cleaner production. Gardening soils were considered highly fertile, with plant-available (Colwell) P concentrations exceeding recommended levels for most horticultural crops, while soils were adequately supplied with nitrogen. Most plant nutrients were derived from freely available urban waste streams and integrated via composting. Various urban waste streams could be used to counter-act imbalanced soil nutrients. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were present in all sites, indicating that the practiced soil management is sustainable from a microbial perspective. Given their important role in supporting plant nutrition, and potential to reduce the need for external nutrient inputs, they provide an important focal point for achieving clean and sustainable urban food production. The results were incorporated into a framework for the management of urban soil health. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
"Walking for Joy? Using a living laboratory to shift to more climate-friendly lifestyles in Santiago, Chile","Two-track thinking about climate change and related sustainability challenges reflects the tendency for people to express concern but, notwithstanding, continue life as usual, making no changes in lifestyles or political agendas. How to overcome this phenomenon has come to the fore as central to meeting energy, transport and other targets for limiting global warming enough to ensure human societies do not collapse. Mobilizing the right emotions, in the right socio-cultural contexts, has proven a major challenge, amidst the failure of conventional communications methods. These typically assume an information deficit: the erroneous belief that people will change if they have more facts. This study involved a practical application of current thinking about cultural trauma, using everyday walking as a vehicle for change. It contributes to current knowledge in three dimensions. It uses walking and walkability to examine the challenge of moving from knowledge to action in a highly urbanized, middle-income country, Chile, which is rapidly transitioning toward “development” but still has a long way to go. It focuses on how to connect theory with real streets, in a troubled but resilient neighborhood, Bellavista, in Metropolitan Santiago. And it innovated using a transdisciplinary, activism-based, action research methodology. Addressing crime, gender and childhood in walking-related strategies effectively encouraged more sustainable living, improving links with local food and community gardens, shared meals, and walking-cycling among older adults, families and children. Improving social solidarity and connection proved an essential first step to open up pathways with strong potential for improving sustainability.

Definition Expression on the Concept of Urban Ecotourism through Theoretical Review of Related Challenges,"Introduction: To explore the basis of ecotourism, we should look for the basis of literature concerning the tourism development and emersion of sustainability though it. Tourism planning has progressed over this period after the WWII, with a detonation of economic and marketing ideas coming to tourism planning. Thus, it is called ""Boosterism"" which we cannot consider it as a model of planning at all and model of ""Mass tourism"" with the belief of ""the more is the better"" was the best idea for its tourism development. Economic approach, with marketing techniques as its tolls is the next step in tourism development. During the 1970s, the results of tourism development proceeded, was an uneven distribution of benefits, and recognition of multitude of negative tourism's impacts became more evident, so the question of development raised up as ""growth paradigm"" which referred ""cautionary perspective"" to this school of thought which this perspective might be considered as the physical/spatial planning tradition. The summery of evolution in the Think/Idea, Model and Tools in Tourism development after WWII are mentioned in Table 1. (Table Presented) During the 80's decades there are a great discussion between the tourism planning literature and language of marketing to prolong the destination's growth stage. In late 1980, the theorizers described the model of ""soft tourism"" and considered it as the new development model instead of mass tourism. Also during this period ""responsible tourism"", ""green tourism"", and ""appropriate tourism"" introduced as new terms. The concept of sustainable tourism was bring together in the late 1980's by the tourism industry's reaction to the Brundtland report on sustainable development following the WCED in 1987. Some explains that conference report ""Our Common Future"" as ""Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"". All above discussions and critics replaced by the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, that marked the beginning of a worldwide commitment which replaced Sustainable development (as a right in Agenda 21) must be applied in a way that respond to the social and environmental needs of current and future generation. But the problem was it is ignored on the working agenda and three pillars. In Barbados Conference it was for the first time that ""sustainable tourism"" and ""nature based tourism"" recognized as the branch of the sustainable development in final dissertation and action plans, and also ecotourism, economic growth and environmental preservation introduced as sustainable tourism development elements in all conference branches. Discussion and Results: The article, explore the discussion on ecotourism through an expansion of its meaning starts from the Hetzer states about ""ecological tourism"" and then other theorizers, and then explore discussion about ""the concept of ecotourism"" through the viewpoints of some critic. They all can be concluded as below items: • Sustainable use of biodiversity and natural resources; • Impact minimisation, both upon the natural and socio-cultural environment, especially in therms of climate change energy, energy consumption and traditional cultures; • Empowerment and fully informed participation of local stakeholders, particularly local communities and indigenous peoples; • Awarness-raising and environmental education of all stakeholders, especially travellers and hosts; • Lasting economic benefits for all actors. In comparison of the meaning and concept of ecotourism, we have one important question: why ""small scale"" and ""the exact location-the location where action of ecotourism occurs"" is not mentioned in above five elements? By literature review, it is obviously that although there is no great dissension between theorizers but there is not any common agreement on the discussion about that question too. There is a discussion about comparison of the mass tourism and soft tourism and he conclude that mass tourism ought to be useful for preserved areas, so it can be rejected the small scale. Also it can be drawn two polar of extremes for continuum of ecotourism paradigm. One pole is the view that all tourism (including ecotourism) has negative impacts on the nature. Conversely in the other pole, human are viewed as living creatures (as it called fauna) - whose behavior and activities is inevitably ""natural""⋯ so therefore human behavior is ""natural"". As the human is part of the ""natural process"" and, as a result, they are literally unable and powerless to act and behave unnaturally. Therefore, no differention between ecotourism and other models of tourism in terms of their ""naturalness"" and thus, all ecotourism is tourism and conversely. This argument shows that there are no common agreements on the scale of ecotourism. So as it concluded in article three items can be considered as the common agreement on the concept of ecotourism: • Environmental/Biodiversity conservation and reduction of travel and development impacts; • Local economic empowerment; • Education through ecological and cultural Travel and experience. After 1990's decade correlated with the world acceptation on the definitions of ecotourism, the experimental activities tried to implement the concept of ecotourism in the urban area. This pragmatically activity starts with the activities of Green Tourism Association (GTA) in the city of Toronto in 1996. The next important step was the first international Urban Ecotourism Conference hold in in 2004, in its declaration, it respect Urban Ecotourism as an ongoing opportunity to conserve biological and social diversity, create new jobs and improve the quality of life and delivered declaration by these four goal as it deliberately defined by Planeta: • Restoring and conserving natural and cultural heritage including natural landscapes and biodiversity, and indigenous cultures; • Maximizing local benefits and engaging the local community as owners, investors, hosts and guides; • Educating visitors and residents on environmental matters, heritage resources, sustainability; • Reducing our ecological footprint. In the article it discussed ideas and implemented project according to the urban ecotourism. All those projects have this hypothesis that urban ecotourism is an applied idea so all of them try to implement their ideas by experiment them in a real urban region. According to all of them, urban ecotourism is an opportunity to conserve our urban areas and make it more sustainable. Some experimental articles is tried to define the dimension of urban ecotourism using fuzzy numbers construction. They tried to introduce an alternative approach, the fuzzy number construction approach, to construct Sustainable Urban Ecotourism Indicators System (SUEIS), which may contribute to the understanding of urban ecotourism, and to excavate the discrepancies of urban ecotourism and traditional ecotourism. The most important thing is that a relative unanimity is in the urban ecotourism theorizers article and case study. Constituents of their principles includes the concept of ecotourism which deployed expressions like these in their work. The concept of urban ecotourism consequence of the experimented and discussion can be draw in a diagram as below: (Figure Presented) Conclusion: Most of the theorizers believe that urban ecotourism is a Contradiction in term. In this regard there are some practitioners who implemented the ecotourism in an urban region. Conversely, the group believed in urban ecotourism, predicate others as ""traditional ecotourism"" and try to deduce theirselves. In this article by discussion on evolutionary configuring the concept of ecotourism, it tries to consequence that there is no differention between two groups. In the other hand, the urban ecotourism is not a new paradigm and according to their pragmatist approaches it depends on the three main concept which those are as same as the ecotourism. While urban ecotourism is a burgeoning subject in the research of ecotourism, more attempts are needed to interpret the contents of urban ecotourism.",About Sufficiency
Opportunities and limitations for Nature-Based Solutions in EU policies - Assessed with a focus on ponds and pondscapes,"Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) are growing in popularity to mitigate and adapt to climate change, enhance biodiversity, and secure human well-being. However, the emergence of NBS has not generated equal attention for all ecosystems. One such neglected ecosystem are ponds and pondscapes (i.e. groups of ponds in a landscape), which are deteriorating in quality and diminishing in quantity. As the European Union (EU) is regarded as influential in the conceptualisation and operationalisation of NBS, we conducted a qualitative content analysis of 38 EU policies to identify opportunities and limitations for the implementation of ponds and pondscapes as NBS. We focus our analysis on ponds and pondscapes, but their prevalence in different landscapes and their multitude of benefits allows us to also make some inferences about the implications of the EU policy context for NBS at large. We find that EU policies strengthen NBS linked to existing and potential Natura 2000 sites, as well as to ecosystems protected through the EU's Birds and Habitats Directives and Water Framework Directive. However, if ecosystems fall outside of these already established policies - as is the case with the vast majority of ponds and pondscapes - their implementation as NBS may be hampered. We also find that the EU emphasises natural water retention measures and carbon-rich ecosystems for climate change adaptation and mitigation, but mostly does not explicitly include ponds and pondscapes despite their potential contributions. Other findings are that the EU's Horizon Europe research policy will likely influence which ecosystems will be used and financed as NBS, while the exact ambition and selection of NBS rests with lower-level authorities or individuals. Therefore, further studies tracing the impact of the supra-national EU policy framework at lower governance levels are vital.",About Sufficiency
"Quantifying the local-scale ecosystem services provided by urban treed streetscapes in Bolzano, Italy","Urban green infrastructure has the potential to offer multiple ecosystem services to society. However, there is little information about the role of these tree dominated, public streetscapes on the local-scale provision of ecosystem services in European mid-sized cities. In the present study, we explored the local-scale effects of different tree dominated streetscape types on mitigating temperatures and air pollution in the city of Bolzano, Italy by integrating the ENVI-met and UFORE models as well as local field, pollution and climate data. We found that total estimated air pollution removal by trees in Bolzano was 2.42 metric tons per year (t/yr); with ozone (1.2 t/yr) being the pollutant most removed and carbon monoxide (0.03 t/yr) the least. Total air pollution removal (901.4 kg/yr) was greatest in parks. Total biogenic volatile organic compound emissions, an ecosystem disservice, were also estimated. The ENVI-met simulations found that urban trees can reduce streetscape temperatures by up to 2 degrees C during the summer and improve human thermal comfort. Results can be used to better understand the dynamics of local-scale ecosystem services of mid-size European cities and to better assess the role of urban streetscapes and green infrastructure in improving human well-being and mitigating the effects of climate change.",About Sufficiency
Ecosystem Services in the Milpa System: A Systematic Review,"The Milpa System is an ancient agroecosystem that has played a crucial role in Mesoamerican agriculture for over 9,000 years, particularly in Mexico and Central America. This system provides essential ecosystem services, such as food production, soil quality restoration, biodiversity conservation and the transmission of ecological knowledge. The objective of this systematic review is to inventory and analyse the potential ecosystem services provided by the Milpa System and similar maize-based intercropping systems. The review followed the PRISMA methodology, ensuring rigorous and reproducible research across studies published worldwide in English and Spanish between 2017 and 2023. The analysis included 47 studies that identified a total of 38 distinct ecosystem services. Amongst these, five provisioning services were identified, with 32 articles highlighting food provision. Twenty regulation and maintenance services were discussed, with biodiversity conservation being the most prominent, mentioned in 24 articles. However, cultural services were under-represented, appearing in only 12 articles. Despite the limited research on the Milpa System’s ecosystem services, particularly outside of Mexico, the findings underscore the system’s critical role in promoting agricultural resilience, ensuring food security and conserving biodiversity. This review emphasises the need for increased research to preserve and promote the Milpa System as a sustainable agricultural model that contributes to the well-being of both local communities and broader ecosystems. © Romero-Natale A et al.",About Sufficiency
POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF MAMMALS TO HUMAN WELL-BEING IN ARGENTINA,"Mammals are key components of biodiversity mediating ecosystem functions, mainly because of the diversity of forms and functions of this group. Understanding and making explicit the role of mammals underpinning Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) or directly contributing to human well-being would help to influence policy formulation towards sustainable development and nature conservation. Through a workshop held at the XXXII Jornadas Argentinas de Mastozoología and subsequent collaborative work, we compiled information related to Mammal’s Contributions to People in Argentina (MCP-Arg) based on participants’ interpretation of the available literature and their field experience. Argentinian mammals contribute to 12 of the 18 defined NCPs. We derived numerous MCP-Arg from studies that focused mainly on ecological processes and conservation, revealing an information gap in MCP-Arg description, quantification, and mapping. All taxa contribute similarly to the overall contributions, highlighting the importance of preserving mammal diversity. Conservation should also be framed at the local community rather than regional scales, aiming to preserve ecological functioning and contributions to human well-being, especially within regulation contributions. Our results show destructive feedback between threats and habitat-related contributions, with habitat degradation being the greatest threat to mammalian contributions and habitat maintenance the most threatened one. Our research indicates that a substantial amount of knowledge about MCP-Arg is available through narratives and interpretations. Considering the NCP approach to mammalian research, we can make significant contributions to both mammal conservation and human well-being. © SAREM, 2022.",About Sufficiency
Integrating Artificial Urban Wetlands Into Communities: A Pathway to Carbon Zero?,"In their natural state, wetland ecosystems provide an optimum natural environment for the sequestration and long-term storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. The loss of wetlands under advancing urbanization not only diminishes this capacity for storage, but increases methane and greenhouse gases as the land is disturbed. Nevertheless, there is growing scientific interest in using artificial or constructed wetlands as a way to mitigate the impact of global climate change, with most attention on their use for water management. Using a potential integrated urban wetland site in Glasgow as a case study, this paper critically examines how artificial urban wetlands can contribute to urban net zero targets in terms of their ability for carbon sequestration, and as part of sustainability initiatives more broadly. We find there are several barriers to implementing artificial urban wetlands for carbon drawdown alone, in particular regarding land ownership constraints, uncertainties in capture efficacy and capture quantitation, and eligibility for market-based crediting schemes. These issues make it currently challenging for the carbon reduction contribution of urban wetlands to be quantified and, say, certified to generate revenue to communities through market-based carbon crediting. However, if integrated within wider community-based sustainability initiatives, artificial urban wetlands can support multiple dimensions of sustainability, creating or supporting value far beyond water management and carbon sequestration objectives. Potential co-benefits range from areas such as health and wellbeing, biodiversity, education, food security, behavioural changes, and social care. Our findings show that for these co-benefits to be identified, maximised and realised, a place-based approach to urban wetland development must be adopted, engaging stakeholders from the project outset to define and facilitate collaboration towards shared outcomes for society, community, and environment. These findings will be relevant to any urban infrastructure development seeking to meet sustainability goals beyond carbon capture. Copyright © 2021 Rogerson, Horgan and Roberts.",About Sufficiency

Beyond the Rising Tide: Towards Effective Climate Policy in Coastal Urban Centers,"As urban areas expand rapidly, understanding the complex interactions between human migration, climate change impacts, and biodiversity loss is crucial for effective climate policy. However, comprehensive knowledge of the simultaneous interaction of these aspects is still scarce. Thus, this paper proposes the classification of ‘Climate Emergency Coastal Cities’, with the categorization of 43 cities into four levels according to their vulnerability (extreme, very high, high, and critical). Our study contributes to evidence-based climate policy and supports efficient resource allocation and interventions for the most vulnerable coastal cities. Highly anthropogenic megacities were ranked as the most sensitive to climate emergencies (Lagos, Nigeria; Jakarta, Indonesia; Los Angeles and Houston, USA; and Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China). It is noteworthy that in countries from both the Global North and South, the entry of new populations is a critical issue, and represents a threat to urban structures and biodiversity; however, in territories with fragile economies and numerous governance challenges, the required structure is still more challenging. The study concludes that integrated urban planning policies are crucial, considering various perspectives and coordinated actions. Policies should address marginalized urban groups and include migrants, and promote human well-being, ecosystem recovery, and climate mitigation, for effective adaptation. © 2024 by the authors.",About Sufficiency

Our study shows that many Indigenous people engage in carbon offset schemes as part of their broader cultural responsibility for landscapes, and that they seek to grow the relationship between social and ecological benefits.

TOWARDS A POSTCOLONIAL PERSPECTIVE ON CLIMATE URBANISM,"The growing interest in urban areas as sites for climate action has led to new ways of conceiving and planning the urban. As climate actions reshape existing understandings of what cities are or ought to be, they constitute new modalities of what recent scholarship has referred to as 'climate urbanism'. This research has framed climate urbanism as a climate-inflected iteration of neoliberal urban development, geared towards the mobilization of 'green' private capital for large-scale infrastructural projects, focused on carbon metrics, and conducive to population displacement through eco-gentrification. In this intervention, we commend these efforts to deliver a critical perspective on how climate change gives rise to forms of urbanism that reproduce urban injustices without addressing the root causes of the climate crisis. However, we warn against two biases in recent scholarship, namely an emphasis on technological solutions and an overreliance on familiar contexts of climate action. The literature on climate urbanism does not yet reflect the diversity of urban responses emerging under the broad umbrella of urban climate action. Adopting a post-colonial perspective on climate urbanism, we call for a greater engagement with the heterogeneous character of climate-changed urban futures.",About Sufficiency
Inequity in nature's contributions to people in O tautahi/Christchurch: A low-density post-earthquake city,"Nature's contributions to people (NCP) include the regulating, material, and non-material benefits of urban vegetation that improve well-being. It is increasingly important to plan cities that provide multiple types of NCP equitably to all residents of the city. However, due to historical legacies and planning policies, it is common for the most socially and economically vulnerable urban residents to suffer reduced access to the benefits of urban ecosystems. Previous studies of urban NCP have drawn attention to inequity in one or several types of NCP, but few have analysed a broad range. Here we analysed inequity in nine diverse forms of urban NCP across an index of economic and social vulnerability designed specifically to characterise vulnerability to environmental pressures. Furthermore, we used spatial analysis to map co-variance in vulnerability and a composite indicator of urban NCP, thus highlighting priority regions for future investments in green infrastructure. We applied this approach to the city of Christchurch/ O over bar tautahi in Aotearoa/ New Zealand, which provides a valuable case study due to its multicultural population and recent history of widespread damage and regeneration following the 2011 earthquake. Overall, the distribution of urban NCP is inequitable to the disadvantage of more vulnerable residents. Residents of more vulnerable neighbourhoods experienced reduced provision of carbon stock, runoff retention, air quality enhancement, shade, educational green space, public outdoor space accessibility, private green space, and bird biodiversity contributions. Conversely, more vulnerable neighbourhoods had greater provision of erosion mitigation (although negligible in magnitude).

Assessing the Impacts of Nature-Based Solutions on Ecosystem Services: A Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystems Nexus Approach in the Nima River Sub-Basin (Colombia),"Forest ecosystem services are critical for maintaining ecological balance and supporting human well-being from different perspectives. However, rapid land use changes driven by agricultural expansion, urbanization, and industrial activities have significantly altered forest ecosystems, degrading the services they provide. We here conduct an ecosystem service assessment through biophysical and economic estimates for a multipurpose Andean water sub-basin in western Colombia. We compare a business as usual (BAU) with a forest nature-based solution (NbS) scenario focused on forest landscape restoration. The research employed participatory methods for the NbS selection and economic valuation techniques to evaluate water flow regulation, water provisioning, water purification, and food provisioning services. Results show that the NbS scenario yielded a net positive economic impact across most evaluated ecosystem services, with notable trade-offs. Specifically, the NbS scenario increased water retention by 2.9% compared to BAU. Water flow regulation demonstrated the most substantial economic benefit, increasing by EUR 11.39 million/year in the NbS scenario. On the other hand, the food provisioning service presented a reduction of EUR 3.2 million/year in the NbS scenario. These findings highlight the potential of forest-based NbS to address the Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystem (WEFE) nexus challenges.

"Building Greener Cities Together: Urban Afforestation Requires Multiple Skills to Address Social, Ecological, and Climate Challenges","Urban afforestation is increasingly regarded as a key strategy for fostering biodiversity to restore and enhance the ecosystem services needed to counteract the effects of climate change in built-up areas. In Italy, several experimental afforestation projects have been launched as part of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), focusing on cities or metropolitan areas such as Milan, Rome, Pistoia and Campobasso. These projects follow a multidisciplinary approach, integrating botanists, foresters, urban planners, landscape architects and remote sensing specialists. The goal is to address the challenging complexity of urban forest restoration through reforestation and afforestation actions. Key innovations include the integration of transdisciplinary methodologies (landscape analysis, landscape design, forest and plant ecology) with the application of advanced remote sensing technologies and participatory community engagement frameworks to address ecological and social challenges. Experimental plots have been set up across various urban areas, testing a range of planting schemes to maximise climate change resilience and ensure long-term ecological sustainability. Emphasis has been placed on selecting drought-tolerant and thermophilic species that are better adapted to widespread warming and local urban heat islands. 'Biodiversity strips' with perennial flowers for insects, shrubs with berries for birds and nests for wild bees and vertebrates have been set up to enhance biodiversity in new afforestation areas. Advanced monitoring tools, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and multi-sensor drones, have been employed alongside field observations to assess forest growth, species survival, structural complexity and biodiversity enhancement over time. Historical analyses of landscape patterns and ecological connectivity over the past 200 years, along with evaluations of afforestation projects from the last 70 years, have provided critical insights into the successes and challenges of previous interventions, serving as a guide for future efforts. By focusing on ecological connectivity, the integration of afforested areas into the urban matrix, and citizen engagement, the current project aims to align urban forestry efforts with sustainable development goals. This comprehensive project framework addresses environmental restoration and the social and aesthetic impacts on local communities, contributing to the overall resilience and well-being of urban and peri-urban ecosystems.",About Sufficiency
A framework linking ecosystem services and human well-being: Saltmarsh as a case study,"The ecosystem services approach is based on the interdependencies between nature and human well-being. However, while the ecosystem services aspect of this approach is well-developed, the human well-being aspect remains unstructured and vaguely defined. An integrated conceptual framework was developed by adapting and linking the UK National Ecosystem Assessment-Follow On framework with human well-being domains. As well as benefits, the notion of disbenefits was incorporated to recognise the potentially detrimental effects from interacting with nature. Benefits and disbenefits occur at the social-ecological interface and are classified by the seven domains of human well-being they affect. The framework is applied to saltmarsh habitat as a case study, highlighting knowledge gaps and the potential applicability and usefulness of the framework. In saltmarsh, benefits mainly accrue at larger scales with a greater impact affecting local to global individuals, while disbenefits tend to occur at a smaller scale and impact in-situ individuals. The framework provides in-depth insight into links, trade-offs and dichotomies between benefits and disbenefits and human well-being, and improves accessibility to the complex research area of human well-being.

Ecosystem services are inextricably linked to human well-being and play a central role in sustainable adaptation strategies.

Temporal Dynamics of Ecosystem Services,"The ecosystem services concept evolved over the last 30 years from a general heuristic model highlighting importance of nature for human well-being to a framework for studying how the appropriation of specific ecological structures or processes influences that well-being. As the ecosystem service concept increasingly becomes an operational tool there is a need to account for the complexity of the relations between production and appropriation of ecosystem services. To date there has been a considerable focus on the spatial patterns of ecosystem services provision and appropriation. We propose a new way of categorizing them according to their temporal dynamics. We differentiate between linear and non-linear dynamics in both the provision and appropriation of ecosystem services. Based on our classification we suggest how temporal dynamics can be better integrated into ecosystem services research in four steps. These include setting the appropriate temporal boundaries of the system, identifying key types of dynamics of the ecosystem, assessing the spatial scale on which the dynamics play out in the system and developing measures for assessing these dynamics. Considering temporal dynamics of ecosystem services by following these steps has the potential to enable better planning of ecosystem services management and therefore, to enhance human well-being.",About Sufficiency
Revealing preferences for urban biodiversity as an environmental good,"Biodiversity is essential for human well-being, but little is known about urban dwellers’ preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for urban biodiversity. Since a large share of the global population concentrates in cities, urban areas are a critical space where humans and nature interact and biodiversity-related preferences are formed. This study investigates urban dwellers’ WTP for biodiversity using a revealed-preference approach on a real estate dataset of approximately 140,000 unique entries of rental and sales transactions of apartments. Three biodiversity indicators were used to investigate heterogeneous preferences for biodiversity as an environmental good. The findings indicate that WTP for biodiversity is positive and economically significant. This implies that urban biodiversity conservation and enhancement can result in co-benefits for the local urban population. Moreover, this study identifies a satellite-based biodiversity indicator as a potential alternative to conventional species richness indicators. This finding is significant for benefit transfer studies and primary biodiversity valuation in regions with limited data availability. The results can inform biodiversity conservation and management decisions by highlighting the importance of incorporating urban biodiversity in biodiversity policies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency

"Urban health: An example of a ""health in all policies"" A pproach in the context of SDGs implementation","Background: Cities are an important driving force to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the New Urban Agenda. The SDGs provide an operational framework to consider urbanization globally, while providing local mechanisms for action and careful attention to closing the gaps in the distribution of health gains. While health and well-being are explicitly addressed in SDG 3, health is also present as a pre condition of SDG 11, that aims at inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities. Health in All Policies (HiAP) is an approach to public policy across sectors that systematically takes into account the health implications of decisions, seeks synergies, and avoids harmful health impacts in order to improve population health and health equity. HiAP is key for local decision-making processes in the context of urban policies to promote public health interventions aimed at achieving SDG targets. HiAPs relies heavily on the use of scientific evidence and evaluation tools, such as health impact assessments (HIAs). HIAs may include city-level quantitative burden of disease, health economic assessments, and citizen and other stakeholders' involvement to inform the integration of health recommendations in urban policies. The Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal)'s Urban Planning, Environment and Health Initiative provides an example of a successful model of translating scientific evidence into policy and practice with regards to sustainable and healthy urban development. The experiences collected through ISGlobal's participation implementing HIAs in several cities worldwide as a way to promote HiAP are the basis for this analysis. Aim: The aim of this article is threefold: To understand the links between social determinants of health, environmental exposures, behaviour, health outcomes and urban policies within the SDGs, following a HiAP rationale;to review and analyze the key elements of a HiAP approach as an accelerator of the SDGs in the context of urban and transport planning; A nd to describe lessons learnt from practical implementation of HIAs in cities across Europe, Africa and Latin-America. Methods: We create a comprehensive, urban health related SDGs conceptual framework, by linking already described urban health dimensions to existing SDGs, targets and indicators. We discuss, taking into account the necessary conditions and steps to conduct HiAP, the main barriers and opportunities within the SDGs framework. We conclude by reviewing HIAs in a number of cities worldwide (based on the experiences collected by co-authors of this publication), including city-level quantitative burden of disease and health economic assessments, as practical tools to inform the integration of health recommendations in urban policies. Results: A conceptual framework linking SDGs and urban and transportplanning, environmental exposures, behaviour and health outcomes, following a HiAP rationale, is designed. We found at least 38 SDG targets relevant to urban health, corresponding to 15 SDGs, while 4 important aspects contained in our proposed framework were not present in the SDGs (physical activity, noise, quality of life or social capital). Thus, a more comprehensive HiAP vision within the SDGs could be beneficial. Our analysis confirmed that the SDGs framework provides an opportunity to formulate and implement policies with a HiAP approach. Three important aspects are highlighted: 1) the importance of the intersectoral work and health equity as a cross-cutting issue in sustainable development endeavors;2) policy coherence, health governance, and stakeholders' participation as key issues; A nd 3) the need for high quality data. HIAs are a practical tool to implement HiAP. Opportunities and barriers related to the political, legal and health governance context, the capacity to inform policies in other sectors, the involvement of different stakeholders, and the availability of quality data are discussed based on our experience. Quantitative assessments can provide powerful data such as: Estimates of annual preventable morbidity and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) under compliance with international exposure recommendations for physical activity, exposure to air pollution, noise, heat, and access to green spaces;the associated economic impacts in health care costs per year; A nd the number of preventable premature deaths when improvements in urban and transport planning are implemented. This information has been used to support the design of policies that promote cycling, walking, public, zero and low-emitting modes of transport, and the provision of urban greening or healthy public open spaces in Barcelona (e.g. Urban Mobility, Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plans, or the Superblocks's model), the Bus Rapid Transit and Open Streets initiatives in several Latin American cities or targeted SDGs assessments in Morocco. Conclusions: By applying tools such as HIA, HiAP can be implemented to inform and improve transport and urban planning to achieve the 2030 SDG Agenda. Such a framework could be potentially used in cities worldwide, including those of less developed regions or countries. Data availability, taking into account equity issues, strenghtening the communication between experts, decision makers and citizens, and the involvement of all major stakeholders are crucial elements for the HiAP approach to translate knowledge into SDG implementation. ©2019 The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
The role of forestry sciences in combating climate change and advancing sustainable development goals,"Introduction: As ecological disasters loom, forests play a crucial role in mitigating climate change and aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study aims to systematically examine the contribution of forestry science research to the SDGs through a multidisciplinary perspective, highlighting its role in advancing global sustainability efforts. Methods: Utilizing the PRISMA protocol, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 39,841 publications since 2015, focusing on the intersection of forestry sciences with the SDGs. Network and keyword co-occurrence analyses were performed to identify thematic clusters and interdisciplinary linkages among SDGs. Results: Our findings indicate a significant focus on SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), emphasizing the forestry sector’s contributions to biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, and ecosystem services. The analyses revealed thematic clusters centered around ecological sustainability, sustainable energy, and social development, demonstrating the diverse ways in which forestry research supports the SDGs. Discussion: This study highlights the interdisciplinary nature of forestry sciences and identifies key areas of contribution while pointing to potential research gaps. Future research should explore advanced technologies such as AI-driven analytics and remote sensing, socioeconomic impacts of forest-based livelihoods, and innovative reforestation techniques. Strengthening urban forestry, enhancing interdisciplinary cooperation, and improving governance are recommended to ensure continued contributions of forestry sciences to global sustainability and the SDGs.

Nature appropriation and associations with population health in Canada's largest cities,"Earth is a finite system with a limited supply of resources. As the human population grows, so does the appropriation of Earth's natural capital, thereby exacerbating environmental concerns such as biodiversity loss, increased pollution, deforestation and global warming. Such concerns will negatively impact human health although it is widely believed that improving socio-economic circumstances will help to ameliorate environmental impacts and improve health outcomes. However, this belief does not explicitly acknowledge the fact that improvements in socio-economic position are reliant on increased inputs from nature. Gains in population health, particularly through economic means, are disconnected from the appropriation of nature to create wealth so that health gains become unsustainable. The current study investigated the sustainability of human population health in Canada with regard to resource consumption or ""ecological footprints"" (i.e., the resources required to sustain a given population). Ecological footprints of the 20 largest Canadian cities, along with several important determinants of health such as income and education, were statistically compared with corresponding indicators of human population health outcomes. A significant positive relationship was found between ecological footprints and life expectancy, as well as a significant negative relationship between ecological footprints and the prevalence of high blood pressure. Results suggest that increased appropriation of nature is linked to improved health outcomes. To prevent environmental degradation from excessive appropriation of natural resources will require the development of health promotion strategies that are de-coupled from ever-increasing and unsustainable resource use. Efforts to promote population health should focus on health benefits achieved from a lifestyle based on significantly reduced consumption of natural resources. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",About Sufficiency
Nature-Based Solutions to Promote Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction Along the Coastal Belt of Bangladesh,"Nature-based solution (Nbs) is an empirical approach in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and mitigation. Coastal ecosystem–based Nbs is more proactive in reducing the risk of coastal hazards and thus assist communities in adapting to or mitigating climate change. This chapter aims to explore the role of coastal natural features as Nbs on increasing resilient food security for coastal climate–vulnerable people through providing food diversity. It also envisions to explore the role of coastal natural ecosystems such as coastal dunes, salt marshes, seagrass beds, how lagoons serve as natural buffers against cyclones, storm surges, sea waves, tidal surges, tidal floods, and protect the shoreline from coastal erosion and sea level rise. This chapter will also illustrate the performance of these ecosystems-based services, sand dunes, and other coastal ecosystem features on climate change adaptation and mitigation services through carbon storage and sequestration, groundwater storage, and land protection. The study was conducted in Kolapara of Patukhali district which is adjacent to Bay of Bengal and known as Kuakata beach. The study was conducted using RS and GIS, participatory research including household survey, focus group discussion, key informants interview, historical disaster loss analysis, and incorporating secondary information from different sources including scientific articles. The study illustrates that coastal natural features are most important Nbs to reduce hydrometeorlogical disaster and climate change adaptation and mitigating. But due to lack of consciousness, overexploitation, and lack of integrated coastal management approaches, most of these important ecosystem features are going to be lost or diminished. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",About Sufficiency
Are green roofs the path to clean air and low carbon cities?,"Green roofs, as part of urban green structures, have been pointed out as the solution to pursuit the goal of healthy cities. This study aims to investigate the direct, focused on meteorological changes, and indirect, related to both meteorological and emissions changes, impacts of green roofs on air quality (PM10, NO2 and O3). For that, the numerical modelling system composed by the WRF-SLUCM-CHIMERE models was applied to a 1-year period (2017), having as case study the Porto urban area. The EnergyPlus model was also applied to estimate the green roofs impacts on the building's energy needs and related impacts on air quality and atmospheric emissions. The analysis of the direct impacts showed that green roofs promote a temperature increase during the autumn and winter seasons and a temperature decrease during the spring and summer seasons. Both negative - concentrations increase - and positive - concentrations decrease - impacts were obtained for the primary, PM10 and NO2, and secondary, O3, air pollutants, respectively, due to changes in the dynamical structure of the urban boundary layer. The indirect effects of green roofs showed their potential to enhance the buildings energy efficiency, reducing the cooling and heating needs. These changes in energy consumption promoted an overall decrease of the environmental and economic indicators. Regarding air quality, the impact was negligible. The obtained results highlight the need for a multipurpose evaluation of the impacts of green roofs, with the different effects having to be traded off against each other to better support the decision-making process. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Urban Land Expansion and Sustainable Land Use Policy in Shenzhen: A Case Study of China's Rapid Urbanization,"Shenzhen is a city that is highly representative of China's rapid urbanization process. As the city rapidly expands, there are enormous challenges to the sustainable use of land resources. This paper introduces the evolution of urban land expansion and the sustainable land use policy of the Shenzhen Government since 2005. The policy covers the reduction in rural-to-urban land conversion, the delineation of urban growth boundaries, arable land reclamation and the establishment of farmland protection areas, urban redevelopment, and the investigation and prosecution of illegal construction. This paper considers the aspects of urbanization and land management systems that are unique to China. The current top-down indicative and mandatory mode of control, which relies on the central government, has very limited effects. Good results were achieved in Shenzhen for the following elements: governmental self-restraint, governmental identity change, and policy innovation.

Mapping spatial patterns of urban agriculture in Rome (Italy) using Google Earth and web-mapping services,"Urban agriculture (UA) has been acknowledged for several positive effects such as access to fresh food, human activities moderation, agro-biodiversity and social and cultural relationships. In the city of Rome due to social and economic trends this kind of activity is spreading, but so far very few attempts have been addressed to inventorying the UA areas (e.g., community gardens, residential gardens, school gardens, illegal vegetable gardens, urban farms, etc.). Some mapping experiences have been carried out but all lack of a well-established methodology to be applied for a complete inventory. In this paper we propose a conceptual framework and methodology for mapping the UA in Rome through Earth Observation techniques by using the concepts of photointerpretation and the features of the most used web-mapping services. Google Earth has been used as a basic tool for visual interpretation and polygon digitalization, while other services have been used for the availability of additional features (e.g., the oblique view of Microsoft Bing Maps). The integration of the web-mapping services combined with ancillary data improved the UA site detection, allowing to define both the land use and the UA typologies. We argue that the integration of the web-mapping services for building urban agricultural land use datasets is cost-effective compared to processing commercial remote sensing images. The inventory can enable administrators to perform analysis about the interactions between agricultural activities and the urban environment, and to enact informed policies for green and vacant urban spaces management.

Facilitating stakeholder dialogues on a carbon neutral city: We need to talk about carbon (and air quality),"The issues surrounding successful public engagement with climate change mitigation policy and decision-making have been extensively researched and identified as barriers to long-term civic and civil engagement. The challenge of transforming our urban spaces to mitigate and adapt to climate change was a key theme of the Bristol Urban ID project, which explored the “business as usual” approaches in policy, practice and engagement that limit truly transformational actions. As part of the project, a Carbon Neutral Bristol 2050 roundtable was held with civic leaders and stakeholders. Discussions focussed on defining carbon neutrality targets, “scopes” and boundaries for Bristol, exploring the opportunity for Bristol to be a carbon neutral city leader, how to build political, business and citizen space for engagement with carbon neutrality, and the role of Bristol Green Capital Partnership (BGCP), a cross-sector network of over 800 organisation working for a sustainable city, as an enabler and facilitator of change. The findings demonstrate a need for organisations working on interconnected environmental, social and wellbeing, and economic issues in cities, such as carbon neutrality and air pollution, to communicate and collaborate. Partnership working is essential to improving city-wide engagement in carbon and air quality management decision making, and to developing integrated city sustainability management strategies that recognise co-benefits and trade-offs. A set of guidelines highlight the need to create political space for people and organisations to talk about carbon and air pollution to develop city plans. © 2018 WIT Press.",About Sufficiency
Role of extensive green roofs for healthy cities,"The steady expansion of cities has had innumerable consequences on the quality of human life. While encroaching economic demands makes preserving green space in most city centers difficult, open space is plentifully a few stories higher. As a result, the idea of the green roof is gaining proponents. Green roof systems are living vegetation installed on the roofs. These can provide many environmental and social benefits and can be an invaluable retreat for achieving low carbon high performance building. Establishing garden roofs or vegetated roofs can improve stormwater management, conserve energy, mitigate urban heat island effect, improve return on investment compared to traditional roofs, reduce noise and air pollution, increase urban biodiversity and provide a more aesthetically pleasing environment. This paper focuses on the review of the current knowledge regarding the benefits of extensive green roofs and the potentials of this technology to be implemented in the Indian context.",About Sufficiency
Toward a Sustainable Blue Economy in the Coastal Zone: Case Study of an Industrialized Coastal Ecosystem in Greece,"Representing 9% of the land worldwide, the coastal zone is a highly populated part of the land, where economic and social growth continuously arise. An expected consequence of rapid development on the coastal zone is the creation of significant environmental pressures connected to human activities. Within this framework, the need to use the ecosystem services concept under the prism of sustainable development has risen to increase the provision of services to the people through an ecosystem approach using the human-environment interaction. The aim of this paper is to form an integrated approach for sustainable blue economy in a coastal ecosystem, using the SDGs and the ecosystem services frameworks and exploring the interlinkages of the ecosystem's parameters from both sides. The outcome of this study is the formation of a decision-making tool for sustainable blue economy in a coastal ecosystem, which classifies the SDGs with a specific factor, according to their importance for the sustainable blue economy, and helps stakeholders prioritize their actions toward the achievement of sustainability in the specific ecosystem.

"Low impact development techniques to mitigate the impacts of climate-change-induced urban floods: Current trends, issues and challenges","The severity and frequency of short-duration, but damaging, urban area floods have increased in recent years across the world. Alteration to the urban micro-climate due to global climate change impacts may also exacerbate the situation in future. Sustainable urban stormwater management using low impact development (LID) techniques, along with conventional urban stormwater management systems, can be implemented to mitigate climate-change-induced flood impacts. In this study, the effectiveness of LIDs in the mitigation of urban flood are analyzed to identify their limitations. Further research on the success of these techniques in urban flood mitigation planning is also recommended. The results revealed that LIDs can be an efficient method for mitigating urban flood impacts. Most of the LID methods developed so far, however, are found to be effective only for small flood peaks. They also often fail due to non-optimization of the site-specific and time-varying climatic conditions. Major challenges include identification of the best LID practices for the region of interest, efficiency improvements in technical areas, and site-specific optimization of LID parameters. Improvements in these areas will allow better mitigation of climate-change-induced urban floods in a cost-effective manner and will also assist in the achievement of sustainable development goals for cities.",About Sufficiency
"A perspective on green, blue, and grey spaces, biodiversity, microbiota, and human health","Humans have lived from equator to poles for millennia but are now increasingly intruding into the wild spaces of other species and steadily extruding ourselves from our own wild spaces, with a profound impact on: our relationship with the natural world; survival of other species; pollution; climate change; etc. We have yet to grasp how these changes directly impact our own health. The primary focus of this paper is on the beneficial influence of proximity to the natural environment. We summarize the evidence for associations between exposure to green space and blue space and improvements in health. In contrast, grey space – the urban landscape – largely presents hazards as well as reducing exposure to green and blue space and isolating us from the natural environment. We discuss various hypotheses that might explain why green, blue, and grey space affect health and focus particularly on the importance of the biodiversity hypothesis and the role of microbiota. We discuss possible mechanisms and exposure routes – air, soil, and water. We highlight the problem of exposure assessment, noting that many of our current tools are not fit for the purpose of understanding exposure to green and blue space, aerosols, soils, and water. We briefly discuss possible differences between indigenous perspectives on the nature of our relationship with the environment and the more dominant international-science view. Finally, we present research gaps and discuss future directions, particularly focusing on the ways in which we might – even in the absence of a full understanding of the mechanisms by which blue, green, and grey space affect our health – begin to implement policies to restore some balance to our environment of with the aim of reducing the large global burden of ill health. © 2023 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Pollinators respond positively to urban green space enhancements using wild and ornamental flowers,"Pollinator diversity and abundance are under direct threat from human activities. Despite societal dependence on pollinators for crop production, humankind continues to drive pollinator declines through agricultural intensification and urbanisation. Urban environments can provide refuge to some pollinators. There is a need, however, to understand how pollinator communities can be supported in these areas while also considering human needs. Public green spaces provide a promising avenue to target plant–pollinator conservation measures in an urban setting due to their large area, high abundance and low plant–pollinator biodiversity. We used a paired design to compare the plant community, pollinator community and plant–pollinator interactions of (i) public urban green spaces enhanced with wildflower meadows and pollinator-friendly ornamental plantings to (ii) control unenhanced urban green spaces. The planting types within enhanced sites were also separately compared. Our results show that not only was the diversity of the overall pollinator community higher in enhanced than control sites, but also the complexity of some wild Hymenoptera and the abundance of Diptera pollinator groups. The negative impact of urbanisation on some pollinator groups was reduced in enhanced sites compared with control sites. Planting both pollinator-friendly ornamental plants and wildflower meadows significantly increased the visits from Diptera and the diversity in the plant–pollinator community compared with wildflower plantings alone. Our results suggest that enhancing public spaces for pollinators has positive effects on key groups and can help mitigate the impacts of urbanisation. Non-native ornamental plants can also play a role in enhancing green spaces for pollinators while maintaining their recreational functions. This supports a mixed-planting approach for improving public green spaces in urban areas for both people and nature. © 2024 The Author(s).

Reading Urban Green Morphology to Enhance Urban Resilience: A Case Study of Six Southern European Cities,"A loss of natural capital within cities and their surrounding areas has been noticed over the last decades. Increasing development associated with higher sealing rates has caused a general loss of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) within the urban environment, whereas urban sprawl and the improvement of road networks have deeply fragmented the surrounding landscape and jeopardized ecosystems connectivity. UGS are an essential component of the urban system, and their loss has a greater impact on, e.g., ecological and hydrological processes, threatening human well-being. Different types and spatial configurations of UGS may affect their own ability to provide ecosystem services, such as biodiversity support and water regulation. Nevertheless, the study of UGS spatial patterns is a research branch poorly addressed.

Difficulties in achieving social sustainability in a biosphere reserve,"In the management of resources, the cost of opportunity plays an important role decision making when resources are finite and their use restricted. In natural protected areas restrictions can lead to social issues when the local economy suffers: the displacement of people, unsupportive attitude towards conservation or illegal activities. This situation is important in biosphere reserves, which should be learning laboratories for an integrated economic, societal, cultural and environmental sustainability. This paper analyzes the example of Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve in Romania, aiming to find correlations between social and environmental issues. The results indicate that urbanization, deforestations and abandonment of agriculture are the leading transitional dynamics of environmental degradation, and ageing and migration of population (especially from rural areas) to better job opportunities are the main societal challenges; they seem to be inversely correlated, although not statistically significant. Rural communities, with a better environmental status, experience social issues, and urban areas, with a better socio-demographic status, face environmental impacts. Spatial analyses show that isolation, essential condition for safeguarding the pristine environmental status, is a major obstacle for development.

The economics of biodiversity and ecosystem services,"Biodiversity conservation confers social benefits at many levels. Although the gene pool is a global public good, many of the ecosystem services supported by biodiversity are regional or even local public goods. At all levels, biodiversity underpins the capacity of the system to deliver services over a range of environmental conditions. The economic problem addressed in this chapter is how to correct for (a) the failure of markets to signal the true cost of biodiversity change in terms of ecosystem services, (b) the failure of governance systems to regulate access to the biodiversity embedded in 'common pool' environmental assets, and (c) the failure of communities to invest in biodiversity conservation as an ecological 'public good'. The chapter reviews both the nature of the challenges posed by these failures, and the options for addressing them. It requires that we are able to correctly identify both the private and social decision problems, and hence that we are able to value those non-marketed environmental effects that are ignored in many private decisions. It further requires that we are able to identify governance mechanisms, institutions, and instruments that will induce private decision-makers to behave in ways that are consistent with the social interest. This chapter focuses on the institutional and policy options for securing the socially optimal mix of species, given the role of biodiversity in assuring ecosystem services over a range of environmental conditions. © Oxford University Press 2009.

"O barômetro da sustentabilidade em uma perspectiva espaço-temporal: Uma análise por biomas, RS, Brasil","The planning and management of biodiversity conservation are constant challenges, and the assessment of sustainability is a relevant tool for these processes. This study aims to analyze sustainability in the municipalities that integrate the biomes of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, which are the Atlantic Forest biome and the Pampa biome, through the application of a Sustainability Barometer model. The proposed model was applied in two time periods, in the year 2000 and in the year 2016, using land use and land cover, pollution, socioeconomic and human health indicators, which have an impact on sustainable development. Spatial distribution and analysis of the degree of sustainability was used, through the Global Moran Index, to determine whether there is a significant spatial correlation with the existence of clusters. The results indicate that the two biomes were considered to have an intermediate degree of sustainability, in the two periods analyzed, and there was no considerable evolution in the degree of sustainability in 16 years. The environmental well-being index was categorized as an intermediary, and the human well-being index was considered higher, with a potentially sustainable degree, in the Atlantic Forest biome. It was possible to measure the degree of sustainability of each variable, in order to understand which ones exert the most negative pressure on sustainable development, as well as which municipalities have the lowest performance. In the Pampa biome, there was a decrease of 14.1% of the municipalities with a potentially sustainable degree to the intermediate degree of sustainability, between periods. The spatial distribution of the degree of sustainability indicates a trend of clusters and a positive and significant correlation (p = 0.001), in biomes, both in 2000 and in 2016, indicating that the classification of sustainability is not random.

A spatially explicit framework for assessing ecosystem service supply risk under multiple land-use scenarios in the Xi'an Metropolitan Area of China,"Rapid global urbanization has perturbed ecosystem structures and functions, resulting in ecological risk and threatening sustainable human well-being and socioeconomic development. However, scientific indicators to analyze ecosystem service (ES) risk patterns need to be explored in detail. In addition, studies on ES supply risk are stagnating on historical or status explorations, especially from the view of disturbance from land-use changes. This study seeks to develop a framework for modeling past-future ES supply risk pattern evaluation and probing into ES risk patterns under different future land-use scenarios. To achieve this objective, the framework integrates the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model, the Intelligent Urban Ecosystem Management System (IUEMS) model, and an established indicator system incorporating ES supply trend, hotspots and coldspots, and ES trade-offs, and synergies. The results show that: (1) In 2050, the supply of climate regulation in the Xi'an Metropolitan Area (XMA) will increase, while that of carbon sequestration and recreation will decrease. In 2050, the supply of climate regulation is the highest under ecological protection (EP) scenario, while the supply of carbon sequestration and recreation are the highest under cropland protection (CP) scenario. (2) From 2000 to 2050, the hotspots and coldspots of climate regulation increase in both natural development (ND) scenario and CP scenario. Notably, CP scenario experiences the most significant reduction in extremely significant hotspots and coldspots of carbon sequestration. From 2000 to 2050, at the regional and pixel scales, climate regulation and carbon sequestration mainly show trade-offs, and carbon sequestration and recreation show synergies.

Making health care more sustainable: The case of the English NHS,"The NHS is the most revered organisation in Britain: 'the proudest achievement of our modern society'.1 It is certainly the largest, although since its inception in 1948 it has operated in a government-funded environment of restricted resources. Nevertheless, it has also benefitted from a generally effective model of intervention centred on a hospital care system integrating specialist and emergency care and a primary care system which functions as both a source of treatment and a gatekeeper to specialist care. New circumstances, including environmentally-generated risk and a shifting disease reality, challenges the adequacy of this model. This paper argues that these new circumstances, some of which have seen a legislative response by government, mean that the NHS has to apply sustainable development thinking programmatically throughout its management and operations. It is also argued that the organisation needs to refocus towards prevention particularly in order to stem the rising tide of non-communicable disease. This paper sets out the thinking and actions of the Sustainable Development Unit, which has the task of developing and implanting sustainability concepts in the NHS. It is argued that the cause of sustainable development calls for a mix of cultural and technological shifts, new incentives and a rolling programme of innovative change. Some examples of success are presented. © 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health.",About Sufficiency
Enhancing Circularity in Urban Waste Management: A Case Study on Biochar from Urban Pruning,"This study investigates the potential of biochar production from urban pruning waste as a sustainable solution within a circular economy framework. Urban green waste, often underutilized, typically increases landfill burden and greenhouse gas emissions. Converting pruning waste into biochar reduces landfill reliance while enabling stable carbon sequestration. Utilizing the circular triple-layered business model canvas (CTLBMC), biochar’s impact is evaluated across economic, environmental, and social dimensions. This structured analysis is based on a theoretical framework and uses secondary data to illustrate the model’s applicability. As a result of the conducted studies, it was found that biochar derived from urban green waste not only improves soil phytotoxicity and enables long-term carbon sequestration, but also offers economic benefits, including municipal cost savings in waste management and diversified revenue streams from biochar sales. Socially, biochar production promotes community engagement in sustainable practices and supports urban greening initiatives, enhancing local ecosystems. The findings suggest that biochar production, assessed through the CTLBMC framework, represents a viable circular business model. This approach provides significant environmental, economic, and social benefits over conventional disposal, offering valuable insights for policymakers, waste management professionals, and urban planners advancing circular economy solutions. © 2024 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Why bees are critical for achieving sustainable development,"Reductions in global bee populations are threatening the pollination benefits to both the planet and people. Whilst the contribution of bee pollination in promoting sustainable development goals through food security and biodiversity is widely acknowledged, a range of other benefits provided by bees has yet to be fully recognised. We explore the contributions of bees towards achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our insights suggest that bees potentially contribute towards 15 of the 17 SDGs and a minimum of 30 SDG targets. We identify common themes in which bees play an essential role, and suggest that improved understanding of bee contributions to sustainable development is crucial for ensuring viable bee systems.",About Sufficiency

Exploring Perceived Well-Being from Urban Parks: Insights from a Megacity in Latin America,"Urbanization has impacted biodiversity and ecosystems at a global scale. At the same time, it has been recognized as a driver of the physical and emotional gap between humans and nature. The lack of direct contact with nature can have a negative impact on several aspects of human well-being and change knowledge and attitudes of people towards the environment. However, this phenomenon is still poorly understood in megacities outside developed countries. Here, we explore the relationship between ecological knowledge and self-reported well-being in an important urban park in Santiago, Chile. We conducted semi-structured surveys of park users to explore their beliefs, preferences, ecological knowledge of plants and birds, and self-reported well-being. Citizens associated urban parks mainly with ""nature,"" and particularly with the presence of trees and plants. Trees were recognized as the most relevant elements of urban parks; in turn, birds were ranked as the less relevant. Regarding formal ecological knowledge, respondents correctly identified an average of 2.01 plants and 2.44 birds out of a total of 10 for each taxon, and exotic species were more likely to be recognized. Park users also reported high scores for self-reported well-being. Interestingly, variance of self-reported well-being scores tended to increase at low levels of ecological knowledge of trees, but no significant relationship was detected with knowledge of birds, nor native species. Ecological knowledge of trees was positively related to self-reported well-being. Results suggest that parks can positively contribute to bring people closer to nature in middle-income countries. Improving ecological knowledge can be critical to restore the relationship between humans and nature in megacities.",About Sufficiency
Exploring Urban Compactness and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Road Transport Sector: A Case Study of Big Cities in South Korea,"This study examined the relationship between urban compactness and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the road transport sector in South Korea, focusing on 84 cities, particularly 27 metropolitan areas with populations of approximately 500,000. We developed an urban compactness index (UCI) using Moran's I, entropy, and the Gini coefficient, integrating city size into the analysis. Cities were categorized into five groups based on their size to analyze GHG emissions and regional variations in compactness comparatively. Our results revealed a significant inverse relationship between UCI and per capita road transport GHG emissions, which was more pronounced in larger cities. Specifically, cities with a population over 1 million displayed reduced per capita road transport GHG emissions in compact urban structures. In conclusion, these findings suggest that larger cities can effectively reduce per capita road transport GHG emissions through urban planning for compact development. Additionally, planners need to consider city size when analyzing the UCI and formulating urban planning strategies aimed at achieving carbon neutrality.",About Sufficiency
Household benefits from energy efficiency retrofits: Implications for net zero housing policy,"Maintaining household welfare in the transition to a net zero economy is critical to the public acceptance of climate policy. A challenge in meeting this goal is our incomplete understanding of the distribution of household-level benefits from policies designed to reduce greenhouse gases in residential buildings. We provide new insights on key variables that contribute to household and social welfare by quantifying both the level and distribution of energy savings, bill savings, and rebates disbursed from Canada's national energy efficiency retrofit program. Using a unique dataset consisting of electricity and natural gas consumption from all singlefamily houses in a Canadian city, we find that adopted retrofits reduce natural gas consumption for up to 10 years in the average participating house by about 20%. Whole-envelope retrofits reduce natural gas consumption by 35%. However, these savings represent only about half of pre-retrofit predicted savings, and several recommended retrofits save zero energy. While energy bill savings exhibit a modest peak among some lower wealth properties, retrofit rebates were disbursed equally across the house wealth distribution.",About Sufficiency
Foliage houseplant responses to low formaldehyde levels,"House plants are reported to ‘clean’ formaldehyde from indoor environments and thus reduce its deleterious health effects. We measured formaldehyde removal rates at concentrations similar to those caused by new furniture or office photocopiers. We also measured CO2 and humidity changes, counted the stomata density and monitored leaf color and shape changes. Controls were an artificial polyester “fern” and methanol as the VOC. All plants reduced formaldehyde from 0.75 ppm to below 0.2 ppm in six hours. The plants fall into two major groups with different responses: one group showed high removal rates: Boston fern (0.85 m h−1), golden pothos (0.41 m h−1), Spanish moss (0.44 m h−1) and spider plant (0.40 m h−1) - faster than the artificial fern (0.09 m h−1). They also show no change in color and appear to completely assimilate formaldehyde. Another group absorbed formaldehyde at a significantly lower rate (dumb cane: 0.07 m h−1; aloe vera: 0.17 m h−1; and Chinese evergreen: 0.09 m h−1) and had a generally different overall behavior from the ‘fast’ group - different CO2, humidity and variance changes - suggesting a different formaldehyde absorption mechanism. An ‘intermediate case’, snake plant (0.29 m h−1), has a slower rate than the fast group but also exhibited other changes, suggesting some combination of both mechanisms. Overall good correlations between formaldehyde uptake rates and stomata counts, total leaf area and water evapotranspiration rates were shown by all these plants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
"Priority areas in municipality planning: Ecosystem services, environmental impact assessments and research areas","Background Several pressing issues face municipal planners including increased land use and climate change. Managing these issues requires a balance between different actions to accommodate citizen’s demands of ecosystem services (ES) and development projects. The implementation of ES as a new tool for assessments needs to be contrasted by research considering existing tools such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). ES has been introduced as a policy tool at the governmental level but implementation at the local and regional scale is still needed; municipalities could benefit from collaboration with the research community for state of the art methods. One obstacle for implementation of ES is that it is not always easy for laymen to understand and additionally, the ES concept may be weakly supported by science. The municipalities realize that a society on its way towards sustainability takes advantage of new knowledge and that interactions with research will put them in the forefront of new scientific questions. The municipalities ask for research that takes a citizen perspective and research that prioritizes questions other than pure environmental considerations. Priorities in municipality planning are based on local conditions and rely on EIA. Many ecological indicators are already covered in EIA and this is reflected in Swedish Comprehensive Plans (SCP) documents, yet need further analysis is needed to be a part of ES. The SCPs present concepts at a policy level and rarely provide a more detailed plan of action compatible with the ES approach. New information We found that the use of ES concepts in Swedish Comprehensive Plans and in EIA is still not common and in need of further support from research and in practice. The EIA is decisive for comprehensive planning documents in the Swedish municipalities and follows standard format over time and between municipalities. ES is focused on human needs while the EIA describes place based assessments on environmental impact rather than feedback to the society by the intervention. Municipalities of south Sweden ask for research support in many different areas, for instance how to set up proper organization for implementation of ES and environmental issues, but priorities are based on their local conditions. The results shows that collaboration between stakeholders and researchers is needed which can create incentives, so that the decisions made by individuals, communities, corporations, and governments may be able to promote widely shared values compatible with ES. Researchers and municipalities who work on an operational level face many challenges in promoting greater use of the ES approach, with some of them yet to be defined. We conclude that implementation of ES could draw from lessons learned in the use of EIA. Further, it is presented that ES has the potential for greater public and stakeholder feedback into decisions as compared to EIA. © 2016, Pensoft Publishers. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Visions for development and management of urban green and blue infrastructure: a citizen's perspective,"Ongoing urbanization leads to problems such as densification, loss of biodiversity, and social injustice in cities. For increasing urban populations, green???blue infrastructure (GBI) is an important element in compact cities contributing to human health, well-being, and the provision of important ecosystem services. We analyzed responses from two open-ended questions about visions, ideas, and topics for the development and management of GBI important for citizens of the city of Leipzig, Germany. The questions were part of an online survey accompanying the development of the local GBI planning strategy: Master Plan Green. The strategy is focusing on five guiding themes that are leading local and global debates about sustainable and resilient cities: biodiversity, climate adaptation, environmental justice, health, and sustainable mobility. We categorize citizens' ideas and suggestions, summarize frequent problems and conflicts, and link ideas and visions to the five guiding themes. As the last step, we discuss citizens' suggestions in order to minimize conflicts in GBI and to identify deficits in present local planning. Major problems and conflicts that were addressed by respondents relate to quality, usability, other users, activities, and safety and security of GBI. Numerous suggestions aimed to tackle these problems, for example, by designating separate use areas, adding naturalness, improving maintenance, and enhancing facilities. A range of ideas and suggestions were based on diverging expectations underpinning the challenge of matching heterogeneous demands of GBI users in an equitable fashion. Linking these suggestions to the five guiding themes reveals that most ideas are covered by one or several guiding themes and are considered in local planning strategies. However, findings also demonstrate that increasing the quantity of Leipzig's GBI is a central request from respondents. Sociocultural and economic aspects as well as conflicting demands among citizens should further be central to GBI planning to avoid injustice and achieve sustainability objectives. This analysis gives insights into opinions and visions of citizens regarding the development of the city's GBI network and thus substantiates major strategic and planning themes leading global and local urban strategies toward sustainable cities. Considering specific suggestions and GBI deficits that bother citizens on a local level, offers the opportunity to improve the social and ecological resilience of GBI.",About Sufficiency

Biodiversity and the built environment: Implications for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),"Recent major global environmental initiatives toward a more sustainable society are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the New Urban Agenda (NUA) and the Paris Agreement. The built environment has been recognised as a major contributor to loss of biodiversity and should therefore play a major role in a sustainable world where ecological values are enhanced. There should be a smooth interaction between the built environment and the natural environment because humanity and nature are the usual victims of loss of biodiversity. The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between the Built Environment, Biodiversity and the Sustainable Development Goals. The paper explores the role of a sustainable built environment towards biodiversity conservation which is central to the realisation of the SDGs in general and SDG 15 in particular. The paper adopts a qualitative research methodology using knowledge generation workshop involving 16 experts from both academia and industry. The results show that, even though the built environment has a negative impact on biodiversity, it also has the greatest opportunity to integrate biodiversity into all development projects. Reducing the impact of the built environment on biodiversity should be an integral part of policies and strategies towards a sustainable built environment. All key built environment stakeholders need to engage in raising awareness of the effects of biodiversity loss as a result of construction activities, on the health and wellbeing of mankind. The value of this paper is to help decision-makers such as government agencies, industry-players and non-governmental organisations to understand the contributions of the built environment towards biodiversity conservation in achieving the SDGs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency

Urban food forestry transforms fine-scale soil function for rapid and uniform carbon sequestration,"Urbanization displaces agriculture and natural ecosystems, constraining food security and carbon (C) sinks. A proposed solution, Urban Food Forestry (UFF), promises local food from trees that can sequester C faster than other land cover types as long as soil function can sustain increased above and belowground productivity. We compared fine-scale variation in soil physical, chemical and biological properties within and between UFF and traditional lawn for evidence of changes in belowground ecosystem services. Both land covers sequestered C, but UFF did so 834% faster, especially in upper soil strata where soil bulk density fell by 50% and microbial activity increased by 1167%. Species richness of both soil fungi and bacteria increased along with nutrient concentrations. Contrary to expectations, that different tree traits would drive increasing fine scale variability in C density, soils beneath the UFF became more uniform, which is consistent with the rapid emergence of system-level regulation. Soil C mass balance may distinguish forests from collections of trees and determine how long UFF helps cities store their carbon and eat it too.",About Sufficiency
Modeled PM2.5 removal by trees in ten U.S. cities and associated health effects,"Urban particulate air pollution is a serious health issue. Trees within cities can remove fine particles from the atmosphere and consequently improve air quality and human health. Tree effects on PM2.5 concentrations and human health are modeled for 10 U.S. cities. The total amount of PM 2.5 removed annually by trees varied from 4.7 tonnes in Syracuse to 64.5 tonnes in Atlanta, with annual values varying from $1.1 million in Syracuse to $60.1 million in New York City. Most of these values were from the effects of reducing human mortality. Mortality reductions were typically around 1 person yr-1 per city, but were as high as 7.6 people yr-1 in New York City. Average annual percent air quality improvement ranged between 0.05% in San Francisco and 0.24% in Atlanta.

Citizens’ perceptions and willingness to pay for urban beekeeping: a case study in northern Italy,"Recently, urban beekeeping has been recognized as an important activity capable of generating many environmental, economic, and social benefits for society. Urban beekeeping is considered a valuable activity that balances the increase in honey production and urban biodiversity conservation in a sustainable way. However, there is no available literature on citizens’ perceptions and willingness to support urban beekeeping at the local level financially. This study investigated the citizens’ perceptions and willingness to pay (WTP) for urban beekeeping in a case study in Italy. To this end, an online survey was administered with a sample of citizens of the Taino municipality near the Milan metropolitan area, where there is a project to realize an urban apiary. At the end of data collection, 153 citizens completed the questionnaire, corresponding to approximately 5% of inhabitants. The results highlighted that for most respondents, the main benefits provided by urban apiaries are related to the awareness and educational activities on the role of honey bees in the urban environment. Besides, the results showed that 60.1% of respondents are willing to contribute financially to the construction of the municipal apiary through a one-time donation, while the remaining 39.9% said they were not willing to contribute financially, citing reasons for protest. The average WTP was estimated at € 22.21 per person, corresponding to a total value of € 48,742.24.

Biodiversity and environmental stressors along urban walking routes,"There is increasing focus on designing liveable cities that promote walking. However, urban walking routes can expose people to adverse environmental conditions that reduce health, well-being and biodiversity. Our primary objective is to assess how urban form is associated with environmental quality, including biodiversity, for people moving through urban spaces. We assess a range of environmental conditions that influence human health and biodiversity (temperature, noise and particulate pollution) and biodiversity of three taxa (trees, butterflies and birds) along 700 m public walking routes embedded in 500 m x 500 m grid cells across three UK towns. Cells are selected using random stratification across an urbanisation intensity gradient. Walking routes in more built-up areas were noisier and hotter; noise levels further increased in areas with more industrial land-use and large roads. There was no evidence of vegetation mitigating noise or temperature, but there was some evidence that increased vegetation cover mitigated small particulate pollution. Walking routes in more built-up environments had lower butterfly, bird and native tree species richness, and reduced butterfly abundance. Large roads were associated with reduced bird species richness and increased noise was associated with reduced bird abundance. Most specific measures of vegetation in the surrounding matrix (median patch size, structural complexity at 1.5 m resolution) were not detectably associated with biodiversity along walking routes, indicating minimal beneficial spill-over. Increased garden cover in the surrounding matrix was associated with less abundant and less species-rich butterfly communities. Our results highlight considerable heterogeneity in the environmental quality of urban walking routes and pedestrians’ potential to experience biodiversity along these routes, driven by reduced quality in areas with more built cover. A greater focus is needed on mitigating adverse effects of specific features of the built environment (roads, industrial areas, noise) surrounding walking routes to enhance the co-benefits of more biodiversity and healthier conditions for pedestrians. © 2023 The Authors",About Sufficiency
VERDIR (Enhancement of the Environment Through Sustainable Rehabilitation and Responsible Innovation),"The urban agriculture is fully developed for several years and we estimated that more than 75% of the world population will live in urban zones before 2050.

VERDIR is a global and integrated project carried by the University of Liège to contribute to the social, cultural, environmental, and economic transition in the South part of Belgium (Wallonia). Wallonia cultivates the tradition of steel and iron for centuries and inventories estimate the number of brownfields in approximately 5000, representing a total surface about 10,000 hectares. Eighty percent of these former industrial sites are situated in peri-urban and urban zones. Moreover, the active steel and iron industries reject important quantities of hot waters, hot gases, and carbon dioxide in the environment. These industrial thermal discharges represent more than 20% of the energy consumed in Wallonia. The possibilities of rehabilitating former industrial sites or the valorization of industrial thermal discharges are numerous. But, recently the urban farming and the development of plant factories have become more and more an important renovation model of brownfields offering new jobs and new industrial sectors.The VERDIR project is a new rehabilitation concept of industrial sites, which mixes the practices of urban agriculture and the production of biomass to high added value molecule.

"A balancing act in urban social-ecology: human appreciation, ponds and dragonflies","Green spaces in cities provide cultural ecosystems services (CES) such as nature connection, wildlife interaction and aesthetic appreciation which can improve aspects of human well-being. Recognising these benefits, researchers are now examining the complex relationship between humans and nature in urban social-ecology. Most studies investigate people's appreciation and valuation of different green space features and their contribution to urban biodiversity. Recommendations arising from such studies are best practices to achieve a balance between landscape aesthetic and ecological objectives, but many knowledge gaps still exist. In a social-ecological project in Greater London, appreciation of ponds and dragonflies in urban green spaces, and the environmental factors determining dragonfly diversity were investigated. We found ponds and their appearance were valued by people as enhancing their green space experience. The preference for wild-looking ponds was moderate. Dragonflies were enjoyed for their colour and high visibility, especially by those who had basic dragonfly knowledge. Species richness of dragonflies was positively associated with habitat heterogeneity in and around a pond. However, people were unable to relate a heterogeneous pond to more dragonfly species. For the first time, some factors that influence the human appreciation-ponds-dragonflies (HPD) relationship in an urban context are revealed. To fully realise the CES potential of ponds and dragonflies in Greater London, a HPD framework is proposed.

"Green Infrastructures, Pollutant Absorption and Economic Values","The environment, the climate emergency and the challenge of nature conservation and biodiversity are crucial issues. In urban areas, where the effects of climate change and the increase in pollutants are most pronounced, the Ecosystem Services offered by greenery, such as the removal of air pollutants, the absorption and sequestration of CO2 and the mitigation of high urban temperatures, produce significant benefits for communities. This research focuses on the ability of green infrastructure to reduce concentrations of dangerous air pollutants, namely Particulate Matter (PM) and ground-level ozone. First, the mechanisms of the uptake of both PM and ozone by vegetation are investigated, highlighting their effects on human health. Then, a critical review of the main approaches to estimating economic costs and benefits related to the change in mortality and morbidity caused by air pollution is proposed. Finally, on the basis of literature data, an indicative value of the economic benefit for Italy related to fewer deaths due to improved air quality is suggested. The perspective of the paper is the definition of a model capable of correlating the levels of particulate matter and ozone absorbed annually by vegetation with the monetary value of the corresponding ecosystem service. This is done by estimating both the reduced health costs resulting from the reduction of diseases and the economic benefits resulting from the reduced number of deaths. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",About Sufficiency
Assessment of the conservation status of natural and semi-natural patches associated with urban areas through habitat suitability indices,"Urban environments rely on the surrounding natural ecosystems remnants as providers of ecosystem functions, therefore these areas not only support a unique biodiversity but also have a social value for maintaining public health andwellbeing. For this reason, urbanization is considered to be one the biggest threats to ecosystems, leading to native biodiversity simplification and, thus, to a detriment of the provided ecosystemservices.Moreover, this change in land use results in high levels of landscape fragmentation and modification in areas surrounding the habitat remnantswhich, in consequence, become inadequate formany native species. In this context, it is important that urban planners have the information to assess the possible consequences of future changes in land use in order to increase the landscape chances of supporting both, native biodiversity and the needs of a growing human population. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the ecological integrity of natural and semi-natural vegetation patches immersed in an urban area in order to generate a conceptual framework for landscape assessment that allows urban planners to envision the best choice for city development at a given place. To do so, we developed a quantitative integral environmental evaluation index that includes ecological characterization, geological characterization, and environmental characterization (presence of anthropic disturbance) of the assessed area. We conclude that the index we have generated in this work is suitable to be used as a management tool to allow an unbiased valuation and to identify managing situations that require a short term response. © 2015, University of Tehran.

The NBS embedded with the Canna lily effectively eliminated organic matter, nutrients, and heavy metals. Nearly 57.2-75.2% COD, 69.9-83.2% BOD, 73.4-90.6% TSS, 51.1-71.6% PO43--P, 66.3-84.8% NH4+-N, 52-61.5% NO3--N, and 68-70.6% NO2--N removal were achieved. Heavy metals like Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, and Pb were removed, with a 98.25% reduction in the total bacterial count. The pollutant removal's kinetics was calculated using first-order kinetics. The mass removal rate of BOD was high in monsoon (22.3 g/m(2)/d), and COD was high in summer (36.4 g/m(2)/d). Organic compound removal (65.2%), including emerging pollutants, was observed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis of water and Canna samples. Wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (WDXRF) studied the elements and oxides retention by media and accumulation by the plant. The CHN content of the Canna and its morphological study was checked using the carbon CHNS analyzer and scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), respectively. The performance of the NBS was validated using variance, correlation, and principal component analysis (PCA).

Close-To-Nature Heuristic Design Principles for Future Urban Green Infrastructure,"The global nature-climate crisis along with a fundamental shift in world population towards cities and towns has sharpened the focus on the role of urban green infrastructure. Green infrastructure has the potential to deliver cost-effective, nature-based solutions to help mitigate problems of climate change as well as provide improved human well-being through the ecosystem services inherent in landscapes rich in biodiversity. The absence of under-pinning science, specifically complex systems science and ecosystem theory in the design and planning of urban green infrastructure, has limited the capacity of these landscapes to deliver ecosystem services and to effectively demonstrate natural resilience to the impacts of climate change. To meet future challenges of environmental uncertainty and social change, the design of urban green space should embrace an adaptive ecosystem-based approach that includes fully integrated participatory planning and implementation strategies founded on principles of close to nature science. Our article offers two models to inform green space planning: urban green space framework and sustainable urban community network. Both concepts provide the foundation for six ecosystem-based design principles. In a case study on Essex green infrastructure, UK, recommendations made by the Essex Climate Action Commission to transform land management practices are presented as examples of adopting principles of the ecosystem approach and nature-based science. Our article concludes by emphasising the importance of reconnecting society with nature in cities through close-to-nature design of urban green space to secure essential ecosystem services and to build resilience to the impacts of climate change.",About Sufficiency
The impacts of agricultural and urban land-use changes on plant and bird biodiversity in Costa Rica (1986-2014),"Costa Rica is recognized worldwide for its nature conservation policy following the traditional land-sparing approach. However, concerns have been raised about the opposite trends of the agricultural land cover changes driven by the option to expand old and new export crops after the country's external debt crisis of the 1980s. We study what happened during the last 20 years by applying landscape ecology metrics to the REDD+ land cover maps of 1986, 2001, and 2014, and statistically testing these indicators with the locations of species richness of plants and birds recorded by INBio. Our results confirm that deforestation has been reversed and most of the biodiversity considered is housed in forestland, but also that the expansion of export monocultures and urban sprawl have fragmented and isolated these tropical forests. Ecological connectivity values decreased 13% across the territory, all crops are negatively correlated with bird and plant locations, and the metropolitan expansion caused a detrimental impact on coffee agroforestry. All these outcomes are consistent with the growing deficit of the Costa Rican physical trade balance due to a faster increase of tropical exports than the growing imports of staple food, with a loss of soil organic matter filled by high doses of agrochemicals imported. Overcoming these environmental problems require a new land-sharing approach to nature conservation aimed at improving ecological connectivity through an agroecology approach combined with land-use planning to preserve the remaining green belt of the shade coffee plantations as a buffer green infrastructure in the metropolitan area.",About Sufficiency
Relating urban biodiversity to human health with the 'Holobiont' concept,"A relatively unaccounted ecosystem service from biodiversity is the benefit to human health via symbiotic microbiota from our environment. This benefit occurs because humans evolved alongside microbes and have been constantly exposed to diverse microbiota. Plants and animals, including humans, are organised as a host with symbiotic microbiota, whose collective genome and life history form a single holobiont. As such, there are interdependencies between biodiversity, holobionts, and public health which lead us to argue that human health outcomes could be improved by increasing contact with biodiversity in an urban context. We propose that humans, like all holobionts, likely require a diverse microbial habitat to appropriate resources for living healthy, long lives. We discuss how industrial urbanisation likely disrupts the symbiosis between microbiota and their hosts, leading to negative health outcomes. The industrialised urban habitat is low in macro and microbial biodiversity and discourages contact with beneficial environmental microbiota. These habitat factors, alongside diet, antibiotics, and others, are associated with the epidemic of non-communicable diseases in these societies. We suggest that restoration of urban microbial biodiversity and micro-ecological processes through microbiome rewilding can benefit holobiont health and aid in treating the urban non-communicable disease epidemic. Further, we identify research gaps and some solutions to economic and strategic hurdles in applying microbiome rewilding into daily urban life.

Low-impact development and coastal waters: Can public health standards be protected?,"Many coastal waters are designated under the federal Clean Water Act to be used for swimming and shellfishing. While Congress has established a legal obligation to protect and restore these ""existing"" uses of coastal waters, conventional stormwater management measures fail to adequately treat and remove bacteria from urban stormwater runoff. This means that as development occurs these existing uses of coastal waters are frequently prohibited to protect public health. This presentation examines the potential of Low-Impact Development (LID) practices to successfully prevent and reverse this persistent and widespread form of water quality degradation in urbanizing coastal areas. The legal water-quality protection imperatives that LID must satisfy are identified, technical challenges unique to coastal areas discussed, and real life experiences with LID use and performance along the coast on North Carolina reviewed. The conclusion is that LID has the potential to protect and restore coastal water quality as long as it successfully replicates natural hydrology, and LID strategies should become the cornerstone of watershed management strategies including Total Maximum Daily Load implementation plans. © 2009 American Society of Civil Engineers.",About Sufficiency

Therefore, our aim was to determine the associations between urban green spaces, greenness exposure and species richness in residential environments with physical activity and body mass index. Sixty-two adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age answered a self-administered questionnaire, providing information on height, weight, age, sex and home address. Data on socioeconomic deprivation were obtained from the European Index of Deprivation for Small Portuguese Areas. Physical activity levels were assessed using accelerometers. Urban green space counts and the normalized difference vegetation index values were measured using buffers along the roads with distances of 300, 500, 1000 and 1500 m from each participant’s residence. To quantify the species richness, the species richness index was used. Linear regression models were fitted to analyze whether urban green spaces, exposure to green spaces and species richness counts for each distance were associated with physical activity and self-reported body mass index. We did not find significant associations between the independent variables and the probability of overweight or obesity. The relationship between environmental variables, adolescents’ physical activity and body weight seems to be complex and further studies may contribute to better understanding of the topic. © 2021 by the authors.

Denser and greener cities: Green interventions to achieve both urban density and nature,"Green spaces in urban areas-like remnant habitat, parks, constructed wetlands, and street trees-supply multiple benefits. Many studies show green spaces in and near urban areas play important roles harbouring biodiversity and promoting human well-being. On the other hand, evidence suggests that greater human population density enables compact, low-carbon cities that spare habitat conversion at the fringes of expanding urban areas, while also allowing more walkable and livable cities. How then can urban areas have abundant green spaces as well as density? In this paper, we review the empirical evidence for the relationships between urban density, nature, and sustainability. We also present a quantitative analysis of data on urban tree canopy cover and open space for United States large urbanized areas, as well as an analysis of non-US Functional Urban Areas in OECD countries. We found that there is a negative correlation between population density and these green spaces. For Functional Urban Areas in the OECD, a 10% increase in density is associated with a 2.9% decline in tree cover. We argue that there are competing trade-offs between the benefits of density for sustainability and the benefits of nature for human well-being. Planners must decide an appropriate density by choosing where to be on this trade-off curve, taking into account city-specific urban planning goals and context. However, while the negative correlation between population density and tree cover is modest at the level of US urbanized areas (R2 = 0.22), it is weak at the US Census block level (R2 = 0.05), showing that there are significant brightspots, neighbourhoods that manage to have more tree canopy than would be expected based upon their level of density. We then describe techniques for how urban planners and designers can create more brightspots, identifying a typology of urban forms and listing green interventions appropriate for each form. We also analyse policies that enable these green interventions illustrating them with the case studies of Curitiba and Singapore. We conclude that while there are tensions between density and urban green spaces, an urban world that is both green and dense is possible, if society chooses to take advantage of the available green interventions and create it.

Bringing nature back into cities,"Protecting nature is a fundamental aspect of local and Indigenous cultures that has more recently become an urban sustainability goal. The benefits provided by nature to people and other species have sparked an upsurge in research exploring how best to manage existing nature in urban environments. Here we expand this focus by drawing attention to an emerging pathway of research and practice that is engaged with the idea of bringing nature back into cities (BNB). We argue that BNB could be a vital force of the 21st century urban-sustainability agenda. However, the enthusiasm of practitioners and policymakers for incorporating BNB objectives into local and global strategies remains uneven. As interdisciplinary scholars involved with the theory and practice of caring for urban nature, we believe that the time is ripe to present a fresh perspective on seven key areas that can unlock the potential of actions to bring nature back into cities. Specifically, we: (a) argue that the sovereignty of local and Indigenous knowledge-systems be acknowledged and respected; (b) contend that the choice of bringing nature back actions should be driven by inclusive decision-making; (c) discuss advances in ecology that need to be addressed to facilitate the return of nature into cities; (d) outline how the diffusion of innovation theory may assist communication of BNB actions to stakeholders; (e) discuss how built-environment professionals can demonstrate the value of urban infrastructure for BNB; (f) call for longitudinal research to understand, quantify and qualify the benefits of BNB actions and (g) consider solutions needed to address concerns about potential risks and disservices associated with actions to bring nature back into urban environments. Taken together, these perspectives, and the transdisciplinary framework that emerges from them, embody theoretical innovation regarding how to bring nature back into cities and a holistic view of how to make this happen in practice. Bringing nature back into cities has the potential to become an environmentally just and culturally inclusive dimension of the 21st urban sustainability agenda upon which future generations of city-dwellers rely.

Metropolitan fringes as strategic areas for urban resilience and sustainable transitions: Insights from Barcelona Metropolitan Area,"In an urbanized world, the challenges posed by climate change need to be met through innovative planning for cities and regions. Urban resilience demands that cities adopt new models centered on carbon neutrality, ecosystem services and biodiversity enhancement, circularity, and social inclusion. In light of the multiple interdependencies of metropolitan systems and the natural and territorial potentialities present on their fringes, this paper discusses the metropolitan fringes as strategic for urban resilience and sustainable transitions. By combining a mixed-method analysis of adaptation and urban plans with semi-structured interviews performed with key technicians, the analysis is focused on an inter-municipal fringe zone within the Barcelona Metropolitan Area - the Bes`os territory. Aiming to contribute to the discussions related to Territorial innovation for cities and regions, the paper offers a multi-scale perspective and illustrates innovative urban transformation strategies across scales. The results highlight that governance and multiple planning and participation instances together with technical and financial support are essential for consensus building in an incremental process. Furthermore, the planning strategies of the case study sought to integrate and enhance the green and blue infrastructures and transform consolidated urban areas with a focus on energy transition, sustainable mobility, circularity, and social inclusion. In conclusion, it is argued that resilience has a multi-scalar perspective within the metropolitan context and should be integrated with planning policies at different scales from a coordinated vision. Although adaptation and urban projects have a critical local element, a broader and more strategic vision is necessary, especially in metropolitan fringe areas.",About Sufficiency
Impact of Land Use Changes on Ecosystem Services Supply: A Meta Analysis of the Italian Context,"Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are caused by several factors, including climate change, socio-demographic dynamics, human pressures and urban sprawl. These factors alter the structure and functionality of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem goods and services to society. The study of LULC changes is important for understanding the dynamics of relationships between environmental, social and economic components and for analyzing the factors affecting natural capital. Including ecosystem services (ES) in spatial planning tools and sectoral policies is useful for improving governance. In this paper, the impact of LULC changes on ES provision has been estimated. To this end, we carried out a literature review (Step 1) to select the biophysical and economic coefficients of ES supply by land cover classes and collect them in a database (Step 2). We subsequently aggregated the economic and biophysical coefficients by macro classes (Step 3) and, using the benefit transfer approach, we estimated the change in the supply of ESs concerning permanence and transition phenomena in Italy from 1990 to 2018 (Step 4). The transition phenomena analysis also allowed us to evaluate the consequences of urbanization and urban green space governance on ES supply. Indeed, these urban green spaces can help reduce risks to people's health and safety and mitigate the effects induced by climate change. In total, approximately 800 coefficients (biophysical and economic) of ESs supplied by Corine Land Cover classes were acquired. The results show a reduction in the annual supply of ecosystem services of EUR 927 million (2022) caused by LULC changes between 1990 and 2018. This research proposes a methodology to improve knowledge of ESs concerning anthropogenic impacts and to support land-use planning policies regarding Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals.",About Sufficiency
Ecology and conservation under ageing and declining human populations,"Much research and media attention has revolved around the environmental impacts of growing global human populations. While the conclusions remain contested, these assessments have largely neglected the ecological and conservation impacts of other key regional processes such as declining populations, ageing demographics and rural-to-urban migration. These demographic shifts are increasingly prevalent across many regions of the world, and will have significant direct effects on natural resource management and biodiversity conservation by altering individual consumption patterns, land use, land stewardship and natural disturbances. Given that the scientific foundation around this topic is still developing, we first present an initial examination of some of the key environmental impacts, aiming to elevate awareness and encourage further research in these areas. Beyond the ecological implications, declining populations, ageing demographics and rural-to-urban migration carry intricate social and cultural consequences that can affect people and nature interactions. Ecological studies that focus on single dimensions of biodiversity or ecosystem responses often overlook these complexities. Demographic changes are likely to be accompanied by shifts in environmental attitudes and connections with nature, all of which will influence our capacity to adapt to or mitigate environmental changes. Finally, environmental policy and practice frameworks are potentially unprepared and their success could be sensitive to these socio-cultural and demographic shifts. Synthesis and applications: This brief overview demonstrates that population decline, ageing and rural-to-urban migration can have extensive implications for biodiversity and the socio-cultural relationships between people and nature. However, the significance, dynamics and consequences of these processes are still largely overlooked. We believe that these changes warrant specific attention from the research, policy and practice communities, as understanding the outcomes and feedbacks associated with depopulation, ageing populations, loss of culture and tradition and ecological change could aid in designing landscapes and informing management that enhances both human well-being and biodiversity conservation. © 2024 The Author(s).

Perspective Why efforts to address India?s ?just transition? should support nature-based solutions,"Transformation towards low carbon development needs action to transform our economy and energy simulta-neously. India has taken several noble aims for continuing to increase renewable energy since an efficient energy transition will help to mitigate climate change. Socio-economic consequences like a considerable loss of liveli-hood will also occur. The 'just transition' concept emphasises delivering the transition fairly to high carbon concentrated workers' communities' livelihood and fossil fuel-based economy towards the regenerative economy and addressing inequality and poverty issues. While nature-based solutions are initiatives taken to restore, protect, and sustainably manage nature to tackle societal problems such as changing climate, challenges origi-nating from urban expansion and livelihood support. There is a substantial research gap on why efforts to address just transition should support nature-based solutions (NbS).

"The Symmetric Effect of Financial Development, Human Capital and Urbanization on Ecological Footprint: Insights from BRICST Economies","Environmental degradation is a serious concern and its prevention strategies have become a central topic worldwide. It is widely accepted that improving environmental quality is essential for advancing sustainable development and societal well-being. From this perspective, the present research employed panel data from 1990 to 2022 from BRICST economies to assess the effects of financial development, human capital, urban population, energy consumption, and economic growth on environmental quality regarding ecological footprint. This study employs second-generation empirical techniques such as CIPS and CADF unit root tests, Westerlund bootstrap cointegration, and DFE/MG/PMG-ARDL models to examine the connections among the studied variables. The empirical findings of this study uncover that in the BRICST countries, environmental quality is exacerbated by human capital, urban population, energy consumption, and economic growth. On the other hand, financial development and GDP2 help improve environmental quality. Additionally, the interaction of the term financial development results with the terms human capital and urban population has a negative effect and reduces ecological footprint by improving environmental quality. From the policy perspective, the selected countries must implement policies that promote equitable financial resources, plan sustainable urbanization to promote compact cities and green infrastructure, and invest in green energy to address the adverse environmental consequences in BRICST economies. © 2024 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
More green infrastructure is required to maintain ecosystem services under current trends in land-use change in Europe,"Green infrastructure (GI), a network of nature, semi-natural areas and green space, delivers essential ecosystem services which underpin human well-being and quality of life. Maintaining ecosystem services through the development of GI is therefore increasingly recognized by policies as a strategy to cope with potentially changing conditions in the future. This paper assessed how current trends of land-use change have an impact on the aggregated provision of eight ecosystem services at the regional scale of the European Union, measured by the Total Ecosystem Services Index (TESI8). Moreover, the paper reports how further implementation of GI across Europe can help maintain ecosystem services at baseline levels. Current demographic, economic and agricultural trends, which affect land use, were derived from the so called Reference Scenario. This scenario is established by the European Commission to assess the impact of energy and climate policy up to 2050. Under the Reference Scenario, economic growth, coupled with the total population, stimulates increasing urban and industrial expansion. TESI8 is expected to decrease across Europe between 0 and 5 % by 2020 and between 10 and 15 % by 2050 relative to the base year 2010. Based on regression analysis, we estimated that every additional percent increase of the proportion of artificial land needs to be compensated with an increase of 2.2 % of land that qualifies as green infrastructure in order to maintain ecosystem services at 2010 levels. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",About Sufficiency
Fair trade towns USA: Growing the market within a diverse economy,"Fair trade is both a movement and a market, and the tension between these two domains reflects an ambiguity at the center of fair trade in the United States, resulting from long-standing debates within the contemporary movement. In practice, this ideological division produces a struggle between companies that offer a small number of fair trade products aside a vast number of conventional items, and those that sell only fair trade certified products. However, it also shapes the experience of on-the-ground fair trade advocacy work. This article uses Gibson-Graham's diverse economies framework to explore three arenas in which this is most clearly evidenced. First, some fair trade advocates are wary of Fair Trade USA's (FTUSA) power and strategies. They are aware that multiple fair trade certification frameworks currently exist; however they aren't always sure which ones are most desirable and why. This confusion can be problematic in Fair Trade Towns (FTT) advocacy work which involves convincing community members, institutions and governments to purchase more fair trade products. Second, in light of FTUSA's strategic marketization of fair trade and the entry of large corporate players into the U.S. fair trade market, fair trade advocates increasingly find themselves in the equivocal position of providing free labor and marketing for large corporations. Third, the efforts of some FTT advocates are stymied by the determined localvores in their community who are more focused on minimizing carbon footprints and supporting local farmers than promoting social justice and environmental stewardship in the developing world. These tensions raise important questions about the scalar politics of alternative markets and diverse economies.",About Sufficiency
Urban and peri-urban agriculture and forestry: Transcending poverty alleviation to climate change mitigation and adaptation,"A range of published and grey literature over the last three decades has underlined the importance of urban and peri-urban agriculture and forestry (UPAF) in cities of developing regions. The focus in the published literature is on livelihoods, poverty reduction and ecosystems services at multiple city scales. Cities of developing regions, particularly in Africa, are searching for ways of addressing the unavoidable impacts of climate change and UPAF has demonstrated scalable adaptation and mitigation potential. However, evidence of UPAF's role in mitigating and adaptation to climate change is scattered in various reports and has not been synthesized for its potential role in developing urban adaptation strategies. Building on the earlier poverty reduction focus of UPAF research, this paper contributes to UPAF knowledge regarding mitigating and adapting to climate change in urban and peri-urban areas in East and West Africa. The paper reports a synthesis based on a systematic review of the available literature on these regions, and selected sources on other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The paper also examines the extent to which literature conveys any evidence for UPAF playing a role in mediating the effects of climate/environmental change. Limited empirical verification was undertaken in Kampala and Ibadan, but this does not form the basis for systematic generalization. The key emerging areas of adaptation and mitigation include enhanced food security, productive greening, ecosystem services and innovative policy for urban resilience and transformation.

"Exploring the impacts of living in a “green” city on individual BMI: A study of Lingang new town in Shanghai, China","Urban planning and design in the 21st century is increasingly focusing on sustainability, illustrated by the proliferation of greener cities. While operational definitions and the actual planning of these cities can vary considerably (e.g., eco cities and low carbon cities), conceptually, at least, these terms overlap, particularly with regard to how they attempt to achieve both greener infrastructural design and healthier human lifestyles. This paper presents the findings of survey-based research carried out within Lingang New Town in Shanghai in 2019. In the cities of the Global North, the interplay between green infrastructural provision and public health has been of interest, especially in the context of social inequalities; however, there is little research from rapidly urbanizing countries where green urbanism is being increasingly promoted. Using this newly constructed example, we identified a clear positive correlation between moving to a green city and the adoption of healthier lifestyles. The structural equation modelling results suggest that behaviors around the use of green space as well as perceptions of different green space have notable impacts on residents’ physical health, measured by body mass index (BMI). The findings further illustrate systemic inequalities among private housing, rental housing and public housing typologies with regard to the distribution of health benefits. © 2020 by the authors.

Managing soil carbon stocks to enhance the resilience of urban ecosystems,"Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) by urbanization will likely replace agricultural expansion as the dominant source of transformation of the terrestrial biosphere. Properly managed urban soils can offset some of the associated carbon (C) losses from urban soils and vegetation by retaining stabilized soil organic carbon (SOC) or soil inorganic carbon (SIC) such as mineral-associated C, black carbon (BC), and stable carbonate minerals. For example, SOC stocks of up to 810 Mg C ha(-1) to 1.5 m depth (Serebryanye Prudy, Russia) and SIC stocks of up to 300 Mg C ha(-1) to 2.5 m depth (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) have been reported, but data on urban soil C storage are scanty. Aside from contributing to climate change mitigation, protecting and increasing SOC stocks support critically important soil-derived ecosystem services. Thus, C-friendly soil and land-use management practices must be developed and implemented to enhance soil-derived ecosystem services in urban areas, and the resilience of urban ecosystems to climate change. A collective management approach for urban soil C is needed. The principal actors involved should be urban land users (e.g., urban dwellers, property owners, developers) as the immediate users and managers of soil C, local professionals, local government and NGOs.",About Sufficiency
Horticultural science’s role in meeting the need of urban populations,"Horticultural products and services impact the health and well-being of urban populations. This is an extremely important group for horticultural scientists and researchers to serve: More than half of all people worldwide already live in urban areas, and more than two-thirds will do so by 2050. In this chapter we address the past, current, and future roles that horticultural science plays in the major issues of concern to public welfare: public health, environmental health, food security, and economic stability. Urban horticulture has important impacts on the health of the individual and the community, two concerns of public health. Documented individual health benefits include less depression and improved pregnancy outcomes from walking in or living near urban green spaces. Community gardens, parks, and other urban vegetation enhance community health by improving social interactions, such as family dynamics, and public safety, such as protection from crimes. Uses of plants to improve the urban environment include temperature modification, air pollution reduction, and water quality improvement. Impacts on biological diversity are mixed. Other negative impacts include the introduction of invasive species. Urban food security requires food in sufficient, nutritious, and affordable quantities. Providing this for all people is one of the greatest challenges for horticultural science. Potential solutions include increasing small-scale food production in urban areas by providing more community gardens or converting vacant lots. Horticulture contributes directly to urban economics through the production and sales of horticultural products by urban businesses. Indirect contributions from plants include higher property values and more productive employees. The increasing urbanization and aging of the human population is happening in conjunction with rising environmental destruction from global warming and climate change. Combining the traditional horticultural concern of feeding the world with an expanded understanding of the additional functions provided by horticultural products, the needs of urban people, and the opportunities to partner with professionals in other disciplines will be essential in the unpredictable future. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.",About Sufficiency
"Water-energy nexus within urban agglomeration: An assessment framework combining the multiregional input-output model, virtual water, and embodied energy","With rapid urban expansion and economic development, water shortages and high energy emissions at the regional scale pose critical challenges for urban agglomerations, resulting in quite intricate water-energy nexus. Although important, an assessment framework that can analyze interregional and intersectoral water-energy nexus among cities at the urban agglomeration scale is still lacking. Based on an environmentally extended multiregional input-output model and the concepts of virtual water and embodied energy, this study developed a new assessment framework for the water-energy nexus. By jointly considering the efficiency of input resources and the connections of interregional industrial sectors, this framework can be used to identify the key regions and sectors for water and energy saving. Using the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration as an example, the new framework revealed that electricity, gas and water supply industry in Zhangjiakou was a typical high water consumption-high energy consumption sector. Light industry and construction belong to a strong water-energy connection sector, whereas the water-saving measures only partially focus on reducing water consumption but promote energy consumption. In the future, it is imperative to improve the water-energy utilization efficiency of upstream sectors and promote the concept of green buildings with low environmental impacts. The developed framework can be further extended to capture food-energy-water nexus from regional to global scale, and can be used as an important toolbox to pinpoint the sector to realize the sustainable development goals of ""clean water and sanitation"" (SDG6) and ""affordable and clean energy"" (SDG7).",About Sufficiency
Thermal Environmental Impact of Urban Development Scenarios from a Low Carbon Perspective: A Case Study of Wuhan,"Amidst the increasingly escalating global concern regarding climate change, adopting a low-carbon approach has become crucial for charting the future developmental trajectory of urban areas. It also offers a novel angle for cities to avoid high-temperature risks. This paper estimates carbon emissions in Wuhan City from both direct and indirect aspects. Then, the ANN (artificial neural network)–CA (Cellular Automata) model is employed to establish three distinct development scenarios (Ecological Priority, Tight Growth, and Natural Growth) to predict future urban expansion. Additionally, the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting Model)—UCM (Urban Canopy Model) model is used to investigate the thermal environmental impacts of varying urban development scenarios. This study uses a low-carbon perspective to explore how cities can develop scientifically sound urban strategies to meet climate change challenges and achieve sustainable development goals. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The net carbon emission for Wuhan in 2022 is estimated to be approximately 20.8353 million tonnes. Should the city maintain an average annual emission reduction rate of 10%, the carbon sink capacity of Wuhan would need to be enhanced by 382,200 tonnes by 2060. (2) In the absence of anthropogenic influence, there is a propensity for the urban construction zone of Wuhan to expand primarily towards the southeast and western sectors. (3) The Ecological Priority (EP) and Tight Growth (TG) scenarios are effective in alleviating the urban thermal environment, achieving a reduction of 0.88% and 2.48%, respectively, in the urban heat island index during afternoon hours. In contrast, the Natural Growth (NG) scenario results in a degradation of the urban thermal environment, with a significant increase of over 4% in the urban heat island index during the morning and evening periods. (4) An overabundance of urban green spaces and water bodies could exacerbate the urban heat island effect during the early morning and at night. The findings of this study enhance the comprehension of the climatic implications associated with various urban development paradigms and are instrumental in delineating future trajectories for low-carbon sustainable urban development models. © 2025 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Measuring inequality of household carbon footprints between income groups and across consumption categories in China,"To achieve carbon neutrality, most countries focus on reducing carbon footprint and its inequality based on not only production, but also consumption. We applied multi-source data and methods to measure inequality of consumption-based household carbon footprints (HCFs) between income groups and across consumption categories. Results showed that, per capita household carbon footprints (PHCFs) increased continuously in 2011–2017, from 1.75 t CO2 to 2.47 t CO2. The increment was larger and larger owing to the rapidly growing household consumption expenditure. Average PHCF of high-income households was 5.33 times greater than that of low-income households in 2017. The high-income households should be more responsible for reducing HCFs and implementing the shift to the low-carbon lifestyle. Inequality was significant with a Gini coefficient of 0.458 for total PHCFs. The contribution rate of between-group inequality to overall inequality was increasing, from 42.49% in 2011 to 60.39% in 2017. There was the polarization characteristic in the inequality of HCFs between income groups. Gini coefficients of PHCFs for some categories were much greater than that of total PHCFs. It is necessary to focus on these categories such as rent, car purchase, furniture and durable goods to reduce HCF inequality. This study revealed the key income groups and consumption categories contributing most to HCF and its inequality, which could provide the references for carrying on the studies and actions of reducing them in the developing countries. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
DEVELOPMENT OF ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH URBAN DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT,"Growing environmental concerns and the rise of sustainable development have made planners shift focus from prioritizing economic and social benefits to incorporating ecological consciousness into urban planning. Ecological challenges, such as habitat degradation from unchecked urban expansion and insufficient green spaces, underscore gaps in ecological awareness among urban planners. Issues, like urban heat islands and water mismanagement, further exemplify the need for enhanced ecological planning. To address these challenges, the paper proposes several governance strategies. It advocates for comprehensive planning for ecological civilization cities, including green infrastructures and natural landscape restoration to mitigate environmental impacts. Enhancing ecological responsibility, through education and community engagement, is vital for fostering a culture of sustainability. Developing an ecological circular economy addresses resource inefficiency and waste problems, while promoting low-carbon transportation options aims to reduce urban carbon footprints.

A decision support framework for the design and operation of sustainable urban farming systems,"The increasing population and continuous urbanization make food security prominent in sustainable development. It is important to develop economic and resource-efficient farming solutions to meet food demand. Renewable energy and waste valorization may bring benefits to build sustainable food production systems and facilitate circular economy. This work aims to develop a decision support framework for the stakeholders to quantitatively assess and optimize their urban farming systems for efficient investment and operation. The proposed framework is based on a holistic system model that considers the energy and material consumption in vegetable production processes and the economic and environmental performance of urban farming systems. In the multi-dimensional assessment model, the net present value and cradle-to-gate CO2 emission, water consumption, and land occupation of different configurations of urban farming systems were assessed. In a further development, the assessment model was embedded in an optimization framework to identify the optimal system design and operation. The optimal crop mix and the corresponding cultivation set points (such as temperature, humidity, irradiance, illumination time, and CO2 concentration) for the farming modules were determined via optimization. To demonstrate the proposed framework, a case study on the design and operation of a vertical farm in Singapore was carried out. The case study examined alternative farming systems with glass-enclosed vs window-free structural design, grid vs solar photovoltaic (PV) energy supply, and traditional chemical fertilizers vs food waste compost fertilization. Results showed that plant-factory farming systems integrated with solar PV and beer-residue-derived fertilizer could be a promising and sustainable farming solution for Singapore as a tropical megacity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Supporting Cities towards Carbon Neutral Transition through Territorial Acupuncture,"Since a solution towards carbon neutrality in already highly populated territories that does not profoundly alter the territories has not yet been found, territorial acupuncture, a new methodology presented in this paper, proposes a solution to this challenge and simultaneously helps to counter the dysfunctional dichotomy between large urban centres and small towns. The aim of this study is therefore to present this new concept and its operation. Hence, a phased study was carried out. Territorial acupuncture is the result of merging different theories and practices, such as Biourbanism, urban acupuncture, and energy community design. For Territorial Acupuncture, the territory is conceived as a single organism and, just like acupuncture in traditional Chinese medicine, punctual interventions (in this case, interconnected energy communities) would benefit the entire territory organism. To make the theory work properly, it will be necessary to carry out multi-scalar and multi-disciplinary analyses over the entire territory to identify the intervention points and then proceed to the design and interconnection of the individual district. Thus, Territorial Acupuncture provides a new approach to the resilience of densely populated territories, which, through punctual interventions on a district scale, benefits the entire territory by modifying energy, socio-economic, and environmental dynamics.",About Sufficiency
Lost in implementation? A field study of the uptake of the ‘green infrastructure’ term and concept in urban policies,"With growing urban populations and increasing demands for more liveable, healthy and resilient cities, green infrastructure (GI) emerged over the last decade as a strategy to improve the quality of life in urban areas, delivering ecological, socio-cultural and economic benefits. To reach the European Union’s political ambitions, it is vital that the concept and its content are used consistently and coherently from national to local scale. Regarding the content, the ambiguity of the multifunctionality characteristic of GI presents an opportunity for adaptation to local values, while also risking to remain a vague and abstract promise. A policy analysis was conducted in four European cities to investigate the uptake of the GI concept in policies relevant for urban green spaces and if it is in line with EU’s understanding. Additionally, we investigate through interviews how interactions between agencies contribute to the mainstreaming of the concept to the municipal level. We found variations in uptake level and interpretation, which can partly be explained by the competition of new and established concepts, and existing structures (legislation and routines of practice). Each case study made multifunctionality concrete by linking multiple values to it, although the amount of values and depth of consideration differs. We found interactions between policymakers themselves, as well with science and civil society, contributing to the mainstreaming of the concept. © 2023 The Author(s).

Nature in nature-based solutions in urban planning,"There has been a surge of academic studies on nature-based solutions in the last decades, reflecting the growing view that nature can help us address the climate and the ecological crises. While definitions of nature-based solutions are commonly referenced in the literature, “nature” itself is rarely defined. This article investigates the ideas of nature in nature-based solutions discourses in urban planning and argues that unpacking their connotations is crucial for a more precise and locally sensitive development of planning for humans and more-than-humans. The findings reveal that “nature” is often used abstractly or through proxies such as ecosystem services or biodiversity. Although the place-specificity of NBS is recognized in the literature, local definitions and values of nature are not sufficiently included, which can compromise the long-term uptake of NBS. The study further highlights the growing recognition of the plural values of nature and the potential for ecocentric approaches to challenge the anthropocentric underpinnings of NBS. The article concludes that unpacking the often-diverging meanings of nature is paramount for a more conscious development of NBS research in planning theory and practice, enhancing the effectiveness, inclusivity, and environmental justice of NBS initiatives and their effective mainstreaming. By embracing plural definitions of nature and fostering a deeper understanding of human-nature relationships, NBS research can support more sustainable, resilient, and equitable urban futures. © 2024 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency
Growing Biodiverse Urban Futures: Renaturalization and Rewilding as Strategies to Strengthen Urban Resilience,"How are our cities using nature-based solutions to confront the challenges posed by a warming climate, the loss of biodiversity and major resource depletion? This article discusses the opportunities and benefits of applying the concepts of regreening and rewilding of cities. The article engages with key sources and summarizes the background and development of regreening and nature-based solutions and important policies, concerns and perspectives of international and national organizations. It introduces the integration of nature-based solutions (NBS) as a strategy in urban planning with the aim to strengthen urban resilience and to slow down the biodiversity decline. Rewilding areas in cities has become a powerful strategy to bring back butterflies, insects, birds, and wildlife. In contrast to highly managed parks and gardens, these rewilding initiatives are leaving allotted spaces mostly uncultivated and self-regulated. Contact to nature is essential for human existence, urban wellbeing, and good quality of life. Green spaces in cities-big or small-all contribute to the health and wellbeing of residents. However, many cities do not offer residents easy access to green space within the city. Improving the better distribution of and access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks is likely to deliver a large number of benefits, such as: ecosystem services, better water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, and restoring damaged ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microclimate. Rewilding has emerged as an important part of new public parks and gardens.

Designing a network of green infrastructure to enhance the conservation value of protected areas and maintain ecosystem services,"There is a growing demand for holistic landscape planning to enhance sustainable use of ecosystem services (ESS) and maintenance of the biodiversity that supports them. In this context, the EU is developing policy to regulate the maintenance of ESS and enhance connectivity among protected areas (PAs). This is known as the network of Green Infrastructure (GI). However, there is not a working framework defined to plan the spatial design of such network of GI. Here, we use the software Marxan with Zones, to prioritize the spatial distribution of different management zones that accommodate the needs of a network of GI. These zones included a conservation zone, mainly devoted to protecting biodiversity, a GI zone, that aimed at connecting PAs and maintaining regulating and cultural ESS; and a management zone devoted to exploiting provisioning ESS. We performed four planning scenarios that distribute the targets for ESS and biodiversity in different ways across management zones. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis by increasing ESS targets to explore trade-offs that may occur when managing together biodiversity and ESS. We use Catalonia (northeastern Spain) as a case study. We found that the representation of ESS could be achieved for intermediate targets in all scenarios. There was, however, a threshold on these targets over which trade-offs appeared between maintaining regulating and cultural ESS and biodiversity versus getting access to provisioning ESS. These “thresholds values” were displaced towards higher ESS targets when we moved from more strict to more flexible planning scenarios (i.e., scenarios that allowed mixing representation of objectives for biodiversity and ESS within the same zone). This methodological approach could help design a framework to integrate biodiversity and ESS management in holistic plans and decision making and, at the same time, meeting European mandates concerning the design of GI networks, or similar needs elsewhere. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Treatment wetlands in decentralised approaches for linking sanitation to energy and food security,"Treatment wetlands (TWs) are engineered systems that mimic the processes in natural wetlands with the purpose of treating contaminated water. Being a simple and robust technology, TWs are applied worldwide to treat various types of water. Besides treated water for reuse, TWs can be used in resources-oriented sanitation systems for recovering nutrients and carbon, as well as for growing biomass for energy production. Additionally, TWs provide a large number of ecosystem services. Integrating green infrastructure into urban developments can thus facilitate circular economy approaches and has positive impacts on environment, economy and health.",About Sufficiency
Envisioning carbon-smart and just urban green infrastructure,"To address the inter-connected climate and biodiversity crises, it is crucial to understand how multifunctional urban green infrastructure (UGI) is perceived to contribute to carbon neutrality, biodiversity, human well-being, and justice outcomes in cities. We explore how urban residents, including youth, associate carbon-related meanings with multifunctional UGI and how these meanings relate to co-benefits to biodiversity, well-being, and broader sustainability outcomes. Our findings are based on a survey distributed among urban residents of Helsinki, Finland (n = 487) and reveal how carbon-related meanings of UGI manifest at different levels of abstraction, agency, and scale, and incorporate community values and concerns attributed to the planning, features, functions, and transformational dimensions of UGI. Core carbon-related meanings of UGI emphasize either actions towards sustainability, carbon neutrality, biodiversity, or unfamiliarity towards such meanings. Perceived justice concerns and the socio-demographic contexts of the respondents covaried with carbon-related meanings associated with UGI. The results illustrate community perceptions of how it is not only possible, but rather expected, that multifunctional UGI is harnessed to tackle climate change, human well-being, and biodiversity loss in cities. Challenges for implementing the carbon-related benefits of UGI include navigating the different expectations placed on UGI and including residents with diverse socio-economic backgrounds during the process. Our findings contribute to a holistic understanding of how multifunctional UGI can help bridge policy agendas related to carbon neutrality, biodiversity protection, and human well-being that cities can implement when aiming for sustainable, just, and socially acceptable transitions towards a good Anthropocene.",About Sufficiency
Relationship Between Urban Tree Diversity and Human Well-being: Implications for Urban Planning,"Green spaces and trees are key elements for enhancing human well-being in cities. Despite recognizing the significance of urban greenery for human health, the role of urban biodiversity in shaping well-being remains poorly understood. This study focused on the interplay between tree genera diversity, perceived urban biodiversity, and the subjective well-being of urban residents in Karlsruhe, Germany. A map-based online questionnaire involving 302 participants investigated well-being locations and perceptions of biodiversity. Tree genera diversity was assessed for nine genera using remote-sensing and ground data. A novel approach of spatially correlating societal mapping results and tree genera cover maps revealed a clear preference for green spaces in the built-up urban environment. The relations between computed tree genera diversity and subjective well-being were unclear. However, there was a significant relationship between the perceived biodiversity of urban green spaces and subjective well-being. The amount of tree cover, the abundance of large trees, as well as the perceived species diversity beyond tree genera, lead to increased well-being of the urban population. At the same time, a perceived unkemptness of urban areas had a negative effect on the residents’ well-being. This should be considered in future research and the design of urban green spaces. © 2025 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency
"The ""Green Belt Berlin"": Establishing a greenway where the Berlin Wall once stood by integrating ecological, social and cultural approaches","Urban greenways benefit urban dwellers by providing multiple ecosystem services and by supporting biodiversity conservation in cities. Increasing competition for open space in growing cities, however, often hinders the establishment of greenways in those places where social demands for related services are highest. In the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, a new greenway, the ""Green Belt Berlin,"" is being established within the former border zone, which now links Berlin's core with the rural hinterland. An analysis of the planning approaches and principles that directed the implementation of the greenway and the transformation of vacant urban land into new parks revealed ways to (i) extend urban green infrastructure in times and places of political transformation; (ii) justify new greenspace by combining multiple ecological, social, and cultural goals within overarching planning programs; (iii) conserve and stage remnants of the Berlin Wall, allowing the greenway to become part of a decentralized memorial landscape; (iv) work with novel ecosystems and wild urban nature by integrating ecology with urban planning and design; and (v) use design interventions to create ""orderly frames."" Spatial analyses indicate that the new greenway may reduce environmental inequity in Berlin as it largely intersects neighborhoods where disadvantaged status coincides with poor access to urban greenspace. This case study thus demonstrates opportunities to strengthen the urban green infrastructure of growing cities through integrative planning approaches.",About Sufficiency
Social Acceptance of Urban Farming in and on Buildings,"Although still overshadowed by environmental and economic aspects, social dimension and social acceptance play a dynamic key role in urban agriculture development. This chapter focuses on the social acceptance of urban farming in building skins and buildings, providing multiple commercial, ecological, and social benefits and essential contributors to future food security and sustainable urban development. Potential stakeholders’ needs, expectations, and preferences in terms of various aspects such as use, maintenance, and aesthetics are explored and discussed based on various farming systems, including collectively and privately organized rooftops, façades, and indoor vertical farming. User-perceived benefits and risks are discussed and used to derive critical drivers and obstacles. The chapter discusses the advantages and disadvantages of social sustainability and acceptability between different farming systems. The main results of specific, not yet numerous, but highly valuable targeted studies and practices are discussed, providing insight into consumers’ and other stakeholders’ attitudes, perceived risks, and acceptance in different parts of the world.

Utilization of ecosystem services in future vision decision-making for climate-resilient cities,"In the face of uncertain future climate change, city policy decision-makers must choose strategies that promote climate-resilient development. Nature-based solutions (NbSs) are considered important for solving urban problems, such as carbon neutrality, improving human well-being, and enhancing biodiversity. This study aimed to examine the possibility of using ecosystem services in decision-making for the future scenarios of the city, considering land use change and climate change in combination. Representative ecosystem services of eco-friendly urban paradigms were selected, and ecosystem services and synergies were analyzed when (1) only land use change was considered, and (2) climate change (RCP 8.5) and land use change were both considered. The selected ecosystem services were analyzed using statistical and model-based methods (InVest, MaxEnt) applied to each characteristic and collectible data. The results revealed that food (rice and fishery production) was affected by land use change, recreation and leisure was affected by external activities and climate change. Carbon uptake was affected by both climate change and land use change. Regarding synergy, the amount of carbon uptake decreased by - 1.60% in BAU (S1) and increased by 24.39% in Smart Shrinkage City (S3); however, regarding recreation, the differences depended on the scenarios, such as an increase in S1 by 5.26% and an increase in S3 by 0.99%.

Feeding the cities: Urban agriculture for food security and sustainability of urban areas,"With the increasing migration of people to urban areas, the demand for extra, fresh, and healthy food in cities has escalated manyfold. Further, anthropogenic activities, high rise buildings, and unplanned construction in urban areas are increasing urban heat. Therefore, the objective of this study is to review the salient features and constraints of urban agriculture, in addition to illustrating traditional and modern approaches, and policies used worldwide to promote the urban agriculture (UA). Urban agriculture is a key component of sustainable urban development that plays a pivotal role in combating food security and malnutrition in peri-urban and urban areas by growing different fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, herbs, flowering and ornamental plants in urban dwellings for food and aesthetic purposes. UA often combines with other functions like urban greening, biodiversity, waste recycling, environmental disaster reduction, CO2 absorption, urban heat island reduction, recreational benefits, contributing to the circular economy and UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). Plants in UA are grown in vacant open spaces, rooftops, balconies and containers, resulting in urban organic harvest by fostering income and health improvement. The concept of UA is being utilized efficiently in many countries. However, there is still a need to promote UA by arranging community gatherings and school students, creating awareness and capacity building through education and training. Growers need to be connected to land and open spaces, enhancing value addition in UA and formulating supportive policies to foster Agri-tourism in urban farms to making it a successful initiative. Recent innovative research ideas and new technological developments such as artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), automation and mechanization in UA are opening new avenues for quality food production in urban areas for sustainable cities. © CAB International 2024.",About Sufficiency
Nature-based solutions and buildings: A review of the literature and an agenda for renaturing our cities one building at a time,"A closer look at the built environment shows that opportunities lie in transforming buildings with nature-based solutions for fostering climate resilience. To understand the potential of buildings in contributing to transforming cities, we conducted a systematic literature review to synthesize the evidence of the provided benefits of nature-based solutions implemented on their roofs and facades. Our goal is to highlight findings about the co-benefits of nature-based solutions on buildings in real-life case studies. After systematic screening and selection, the 222 reviewed research papers support that there is confidence in the climate resilience performance and benefits green walls, green roofs, and living walls provide, contributing to heat resilience and indirectly to social-ecological justice, especially when they are installed in old buildings. Our findings show that other recorded benefits include the provision of vegetation, habitat and biodiversity enhancement, and strong evidence of water retention and purification. We also report on design characteristics of nature-based solutions which are recommended when they are implemented on buildings. Green roofs were especially well-documented and it underlines the need of more studies about diverse NBS. From the synthesis of the state of the art, we propose that further research about the design of nature-based solutions on buildings is required to extend their co-benefits to noise reduction, air pollution entrapment and filtering, and carbon sequestration. In our paper, we found that the most important knowledge gap for future research is holistic perspectives on designing NBS on buildings. © 2023",About Sufficiency
"Availability and Accessibility of Urban Green Spaces in a High-Density City: The Case of Raipur, India","Urban green spaces (UGS) can counter the ill effects of urbanization in high-density cities. Studies related to these aspects are rare in Indian cities, however. This article aims to assess the availability and accessibility of UGS in Raipur, India. The objectives are to identify the status of UGS alteration, determine the status of available UGS, and identify the optimum population density for which UGS can be made available and accessible. Land use change detection, fragmentation index, availability index, UGS per capita, and neighborhood accessibility are used to assess aspects of UGS. The results show an increase in built-up area (24.32 percent) from 2010 to 2020. They also show a decrease in the UGS availability index and an increase in the fragmentation index from the city center to the outskirts. Uneven distribution of UGS categories is found all over the studied urban area. Low-density areas have more UGS per capita available than high-density areas, whereas medium-high-density areas have the maximum UGS accessibility. The study concludes with density-wise implications to maximize the UGS benefits and identifies medium-high density as the optimum density that allows high accessibility to the available UGS.",About Sufficiency

While the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a commonly employed method for multicriteria analysis of ESs, it has faced criticism for its limited ability to handle inherent imprecision and uncertainties. Consequently, we proposed an assessment framework for ESs using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and implemented it in the Shenyang Metropolitan Area (SMA), a key political and economic center in Northeast China. We quantified eight types of ESs (water yield, food supply, water regulation, carbon storage, waste regulation, soil retention, habitat quality, and outdoor recreation) within SMA. The FAHP was utilized to determine the weights of these ESs. Subsequently, we presented a normalized index to identify priority conservation and development areas. Our results indicated that the primary areas for conservation were mainly located in the southwest and east of Benxi City, the southeast of Fushun City, and the southeast of Anshan City, whereas areas for development were primarily in the northwest of Shenyang City. Through comparing various ES integration methods, our study underscores the effectiveness of FAHP in ES evaluation.

Therefore, by examining different planning approaches to networks, this chapter clarifies what is meant by these concepts and approaches in the literature.",About Sufficiency
Transdisciplinary approaches assessing unmanaged urban green spaces reveal benefits for biodiversity and people,"Rapid urbanization is projected for African cities at the cost of urban green space, which could jeopardize biodiversity and human benefits. Studies focusing specifically on human–green space relationships in the Global South are lacking, and the validity of extrapolating results from studies in the Global North remains questionable and cannot provide local context-specific design solutions. This study combines methods and perspectives from ecology and human geography with landscape design to better understand the benefits for biodiversity and people derived from unmanaged green spaces in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. Based on empirical data from two unmanaged green space areas in disadvantaged communities, we identify benefits for biodiversity and people and define guidelines for inclusive trans-disciplinary interventions. We combine information from a vegetation survey, a community survey of 200 respondents and a rapid assessment of multifunctional benefit provision to formulate in holistic landscape design proposals. We show that the sites have biodiversity value and provide habitat for > 169 different plant species, including protected species, and smaller wildlife. Residents use the spaces for utility, passive and active leisure, and > 76% of residents benefit from the use of these spaces. However, the integrity and provision of benefits from green spaces are threatened by pollution, safety concerns, biological invasions, and land conversion. Context-specific designs could be developed by merging methods across disciplines and involving local stakeholders to integrate the multifunctionality of socioecological benefits into landscape interventions. Collaboration across ecology, human geography and landscape design generates multifunctional perspectives of unmanaged green spaces that consider benefits for biodiversity and disadvantaged communities. © The Author(s) 2024.",About Sufficiency
Ecological analyses of street trees of Indian cities to achieve United Nations sustainable development goals,"The present study determined the community characteristics, structural composition, and regeneration status of street trees in two major Indian cities viz., Ranchi and Delhi.

The study reported a very high species diversity index (H′) in both Ranchi (3.98) and Delhi (3.47), with similar species evenness (0.85). Fabaceae and Ficus were the predominant family and genus, respectively in both cities. The similarity of street trees of Ranchi and Delhi is quite low in terms of all the β-diversity indices (SI = 38.75% and dissimilarity = 61.25%; Cj = 0.24 and dissimilarity = 0.76; BCij = 0.61 and similarity = 0.39). The total street tree density in Ranchi (217 ind. ha−1) and Delhi (637 ind. ha−1) varied significantly, while the dominance (basal area) of both cities were quite similar (20.67 m2ha−1 and 21.70 m2ha−1) due to the predominance of young and adult individuals (GBH ≥30–90 cm) in the street tree community at Ranchi and pole and young individuals (GBH ≥ 10–60) in Delhi. The regeneration potential of street trees in both cities was quite concerning because the majority of street trees at Ranchi (62.5% of 96 spp.) and Delhi (57.38% of 64 spp.) had shown no regeneration.

Gated gardens: Effects of urbanization on community formation and commons management in community gardens,"Community gardens are often positioned as spaces where urban people can build community, reclaim common space, and reassert a ""right to the city"" in urban landscapes that are shaped by gentrification and the privatization of space. However, the literature on urban agriculture often focuses on the struggles of gardens to endure external political-economic processes, largely overlooking within-garden tensions relating to social inequality and resource access. In this study we examined how the pressures associated with urbanization are inscribed in three community garden landscapes in the central coast of California a region undergoing massive urban transformation in recent decades. The cases reveal that social tensions from urbanization permeate garden boundaries to influence the production of space and the social relations within the garden. Specifically, the resource struggles and social inequities in these regions are made visible in the gardens through conflicts over membership rules, resource management, and theft of produce. The analysis of these conflicts illustrates how extreme real estate valuation and gentrification shapes the particular ways in which the urban commons are managed, including the forms of inclusion and exclusion, claims-making, and racialization of resources that are employed. Uncovering and complicating our understanding of the struggles of and tensions within community gardens is a necessary step in the pursuit of ""just sustainability"" within changing cityscapes.",About Sufficiency
Mitigation and Chemistry of Indoor Air Pollutants in Urban and Rural Environments of India: A Review of Contemporary Advances,"Globally people devote approximately 90% of their time indoors either in their house or office or institution, etc. Together with the dispersion of outdoor air pollutants, toxins are produced in indoor atmosphere owing to various actions such as heating, cooking, cooling and emissions from building materials. Hence, the indoor air quality (IAQ) influences human well-being and efficiency. Even though indoor air quality (IAQ) research has been done from various outlooks, there is still an absence of inclusive assessment of peer reviewed IAQ studies, which precisely covers the IAQ in rural and urban environment helping to recognize the sources and consequences in both the environment, respectively. Therefore, this review article of scientific studies offers a broad spectrum of pollutants identified in both rural and urban indoor environments in context to India, highlighting the technical interventions, modelling techniques and remedies such as HEPA filters, carbon filters, bioremediation etc. in course of improving IAQ.

Mapping the capacity of concave green land in mitigating urban pluvial floods and its beneficiaries,"Pluvial floods can exert significant pressure on urban sustainability and human wellbeing during rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization and exacerbated flooding have stimulated investigations of green land's role in mitigating urban flooding in China. The newly applied ""Sponge City"" plan considers the concave green land (CGL) as an effective tool in mitigating pluvial floods. However, its capacity and beneficiaries still need to be elucidated. This paper fills this research gap by integrating urban flood simulation, scenario analysis, and mitigation assessment in central Shanghai, China. It reveals that CGL could not only mitigate direct runoff and inundation, but also reduce population exposure and enhance community resilience. CGL with a depth of 0.10-0.20 m can mitigate direct runoffs by 23.63-98.35% and inundation extents by 26.09-82.41%, resulting in a slide of the exposed urban population by 0.40-1.04 million persons and the exposed elders by 0.04-0.12 million persons. Moreover, the effectiveness of CGL varies spatially implying for a sound spatial planning of CGLs and a potential combination with other flood mitigation measures.

A classification scheme for urban agriculture combining technical properties with characteristics related to the economic and social sustainability,"Urban agriculture is often associated with sustainable agricultural practices. However, the variety of systems qualifying as urban agriculture and the limited information available about their sustainability question this direct relationship. To better understand differences in intra-urban agriculture systems and their sustainability, this paper proposed an holistic classification of urban agricultural systems and collected knowledge about the environmental, social, and economic sustainability of these systems. Such a classification is important to evaluate sustainability claims on urban agricultural systems, anticipate potential sustainability trade-offs between urban agricultural systems and propose preventive measures to address these, and ultimately guide the sustainable deployment of these systems. Compared with existing classifications, the novel classification scheme proposed here accounts for technological, social and economic characteristics of urban agriculture systems to better distinguish between all systems. It was built on 91 scientific papers. The economic intensity of production was, for example, an important characteristic to coherently group urban agriculture systems. The intensity of cooperation between all actors was another characteristic emphasized for certain urban agriculture systems. One end of the classification scheme describes ground-based open, socially motivated urban agriculture systems with high cooperation intensity and low production intensity. The other end of the classification scheme describes building-integrated quasi-closed systems with high production intensity. In between, we find: building-integrated conditioned systems, ground-based conditioned systems, and building-integrated open systems. Mapping sustainability claims from literature in the classification scheme supported its definition along the three characteristics. For example, urban farming was associated with job creation, food safety, water savings, and higher yields while urban gardening with educational potentials, biodiversity improvements, and lower yields. Their display in the classification scheme was therefore supported. To further support the use of the proposed scheme, additional quantitative research to better understand and quantify the sustainability of urban agriculture systems is required. © The Author(s) 2024.",About Sufficiency
Spatial and habitat determinants of small-mammal biodiversity in urban green areas: Lessons for nature-based solutions,"In an increasingly anthropogenic world, urban green areas are critical for human well-being because of the ecosystem services they offer. However, the management of these areas often prioritizes economic, architectural, and esthetic needs over ecological functionality, undermining the benefits they ought to provide. Actions to restore the functional ecological processes of urban green areas have thus become increasingly urgent. This study investigated the impact of urban green area characteristics on the community composition of an indicator animal group to inform Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs) for urban biodiversity and sustainability enhancement. We analyzed data on small mammal community composition from three Italian metropolitan cities (Milan, Florence, and Rome), focusing on the distribution pattern of synanthropic and non-synanthropic species. Small mammal surveys were carried out using hair tubes in sampled areas located along a gradient of green area size and fragmentation. Multiple Linear Mixed Models assessed the influence of spatial and habitat green area characteristics on species richness. Synanthropic species richness was positively associated with manicured urban parks, while non-synanthropic species richness was higher in woodland green areas characterized by high shrub cover. Through a Linear Mixed Model and NODF-based Nestedness analyses, we found that competitive exclusion and selective extinction/colonization processes did not significantly influence community composition. These insights emphasize the major influence of habitat composition in supporting functional communities of urban small mammals. To move toward resilient urban ecosystems, NBSs must primarily be implemented at a local scale by creating green patches with high habitat quality, and secondarily, they should be embedded in an interconnected and functional network at a city scale.",About Sufficiency

"Assessing the state of urban forests in Dédougou, a Sahel city in Burkina Faso","The composition and diversity of urban forests are gaining attention in scholarly research, urban development, and sustainability efforts. Despite their critical ecosystem services, literature on urban forests remains limited, especially in developing countries like Burkina Faso. This study examines the urban area of Dedougou, assessing species composition, diversity, and structural characteristics across different land-use and land-cover (LULC) types. Botanical investigations were conducted in five of the city's six sectors, covering administrative, school, residential, and roadside areas. Data, including species, origin, height, and diameter at breast height, were collected from 47 plots (50 m x 50 m) in administrative, school, and residential areas, and 17 plots (50 m x 20 m) along roadsides. A total of 71 species, distributed across 57 genera and 31 families, were identified. Among these, 57% were exotic, 51% were edible, 89% had medicinal properties, and 37% served ornamental purposes. The Shannon diversity index averaged 2.2 +/- 0.8. No significant difference was observed in the distribution of exotic and native species across various LULC types. Residential areas exhibited the highest species richness, with 36 exotic and 30 native species, while roadsides had the lowest, featuring ten exotic and eight native species. The findings have implications for United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goals 11, 13, and 15.

Interface Between Instruments of Development Planning and Biodiversity Planning and Conservation,"Biodiversity sustains human civilisation as it is intricately related to the supply of all the ecosystem services that underscore human well-being. The connotation ‘human well - being’ denotes amongst other things ‘security’ that entails security to ‘resource access’ and ‘adequate livelihoods’- as basic materials for a good life. However, the benefits of growth and development accruing from our natural resources need to be distributed equitably amongst the ‘people’ without damaging the ‘ecological health of the planet’ to achieve the goals of the sustainable development (2015) at the global level. Though cities are proficient means of spatial organisation that provide shelter and livelihood to a large number of people and have developed into foci of innovations and economic growth they have been inept of taking care of nature due to their exhaustive and unsustainable consumption pattern. They are intense hubs of energy and material consumption that emanates massive wastes damaging environmental health and, in turn, biodiversity. The answer to this dilemma lies in the Mainstreaming Biodiversity into the city planning and management which will balance biodiversity and development. Mainstreaming or including biodiversity into urban planning is imperative as cities draw numerous ecosystem services at local, regional and global scales. However, this expression ‘mainstreaming’ warrants a clear understanding of the jargon itself and the instruments that will enable integration of the same. In this paper, an attempt has been made to explore the diverse instruments that are available at the global, national, subnational and local levels for biodiversity conservation and management and urban planning processes. The idea is to explore the interface that exists between the instruments of the two spheres and create a convergence between the processes of urban planning and biodiversity conservation. © 2020, Bentham Books imprint.",About Sufficiency
Co-benefits of urban biodiversity,"Growth and development of an urban area modifies and creates biodiversity, which has a vital role in maintaining and improving the quality of the urban environment. The paper studies the growth and development of Delhi, the capital city of India, and outlines an approach to assess the biodiversity pattern of the metropolis. The co-relation between habitat scales and levels of planning to arrive at a biodiversity profile of an urban area, are explained. The Global Biodiversity Assessment and Convention on Biological Diversity has brought forth the need to conserve biodiversity at global and local levels. Because of their diminishing numbers, the role of species in urban areas has become critical. So far, in cities, open spaces are supposed to mainly cater to aesthetic demands and recreation needs. But if we examine the environmental role they play—pollution abatement, water recharge, indicator of pollution, climatic amelioration, flood control and so on—they are many.

Feeding Cities: Food security and ecosystem support in an urbanizing world,"In this chapter we take a complex systems approach to exploring the linkages among the phenomenon of urbanization, the changing value systems and world perspectives of urban dwellers, the sometimes distant connections to the food production systems that support cities, and the often invisible ecosystem services that support food production and in turn are affected by food production. After we explore the relationship between a range of ecosystem services and their relationship to food production, we present three cases of economically developed cities that secure their food from global sources. The wealthy urban populations in all our three case cities adhere to the highly commoditized systems of industrial production based on energy- and material-intensive external inputs for the bulk of their food provision. Fully integrated into the global market, trade enables these cities to both consume and produce what their consumers desire without regard to the local capacity of ecosystems in the regions around the cities. Although each city is secure under prevailing economic and trade conditions, they are exposed to a range of socio-economic and ecosystem vulnerabilities that arise from the conventional “productivist” food production paradigm upon which they are based. We conclude by proposing a number of scenarios describing plausible trajectories for the evolution of food systems in the twenty-fi rst century as humanity becomes increasingly urbanized. Fundamentally, the ecologically integrated system approach, especially the urban garden component, would go a long way towards reconnecting urban dwellers with the biosphere, with potential positive effects on biodiversity. © 2013, Springer Netherlands.

Mapping Urban Green Infrastructure: A Novel Landscape-Based Approach to Incorporating Land Use and Land Cover in the Mapping of Human-Dominated Systems,"Common approaches tomapping green infrastructure in urbanised landscapes invariably focus on measures of land use or land cover and associated functional or physical traits. However, such onedimensional perspectives do not accurately capture the character and complexity of the landscapes in which urban inhabitants live. The new approach presented in this paper demonstrates how open-source, high spatial and temporal resolution data with global coverage can be used tomeasure and represent the landscape qualities of urban environments. Through going beyond simple metrics of quantity, such as percentage green and blue cover, it is now possible to explore the extent to which landscape quality helps to unpick the mixed evidence presented in the literature on the benefits of urban nature to human well-being. Here we present a landscape approach, employing remote sensing, GIS and data reduction techniques to map urban green infrastructure elements in a large U.K. city region. Comparison with existing urban datasets demonstrates considerable improvement in terms of coverage and thematic detail. The characterisation of landscapes, using census tracts as spatial units, and subsequent exploration of associations with social-ecological attributes highlights the further detail that can be uncovered by the approach. For example, eight urban landscape types identified for the case study city exhibited associations with distinct socioeconomic conditions accountable not only to quantities but also qualities of green and blue space. The identification of individual landscape features through simultaneous measures of land use and land cover demonstrated unique and significant associations between the former and indicators of human health and ecological condition. The approach may therefore provide a promising basis for developing further insight into processes and characteristics that affect human health and well-being in urban areas, both in the United Kingdom and beyond.",About Sufficiency
"The nexus of industrial employment, financial development, urbanization, and human capital in promoting environmental sustainability in E7 economies","Financial development supports economic growth, reduces unemployment, ensures justice, and has an impact on the environment. Human development significantly supports E-7 countries in achieving the goal of stable and qualified economic development in the next decade. This factor affects people’s ability to manage environmental problems and increases their productivity by contributing to people’s industrial and production processes. It can be a guide for states to choose technologies that take into account the clean environment and increase energy efficiency in areas where energy is constantly used. Increasing urbanization encourages various development activities. This study aims to investigate the impact of financial development, human development, urbanization, and industrial employment on environmental quality for E-7 countries with regularized common correlated effects and the Augmented Mean Group long-run estimators. Another important aim of the study is to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 4, 8, 9, 11 and 13. Increasing financial development improves environmental quality in Russia and India, according to robust results from long-run estimators. Increasing human development in China increases environmental pollution. While the expansion of urbanization increases environmental quality in Brazil, it decreases it in China. The increase in employment in the industry increases the load capacity factor in the panel group, Brazil, China, Indonesia, and India. In addition to these results, the current article presents policy recommendations for governments to increase environmental quality on a country basis and provides feasible solutions on how to use the independent variables in the study as environmental tools. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",About Sufficiency
Biodiversity Potential in Brazilian Medium-sized Cities through Human Access to Nature,"The paper examines the relationship between city and environment, assuming that contemporary urbanism and sustainability of urban environment do not dialogue. To this end, from analysis of urban biodiversity, cultural ecosystem services, urban design, biophilia and configurational accessibility, a sample of 21 medium-sized Brazilian cities is investigated. Methodology is structured in two sections: (a) categorization of settlements according to biodiversity potential; and (b) spatial analysis of cultural ecosystem services (CES) to verify human access. Results indicate that investigated settlements present: (i) urbanization advancing through vegetation areas, extensive agricultural areas and patches of tree vegetation, low presence of parks, squares and protected areas; (ii) high to medium potential for biodiversity, using this potential for ecosystem services of provisioning and regulation and; (iii) satisfactory levels of access to cultural ecosystem services that reflect human access to nature. In addition, it was found that the CES are located, based on Space Syntax, in potentially accessible urban areas with potential for social interaction. © 2022 Proceedings 13th International Space Syntax Symposium, SSS 2022.

Integrative management to mitigate diffuse pollution in multi-functional landscapes,"Increasing anthropogenic intervention within the terrestrial environment has perturbed the cycling of major nutrients, such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) with detrimental effects on climate, biodiversity and the ability for ecosystems to supply fundamental services for human health and sustainable economic growth. Controlling diffuse pollutants from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere and receiving waters is paramount for maintaining the integrity of multi-functional landscapes and protecting the wider environment. Utilising four typical land use categories (uplands, woodlands, agriculture: grassland/cropland), we discuss sources and the qualitative risk of diffuse pollutant production that impacts on air and water quality. Integrated diffuse pollution research that combines gaseous, dissolved and solid (particulate) physical phases is essential for understanding inter-relationships between different pollutant fates, and preventing unintentional pollutant swapping. Future research and awareness should focus on mitigation measures that achieve multiple benefits and minimal disbenefits with respect to diffuse pollution, whilst considering other ecosystem service sectors. Where evidence of benefits can be proven, these can be incorporated within an integrated catchment approach to environmental management and planning. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Climatic adaptation strategy under urban agriculture rainwater cropping systems: a case study from watermelon ( Citrullus lanatus) as live mulch,"In-situ live mulch crops such as watermelon can reduce soil temperature, improve soil moisture, and provide additional income for food security in mixed cropping systems. These investigations quantify the impact of in-situ watermelon live mulch densities on yield potential, climatic change adaptation capability and food security strategies in tropical urban amaranth production systems. Imposed were 3 sowing densities of watermelon: 1.5x0.45 m; 1.5x0.90 m; 1.5x1.50 m. Grain amaranth was transplanted at 0.75x0.75 m spacing in an RCB design. Averaged over 2 consecutive cropping's, amaranth grain and watermelon yields were significantly highest at 1.5x0.90 m watermelon plant spacing density optimum for yield potential, climate change adaptability and food security resilient strategy. This corresponded to the reduction in maximum soil temperature of 2 degrees C by amaranth and 3.5 degrees C by watermelon compared to the control without mulch. There was a check plot without amaranth and watermelon but weeds monitored. Soil moisture content was significantly (P=0.05) conserved in the live mulch treatments by 18.2% compared to the bare not mulched soil control of 14%. This research demonstrates that live mulch is useful in rainwater conservation and reduced temperature; and we believe offers opportunities for food security, carbon sequestration and landscape restoration in the humid tropics of sub Saharan Africa countries under rain-fed agriculture climate change scenarios.",About Sufficiency
"Ecosystems Services and Green Infrastructure for Respiratory Health Protection: A Data Science Approach for Paraná, Brazil","Urban ecosystem services have become a main issue in contemporary urban sustainable development, whose efforts are challenged by the phenomena of world urbanization and climate change. This article presents a study about the ecosystem services of green infrastructure towards better respiratory health in a socioeconomic scenario typical of the Global South countries. The study involved a data science approach comprising basic and multivariate statistical analysis, as well as data mining, for the municipalities of the state of Paraná, in Brazil’s South region. It is a cross-sectional study in which multiple data sets are combined and analyzed to uncover relationships or patterns. Data were extracted from national public domain databases. We found that, on average, the municipalities with more area of biodiversity per inhabitant have lower rates of hospitalizations resulting from respiratory diseases (CID-10 X). The biodiversity index correlates inversely with the rates of hospitalizations. The data analysis also demonstrated the importance of socioeconomic issues in the environmental-respiratory health phenomena. The data mining analysis revealed interesting associative rules consistent with the learning from the basic statistics and multivariate analysis. Our findings suggest that green infrastructure provides ecosystem services towards better respiratory health, but these are entwined with socioeconomics issues. These results can support public policies towards environmental and health sustainable management. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",About Sufficiency
"A different look at environmental health: Social and environmental inequities in the metropolitan region of São Paulo, Brazil","The concentration of large populations in metropolitan areas is a great matter of interest in the field of public health, especially in developing countries. Although the metropolization process is considered a worldwide phenomenon, this trend is accentuated in low and medium income countries considered as emerging countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. In the process of metropolization, irreversible impacts were observed on the natural environment, including with respect to pressures on environmental services. In this chapter, the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo in São Paulo (Brazil) is the object of study focused on the analysis of the occupation of watershed protection areas, which provide environmental services and social inequalities, which may be relevant in the context of violence, reflected as a matter of public and environmental health. We used data from Brazilian public institutions, allowing verifying the relations between inequalities in socioeconomic and environmental health of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (MRSP), state of São Paulo, Brazil. We applied a critical analysis to contextualize the 39 municipalities' components of the MRSP with about 20 million inhabitants. The city of São Paulo has a forceful representation as headquarters of the metropolis, with 11.253.503 inhabitants in 2010 with GDP of R$ 389 billion and GDP/capita of R$ 35,271.9 in 2009.As for this economic indicator, we note that the inequality is large, ranging from the highest in the city of Barueri with the lowest R$ 99,595.7 in Francisco Morato with R$ 5,492.6 in 2009. However, the environmental and health inequalities are presented in forms of spatialization with the economic disparities. Thus, under the condition of relevant environmental services providers, we focus the discussion on distinct patterns of inequalities that occur in municipalities with a significant portion of the watershed protection area, providing water to the city of São Paulo. In this condition, exploring the aspect of violence as an important indicator of public health, we observed an increase in the rate of homicides in Mairiporã with 49.9 in 2001 to 53.1 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009 and Juquitiba with 36.7 in 2001 to 68.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009, while Francisco Morato (45.9 in 2001 to 21.6 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009) and Taboão Serra (84.6 in 2001 to 19.4 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009). The urban segregation and social exclusion can be considered as some of the factors associated with increased violence. Concluding Remarks, the watershed areas in MRSP can be considered the most fragile areas by the presence of remnants of green areas, are providers of ecosystem services and suppliers of water to metropolis, and where overlapping social inequities as the areas of greatest violence and environmental degradation. It can be inferred that the environmental and social problems such as violence and inequities in watershed areas can be compounded with the possible exacerbation of climate phenomena. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Markets for conserving biodiversity habitat: Principles and practice,"As residential, commercial, and industrial developments continue to erode the integrity of natural areas, public interest in interactions between ecological and economic systems has intensified. This interest registers in frequently contentious debates about the validity of goals to preserve natural areas and the efficiency and the equity properties of the means to do so. Arguably this same public has denied the goals of environmental protection more frequently than necessary because regulatory authorities have used unnecessarily costly means of implementation.1 The devices used to implement the goals of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) seem a prime example of those means of implementation. Only the most insensitive, strictly urban beings would dare assert in polite company that it is not good in principle to protect the earth's non-urban life-forms and the habitats in which they live. Witness the consistently high standing in polls that the public gives the generic concept of environmental protection, including habitat conservation. The rub appears to be in how to implement the ESA and whether its goals are always feasible, have been made too costly by perverse bureaucratic rigidities and complexities, or are simply feel-good expressions. Much of the land to which the ESA is meant to apply is privately owned. Some threatened or endangered species currently exist only on private land held in multiple ownerships. Suggestions and actual attempts to make implementation of the ESA more flexible and more predictable and less costly for private owners than can be achieved by simply issuing management injunctions to them from on high have not been lacking. Incidental take permits in which development is allowed if a landowner can show that it will not lead to species extinction are granted by the ESA authority. Safe harbor plans in which federal authorities and landowners negotiate no-fault contracts, where owners are not liable for harm to a species if they manage their land in accordance with contract terms, are now sometimes used by federal authorities (Turner and Rylander 1998). Economists and those who now and then listen to economists have proposed variants of tradable effluent permit allocation instruments (Crocker 1966; D. Montgomery 1972), such as tradable habitat preservation credits (Merrifield 1995) and tradable development rights (Stavins 1989). The flexibility and predictability these devices purportedly offer owners have, however, been met with skepticism by occasional commentators, including even some economists. Frey et al. (1996) worry that marketlike instruments will reduce the demand for and crowd out environmental virtue (morality). But virtuous attitudes and the social norms that manifest them can breed disrespect when they ask for more than people can accomplish. Boyd et al. (1999) center their criticisms on the costs of designing site-specific contracts, claims, or rights, owner by owner. Granted, the complexity of designing an ecologically and economically sound system of permits, claims, or rights to develop sites can be daunting. This is an inadequate reason, however, to dismiss out of hand such systems when the only recognized alternative to them is a command-and-control system of questionable virtue in which middle-level bureaucrats and biological technicians are given free rein to designate restricted development sites and to redistribute wealth while using little more than biological criteria to do so. Given that society values natural habitats and the varied organisms that enjoy them, economic efficiency decrees that private landowners be held accountable for the effects their activities have on the socially valued dimensions of these habitats. Nevertheless, accountability must be achieved at the least cost to landowners and to the rest of society if the public is to ungrudgingly accept the ESA. The next section argues that substantial scope exists for the use of tradable permits or credits in habitat conservation efforts. It also compares the economic efficiency and the wealth distribution features of tradable credit schemes to command-and-control schemes. A third section forms the core of the essay. It argues (and, for stylized conditions, formally demonstrates in an appendix) that neither tradable credit systems alone nor wealth redistributing command-and-control systems alone are capable of providing the flexibility and predictability that a socially least-cost design for habitat protection requires. Least-cost designs will initially involve private landowners in a tradable habitat credit system and, subsequently, in a transfer payment, command-and-control exercise operated by a central authority. Contrary to the standard perception that tradable permits or credits and environmental use taxes or subsidies are substitute policy instruments, this chapter suggests that they can be complements. They can reinforce each other's strengths while sidestepping their weaknesses. The fourth section comments on the practical issues likely to be involved in implementing such a hybrid scheme of economic incentives and regulation, with particular attention to the relevance to outcomes of the accuracy of information about habitat attributes and its division between landowners and the regulating authority. In conclusion, I argue that the hybrid scheme is worthy of serious consideration. Circumstances are likely to be plentiful on multiple-ownership private lands where the scheme can achieve public habitat conservation goals in a flexible, predictable, efficient, and equitable fashion. © 2005 by The University of Texas Press.

Just nature-based solutions and the pursuit of climate resilient urban development,"Nature -based solutions (NbS) offer pathways towards climate resilient development.

In urban spaces, NbS are also about the design and re -design of the urban built and natural environment. This presents a need to create the institutions and governance mechanisms that allow for the co -production and co -design of NbS alongside local communities in ways that serve to address justice and legacies of inequality. In this perspective, I examine three areas of focus to deliver just nature -based solutions: problem , process , and progress . Problem focuses on the types of relationships nature -based solutions seek to transform -the race and class -based inequalities embedded in urban form. Process addresses how nature -based solutions can deliver justice through design and co -production. Finally, progress is about developing indicators and measuring progress towards achieving just nature -based solutions and how they reflect diverse and pluralistic value systems. Collectively these should move just NbS towards the repair of social and ecological exploitation in and beyond the city.",About Sufficiency
Towards the intentional multifunctionality of urban green infrastructure: a paradox of choice?,"Decades of research on multifunctional Green Infrastructure (GI) has yet to translate into holistic implementation in the built environment. This oversight stems from assumptions that many ecosystem services occur passively and thus potential synergies are overlooked during planning and design. This study offers specific guidance for coordinating GI planning, design, and construction by examining the current state of academic literature on these aspects. It identifies 15 GI elements (e.g., green roofs) and 15 objectives (e.g., biodiversity) to collectively consider before implementation. The literature tends to isolate discussions of “engineered” GI elements with water-related objectives, while more “natural” GI are linked to biodiversity and human well-being. Coordinating across GI objectives and elements remains imperative, but evaluating too many options risks a paradox of choice. This study recommends short-term adherence to principles of adaptive design and, in the long-term, reemphasizes multifunctionality assessments, inter and transdisciplinary collaboration, and political will. © The Author(s) 2024.",About Sufficiency
"How to build science-action partnerships for local land-use planning and management: Lessons from Durban, South Africa","The gap between scientific knowledge and implementation in the fields of biodiversity conservation, environmental management, and climate change adaptation has resulted in many calls from practitioners and academics to provide practical solutions responding effectively to the risks and opportunities of global environmental change, e.g., Future Earth. We present a framework to guide the implementation of science-action partnerships based on a real-world case study of a partnership between a local municipality and an academic institution to bridge the science-action gap in the eThekwini Municipal Area, South Africa. This partnership aims to inform the implementation of sustainable land-use planning, biodiversity conservation, environmental management, and climate change adaptation practice and contributes to the development of human capacity in these areas of expertise. Using a transdisciplinary approach, implementation-driven research is being conducted to develop several decision-making products to better inform land-use planning and management. Lessons learned through this partnership are synthesized and presented as a framework of enabling actions operating at different levels, from the individual to the interorganizational. Enabling actions include putting in place enabling organizational preconditions, assembling a functional well-structured team, and actively building interpersonal and individual collaborative capacity. Lessons learned in the case study emphasize the importance of building collaborative capacity and social capital, and paying attention to the process of transdisciplinary research to achieve more tangible science, management, and policy objectives in science-action partnerships. By documenting and reflecting on the process, this case study provides conceptual and practical guidance on bridging the science-action gap through partnerships. © 2016 by the author(s).",About Sufficiency
"Vehicle emissions and fertilizer impact the leaf chemistry of urban trees in Salt Lake Valley, UT","The urban nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles are substantially influenced by human activity. Alterations to these cycles include increased inputs from fossil fuel combustion and fertilizer use. The leaf chemistry of urban trees can be used to distinguish between these different N and C sources. Here, we evaluated relationships between urban vegetation and different N and C sources in street and residential trees in the Salt Lake Valley, Utah. We tested three hypotheses: 1) unfertilized street trees on high traffic density roads will have higher leaf %N, more enriched δ15N and more depleted δ13C than unfertilized street trees on low traffic density roads; 2) trees in high income residential neighborhoods will have higher leaf %N, more depleted δ15N and more enriched δ13C than trees in lower income neighborhoods; and 3) unfertilized street trees will have lower leaf %N, more enriched δ15N and more depleted δ13C than fertilized residential trees. Leaf δ15N was more enriched near high traffic density roads for one study species. However, street tree δ15N and δ13C were largely influenced by vehicle emissions from primary and secondary roads within 1000 m radius rather than the immediately adjacent road. Leaf δ13C was correlated with neighborhood income, although this relationship may be the result of variations in irrigation practices rather than variations in C sources. Finally, unfertilized trees in downtown Salt Lake had lower leaf %N, more enriched δ15N and more depleted δ13C than fertilized trees. These results highlight that urban trees can serve as biomonitors of the environment. Moreover, they emphasize that roads can have large spatial footprints and that the leaf chemistry of urban vegetation may be influenced by the spatial patterns in roads and road densities at the landscape scale. This study highlights that vehicle emissions and fertilizer have isotopically distinct influences on urban foliage. It also underscores that dense urban roads have a large spatial footprint. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
"Biodiversity and direct ecosystem service regulation in the community gardens of Los Angeles, CA","Context Urban community gardens are globally prevalent urban agricultural areas and have the potential to fulfill human needs in impoverished neighborhoods, such as food security and access to open space. Despite these benefits, little research has been conducted evaluating environmental and socioeconomic factors influencing community garden plant biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES). Objective Our study investigated the drivers of managed plant richness, abundance, and ES production in community gardens across Los Angeles County, CA from 2010 to 2012 at regional, garden, and plot scales. Methods Fourteen community gardens were visited in the summers of 2010-2012 for comprehensive species surveys across regional, garden, and plot scales. We compared biodiversity to household income, plot size, and gardener ethnicity. Results In total, 707 managed plant species were recorded in summer surveys over a 3-year period. Ornamental plant richness increased with neighborhood income, while edible and medicinal richness increased with size of garden plots. Gardener ethnicity also influenced the composition of managed species, especially edible species. Conclusions We explain these patterns through a hierarchy of needs framework; gardeners preferentially plant species progressively less connected to human need. Ornamental plant increases in high-income regions may be explained by their requirement for financial investment and maintenance time. Cultural and provisioning ES are important for immigrant populations, resulting in ethnically distinct crop assemblages. Finally, distinct species-area relationships imply high demand for food abundance and biodiversity. Our quantitative results indicate that community gardens contribute to a biologically diverse urban ecosystem and provide valued ecosystem services in food insecure regions.",About Sufficiency
Stormwater nature pockets: A case for using green infrastructure to create engaging childhood spaces,"INTRODUCTION Urban areas require stormwater management. Recently there has been a movement towards more nature-based, green infrastructure approaches for managing stormwater. These systems have also demonstrated additional ecosystem benefits much needed in urban areas. At the same time, decades of research support the need for access to nature for healthy childhood development. Designing and locating nature-based stormwater systems where children frequent renders systems as multifunctional spaces, providing synergetic opportunities, which benefit individuals and communities. Challenges to integrating these spaces include safety, cost, and management, all of which can be overcome by smart and appropriate design. Such design requires collaboration between different skillsets and stakeholders through some minimal, but essential changes in the consultation and design process. Ultimately, integrating nature-based stormwater practices into children’s outdoor spaces will provide economic, environmental, and social benefits to urban areas. © 2015, College Publishing.

"Similar cities, but diverse carbon controls: Inspiration from the Yangtze River Delta megacity cluster in China","Addressing global uneven urban development and the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions (CE), this study presents a new method for calculating urban socioeconomic development indexes using a variety of data sources. Using the Yangtze River Delta as an example, we categorize urban areas into core, transitional, and peripheral cities. With the help of extended Kaya-index decomposition models, we evaluate the effects of regional industrial growth, consumer markets, and spatial expansion on urban CE. The research explores differences in CE drivers across and within these city categories. Our findings reveal that in core cities, 31.5 % of CE is due to the industrial structure and 14.9 % due to population density. In transitional cities, CE increases by 60.22 % primarily due to industrial structure and consumer consumption. Peripheral cities, on the other hand, have a complex set of causes for CE, with per capita living, spatial expansion, population size, urbanization, and consumption limitation contributing to 91.97 %, 10.73 %, 14.2 %, 9.34 %, and 24.92 % of CE respectively. Varied factors influence CE intensity differences within each city group. Cleaner production technologies and potential carbon reductions in consumption and industry are identified as key strategies for compensating CE reduction. We propose the adoption of carbon function zoning in urban clusters to leverage the role of carbon function in each area. Territorial spatial planning should ensure a balanced layout of production, living, and ecological functions. Residents' consumption, being the key factor driving CE, must transition toward green, low-carbon consumption, reinforced by societal norms and responsibilities. This research provides valuable theoretical and practical insights into urban classification and CE reduction strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
"Using SPOT Data and FRAGSTAS to Analyze the Relationship between Plant Diversity and Green Space Landscape Patterns in the Tropical Coastal City of Zhanjiang, China","Urban green spaces provide a host of ecosystem services, the quantity and structure of which play an important role in human well-being. Rapid urbanization may modify urban green spaces, having various effects on plant diversity. Tropical coastal cities have urbanized rapidly in recent decades, but few studies have been conducted with a focus on their green spaces. We studied the responses of cultivated and spontaneous plants, both key components of urban flora, to the landscape structure of urban green spaces and possible social drivers. We analyzed existing relationships between plant diversity indices, urban green space landscape metrics (using Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) data,), and social factors, including the type, population density, construction age, and GPS coordinates of each Urban Functional Unit, or UFU. We found that UFUs with more green space patches had higher cultivated and spontaneous species richness than those with fewer green space patches. Spontaneous species richness decreased when green space patches became fragmented, and it increased when green space patches were more connected (e.g., via land bridges). Conversely, cultivated species richness increased with green space patch fragmentation. The phylogenetic diversity of both cultivated and spontaneous plants were weakly associated with green space structure, which was strongly driven by land use. Old UFUs and those with larger populations had more green space patches overall, although they tended to be small and fragmented. Green space patch density was found to increase as the UFU age increased. From the viewpoint of knowledge transfer, understanding the effects and drivers of landscape patterns of urban green spaces could inform the development of improved policies and management of urban green space areas.",About Sufficiency

A multi-dimensional assessment of the environmental and socioeconomic performance of community-based sustainability initiatives in Europe,"The contribution of community-based initiatives towards sustainability transitions is of growing interest. However, systematic, quantitative, and comparative assessments of their potential impact across different environmental, social, and economic dimensions are scarce. In this paper, we present a multi-dimensional assessment of 37 initiatives grouped in the following typologies: community gardens, solidarity purchasing groups, food cooperatives, community energy, recycling, and mobility initiatives. We provide evidence of the capacity of community-based sustainability initiatives to promote effective and efficient low-carbon solutions, social capital and inclusion, human capital, economic impact, and innovation. We show that, thanks in particular to their environmental effects, community energy initiatives are the best performing, although their social impact is weak. The opposite is true for community gardens. Mobility and recycling initiatives rank lower but can obtain meaningful impacts if they engage intensively within their communities. Food cooperatives and purchasing groups have the weakest effects. However, we show that results for individual initiatives are variable—indicating that the specific activities undertaken are less important than how they are conducted. Moreover, the best-performing initiatives are usually active in more than one typology, showing that diversification is an asset. We also show some interesting correlations between the degree of diversity of participants that initiatives can attract, their propensity to diffuse knowledge, and their creativity in finding carbon-efficient solutions. Finally, top-ranked initiatives overall rarely appear at the top of any separate assessment criterion: the possibility of a community-led transition rests on their performance across several dimensions combined. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",About Sufficiency
Socio-ecological interactions promote outbreaks of a harmful invasive plant in an urban landscape,"1. Urban landscapes often harbour organisms that harm people and threaten native biodiversity. These landscapes are characterized by differences in socioeconomic context, habitat suitability and patch connectedness. Identifying which spatial differences enable outbreaks of pests, pathogens and invasive species will improve targeted control efforts.2. We tested hypotheses to explain the distribution and demography of puncturevine Tribulus terrestris, a human-dispersed invasive plant in Boise, a city in the western United States. We hypothesized an increase in puncturevine infestations near low-valued properties with a high proportion of bare ground, the species' preferred microhabitat, that are well connected on the urban road network. To test these hypotheses, we collected data on the abundance, emergence and persistence of reproductive plants in transects spanning >100 km of our study city. We then used hierarchical Bayesian models to evaluate the impacts of spatial covariates on puncturevine distribution and demography.3. Bare ground cover consistently increased abundance, emergence and persistence of puncturevine, indicating the overarching importance of suitable establishment sites for this invasive species.4. Property value had the strongest impact on puncturevine abundance and was the most important main effect in the model for puncturevine emergence. In both models, lower-valued properties had a higher risk of puncturevine occurrence.5. The effects of road network connectivity depended on bare ground cover, with the highest predicted abundance and emergence of puncturevine in patches with low connectivity on the road network and high bare ground cover. Understanding these relationships will require data that can disentangle seed dispersal from es- tablishment limitations.",About Sufficiency
Smart Sustainable Cities of the New Millennium: Towards Design for Nature,"Urban environments consist of a mosaic of natural fragments, planned and unintentional habitats hosting both introduced and spontaneous species. The latter group exploits abandoned and degraded urban niches which, in the case of plants, form what is called the third landscape. In the Anthropocene, cities, open spaces and buildings must be planned and designed considering not only human needs but also those of other living organisms. The scientific approach of habitat sharing is defined as reconciliation ecology, whilst the action of implementing the ecosystem services and functioning of such anthropogenic habitats is called Urban Rehabilitation. However, urban development still represents the main cause of biodiversity loss worldwide. Yet, the approach of planners and landscape architects highly diverges from that of ecologists and scientists on how to perceive, define and design urban green and blue infrastructure. For instance, designers focus on the positive impact that nature (generally associated with indoor and outdoor greeneries) has on human well-being, often neglecting ecosystems’ health. Instead, considering the negative impact of any form of development and to achieve the no net loss Aichi’s objectives, conservationists apply mitigation hierarchy policies to avoid or reduce the impact and to offset biodiversity. The rationale of this review paper is to set the fundamentals for a multidisciplinary design framework tackling the issue of biodiversity loss in the urban environment by design for nature.

City as Urban Ecology: Ecosystems as Climate Regulators and Sources of Resilience,"Due to its carbon impact, building has become increasingly questionable: famous architects and urban designers contend, the disciplines should either deploy mapping skills towards better decision-making, or focus on careful small-scale interventions. A combined approach to climate and resilience addresses contexts of population growth and housing scarcity: The method combines dense conversion of buildings to reduce carbon footprint, together with transformation and revegetation of urban spaces for climate mitigation. Two co-developed projects illustrate in combination a strategy mapping out such urban renewal potentials, testing design at precinct scale through precise interventions, and application through 1:1-prototypes. The design-research investigations propose to look beyond buildings into whole city approaches to urban resilience, which rehabilitate urban structures and spaces. Two complementary blueprint case-studies investigate how landscape can combine with urban renewal strategies to address challenges of climate (urban heat, flooding) and biodiversity (extinction) as well as the very human need for engaging urban spaces. The strategies combine architecture, urban and landscape design to re-envision city spaces as new urban ecologies. They test how to reappropriate underused urban spaces, creating blue-green urban networks of amenity as optimistic perspective for the future. The intertwining studies unpack how we may reconceptualise city spaces as resilient and adaptive urban ecosystems comprising flora, fauna and humans within urban environments. Such ecosystems are able to absorb heavy rainfalls and heat and thus reduce vulnerability to climate change and weather extremes. A first study focused on identifying underused spaces within Melbourne’s existing urban fabric for ecosystems that could host new resilient infrastructures and programs. The redesigned spaces create a balance between urban and natural systems. A second study delved into how to design and implement such ecosystems within urban contexts though a precinct strategy and four 1:1 prototypes. Starting from specific urban spaces, it explored their capacity to host particular types of ecosystems framed around specific endemic animals. The article will develop how these explorations have culminated in an expansion of the one-health concept (WHO, 2024) applied currently in health sciences in the field of urban design and planning. A new expanded concept conceptualizes the interdependency between human, biological and infrastructural health in cities. Thereby, it highlights the importance of thinking the city as an interlinked ecosystem while redesigning urban spaces for resilient and optimistic futures. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",About Sufficiency
Setting priorities for urban forest planning. A comprehensive response to ecological and social needs for the metropolitan area of rome (Italy),"Urban forests represent key elements of green infrastructure and provide essential ecosystem services in both the ecological and social spheres. Therefore, forestation planning plays a decisive role in the sustainable development strategies of metropolitan areas and addresses the challenge of maintaining biodiversity while improving human health and well-being. The aim of this work is to present a methodological approach that can be used to identify priorities in urban forest planning and can provide comprehensive responses to ecological and social needs in any metropolitan context. The approach, which is based on interdisciplinary principles of landscape ecology, ecosystem geography and dynamic plant sociology, has been adopted in the Municipality of Rome (Italy). The first step entails defining an ecological framework for forestation plans by means of the ecological land classification and assessment of landscape conservation status. The second step entails setting forestation priorities according to both ecological and social criteria. The application of the method proved to effectively select limited areas requiring intervention within an extensive metropolitan area. Furthermore, it provided responses to sustainability issues such as long-term maintenance of restored habitats, landscape perspective of planning, greening of urban agriculture, improvement in urban resilience, and cost-effective improvement in ecosystem services provision. © 2015 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Green infrastructure and ecosystem services - is the devil in the detail?,"Background Green infrastructure is a strategic network of green spaces designed to deliver ecosystem services to human communities. Green infrastructure is a convenient concept for urban policy makers, but the term is used too generically and with limited understanding of the relative values or benefits of different types of green space and how these complement one another. At a finer scale/more practical level, little consideration is given to the composition of the plant communities, yet this is what ultimately defines the extent of service provision. This paper calls for greater attention to be paid to urban plantings with respect to ecosystem service delivery and for plant science to engage more fully in identifying those plants that promote various services. Scope Many urban plantings are designed based on aesthetics alone, with limited thought on how plant choice/composition provides other ecosystem services. Research is beginning to demonstrate, however, that landscape plants provide a range of important services, such as helping mitigate floods and alleviating heat islands, but that not all species are equally effective. The paper reviews a number of important services and demonstrates how genotype choice radically affects service delivery. Conclusions Although research is in its infancy, data are being generated that relate plant traits to specific services, thereby helping identify genotypes that optimize service delivery. The urban environment, however, will become exceedingly bland if future planting is simply restricted to monocultures of a few 'functional' genotypes. Therefore, further information is required on how to design plant communities where the plants identified (1) provide more than a single benefit (multifunctionality), (B) complement each other in maximizing the range of benefits that can be delivered in one location, and (3) continue to maintain public acceptance through diversity. The identification/development of functional landscape plants is an exciting and potentially high-impact arena for plant science. © The Author 2016.

"Exploring the Impact of Spatial Arrangements on BREEAM Outstanding Projects in London, UK","The spatial configuration of urban areas impacts environmental sustainability, social equity, and economic and social resilience. This study examines the intricate relationship between spatial arrangements and the planning and design of BREEAM Outstanding projects in London, UK. It analyses the relationship between urban morphology and the effectiveness of sustainable building practices and contributes to the broader objectives of urban sustainability. This research focuses on London, UK—a city renowned for its complex urban fabric and architectural heterogeneity—using a multi-case study approach to dissect the elements that facilitate the development of BREEAM Outstanding projects. This study analyses key spatial characteristics such as land use diversity, subway network analysis, and street network analysis using betweenness centrality of edges and node degrees. These factors are considered due to their impact on energy performance, carbon emissions, and social sustainability metrics. Furthermore, this research explores how urban design strategies, such as enhanced walkability and mixed-use development, reinforce the success of BREEAM-certified Outstanding-rated projects. The findings of this investigation reveal a correlation between urban environments and the development of BREEAM Outstanding-rated projects in London. By aligning the spatial organisation of urban form with BREEAM principles, urban planners, policymakers, and architects can facilitate the creation of cities that are environmentally sustainable, socially inclusive, and economically prosperous. The research offers substantive insights and actionable recommendations for future urban development, advocating for a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to sustainable city planning and design. The spatial arrangement of urban form impacts the planning and design of BREEAM Outstanding projects. Findings from current and future research will be used to investigate the connections between spatial arrangement and various categories in BREEAM and how they can influence future sustainable urban environments to set a benchmark for sustainability for contributing to a more equitable urban future. © 2024 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Spider assemblages within greenspaces of a deindustrialized urban landscape,"Many Midwestern cities in the United States have experienced high levels of economic decline and population loss. This deindustrialization has led to thousands of acres of vacant land maintained as grassy habitats. The communities living within these neighborhoods have conceptualized reutilization strategies for this land, including urban agriculture and the creation of small parks of native plantings. In this 2-year study, we examined the impacts of vacant land conversion on spiders within residential vacant lots, community gardens, and planted prairies within the peri-urban park system. At the time of the study, planted prairies on previously vacant land were not common, so those within the park system may serve as a foundation for future plantings. We found that maintained vacant lots contained the most numerous spider assemblages, which was dominated by disturbance-tolerant habitat generalist species. Community gardens contained numerically fewer spiders but a slightly richer assemblage than vacant lots. Similarly low numbers were also found in planted prairies but the assemblage was the most diverse of the greenspaces examined. We also contrasted results at the family versus genus level in order to assess the taxonomic sufficiency relevant for future studies, and found that genus level was important for elucidating the effects of urban land use on these spider assemblages. From this research, we conclude that spiders are an important indicator group of disturbance when examining urban greenspace management and revitalization, and that alteration in greenspace design will influence biodiversity and assemblage composition. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",About Sufficiency
Soil infectivity and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities in four urban green sites in central Argentina,"Many cities around the globe strive for create and maintain urban forests to improve human health, welfare and more positive interactions towards nature. Frequently, the only available land has compacted and degraded soils with an altered soil biota. Studies are needed to address soilborne fungi biodiversity especially that of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), essential for plant development. Our aim was to evaluate the AMF community composition and soil infectivity in four urban sites with different disturbance levels and management histories (Córdoba, Argentina). In two urban forests (reference and restored) and two parklands (forested and control), indigenous AMF morphospecies, soil compaction and dominant plant cover were determined together with the soil infectivity in a greenhouse experiment. Results indicated that AMF communities were dominated by Funneliformis geosporum, Glomus brohultii and Rhizophagus intraradices which are considered generalists and resilient to harsh environmental conditions. AMF community composition varied greatly between the undisturbed reference site and the more disturbed parklands. The richness, diversity and soil infectivity were higher in both urban forests compared to parklands and was partially related with the greater variety of plant physiognomies (in restored site), the dominance of arboreal cover (in reference site) and the lowest soil compaction compared to parklands. In the restored forest, AMF richness and diversity were higher compared to the parklands and to the control parkland, respectively. The greater subsoil compaction and the higher percentage of herbaceous cover (mainly monospecific lawn) represented the most disturbed conditions as a consequence of trampling and subsequent soil erosion. We concluded that differences existed between urban forests and parklands sites with variable disturbance intensities and management histories, however, the parameters analysed here do not fully describe the effects of local urban conditions in the composition and infectivity status of AMF in the soil, and hence future research approaches are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH",About Sufficiency
"Social benefit cost analysis of ecosystem-based climate change adaptations: a community-level case study in Tanna Island, Vanuatu","Small island developing states are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including more intense and frequent extreme weather, warming temperatures, coastal erosion, inundation, and coral bleaching. Locally-specific natural resource threats, associated with population growth and tourism, exacerbate these systemic risks, which are particularly acute where community well-being is subsistence-based and directly reliant on ecosystem services. Garden productivity is falling as the cropping/fallow cycle intensifies and culturally and there is loss of observance of traditional resource taboos, eroding the effectiveness of customary management. Ecosystem based adaptations (EbA) provide a fruitful range of interventions and are beginning to attract development funding. We undertook a social benefit cost analysis for a suite of interconnecting EbAs for Tanna in Vanuatu. We found that funds targeted at increasing the productivity of the gardens returns significant social benefit. This also reduces pressure on natural resource threats and can potentially be adopted by all households on Tanna. In addition, increasing the community's capacity to balance formal forest and reef conservation with customary management can provide small, but nevertheless important complimentary benefits. Our programme design included interlinking activities, including a series of demonstration garden plots, extension officers, community radio, a community ranger programme and a tree nursery.",About Sufficiency
Soil quality is key for planning and managing urban allotments intended for the sustainable production of home-consumption vegetables,"The growing importance of urban allotments in planning and managing urban areas is due to the combined positive effects on ecosystem services, the economy and human well-being, especially of groups of the urban population that can be vulnerable (e.g. the elderly, immigrants, low-income families). Some studies have highlighted the potential risk of contamination by metals of vegetables grown in urban areas and the lack of appropriate site-specific risk assessments. However, surveys are still lacking on the possibilities of using urban soil as a good substrate to produce vegetables for home consumption. We assessed the soil quality in two areas in Pisa (Italy), one intended for urban horticulture and the other already cultivated for that purpose. We analysed the soils for the main chemical and physical characteristics (texture, bulk density, water stability index, pH, cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, phosphorous) and elements (Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr, Zn, Cd, As, K, Al and Mn). Our results showed that both areas had physical and chemical heterogeneity due to the effects of urbanization and to the different cultivation techniques employed. The metal content was lower than the guidelines limits, and the soil conditions (pH = 8) greatly reduced the metal mobility. Copper concentration in some of the cultivated area samples was higher than the limits, representing a possible stress factor for the microbial biodiversity and fauna. Our findings demonstrate that site-specific surveys are necessary before planning urban cultivation areas, and educating urban gardeners regarding sustainable cultivation techniques is a priority for a safe environment.",About Sufficiency
Complexity-biodiversity relationships on marine urban structures: reintroducing habitat heterogeneity through eco-engineering,"Urbanization is leading to biodiversity loss through habitat homogenization. The smooth, featureless surfaces of many marine urban structures support ecological communities, often of lower biodiversity, distinct from the complex natural habitats they replace. Eco-engineering (design for ecological co-benefits) seeks to enhance biodiversity and ecological functions on urban structures. We assessed the benefits to biodiversity of retrofitting four types of complex habitat panels to an intertidal seawall at patch (versus flat control panels) and site (versus unmodified control seawalls and reference rocky shores) scales. Two years after installation, patch-scale effects of complex panels on biodiversity ranged from neutral to positive, depending on the protective features they provided, though all but one design (honeycomb) supported unique species. Water-retaining features (rockpools) and crevices, which provided moisture retention and cooling, increased biodiversity and supported algae and invertebrates otherwise absent. At the site scale, biodiversity benefits ranged from neutral at the high-and mid-intertidal to positive at the low-intertidal elevation. The results highlight the importance of matching eco-engineering interventions to the niche of target species, and environmental conditions. While species richness was greatest on rockpool and crevice panels, the unique species supported by other panel designs highlights that to maximize biodiversity, habitat heterogeneity is essential.

"Conceptual and Practical Approaches to Integrated Watershed Management and Agroforestry to Address Food Security and Environmental Degradation in Lake Tana and the Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia","Forests and trees provide food, fuelwood, and construction materials and many environmental benefits, such as erosion control, clean water and air, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration. The forest covers in Ethiopia and that of the Blue Nile River Basin in particular have been deteriorating at a progressive rate. The situation is even worse in the Angereb watershed. The major causes of deforestation and environmental degradation in Ethiopia are increasing population, increasing demand for farmlands, and increasing demand for fuelwood for cooking and construction materials. The effects of poor farming practices and lack of conservation are the main causes for the siltation of the Angereb dam and the pollution of drinking water from the dam. To address these environmental and livelihood problems, concepts of sustainability and ecosystem-based approaches were applied. We involved different stakeholders, such as the Gondar City Administration, Department of Forestry and Agriculture, Department of Water Affairs, Farmers in the Angereb watershed, University of Gondar, and the Corvallis-Gondar Sister Cities Association in the project. Through this participatory approach, the stakeholders identified the natural resource problems in the Angereb watershed, proposed integrated watershed management involving soil and water conservation, agroforestry, tree planting, and reduced siltation of the dam. Through this project, we improved the tree nursery at Weleka and raised multipurpose indigenous and exotic tree species for planting. Farmers were involved in tree planting and agroforestry practices, such as establishing riparian buffers along the streams, alley cropping for soil and water conservation by planting trees on terraces and agroforests/home gardens to address food security. Through this project, 2.5 million tree seedlings were planted on 560 hectares in the Angereb watershed in ten years. Since 2010, 19 water sources were constructed, including drilled wells, hand-dug wells, and developed springs to provide clean drinking water for 1700 households in Gondar city and the surrounding villages. We recommend scaling up the ecosystem-based approaches, using lessons learned on agroforestry, tree planting, and soil and water conservation in the Angereb watershed to the larger Blue Nile River Basin. This will address environmental degradation, soil erosion, and food security, which will have great impacts on survival of Lake Tana and extend the longevity of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) by reducing siltation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",About Sufficiency
"Understanding and conceptualizing how urban green and blue infrastructure affects the food, water, and energy nexus: A synthesis of the literature","The interactive dynamics in the food, water, and energy system as a nexus (FWEN) are critical to the sustainable development of global cities, and they can be mediated by green and blue infrastructure (GBI) in the urban area. Here we provide a comprehensive literature review to examine how GBI affects FWEN in urban centers, an area which is currently understudied. In order to do this, we undertake a systematic review of the literature using a meta-analytic approach and topic modelling. Based on our synthesis, we develop a conceptual framework of the key links between urban GBI and FWEN and the direction and magnitude of the relationship. We found that GBIs can benefit food supply, energy saving, and climate change mitigation but at a price of food safety and water contamination. Well-designed urban construction can help curb the negative effects. Therefore, we need to make deliberate and integrative policy to link GBI with each element in urban FWEN. Moreover, the focus of studies on GBIFWEN links is also heterogeneous across cities: urban agriculture and food security are priorities in cities located in Africa and Asia as well as in lower income and larger cities (but not metropolitan areas), while the cooling effect of green space has been a focus for cities of middle or high income. Finally, current research focuses on isolated analysis, lacking integrated studies needed for decision making supporting tools. While isolated analyses lead to connectivity failures and can result in adverse impacts, integrated analyses can identify interdependencies of environmental resources between parts of a cycle and across different scales, which can increase resource efficiency and minimize environmental degradation. Therefore, our key findings point out the importance of linking the effects of GBI on each component of FWEN in both research and policy making. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
The 2019 report of the MJA–Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: a turbulent year with mixed progress,"The MJA–Lancet Countdown on health and climate change was established in 2017 and produced its first Australian national assessment in 2018. It examined 41 indicators across five broad domains: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. It found that, overall, Australia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health, and that policy inaction in this regard threatens Australian lives. In this report we present the 2019 update. We track progress on health and climate change in Australia across the same five broad domains and many of the same indicators as in 2018. A number of new indicators are introduced this year, including one focused on wildfire exposure, and another on engagement in health and climate change in the corporate sector. Several of the previously reported indicators are not included this year, either due to their discontinuation by the parent project, the Lancet Countdown, or because insufficient new data were available for us to meaningfully provide an update to the indicator. In a year marked by an Australian federal election in which climate change featured prominently, we find mixed progress on health and climate change in this country. There has been progress in renewable energy generation, including substantial employment increases in this sector. There has also been some progress at state and local government level. However, there continues to be no engagement on health and climate change in the Australian federal Parliament, and Australia performs poorly across many of the indicators in comparison to other developed countries; for example, it is one of the world's largest net exporters of coal and its electricity generation from low carbon sources is low. We also find significantly increasing exposure of Australians to heatwaves and, in most states and territories, continuing elevated suicide rates at higher temperatures. We conclude that Australia remains at significant risk of declines in health due to climate change, and that substantial and sustained national action is urgently required in order to prevent this. © 2019 AMPCo Pty Ltd",About Sufficiency
"Climate change policies reduce air pollution and increase physical activity: Benefits, costs, inequalities, and indoor exposures","The burden of diseases attributable to air pollution is comparable to those of global health risks such as unhealthy diets and tobacco smoking, with many air pollution sources also emitting climate heating gases. In this UK study we estimated the co-benefits of Net Zero (NZ) climate policy on the health benefits of air pollution reduction, increased active travel, outdoor exposure inequalities and indoor air pollution changes. The study focused on two of the largest UK sources, road transport and building heating, with comparisons made between NZ and UK existing policy, referred to as Business as Usual (BAU). Particulate matter (PM2.5), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Ozone (O3) projections were made between 2019 and 2050, with emphasis placed upon the NZ co-benefits in 2030 and 2040. We compared the UK BAU scenarios with the Climate Change Committee's (CCC) Balanced Net Zero Pathway (BNZP) and Widespread Innovation (WI) pathway. Compared to BAU predictions, BNZP assumptions lead to more electric vehicles, reduced vehicle km, more low carbon building heating, and reduced emissions of NO2 and PM2.5. By 2040 under BNZP, relative to BAU, the buildings sector was predicted to be three times more effective at reducing PM2.5 than road transport. To help reduce the inequality gap the NZ building transition was tailored toward those most in need. Outdoor air pollution exposure inequalities prevailed across the socioeconomic spectrum, especially for NO2, but were less pronounced due in part to NZ policies. Core air quality health benefits for the BNZP buildings sector were £21.3 billion (16.4 to 26.2) by 2050 and £98.4 billion (75.7 to 121.1) by 2154. For the transport sector the health benefits were £9.1 billion (7.0 to 11.2) by 2050 and £36.5 billion (28.1 to 44.9) by 2154. NZ building sector operating costs did not achieve break-even via efficiency savings, but with Greenhouse Gas (GHG) (lower benefits) break-even was achieved in 2052. With additional air pollution health benefits, building-sector time to break-even improved by between 3.1 (2.5 to 4.7) and 6.3 (4.7 to 7.6) years to between 2046 and 2049. Analysis found that removing gas cooking at home, for NZ, may result in greater concentration reductions than outdoor air pollution for NO2. Net Zero health and economic co-benefits are large, as are the changes needed, requiring political leadership and public engagement. Our findings are relevant to other countries facing the NZ transition. © 2024",About Sufficiency
Residential Greenery: State of the Art and Health-Related Ecosystem Services and Disservices in the City of Berlin,"Inclusively accessible green areas are essential for livable cities. The residential greenery on a door's step of urban dwellers has rarely been the subject of research. Here we provide insights into the state of the art of residential greenery in Berlin, Germany. We focus on socially disadvantaged neighborhoods exposed to high loads of environmental stressors and belonging to four relevant building types of Central European cities. 32 plots in eight sample areas were randomly chosen and surveyed during 2017 and 2018. We surveyed the presence of structural elements, the presence and abundance of woody species and the health-related ecosystem (dis-)services (i.e., species' air filtration and allergenic potential). We analysed the similarity among tree species to assess plant use patterns. The air cleaning and allergenic potential of woody species were assigned based on literature. In order to discuss strategies to improve residential greenery, we performed an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of these green spaces. We revealed a high dissimilarity of woody species assemblages across sites and within different building types, indicating no common plant use fashion. Recorded species provide moderate to high air filtering capacity. One to two third of all trees have a high allergenic potential that has to be addressed in future plant use decisions. Bike racks, benches, lights and playgrounds are common elements, whereas bioswales, facade-bound greening, atrium, fountains or ponds are rare. Their implementation can enhance the health and wellbeing of local residents. Building-attached greenery can improve densely built up areas of the Wilhelminian period, whereas space-intensive measures can be implemented in the spacious greenery of row-buildings settlements of the 1920s-1970s and of large housing estates of the 1970s-1980s.

Environment and health in italian cities: The case of taranto,"Like heterotrophic organisms, cities live on the basis of a strong imbalance between the relevant inflows of matter and energy and outflows of waste and emissions, which can extend over large areas. The data of the ecological footprint of cities have quantified emblematically this imbalance. The rapid growth of urbanization, especially in developing countries, is a matter of serious concern. Unsustainable by definition, cities generate environmental impacts of all kinds, with intensities that vary according to the characteristics of the areas in which they develop. Italian cities are a significant case study, for the high density of population and economic activity, the shortage of green areas, the internal mobility largely centered on the private car, as well as for the frequent breaches of the rules and laws oriented to protect the environment.

Valuing ecosystem services of community gardens in developing countries: a case study of Dezful City in Iran,"Allotment (AGs) and community gardens (CGs) are types of urban gardens that provide diverse ecosystem services (ESs) such as climate regulation, beautiful landscapes, biodiversity and food security. Despite this, there are no AGs or CGs in many developing countries such as Iran. One of the main reasons for the lack of development of CGs in developing countries is the lack of proper understanding by policy-makers and citizens regarding the economic value of the ESs provided and the lack of disclosure of the benefits of its construction in urban areas. The purpose of this study is to analyse the preferences of citizens, to examine the existence of a potential market, to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) for the creation and operation of CG services and to investigate the factors affecting residents’ WTP in Dezful, Iran. For this purpose, a choice experiment, based on the stated preferences valuation approach, was applied through interviews with 170 respondents living in Dezful urban area. The data were collected during the autumn of 2022 and analysed using conditional logit model. The results indicated that the responding citizens are willing to pay 4.57 USD per month to create CG and operate its ESs in Dezful. Amongst the attributes and ESs of the community garden, citizens valued cultural services the most, followed by provisioning services. In addition, the variables “age”, “being native”, “education”, “household expenditure level” and “awareness and recognition of CG ecosystem services” had a significant effect on WTP. According to the results, it is suggested to follow the policy of creating CGs with the participation of citizens instead of focusing only on the creation of urban green space with a government budget and heavy financial burden. CGs, while providing diverse ESs, can generate sustainable incomes for municipalities and accelerate the movement toward sustainable urban development. © Mostafa Baniasadi & M.

Efficiency evaluation of low impact development practices on urban flood risk,"Urban flood risk assessment delivers invaluable information regarding flood management as well as preventing the associated risks in urban areas. The present study prepares a flood risk map and evaluate the practices of lowimpact development (LID) intended to decrease the flood risk in Shiraz Municipal District 4, Fars province, Iran. So, this study investigate flood vulnerability using MCDM models and some indices, including population density, building age, socio-economic conditions, floor area ratio, literacy, the elderly population, and the number of building floors to. Then, the map of thematic layers affecting the urban flood hazard, including annual mean rainfall, land use, elevation, slope percentage, curve number, distance from channel, depth of groundwater, and channel density, was prepared in GIS. After conducting a multicollinearity test, data mining models were used to create the urban flood hazard map, and the urban flood risk map was produced using ArcGIS 10.8. The evaluation of vulnerability models was shown through the use of Boolean logic that TOPSIS and VIKOR models were effective in identifying urban flooding vulnerable areas. Data mining models were also evaluated using ROC and precision -recall curves, indicating the accuracy of the RF model. The importance of input variables was measured using Shapley value, which showed that curve number, land use, and elevation were more important in flood hazard modeling. According to the results, 37.8 percent of the area falls into high and very high categories in terms of flooding risk. The study used a stormwater management model (SWMM) to simulate node flooding and provide management scenarios for rainfall events with a return period ranging from 2 to 50 years and five rainstorm events. The use of LID practices in flood management was found to be effective for rainfall events with a return period of less than 10 years, particularly for two-year events. However, the effectiveness of LID practices decreases with an increase in the return period. By applying a combined approach to a region covering approximately 10 percent of the total area of Shiraz Municipal District 4, a reduction of 2 - 22.8 percent in node flooding was achieved. The analysis of data mining and MCDM models with a physical model revealed that more than 60% of flooded nodes were classified as ""high"" and ""very high"" risk categories in the RF-VIKOR and RFTOPSIS risk models.",About Sufficiency
Ten questions concerning the role of urban greenery in shaping the future of urban areas,"Strengthening sustainability starts with maintaining a balanced relationship between society, the environment, and the economy, and one of the pillars of doing this is increasing the amount of green infrastructure and expanding it in urban areas. Densely populated urban areas with fewer greenery are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including sea level rise, storm surge, heat waves, droughts, and changing diseases, and vulnerable populations in urban areas are likely to be disproportionately affected. In addition to providing multidimensional benefits to all ecosystems, urban greenery is influential in developing sustainable lifestyles and healthy eating habits, increasing individual well-being derived from the need for a sense of belonging and social inclusion, as well as reducing carbon footprint. As urban greenery is part of urban development but less attention is paid to it, the benefits of these areas should be further explored and highlighted. Thus, ten questions were raised concerning the contribution of urban greenery to the future of urban areas.

The milk run revisited: A load factor paradox with economic and environmental implications for urban freight transport,"Research has shown that time access restrictions in city centers might increase social sustainability aspects such as livability or safety, but might also increase the number of vehicles and the total distance travelled; which have negative environmental impact and can decrease economic sustainability. In this paper we see that this negative effect could also be the result of other access restrictions, like load factor restrictions, and may be related to factors other than the number of vehicles and total distance travelled. Such as if the distribution center is in the outskirts of the city and customers are situated outside the city center. In this study a common urban distribution network scenario is presented - the milk run - where only the load factor is changed. Increasing the load factor is usually regarded as a way of improving efficiency, but we observe that under certain conditions improving the load factor affects economic and environmental sustainability, by increasing total costs and emissions. Following insights from this study, implementation of policies and business decisions in urban freight distribution are recommended not to use single key performance indicators. Following insights from this study, policy makers and companies should be careful when using single key performance indicators in urban freight distribution. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",About Sufficiency
The Role of Urban Agriculture as a Nature-Based Solution: A Review for Developing a Systemic Assessment Framework,"Urbanization and achieving sustainable agriculture are both major societal challenges. By reducing food miles and connecting people with nature, food cultivation in cities has several major advantages. However, due to further urban development (peri-) urban agriculture (UPA) is under threat. To strengthen UPA, we argue for considering UPA as a nature-based solution (NbS) supporting systemic approaches for societal challenges. However, academic knowledge on UPA's contribution to various societal challenges of urbanization is still fragmented. This study addresses the gap by conducting a systemic literature review, incorporating 166 academic articles focusing on the global north. The results of the review show that UPA contributes to ten key societal challenges of urbanization: climate change, food security, biodiversity and ecosystem services, agricultural intensification, resource efficiency, urban renewal and regeneration, land management, public health, social cohesion, and economic growth. The value of UPA is its multifunctionality in providing social, economic and environmental co-benefits and ecosystem services. When implementing UPA, social, institutional, economic, technical, geographical, and ecological drivers and constraints need to be considered. To upscale UPA successfully, the study develops an integrative assessment framework for evaluating the implementation and impact efficiency of UPA.

In this study, we performed a multiple linear regression using 34 cities in different regions across the globe to investigate the relationship between green spaces and public health. Our analysis suggested that for richer cities, green spaces were associated with better public health; whereas a greater area of green spaces was associated with reduced public health in the poorest cities. In contrast to previous studies, which typically found positive relationships between green spaces and health benefits, we demonstrate that health benefits of green spaces could be context dependent.",About Sufficiency

Commercial urban agriculture: A review for sustainable development,"Ensuring food security, improving sustainability, and, at the same time, demonstrating the widely perceived economic value are challenges presented by commercial urban agriculture. This article explores the economic, social, and environmental factors that contribute to commercial urban agriculture as a response to sustainable development. Therefore, using text mining, a scientific survey of information was carried out to verify the predominant approaches in the literature. The economic causes are the main drivers of the activity, especially when related to the generation of employment and income, minimization of costs along the supply chain, and the proximity of the local market to the consumer. Investigations on environmental sustainability have shown significant growth in recent years, as commercial urban agriculture contributes to changes in the interactions of the urban environment, especially for land use, ecosystem conservation, biodiversity, climate improvement, and urban landscape. There is also evidence of a positive outlook on the future of urban agriculture characterized as an indispensable activity for the local production of sustainable food, which tends to minimize the pressures on conventional agriculture and contribute to facing global challenges. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
"Multi-temporal remote sensing and geospatial analysis for urban ecosystem service dynamics: A three-decade assessment of land surface transformation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","The rapid transformation of Earth's surface through urbanization presents critical challenges for ecosystem sustainability and climate resilience. This study employs advanced remote sensing and geospatial technologies to monitor and assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban ecosystem services in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, over three decades (1993-2023). Using multi-temporal Landsat imagery analyzed through Support Vector Machine algorithms in Google Earth Engine, we achieved high-accuracy (>85%) land use/land cover classification to quantify urban expansion patterns and their impact on ecosystem service values (ESVs). The analysis revealed significant urban intensification, with built-up areas expanding by 145.70 km(2), resulting in the conversion of 130.74 km(2) of barren soil, 7.14 km(2) of vegetation, and 7.71 km(2) of water bodies. This transformation led to a substantial reduction in ESVs totaling $477.48 million, with the most significant impacts on hydrological regulation (-$114.25 million), waste treatment (-$97.05 million), and biodiversity protection (-$72.78 million) services. The spatiotemporal analysis demonstrated clear patterns of ecosystem service degradation, particularly in the city's central regions. Our findings provide crucial insights for achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals (Target 11.1, 6.6., 13.1, 3.9 and 15.1) by quantifying the environmental costs of rapid urbanization and informing evidence-based urban planning strategies. The study's innovative integration of remote sensing, machine learning, and ecosystem service valuation offers a robust framework for monitoring urban ecosystem dynamics and supporting sustainable urban development in rapidly growing arid regions.",About Sufficiency
A systematic review of the relationship between urban forest quality and socioeconomic status or race,"The quantity of urban forests in cities is critical for biodiversity conservation and human health, and is known to be distributed unequally. Increasingly, the quality of urban forests are also being recognised as shaping the benefits they provide. Previous studies and reviews have demonstrated that the quality of urban green spaces is associated with patterns of inequality as measured by socio-economic status and race (in the U.S). This study extends this body of knowledge to urban forests by systematically reviewing the urban forest literature (that explicitly study the urban forest) exploring the relationship between urban forest quality and both socio-economic status and race. Two academic databases (SCOPUS and Web of Science) were systematically searched. A total of 2012 papers were screened and 21 articles were included in this study. Almost all studies (20/21) found evidence of inequality, with at least one significant association between measures of urban forest quality and socio-economic status or race. However, 6 studies found contrasting patterns, with lower socioeconomic status areas having higher urban forest quality. There was variation in the type of ‘urban forest’ studied, and variation in the ways both urban forest quality and socio-economic status were measured, making inter-study comparisons difficult. Interestingly, the literature was geographically diverse, and future research could continue to focus on countries in Africa, South America and Asia with diverse needs for and uses of urban forests. In conclusion, this review finds evidence for inequity in the distribution of urban forest quality. Future research that more clearly describes the urban forests being studied and that explores sociocultural variation in perceived quality would allow better generalisation and understanding of forest quality patterns. © 2022",About Sufficiency
"A Systematic Review of the Role of Land Use, Transport, and Energy-Environment Integration in Shaping Sustainable Cities","Land use, transport, and energy-environment integration (LUTEI) is receiving considerable attention as an elaborate approach to improving urban resilience. Research evidence on this multidisciplinary topic tends to be fragmented, hindering constructive analysis of its role in shaping sustainable cities. This paper addresses this by undertaking a holistic systematic review to consolidate diverse perspectives. The analysis of 195 reviewed papers identified four main clusters of knowledge that include methodological approaches, policy instruments, urban design elements, and impacts of interventions. The analysis revealed that a growing body of literature is increasingly focused on improving accessibility planning, transit-oriented development, and policy integration to achieve sustainable and healthy transport as a vital element of resilience in cities. The review found, however, that the integration of environment and energy into land use and transport models is still at a nascent stage of development and has largely been overlooked in traditional LUTI models. This can lead to unreliable assessments of the impacts of low-carbon mobility solutions, emerging green transport technologies, and long-term changes in energy consumption affecting sustainable mobility futures. This paper concludes by connecting LUTEI dimensions to the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDG), outlining future directions to ignite meaningful research on the topic and providing a transparent path for decision-makers to adopt LUTEI-informed planning. © 2023 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Maintaining ecological integrity and sustaining ecosystem function in urban areas,"Urbanizing regions increasing challenge the ecosystem's capacity to deliver important ecological services to the human population and support human well-being. Scholars of urban ecology have hypothesized that the patterns of urbanization control ecosystem dynamics through complex interactions and feedback mechanisms linking urban activities and their spatial organization to land cover and environmental change. However, empirical studies of the underlying processes and mechanisms linking urbanization patterns and ecosystem dynamics are still extremely limited. In this paper, I present a framework linking urban patterns to ecosystem functions and discuss a set of hypotheses based on the empirical evidence established in the literature.",About Sufficiency
Exploring subjective well-being and ecosystem services perception along a rural-urban gradient in the high Andes of Ecuador,"Understanding sociocultural perceptions about human-nature relationships is essential to promote collective responses for sustainable ecosystem management. This study explores the sociocultural factors that influence subjective well-being (measured by life satisfaction) and how ecosystem services are perceived in an area inhabited by the Kichwa people, for whom the ancient notion of Good Living (Sumak Kawsay) is active. We carried out 482 surveys in five villages along a rural-urban gradient in the province of Imbabura (Ecuador). Rural and urban people differed in their subjective valuations of well-being components and the sociocultural factors that most influence life satisfaction. We also detected changes along the rural-urban gradient regarding how these sociocultural and subjective well-being factors explain the degree of importance that local people attribute to different ecosystems services provided by high Andean ecosystems. Formal education, the perception of local ecological knowledge, and the use of the Kichwa language were identified as important sociocultural factors that explain the observed differences. Finally, we discuss the risks of the ongoing expansion of urban lifestyles for the conservation of Andean social-ecological systems, highlighting the importance of maintaining traditional practices and beliefs associated with the Kichwa culture.",About Sufficiency
Design and impact assessment of watershed investments: An approach based on ecosystem services and boundary work,"Watershed investments, whose main aim is to secure water for cities, represent a promising opportunity for large-scale sustainability transitions in the near future. If properly designed, they promote activities in the watershed that enhance ecosystem services while protecting nature and biodiversity, as well as achieving other societal goals. In this paper, we build on the concepts of ecosystem services and boundary work, to develop and test an operative approach for designing and assessing the impact of watershed investments. The approach is structured to facilitate negotiations among stakeholders. Its strategic component includes setting the agenda; defining investment scenarios; and assessing the performance of watershed investments as well as planning for a follow-up. Its technical component concerns data processing; tailoring spatially explicit ecosystem service models; hence their application to design a set of “investment portfolios”, generate future land use scenarios, and model impacts on selected ecosystem services. A case study illustrates how the technical component can be developed in a data scarce context in sub-Saharan Africa in a way that is functional to support the steps of the strategic component. The case study addresses soil erosion and water scarcity-related challenges affecting Asmara, a medium-sized city in Eritrea, and considers urban water security and rural poverty alleviation as two illustrative objectives, within a ten-year planning horizon. The case study results consist in spatially explicit data (investment portfolio, land use scenario, impact on ecosystem services), which were aggregated to quantitatively assess the performance of different watershed investments scenarios, in terms of changes in soil erosion control. By addressing stakeholders' concerns of credibility, saliency, and legitimacy, the approach is expected to facilitate negotiation of objectives, definition of scenarios, and assessment of alternative watershed investments, ultimately, to contribute to implementing an adaptive watershed management. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",About Sufficiency

Trends and knowledge gaps on ecological restoration research in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest,"Given the current global environmental crisis, restoring degraded ecosystems stands out among the nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change, reestablish ecosystem services, and maintain biodiversity and human well-being. The high biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest (AF) and its severe degradation turned it into a ""restoration hotspot."" We performed a bibliometric analysis of the research on restoration of the Brazilian AF to identify thematic trends, potential gaps, as well as networks and benefits of collaboration. We also explored the spatial distribution of degradation, restoration science, and practice within the AF. We analyzed 932 articles on the issue from the Web of Science platform (1990-2020). Publications abruptly increased in the last 15 years, first by Brazilian groups and later in collaboration with foreign groups. International collaboration increased the probability of highly cited articles. Topics addressed have changed greatly in their relative position over time, likely due to scientific advances refuting theories or invalidating failed techniques. Natural regeneration was the main trending topic, while forest succession was the main emerging topic, and ecosystem services appeared as a trending topic. Research and restoration initiatives were both unevenly distributed throughout the AF region, with the southeastern region of Brazil standing out (60% of publications). The percentage of the original AF undergoing restoration is very low in all regions, regardless of scientific publications or AF extent remaining. The knowledge gaps pointed-climate change and functional traits-should drive priorities for research funding, aiming to provide robust evidence to support decision-making processes as well as restoration practices.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental impact assessment of agrophotovoltaic power plants based on cross-regional empirical evidence,"With the rapid progress of energy transition aimed at achieving carbon neutrality goals, a significant number of centralized ground photovoltaic (PV) power plants have been widely established across China. However, the impacts of PV panels on climate, soil, and vegetation have not been systematically studied, especially in nature-based agrophotovoltaic power plants. Taking three of the typical agrophotovoltaic power plants in Zhejiang Province, China as examples, combining perennial consecutive daily onsite meteorological monitoring and filed plot sampling data, this study conducts an in-depth assessment of the environmental effects. Our results show that: (1) the wind speed under panels (UP) was significantly lower than that between panels (BP), with reductions ranging from 40.32 to 41.43%; the net total radiation and photosynthetically active radiation of UP decreased by 67.17% and 74.83% compared to BP, respectively; (2) there were no significant variations in soil nutrient contents between UP and BP; and (3) the normalized difference vegetation index and fresh weight of vegetation of UP were lower than those of BP. However, there was no significant difference in aboveground biomass (dry weight). Our results suggest that agrophotovoltaic power plants can sustainably generate electricity while preserving land productivity through precision fertilizer management and appropriate crop selection in East China. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Inclusion of peanut in wheat-maize rotation increases wheat yield and net return and improves soil organic carbon pool by optimizing bacterial community,"Improving soil quality while achieving higher productivity is the major challenge in the agricultural industry. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) (W-M) rotation is the dominant planting pattern in the Huang-HuaiHai Plain and is important for food security in China. However, the soil quality is deteriorating due to the W-M rotation's long-term, intensive, and continuous cultivation. Introducing legumes into the W-M rotation system may be an effective way to improve soil quality. In this study, we aimed to verify this hypothesis by exploring efficient planting systems (wheat-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) (W-P) rotation and wheat rotated with maize and peanut intercropping (W-M/P)) to achieve higher agricultural production in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain. Using traditional W- M rotation as the control, we evaluated crop productivity, net returns, soil microorganisms (SMs), and soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions for three consecutive years. The results indicated that wheat yields were significantly increased under W-P and W-M/P (382.5-579.0 and 179.8-513.1 kg ha-1, respectively) compared with W-M. W-P and W-M/P provided significantly higher net returns (58.2 and 70.4%, respectively) than W-M. W-M/P and W-M retained the SOC stock more efficiently than W-P, increasing by 25.46-31.03 and 14.47-27.64%, respectively, in the 0-20 cm soil layer. Compared with W-M, W-M/P improved labile carbon fractions; the sensitivity index of potentially mineralizable carbon, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and dissolved organic carbon was 31.5, 96.5-157.2, and 17.8% in 20-40, 10-40, and 10-20 cm soil layers, respectively. The bacterial community composition and bacteria function were altered as per the soil depth and planting pattern. W-M/P and W-M exhibited similar bacterial community composition and function in 0-20 and 20-40 cm soil layers. Compared with W-P, a higher abundance of functional genes, namely, contains mobile elements and stress-tolerant, and a lower abundance of genes, namely, potentially pathogenic, were observed in the 10-20 cm soil layer of W-M and the 0-20 cm soil layer of W-M/P. SOC and MBC were the main factors affecting soil bacterial communities, positively correlated with Sphingomonadales and Gemmatimonadales and negatively correlated with Blastocatellales. Organic input was the main factor affecting SOC and SMs, which exhibited feedback effects on crop productivity. In summary, W-M/P improved productivity, net returns, and SOC pool compared with traditional W-M rotation systems, and it is recommended that plant-soil- microbial interactions be considered while designing high-yield cropping systems.",Not About Sufficiency
How do Protected Areas Contribute to Human Well-Being? Multiple Mechanisms Perceived by Stakeholders in Chile,"Biodiversity conservation in designated protected areas reshapes the ways in which people interact with their ecosystems and each other, providing changes in their opportunities to satisfy different aspects of their well-being.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in four Chilean protected areas to identify the multiple mechanisms through which protected areas contribute to human well-being. The stakeholders cited diverse NCPs from protected areas, including material, nonmaterial, and regulating ecosystem services. The stakeholders’ narratives suggested that protected areas satisfy several dimensions of human well-being, which varied both in frequency of citation across the protected areas and according to the stakeholders’ areas of interest. Protected areas were described as contributing to several dimensions of human well-being beyond economic benefits. The narratives indicated a set of multiple mechanisms linking ecosystem services provided by protected areas and satisfaction of dimensions of human well-being at the local level. We emphasize the need to design adaptive management plans for protected areas based on multiple mechanisms linking biodiversity protection and human well-being.

Soil Conservation Benefits of Ecological Programs Promote Sustainable Restoration,"Ecological restoration efforts in less developed regions confront a sustainability challenge due to the undervaluation of their substantive benefits. Soil conservation, as a crucial ecosystem service supporting both ecological and socioeconomic systems in less developed regions, is often overlooked in estimating the benefits of restoration efforts. We introduce a framework that integrates the multi-model approach and scenario analysis on cloud computing platforms to capture the significance of soil conservation benefits by assessing the world's largest restoration programs from China. Our analysis reveals that these restoration programs, with a total investment of $133 billion, have prevented 7.29 +/- 1.01 Pg of soil erosion, valued at $243.0 +/- 25.9 billion from 2000 to 2019. Notably, two critical programs that synergize forest conservation, cropland conversion, and human well-being in China's less developed regions account for approximately 85% of the soil conservation benefits. Our findings underscore that soil conservation benefits significantly enhance the substantive benefits and prioritization of restoration efforts in less developed regions, reinforcing the potential for global restoration efforts to contribute to a sustainable future.",Not About Sufficiency
The Promotion and Development of One Health at Swiss TPH and Its Greater Potential,"One Health, an integrated health concept, is now an integral part of health research and development. One Health overlaps with other integrated approaches to health such as EcoHealth or Planetary Health, which not only consider the patient or population groups but include them in the social-ecological context. One Health has gained the widest foothold politically, institutionally, and in operational implementation. Increasingly, One Health is becoming part of reporting under the International Health Legislation (IHR 2005). The Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) has played a part in these developments with one of the first mentions of One Health in the biomedical literature. Here, we summarise the history of ideas and processes that led to the development of One Health research and development at the Swiss TPH, clarify its theoretical and methodological foundations, and explore its larger societal potential as an integrated approach to thinking. The history of ideas and processes leading to the development of One Health research at the Swiss TPH were inspired by far-sighted and open ideas of the directors and heads of departments, without exerting too much influence. They followed the progressing work and supported it with further ideas. These in turn were taken up and further developed by a growing number of individual scientists. These ideas were related to other strands of knowledge from economics, molecular biology, anthropology, sociology, theology, and linguistics. We endeavour to relate Western biomedical forms of knowledge generation with other forms, such as Mayan medicine. One Health, in its present form, has been influenced by African mobile pastoralists’ integrated thinking that have been taken up into Western epistemologies. The intercultural nature of global and regional One Health approaches will inevitably undergo further scrutiny of successful ways fostering inter-epistemic interaction. Now theoretically well grounded, the One Health approach of seeking benefits for all through better and more equitable cooperation can clearly be applied to engagement in solving major societal problems such as social inequality, animal protection and welfare, environmental protection, climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and conflict transformation. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Deliberating Our Frames: How Members of Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives Use Shared Frames to Tackle Within-Frame Conflicts Over Sustainability Issues,"Multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) have been praised as vehicles for tackling complex sustainability issues, but their success relies on the reconciliation of stakeholders’ divergent perspectives. We yet lack a thorough understanding of the micro-level mechanisms by which stakeholders can deal with these differences. To develop such understanding, we examine what frames—i.e., mental schemata for making sense of the world—members of MSIs use during their discussions on sustainability questions and how these frames are deliberated through social interactions. Whilst prior framing research has focussed on between-frame conflicts, we offer a different perspective by examining how and under what conditions actors use shared frames to tackle ‘within-frame conflicts’ on views that stand in the way of joint decisions. Observations of a deliberative environmental valuation workshop and interviews in an MSI on the protection of peatlands—ecosystems that contribute to carbon retention on a global scale—demonstrated how the application and deliberation of shared frames during micro-level interactions resulted in increased salience, elaboration, and adjustment of shared frames. We interpret our findings to identify characteristics of deliberation mechanisms in the case of within-frame conflicts where shared frames dominate the discussions, and to delineate conditions for such dominance. Our findings contribute to an understanding of collaborations in MSIs and other organisational settings by demonstrating the utility of shared frames for dealing with conflicting views and suggesting how shared frames can be activated, fostered and strengthened. © 2021, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Optimization of county-level territorial spatial patterns in major agricultural production areas under multi-objective synergy,"This study aims to optimize the land use spatial pattern in the major agricultural production areas at the county level, in order implement the national functional zoning and food security. An optimization framework was constructed for the land use spatial pattern of major agricultural production areas, according to the four aspects of ""scale-structure-layout-strategy."" Taking Qixian County in Shanxi Province as an example, the optimization targets were defined as the food security, ecological security, economic development, carbon reduction, and social security. The grey multi-objective model was coupled with the GeoSOS-FLUS model. The county was further divided into the functional zones. The development strategies were proposed for each zone. The results were as follows: 1) The area of arable land was remained at 38 320.60 hm2 by 2035 after structural optimization; The area of forest land increased to 17 172.40 hm2, in order to enhance the carbon sequestration; Grassland decreased to 21 485.80 hm2 for the optimal land use; The water area increased to 159.50 hm2 for the ecological services; The construction land was expanded to 8 214.70 hm2. The total economic output was predicted to increase by 1 097 6.76 million yuan, compared with 2021. Net carbon emissions were reduced by approximately 86 250 t, compared with 2021. Carbon intensity was predicted to decrease by 53.34%, compared with 2021, and by 88.57% compared with 2005. These predictions were achieved in the multiple objectives from the agricultural production, ecological protection, and economic development. 2) The GeoSOS-FLUS model was used to simulate the layout of land use. The Kappa index reached 0.87, with an overall accuracy of 0.91, indicating the high precision and reliable optimization. Furthermore, the more concentrated and efficient forest land was significantly improved the carbon sequestration; The quality of arable land was enhanced to further ensure the national food security. More concentrated construction land was also promoted the economic circulation. The optimized layout provided a solid spatial foundation for the sustainable development in major agricultural production areas. 3) According the development potential of different townships, the county was divided into three zones: agricultural production, economic development, and carbon sequestration. Among them, the carbon sequestration zone aimed to enhance the carbon sequestration and protect ecosystems. The ecological corridors and projects were dominated, such as returning farmland to forest, grassland protection, and wetland restoration, particularly for the low-carbon tourism and ecological agriculture. The economic development zone aimed to promote the industry clusters and infrastructure. The industrial restructure and carbon reduction were then driven to enhance the connectivity with the Taiyuan metropolitan area. The agricultural production zone prioritized the protection and quality of basic farmland and the arable land. Characteristic agriculture was developed to promote the branding of Qixian pear. Green and low-carbon agriculture was implemented to construct the modern agricultural industrial parks and rural infrastructure. The land use spatial pattern was also optimized in the major agricultural production areas at the county level. The county functional zoning and multidimensional development were integrated to coordinate the multiple objectives, such as food security, economic development, carbon reduction, ecological security, and social security. The differentiated strategies were proposed to formulate the land use and territorial spatial planning. The spatial optimization of land use can offer the valuable insights to the functional counties for the agricultural modernization and the carbon neutrality. © 2025 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Promoting circular economy: Comparison of novel coupled aquaponics with anaerobic digestion and conventional aquaponic systems on nutrient dynamics and sustainability,"Aquaponics presents promising green technology for food security and climate change. This study investigated the performance and nutrient dynamics in a novel aquaponics with onsite anaerobic treatment compared with conventional decoupled and coupled aquaponics. All systems demonstrated good performance with fish survival rates of >97 %, feed conversion ratios of 1.3, and high lettuce production of 6.9–11.8 kg/kg-feed. The recovery of N and P (from their concentrations in the feed) was 21 % and 16 % respectively in the decoupled aquaponics, and 24 % and 18 % in the coupled aquaponics. Recovery of N and P in the novel aquaponics was 41 % and 36 %, respectively, which led to enhanced total nutrient utilization efficiency of 76 % N and 80 % P. The latter was due to the high recovery of N and P from the fish sludge. The novel system also demonstrated 1.6× higher plant areal productivity, 2.1× lower water usage, and 16 % less energy consumption per kg of feed relative to the other tested (conventional) systems. It was postulated that coupled aquaponics with anaerobic digestion is a sustainable solution that may promote a circular economy, especially in arid zones with high radiation and temperature. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Grassland Ecosystem Progress: A Review and Bibliometric Analysis Based on Research Publication over the Last Three Decades,"Understanding the grassland ecosystem is crucial for improving grassland ecosystem functions and services such as climate regulation, water and soil conservation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity and gene pool maintenance. However, a systematic and comprehensive review of the relevant literature is still unclear and lacking. The VOSviewer software and cluster analysis were used to visually analyze and perform dimension reduction classification on the 27,778 studies related to grassland ecosystem research based on the Web of Science database. The number of publications targeting grassland ecosystem increased rapidly from 2006 to 2021. Ecology, agronomy, and environmental science were the most popular research categories, and the top journal sources were Remote Sensing, Journal of Ecology, and Ecology and Evolution. The leading publishing countries were the United States, China, and Germany. The top three institutions were the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Colorado State University. Cooperation between different countries and institutions had increased. Keyword co-occurrence network analysis showed that Biodiversity, Vegetation and Conservation were the most popular study areas, grassland management, climate change, land use pattern, and ecosystem impact were the hot research topics. All studies could be divided into three categories by cluster analysis: grassland ecological characteristics including basic physicochemical properties, vegetation community characteristics, aboveground and belowground biomass, and soil structural quality of grassland; driving mechanisms that demonstrated effects of human activities and climate change on grassland ecosystem function; and grassland ecosystem services that focused the influences of different grassland management strategies on ecological services, animal welfare and human well-being. The three topic categories of reviewed studies were interrelated and consistent with each other, and the performances were progressive.

Factors influencing and changes in the organic carbon pattern on slope surfaces induced by soil erosion,"The “Grain for Green” project disrupts the original sediment distribution pattern on eroded slopes, leading to changes in the lateral transport and vertical deposition of organic carbon. The organic carbon fraction can further enhance our understanding of the dynamics of soil carbon pools during deposition, which can help enhance understanding of the role of soil erosion in the global carbon cycle. On the Loess Plateau, we chose retreating slope (grasslands) and original slope (cultivated land) for our study. Through field sampling combined with an indoor test analysis, we hope to explain dynamic changes in the soil carbon pool on the retired slope, in response to deposition resulting from eroded material. It was found that as the cultivated land was retired to grassland, the sediment transport deposition pattern on the slope altered from whole-slope erosion to alternating erosion-deposition changes. Vegetation restoration changed the composition of the soil carbon fraction: the ratio of grassland particulate organic carbon (POC) to total organic carbon increased from 48.62% to 61.36%, and the sensitivity index of the carbon fraction changed from light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) following the transformation of cropland to grassland. Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) was further conducted to quantify the effects of erosive sediment texture, carbon fraction, and stoichiometry on soil organic carbon (SOC). Erosive sediment texture was a key variable influencing SOC in cultivated soils (path coefficient:0.852), whereas the carbon fraction on the grassland slope had the greatest influence on the organic carbon (path coefficient:0.830). The soil erosion modulus negatively affected erosive sediment texture on both cultivated and grassland slopes. Studies have shown that on severely eroded slopes, attention should be paid to the transport of sediment and organic carbon allochthonous caused by erosion.When erosion intensity decreases, it may be more effective to reduce organic carbon mineralization and increase carbon sequestration by enhancing the physical protection of carbon components and reducing the accessibility of soil microorganisms, giving full play to the role of soil and water conservation in achieving the global sustainable development goal of carbon neutrality. This study provides a scientific support for further supplementing the turnover mechanism of the carbon fraction in the soil carbon cycle (in the context of soil erosion). © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying Ecological Priority Areas for Synergistic Conservation across Scales in the Asian Water Tower Region,"The region containing 17 Asian countries located on and around the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Asian Water Tower) is experiencing a serious ecological crisis, representing a major challenge for both Asian and global ecological conservation. Identifying and synergizing multiscale ecological conservation priorities for this region can promote progress toward the goals proposed by the post-2020 global biodiversity framework (e.g., protecting 30% of the planet) and Sustainable Development Goal 15 (life on land). We mapped the importance of and interactions among 5 key ecosystem services (ESs) (water conservation, carbon sequestration, sand fixation, soil conservation, and biodiversity conservation) across this region and identified areas where synergistic ESs were present. We further identified synergistic national-and regional-scaled conservation priority areas. The areas with ""high importance"" of the composite ESs accounted for 18.9% of the total region. Seventy-two percent of this area was found to have an overlap of at least 2 ESs. Approximately 33.3% of the study region was identified as a regional-scaled conservation priority area, which can be implemented synergistically in each country. Approximately 22.5% of the land in the priority area was nonecological land, which can seriously compromise the importance of ESs. A set of actions to support achieving global conservation goals, such as strengthening the control of anthropogenic activities in priority conservation areas, providing additional efforts and assistance to some key countries, and developing effective ecological compensation schemes, was provided.",Not About Sufficiency
Substitution of chemical fertilizer by Chinese milk vetch improves the sustainability of yield and accumulation of soil organic carbon in a double-rice cropping system,"The double-rice cropping system is a very important intensive cropping system for food security in China. There have been few studies of the sustainability of yield and accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the double-rice cropping system following a partial substitution of chemical fertilizer by Chinese milk vetch (Mv). We conducted a 10-year (2008-2017) field experiment in Nan County, South-Central China, to examine the double-rice productivity and SOC accumulation in a paddy soil in response to different fertilization levels and Mv application (22.5 Mg ha(-1)). Fertilizer and Mv were applied both individually and in combination (sole chemical fertilizers, Mv plus 100, 80, 60, 40, and 0% of the recommended dose of chemical fertilizers, labeled as F100, MF100, MF80, MF60, MF40, and MFO, respectively). It was found that the grain yields of double-rice crop in treatments receiving Mv were reduced when the dose of chemical fertilizer was reduced, while the change in SOC stock displayed a double peak curve. The MF100 produced the highest double-rice yield and SOC stock, with the value higher by 13.5 and 26.8% than that in the F100. However, the grain yields increased in the MF80 (by 8.4% compared to the F100), while the SOC stock only increased by 8.4%. Analogous to the change of grain yield, the sustainable yield index (SYI) of double rice were improved significantly in the MF100 and MF80 compared to the F100, while there was a slight increase in the MF60 and MF40. After a certain amount of Mv input (22.5 Mg ha(-1)), the carbon sequestration rate was affected by the nutrient input due to the stimulation of microbial biomass. Compared with the MFO, the MF100 and MF40 resulted in a dramatically higher carbon sequestration rate (with the value higher by 71.6 and 70. whereas the MF80 induced a lower carbon sequestration rate with the value lower by 70.1% compared to the MFO. Based on the above results we suggested that Mv could partially replace chemical fertilizers (e.g., 40-60%) to improve or maintain the productivity and sustainability of the double-rice cropping system in South-Central China.",Not About Sufficiency
Human Disturbance of Biodiversity Conservation Areas in the Nujiang River Basin in Yunnan Province,"This study selected six socio-economic indicators to calculate the Human Disturbance Index (HDI) in 2005, 2010 and 2015 for towns, and then existed Nature Reserve and Priority Conservation Area (PCA) in the Nujiang River Basin in Yunnan (NRBY). We classified HDI in five levels: slight, light, moderate, severe, and extreme. Results showed since 2005, NRBY towns’ HDI overall increased; the numbers of slight and light HDI towns decreased, but moderate, severe and extreme HDI towns increased. The HDI of National, Provincial and County NRs overall increased since 2005 and separately reached light, light and moderate levels in 2015. Around or even within some NRs (Yongde Snow Mountain, Longling Xiaoheishan, Lincang Lancang River, Nanpeng River), there were some moderate or even extreme HDI towns, where human disturbances should be controlled to avoid further increase of these NRs’ HDI. The HDI of three types of PCAs in NRBY showed slow increasing and remained slight or light HDI level in 2015. According to the spatial patterns of existed NRs, PCAs, township HDI status in NRBY, we proposed three kinds of modes to optimize existed NRBY NRs’ system: establishing new NR in Biluo Snow Mountain in upstream part of NRBY, expanding existed NRs or establishing ecological corridors among the different patches of existed NRs in the downstream part of NRBY, carrying on ex-situ conservation or establish small nature reserves within the moderate or extreme HDI towns in the midstream part of NRBY. © Tropical Geography 2018.",Not About Sufficiency
Research progress on low-carbon and high-yield cultivation technology for double-cropping rice in South China,"The key technologies for low-carbon and high-yield of double-cropping rice in South China (DCRSC) and their integrated application were introduced from the aspects of low-carbon variety selection, water-saving and emission reduction irrigation, and fertilizer reduction and efficiency enhancement, etc. The main progress, problem and future focus on the development and extension of low-carbon and high-yield technology for DCRSC were summarized. The low-carbon and high-yield cultivation technology for DCRSC could synergize water-saving and fertilizer-saving, emission reduction and pollution control, high yield and income, realized the coordination of low-carbon and high-yield, therefore it would have a good application prospect. There are main problems for this technology including limited available varieties, undiversified planting modes, and difficult promotion at present. While increasing policy support, further efforts are needed to enhance the improvement and extension of the new technology, including variety screening, cropping pattern optimization and basic research, so as to ensure national food security and achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals. © 2023 Editorial Department, Journal of South Agricultural University.

Reducing land fragmentation to curb cropland abandonment: Evidence from rural China,"Reducing land fragmentation can theoretically curb cropland abandonment, thus ensuring food security. However, few studies have quantified this relationship using large-scale survey data at the household level. This study adopts a two-way fixed-effects (TWFE) model to examine the effect of land fragmentation on cropland abandonment using nationally representative panel data from the China Rural Household Panel Survey (CRHPS). The panel data set contains 15,138 households across 29 provinces in 2017 and 2019. We find that land fragmentation has a significant and positive relationship with cropland abandonment. The mechanism analysis reveals that this relationship is due to high labor costs and difficulties in renting out the fragmented land. The heterogeneity analysis indicates that farmers with poor human capital and those living in non-plain areas are at a higher risk of abandoning their cropland due to land fragmentation. Furthermore, the association between land fragmentation and cropland abandonment tends to vary across different land rent-in scenarios. For instance, an increase in the number of plots in the case of land rent-in is not necessarily associated with cropland abandonment. These findings are conducive to correcting the underestimation of the role of land fragmentation in cropland abandonment, and their implications may be extended to various countries.",Not About Sufficiency
Hierarchical bimetallic nanoparticles embedded nitrogen-doped carbon derived from ZIF-67 composites for efficient electrochemical nitrite sensing,"Nitrite is commonly found in various aspects of daily life, but its excessive intake poses health risks like blood oxygen transport impairment and cancer risks. Accurate detection of nitrite is crucial for preventing its potential harm and ensuring public health. In this work, Cu–Co bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) incorporated nitrogen-doped carbon dodecahedron (Cu/Co@N–C/CNTs-X, where X denotes the carbonization temperatures) are synthesized by facile carbonization of CuO@ZIF-67 composites. Cu and Co NPs are uniformly embedded in the carbon dodecahedron decorated by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) without agglomeration. Combining the superior catalytic from Cu and Co NPs with the electrical conductivity and stability from the carbon frameworks, the Cu/Co@N–C/CNTs-600 composite as catalyst detected nitrite concentrations ranging from 1 to 5000 μM, with sensitivity values of 0.708 μA μM–1 cm–2, and a detection limit of 0.5 μM. Moreover, this sensor demonstrated notable selectivity, stability and reproducibility. The design of Cu/Co@N–C/CNTs-X catalysts prepared in this study can be used as an attractive alternative in the fields of food quality and environmental detection. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Carbon Society 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Enlarging or narrowing? Exploring the impact of energy poverty on carbon inequality in China,"This paper investigates the impact of energy poverty eradication on carbon inequality mitigation in China. First, we find that energy poverty positively correlates with carbon inequality, indicating that alleviating energy poverty narrows the inequality of carbon emissions. Second, alleviating energy poverty is especially crucial in regions facing a more deteriorated situation characterized by energy poverty and carbon inequality. Third, environmental protection expenditures are a mediator and can also directly tackle carbon inequality. Fourth, energy poverty inhibits technological innovation and leads to more traditional energy consumption, undermining the energy transition. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Sustainable management strategies for balancing crop yield, water use efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions","CONTEXT: To ensure food security in the face of climate change, it is crucial to use effective agricultural management practices that produce the triangular win-win for water, crops, and environments. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the sustainable management measures for balancing crop yield, water use efficiency (WUE) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in China during 1981-2020. METHODS: The study selected the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of China as the research area, where there were sharp contradictions among water shortage, food security and polluted environment. Four irrigation treatments and four fertilization treatments were set referring to the local cultivated experiences. The daily dynamic changes in crop yield, WUE and GHG emissions were simulated by optimized Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The irrigations had positive impacts on crop yield and WUE in BTH region. The irrigation amount's rise caused a gradual augmentation in the total yield of winter wheat and summer maize from 1981 to 2020.The highest total yield was achieved under W4 irrigation treatment (320 mm water for winter wheat and 60 mm water for summer maize), with an annual mean of 24,579.2 kg center dot ha(-1). The annual average WUE under the W3 irrigation treatment (240 mm water for winter wheat) was the highest, with an average of 13.9 kg center dot ha(-1)center dot mm(-1). However, extensive fertilization exacerbated soil GHG emissions. The soil GHG emissions were found to be significant increase as the input amount of fertilization. The FI fertilization measure (no fertilization) was assessed to have the least impact on the environment, with an average GHG emissions of 0.4 Mg center dot CO2-eq center dot ha(-1). The optimal goals of high yield, high WUE and low GHG emissions were achieved by choosing effective combination practices of water and nitrogen management. Overall, the W3 irrigation and F3 fertilization (180 kg/ha fertilizer for winter wheat and 120 kg/ha fertilizer for summer maize.) treatments had the maximum water-fertilizer production indexes in the BTH region. SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights the importance of agricultural management measures for guaranteeing food security and environmental sustainability at the same time under climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
Driving Factors and Scale Effects of Residents’ Willingness to Pay for Environmental Protection under the Impact of COVID-19,"In recent years, environmental degradation and the COVID-19 pandemic have seriously affected economic development and social stability. Addressing the impact of major public health events on residents’ willingness to pay for environmental protection (WTPEP) and analyzing the drivers are necessary for improving human well-being and environmental sustainability. We designed a questionnaire to analyze the change in residents’ WTPEP before and during COVID-19 and an established ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM), spatial error model (SEM), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and multiscale GWR to explore driver factors and scale effects of WTPEP based on the theory of environment Kuznets curve (EKC). The results show that (1) WTPEP is 0–20,000 yuan before COVID-19 and 0–50,000 yuan during COVID-19. Residents’ WTPEP improved during COVID-19, which indicates that residents’ demand for an ecological environment is increasing; (2) The shapes and inflection points of the relationships between income and WTPEP are spatially heterogeneous before and during COVID-19, but the northern WTPEP is larger than southern, which indicates that there is a spatial imbalance in WTPEP; (3) Environmental degradation, health, environmental quality, and education are WTPEP’s significant macro-drivers, whereas income, age, and gender are significant micro-drivers. Those factors can help policymakers better understand which factors are more suitable for macro or micro environmental policy-making and what targeted measures could be taken to solve the contradiction between the growing ecological environment demand of residents and the spatial imbalance of WTPEP in the future. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Research status, development trends, and the prospects of cultivated land risk","Cultivated land risk poses a critical threat to food security, and managing it is crucial for sustainable land use. To effectively manage this risk, it is essential to identify different types of cultivated land risk, understand their development trends, and research hotspots. This review constructs a comprehensive search strategy for subject terms in CiteSpace to analyze 12,581 literature sources related to cultivated land risk. Through tracking hot spots in cultivated land risk research, we have identified two main phases over the past 20 years. The first phase (2002–2015) focused on exploring various types of cultivated land risk, including soil, nitrogen, sewage sludge, organic matter, and carbon sequestration. Three keywords:soil, nitrogen, and sewage sludge were studied extensively during this period, with research on agricultural intensification, transport conservation, all aimed at enhancing the theoretical framework concerning cultivated land risk. The second phase (2015–2022) emphasized in-depth research into the mechanisms behind the generation of cultivated land risk. Key topics included methods and models for cultivated land risk research, source analysis, and source apportionment, as well as potentially toxic element and random forest analyses. This phase saw a shift towards a more comprehensive understanding of cultivated land risk, with a focus on uncovering underlying causes and developing effective mitigation strategies. Our research has identified three pivotal steps aimed at reducing cultivated land risk: 1) Rigorous Land Use Management: Implement stringent land use regulations to safeguard high-quality land resources. 2) Sustainable Agricultural Practices: Curtail the utilization of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, fostering improved soil fertility and minimizing environmental repercussions. 3) Robust Environmental Oversight: Establish a robust monitoring network to consistently track environmental concerns, concurrently encouraging the adoption of eco-friendly farming techniques. This comprehensive review holds substantial theoretical significance in advancing the agenda of sustainable cultivated land management and effectively alleviating the perils linked with land use alterations.

Technological and environmental advantages of a new engine combustion mode: Dual Biofuel Intelligent Charge Compression Ignition,"With the rapid development of the world economy, the demand for energy will inevitably increase the resource shortage and environmental pollution problems. Therefore, the coordinated development of energy and environment is an important way to achieve the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, the dual biofuel intelligent charge compression ignition (ICCI) mode fuelled with butanol and biodiesel was demonstrated to achieve a high-efficiency and ultra-low emissions, which will have global real-world energy influence. The maximum thermal efficiency of the butanol/biodiesel ICCI mode is 3.5% higher than the absolute efficiency of the conventional mode, and the nitrogen oxide emissions decreased by 76.69% to 99.47%. The butanol/biodiesel ICCI mode has the potential to achieve carbon neutrality in the road transport sector and mitigate the greenhouse effect. Hence, direct air pollutants would be eliminated. Meanwhile, with the increasing production of biofuels worldwide, this work not only improves the environmental pollution and relieves the energy crisis, but also provides a method to deal with the mutual restraint between energy, environmental and technology.",Not About Sufficiency
Relating energy innovations and natural resources as determinants of environmental sustainability: The role of globalization in G7 countries,"The G7 nations have yet to have a detectable influence on the accomplishment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 8, 7, and 13. This scenario might be attributed to the fundamental problem with fossil fuel utilization in these nations as well as the difficulties in putting renewable energy generalization into practice. The G7 nations are battling to lessen their ecological footprint in the aftermath of these two possibilities. This study covers between 1990 and 2018 and adopts cross-sectional augmented autoregressive distributed lags (CS-ARDL) as the main model, whereas augmented mean group (AMG) and correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) techniques are used for robustness check. This study focuses on a policy readjustment that may be necessary to address this problem. More particularly, it examines how energy innovation, globalization, and nonrenewable energy affect ecological footprint. The empirical outcomes reveal that energy innovation and globalization negatively affect ecological footprint, whereas NREC and GDP positively influence EF. Based on the empirical findings of the paper, an SDGs-focused policy agenda is proposed. SDGs 7, 8, and 13 are addressed by this policy framework, but they can be also applied to other countries. This study contributes to the attention to the G7 nations’ environmental policy concerns and a concomitant suggestion of this SDGs-focused policy framework. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the effects of ecological engineering on carbon storage by linking the CA-Markov and InVEST models,"Ecological engineering has become an essential tool in efforts to address environmental crises, improve human well-being, and achieve sustainability. However, efficient assessment of changes resulting from ecological engineering remains a challenge. In this study, we evaluated the effects of ecological engineering on carbon storage in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin in semi-arid northwestern China by linking the CA-Markov and InVEST models. Firstly, the CA-Markov model was used to simulate land use/cover change (LUCC) following the implementation of ecological engineering programs. Then, the InVEST model was adopted to assess changes in carbon storage due to LUCC. The results showed that ecological engineering could increase carbon storage by 10.27 Tg from 2015 to 2029 by increasing the proportion of land cover types with higher carbon storage capacity. The relative error of the linked model was 0.22%, indicating that the linked model was highly applicable in assessments of the effects of ecological engineering on carbon storage in the study area.

Crop yields under no-till farming in China: A meta-analysis,"No-till (NT) farming is popular globally, however, the effects on crop yields remain debatable. A meta analysis was conducted on crop yield responses to NT in China based on 1006 comparisons from 164 studies. Results showed that a decrease of 2.1 +/- 1.8% on crop yield was observed under NT with residue removed (NTO) compared with that under plow tillage with residue removed (PTO), but the decreases can be diminished to 1.9 +/- 1.0% when residue retention was combined with both the two tillage practices. On the contrary, NT with residue retention (NTR) may significantly increase crop yields by 4.6 +/- 1.3% compared with that under PTO (P < 0.05). Along with improvements in crop yields, increases in soil organic carbon (SOC) by 10.2 7.2%, available nitrogen (N) by 9.4 +/- 5.4%, available potassium by 10.5 +/- 8.8%, and water storage by 9.3 +/- 2.4% was observed under NTR compared with PTO, indicating that improvements in soil quality could benefit crop productivity under NTR. Categorically, results on meta-analysis and regression indicated large variations in crop yields under NTR because of differences in crop species, temperature and precipitation, antecedent SOC level, N fertilizer input, duration of adoption, and with or without residue retention. For example, crop yields significantly increased with increase in duration (P < 0.0001) under NTR, by 21.3% after 10 years of continuous NTR compared with PTO. Adoption of NTR under appropriate site-specific conditions can advance China's food security, improve yield stability and alleviate soil-related constraints. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Progress in Significant Soil Science Fields of China over the Last Three Decades: A Review,"Due to continuous decreases in arable land area and continuous population increases, Chinese soil scientists face great challenges in meeting food demands, mitigating adverse environmental impacts, and sustaining or enhancing soil productivity under intensive agriculture. With the aim of promoting the application of soil science knowledge, this paper reviews the achievements of Chinese scientists in soil resource use and management, soil fertility, global change mitigation and soil biology over the last 30 years. During this period, soil resource science has provided essential support for the use and exploitation of Chinese soil resources, and has itself developed through introduction of new theories such as Soil Taxonomy and new technologies such as remote sensing. Soil fertility science has contributed to the alleviation and elimination of impeding physical and chemical factors that constrain availability of essential nutrients and water in soils, the understanding of nutrient cycling in agroecosystems, and the increase in nutrient use efficiency for sustainable crop production. Chinese soil scientists have contributed to the understanding of the cropland's role in global change, particularly to the understanding of methane and nitrous oxide emission from rice fields and the effect of elevated carbon dioxide and ozone on rice-wheat system. Soil biology research has progressed in biological N fixation, distribution of fauna in Chinese soils, and bioremediation of polluted soils. A new generation of soil scientists has arisen in the last three decades.

Desertification Reduces Organic Carbon Content and Nutrient Availability in Dryland Soils: Evidence From a Survey in the Amu Darya River Basin,"Desertification degrades drylands, undermining ecosystem services and human well-being as a serious global issue. Assessing desertification impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) and properties aids in preserving drylands and combating desertification. However, knowledge gaps persist regarding desertification effects on SOC and soil in Central Asia's Amu Darya River Basin. Surveys across ~1000 km in this region showed that desertification decreased SOC by ~52% versus natural vegetation. Desertification also reduced nutrient availability and altered hydrothermal conditions, pH, stoichiometry, and herbaceous richness. In particular, it decreased soil clay and silt while increasing sand content. Regional climate change and prolonged grazing are primary desertification drivers here. These pronounced impacts on soils and vegetation may threaten ecological processes and services.

"Multi-Scenario Land Use/Cover Change and Its Impact on Carbon Storage Based on the Coupled GMOP-PLUS-InVEST Model in the Hexi Corridor, China","Understanding the relationship between land use and carbon storage is vital for achieving sustainable development goals. However, our understanding of how carbon storage develops under land policy planning is still incomplete. In this study, a comprehensive framework that integrates Gray Multi-objective Optimization Programming (GMOP), the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model, and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) models is introduced to evaluate land use dynamics and ecosystem services. Two scenarios have been established to estimate Land Use and Land Cover Change (LUCC) patterns in the Hexi Corridor by 2035: the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, developed based on historical trends, and the ecological conservation scenario (ECS), optimized with multiple policy objectives. The results show the following: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the predominant land use type in the Hexi Corridor was unutilized land, with LUCC mainly involving the transformation of unutilized land to grass land. (2) Carbon storage in the Hexi Corridor increased by approximately 9.05 x 106 t from 2000 to 2020 due to LUCC, characterized by higher levels in the south and lower levels in the north. (3) The areas of grass land and arable land are expected to continue increasing until 2035, while the extent of unutilized land is projected to decrease. The ECS is poised to create a balance between ecological protection and economic development. (4) By 2035, both the BAU scenario and ECS estimate an increase in the carbon storage of the Hexi Corridor, with the ECS expected to result in the most significant gains.

Just Transition for China’s Coal Regions Towards Carbon Neutrality Targets,"China has pledged to peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. A crucial aspect of this commitment involves transitioning from coal‐dependent activities primarily concentrated in certain regions pivotal to local economies, employment, and livelihoods. High‐quality development necessitates identifying just transition strategies for these coal‐intensive regions, ensuring inclusive benefits from the energy transition. These regions exhibit disparities in economic and industrial growth, with many low‐income mining communities and inadequate public services. This calls for comprehensive policy interventions in economic, energy, societal, and environmental domains. This study aims to delineate just transition strategies for China’s coal regions, considering their unique challenges and circumstances. Initially, this article reviews the evolution of “just transition” as a concept and its policy implications. Subsequently, it explores China’s approach to achieving carbon neutrality through the lens of just transition, delving into the local economy’s reliance on coal‐related industries and the impact on employment. Following a clear delineation of the vision for just transition in China, the analysis focuses on identifying principles and pathways for transition. The goal is to propose nuanced and effective policies to ensure just outcomes in the context of China’s energy transition. © 2024 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Bacillus cereus WL08 immobilized on tobacco stem charcoal eliminates butylated hydroxytoluene in soils and alleviates the continuous cropping obstacle of Pinellia ternata,"Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), as an emerging contaminant in ecosystems, has potential influences on animals, aquatic organisms, and public health, and has been proven to be a major allelochemical of Pinellia ternata. In this study, Bacillus cereus WL08 was used to rapidly degrade BHT in liquid culture. Strain WL08 immobilized on tobacco stem charcoal (TSC) particles notably accelerated BHT removal in contract to its free cells, and exhibited excellent reutilization and storage capacities. The optimal removal parameters of TSC WL08 were ascertained to be pH 7.0, 30 °C, 50 mg L−1 BHT and 0.14 mg L−1 TSC WL08. Moreover, TSC WL08 significantly accelerated the degradation of 50 mg L−1 BHT in sterile and non-sterile soils compared to that of free WL08 or natural dissipation, and notably shortened their half-lives by 2.47- or 362.14- fold, and 2.20- or 14.99- fold, respectively. Simultaneously, TSC WL08 was introduced into the continuous cropping soils of P. ternata, which accelerated the elimination of allelochemical BHT, and notably enhanced the photosynthesis, growth, yield, and quality of P. ternata.

Valuation of ecosystem services in China under different SSP-RCP scenarios,"Quantitative assessment of ecosystem service values is an important basis for human using and managing ecosystems reasonably. The simulation of land use change under future climate scenarios and its impact assessment on the value of ecosystem services is important for regional ecosystem service management, the development of ecological functional zoning and climate change mitigation and adaptation. This study estimates the ecosystem service values (ESVs) in China (except Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, China) from 2020 to 2050 based on land use scenarios simulated by the latest IPCC Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and discusses the trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem service functions in 2050. We get the following main conclusions. The ESV in 2020 - 2050 shows SSP1-RCP2.6 > SSP2-RCP4.5 > SSP3-RCP6.0, and the ESV in 2020 is 12.39×104billion yuan in SSP1-RCP2.6 scenario and 12.34×106billion yuan in 2050; the ESV in SSP2-RCP4.5 scenario is 12.17×104billion yuan in 2020 and 12.11×104billion yuan in 2050; the ESV in 2020 is 12.02×104billion yuan and 11.53×104billion yuan in 2050 under the SSP3-RCP6.0 scenario. The rate of ESV decline is faster in the SSP3-RCP6.0 scenario and more stable and flatter in SSP1-RCP2.6 and SSP2-RCP4.5.The largest proportion is occupied by regulation services (66.98% to 68.46%), with support services in the second place (18.81% to 20.64%), followed by supply services (8.64% to 9.44%), and the smallest proportion is cultural services (3.19% to 3.36%). The synergies between the three scenarios are SSP1-RCP 2.6 > SSP2-RCP4.5 > SSP3-RCP6.0, so the most synergistic scenario SSP1-RCP2.6 is used as an example to explore the tradeoffs and synergies between ecosystem services in the future (2050). The six sets of relationships in the 2050 SSP1-RCP2.6 scenario are predominantly synergistic, with support-culture services having the highest degree of synergy and correspondingly the lowest degree of trade-offs. The highest trade-off is for supply-support services. This study bridges the gap between the current lack of research on the value of ecosystem services at large scales in future scenarios. The following suggestions are put forward: China should actively respond to climate change, carry out ecosystem protection and restoration, enhance ecosystem service capacity, increase carbon sink, and help achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality. At the same time, we should pay attention to food security, control urban sprawl, carry out ecological management and protection in urban fringe, and ensure the ability of supply and regulation services.

"County-level and monthly resolution multi-pollutant emission inventory for residential solid fuel burning in Fenwei Plain, China","The Fenwei Plain (FWP) in central China is the fourth largest plain nationwide. This region has experienced severe air pollution during the past decades, largely due to residential solid fuel burning. A regional-scale emission inventory covering multi-pollutants was currently unavailable for this area due to the lack of localized emission factors (EFs) from various sources. In this study, localized EFs derived from previous in situ measurements and detailed county-level activity data were used to develop an emission inventory of particulate and gaseous pollutants for the source sector of five residential solid fuels in the FWP in 2020. Emissions of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), ions, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were estimated to be 230–290, 89–160, 20–29, 31–54, 0.93–22, 2100–3600, 64–87, 9.3–12, and 45–92 Gg/yr, respectively. The county-level distribution characteristics differed between pollutant species due to their different EFs and consumption patterns of solid fuels. Shouyang County emitted most for all pollutants (2.66%–4.91% of the region total) except PM2.5 and SO2, for which Xiangfen and Hongtong County emitted the most (2.64% and 2.90%), respectively. Emissions were higher in cold (SO2 during November to January, other pollutants during November to February) than warm months. Uncertainties in this newly developed emission inventory were estimated to be 25.2%–69.8%, much lower than those of existing ones, demonstrating the reliability of this inventory. Gini coefficients indicated that EC, PAHs, NOx, and VOC emissions exhibited evident regional disparities, e.g., Yuncheng and Jinzhong had high pollution levels despite low economic output.

Environmental thresholds are known to govern global vegetation patterns, but it is still unknown whether they can be used to predict the distribution of soil organisms and functions across global biomes. Using a global field survey of 383 sites across contrasting climatic and vegetation conditions, here we showed that soil biodiversity and functions exhibited pervasive nonlinear patterns worldwide and are mainly governed by water availability (precipitation and potential evapotranspiration). Changes in water availability resulted in drastic shifts in soil biodiversity (bacteria, fungi, protists and invertebrates) and soil functions including plant–microbe interactions, plant productivity, soil biogeochemical cycles and soil carbon sequestration. Our findings highlight that crossing specific water availability thresholds can have critical consequences for the provision of essential ecosystem services needed to sustain our planet. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Crop rotation with plastic mulching increased soil organic carbon and water sustainability: A field trial on the Loess Plateau,"Appropriate crop rotations are beneficial for food security and carbon sequestration. In cool and semiarid rain-fed areas, however, the effect on carbon sequestration in soil and the soil-crop system is not clear. In this study, a crop rotation field experiment was carried out on the Loess Plateau, China, involving (1) wheat continuous cropping (WCC), (2) maize continuous cropping (MCC), (3) potato continuous cropping (PCC) and (4) wheat-maize-potato rotating cropping (RC). All treatments were tilled once, and then, plastic mulched immediately to inhibit evaporation. We found that the rotating cropping system improved water storage in the 0-300 cm soil profile by 65.8 mm through the 6 years, while MCC depleted deep soil moisture. In a drought year, total dry matter (DM) for the rotating cropping was greater by 23.9% and 79.3% and harvested carbon quantity (HCQ) by 0.6 and 1.8 Mg ha(-)(1) compared with WCC and MCC systems, respectively. Total evapotranspiration significantly decreased by 14.5% compared with MCC, with no significant change compared with WCC and PCC. The soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration at 20-30 cm depth in the rotating cropping system was 36.0%, 28.0% and 30.3% greater than those of WCC, MCC and PCC, respectively. Similarly, the SOC sequestration rate at this depth was higher by 3.8, 3.2 and 3.4 Mg ha(-)(1), respectively. The pure carbon accumulation (PCA) of the rotating cropping system significantly increased compared with WCC and PCC, resulting in increased water use efficiency of pure carbon accumulation (WCP) by 11.1, 2.2 and 3.1 Mg ha(-)(1) mm(-)(1) compared with the WCC, MCC and PCC systems, respectively. Overall, the rotating cropping (RC) system maintained better soil water conditions, sustained crop development and SOC sequestration, especially optimizing the relationship between crop water utilization and SOC sequestration in soil-crop system in the cool semiarid rain-fed area.",Not About Sufficiency
The policy and technical system of eco-environment protection and restoration in European union and its enlightenment to China,"Eco-environmental degradation has become one of the key factors restricting the health of ecosystems and human well-being around the world. How to mitigate and solve the problem of eco-environmental degradation has become an important content for countries to explore sustainable economic and social development. The European Union (EU) re-alized the seriousness of the eco-environmental problems earlier, and has formed a relatively sound policy system of envi-ronmental integration and established an innovation-driven technology practice system through long-term exploration, which has played an important role in maintaining the sustainable development of the EU. At present, China is at an important juncture of eco-environmental protection. To fully understand the policy and technical practice system of eco-environmental protection and restoration of the EU will be helpful to promote the cause of eco-environmental protection in China. On the basis of relevant literature research and analysis, this paper summarizes the status of eco-environmental protection in the EU, and systematically sorts out the relevant policy systems and technical measures. The paper also proposes that in the fu-ture, eco-environmental protection and restoration should be incorporated into multiple departments, and environmental management mechanisms with public participation should be explored in the field of policy. In terms of innovation of tech-nical measures, it is necessary to promote the localization and mainstream development of nature-based solutions, and build a platform for innovation and exchange of technical measures based on enterprises and multi-participation. © 2023, China Environmental Science Press.

Combing public-private partnership and large-scale farming increased net ecosystem carbon budget and reduced carbon footprint of maize production,"Limited adoption of advanced technologies and land fragmentation limit the sustainable intensification of agriculture in developing countries. Here, we explore and establish an integrated management strategy by combining the public-private partnership (PPP) and large-scale farming (LSF) for more profitable and sustainable no-tillage maize production. A case study was conducted in the North China Plain to determine the applicability and the key drivers underpinning PPP-LSF success. On average, maize under PPP-LSF yielded 10.4 Mg ha(-1), which was 11.8% and 19.4% greater than that of LSF and smallholder farming (SHF), respectively. Compared with LSF and SHF, the PPP-LSF achieved the highest energy use efficiency and the lowest negative environmental externalities. The carbon footprint of PPP-LSF was 267 kg CO2-eq Mg-1, which was 32.7% and 38.2% lower than that of LSF and SHF, respectively. A new causal factor analysis developed in this study revealed that the mechanised application of controlled-release formula fertilisers, eliminating top-dressing, was the main factor for low carbon footprint in PPP-LSF. The mean net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB), sustainability index, and net ecosystem economic benefit of PPP-LSF were 22.5 Mg C ha(-1), 17.1 and 2040 $ ha(-1), respectively, which were increased by 15.3% and 23.9%, 55.5% and 69.3%, and 28.7% and 50.3% compared with LSF and SHF. Higher net primary productivity related soil carbon sequestration potential and lower field carbon emissions were the main drivers of high NCEB of PPP-LSF. This real-world commercial crop production-based example illustrates the value and potential of PPP-LSF in utilising modern innovative farming technologies and management strategies to accelerate agricultural productivity and resources conservation with reduced environmental footprints.",Not About Sufficiency
Nuclear Power Sustainability Path for China from the Perspective of Operations,"Nuclear power, as a low-carbon, stable, and efficient energy, plays an important role in replacing fossil fuels in the development of a globally sustainable energy system. However, nuclear power has deviated from the path to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. The path of sustainable nuclear power for China was proposed based on an analysis of the development of global nuclear power and the situation in China, using advanced operation concepts and intelligent collaboration technology to change the labor-centered operation mode. It serves as a model for other countries with a labor-centered nuclear power operation mode and an aging society seeking to achieve carbon neutrality through the use of nuclear power around the world. © 2022 Tao Zhang et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Altruistic mode selection and coordination in a low-carbon closed-loop supply chain under the government's compound subsidy: A differential game analysis,"Under low-carbon circular economy, how the government and low-carbon closed-loop supply chain (LC-CLSC) members make decisions to achieve carbon neutrality and recycling of waste resources becomes a prominent part of the study. This paper studies the altruistic mode selection and coordination of the LC-CLSC under the compound subsidy of the government from a long-term dynamic perspective. The results show that the altruistic behavior of the manufacturer as the leading party can promote emission reduction and recycling activities, and increase the retailer's profit and total profit while avoiding damage to its profit when its altruistic intensity is maintained at a reasonable level. The altruistic behavior of the retailer as the subordinate party will inhibit emission reduction and recycling activities, and increase the manufacturer's profit by damaging its profit, therefore leading to a decline in the total profit. The emission reduction subsidy rate decreases as the mutual altruistic intensity increases. The recycling subsidy rate decreases as the manufacturer's altruistic intensity increases, but it will increase as the retailer's altruistic intensity increases. Compared with other altruistic modes, the leading party manufacturer's unilateral altruistic mode can achieve a higher level of emission reduction, recycling rate, total profit, consumer surplus and social welfare. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Immediate actions on coal phaseout enable a just low-carbon transition in China's power sector,"To meet the 2060 carbon neutrality target, China will need to phase out existing coal-fired power plants by 2050 or before. The electricity supply sector directly employs over 2 million and an additional 2 million when indirect employment including product and machinery production are included. To investigate the policy options and pathways available to meet the national climate goal while transitioning this jobs-intensive and economically powerful sector, we developed a plant-level job accounting model, and combine it with a power sector optimization model to assess job loss in the coal sector, as well as job creation in the burgeoning renewable power sector in China. We find that national and provincial policy actions to support an early and managed transition help to ensure a job-rich and both geographically and socioeconomically equitable shift from coal to clean energy. Specifically, the projected decline in fossil-fuel jobs can be fully offset by job new creation in the expanding renewable energy sector. Current COVID-19 economic stimulus plans include a potential new coal boom, where China could build up to 247 GW of additional plants, and thus delay the transition by a decade or more. We find that this action would result in up to 90% of coal-fired workers losing jobs between 2030 and 2040 without a clear pathway to absorb these workers in what will be an already mature clean energy economy. Provinces with massive coal fleets and limited renewable energy resources, notably Anhui, Henan, Hebei and Shandong, etc., would face a particularly disruptive mismatch of job gains and losses. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Digital economy, energy efficiency, and carbon emissions: Evidence from provincial panel data in China","Improving energy efficiency and lowering carbon emissions are of great importance to realize the “dual carbon” goal of carbon peak and carbon neutrality. Digital economy is a new engine of economic development, but whether or how it affects energy efficiency and carbon emissions are unclear. Utilizing panel data of China's 30 provinces from 2012 to 2019, this study empirically explores the relationships among digital economy, energy efficiency, and carbon emissions. Meanwhile, from the perspective of energy efficiency, applying mediation models and panel threshold model, it analyzes the direct, indirect, and nonlinear influencing mechanisms of digital economy on carbon emissions. The results reflect that the development of digital economy in China intensifies carbon emissions. Energy efficiency serves as a vital partial mediator between the two. The enhancement of energy efficiency can lower carbon emissions. However, the development of digital economy is not conducive to improving energy efficiency, thereby, indirectly increasing carbon emissions. The mediating effect of energy efficiency accounts for 30.58 % of the total effect of digital economy on carbon emissions. Meanwhile, taking energy efficiency into account, the impact of digital economy on carbon emissions has a significant double-threshold effect and presents an N-shaped trend. [0.824, 0.912] is the optimal range of energy efficiency, within which the growth of the digital economy can empower carbon emission abatement to some extent. In addition, the expansion of population size, the coal-based energy consumption structure, and the industrial structure significantly increase carbon emissions. The improvements in living standards and environmental regulations can help to decrease carbon emissions, but the emission abatement effects are not significant. Those conclusions reveal the importance of optimizing the level and quality of digital economy and adopting differentiated digital economy development policies based on energy efficiency to achieve carbon emission reduction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Long-term transition of China's power sector under carbon neutrality target and water withdrawal constraint,"Deep carbon mitigation and water resources conservation are two interacted environmental challenges that China's power sector is facing. We investigate long-term transition pathways (2020–2050) of China's power sector under carbon neutrality target and water withdrawal constraint using an integrated capacity expansion and dispatch model: SWITCH-China. We find that achieving carbon neutrality before 2060 under moderate cost decline of renewables by 10–20% depends heavily on large scale deployment of coal-fired power generation with carbon capture and storage (CCS) since 2035 in China's water-deficient northwestern regions, which may incur significant water penalties in arid catchments. Introducing water withdrawal constraints at the secondary river basin level can reduce the reliance on coal-CCS power generation to achieve carbon neutrality, promote the application of air-cooling technology, and reallocate newly built coal power capacities from northwestern regions to northeastern and southern regions. If levelized cost of renewables can decline rapidly by about 70%, demand for coal power generation with CCS will be significantly reduced by more than 80% and solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind could account for about 70% of the national total power generation by 2050. The transition pathway under low-cost renewables also creates water conservation co-benefits of around 10 billion m3 annually compared to the reference scenario. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Distribution and determinants of organic carbon and available nutrients in tropical paddy soils revealed by high–resolution sampling,"Rice is one of the most important crops in China; however, the loss of paddy area and imbalanced soil nutrient composition threaten food security in China owing to the increasing food demand. Soil nutrients significantly influence soil fertility, quality, and productivity, thereby controlling rice production and agroecosystem sustainability. However, a systematic assessment of the nutrient distribution and its driving factors is lacking in the low–yield paddy soils of southern China. In this study, 3239 surface paddy soil samples covering an area of 1278 km2 were collected and analyzed for soil organic carbon (SOC), alkaline hydrolyzable nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK). The dominant factors influencing SOC, AN, AP, and AK were identified using a Random Forest (RF) method. We identified deficient levels of SOC (8.94 g kg−1), SOC density (SOCD, 21.1 t ha−1), AN (55.3 mg kg−1), and AK (37.2 mg kg−1) in tropical paddy soils, but high levels of AP (34.7 mg kg−1). According to the RF, SOCD was significantly correlated with soil AN and AK, implying their coupled cycling in tropical paddy soils; however, the negative correlation between SOC and AP signified decoupling. Compared with waterloggogenic paddy soils, gleyed paddy soils had significantly higher SOC concentrations and densities but significantly lower AP and AK concentrations and pH. Analyses of cropping system effects indicated that double– and triple–cropping systems had significantly higher SOC, bulk density (BD), SOCD, AP, AK, and pH than those of single–cropping systems. These results suggested that tropical paddy soils can potentially sequester OC and available nutrients via efficient soil management. Considering the deficient AN and AK levels of single–cropping system and their high importance on SOCD and soil productivity, double– and triple–cropping systems (generally with high N and K fertilization and residue return) are recommended as an efficient approach to improve the poor soil nutrient status and enhance the OC pool and rice production in tropical paddy soils. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Improving Representation of Crop Growth and Yield in the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model and Its Application to China,"To accurately assess the roles of agriculture in securing food security and maintaining environmental sustainability, it is essential to improve the representation of crop growth, development, and yield formation in global land models that traditionally focus on energy, water, carbon, and nitrogen exchanges between land and the atmosphere. In this study, a process-based agricultural module has been coupled with the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM-AG2.0) for assessing how multiple environmental factors (climate change, atmospheric CO2 concentration, tropospheric O-3, and nitrogen deposition) and human activities (land use/cover change, nitrogen fertilizer use, and irrigation) have affected the crop growth, development, yield, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and water cycles in agroecosystems. Here we describe the model structure for simulating crop growth, development, and yield formation in the DLEM-AG2.0, and then we validate the model using field observations and a national yield survey for three major crops (wheat, maize, and rice) in China during 1980-2012. Results show that the DLEM-AG2.0 is capable of simulating the dynamic processes of phenological development, leaf growth expansion, biomass accumulation, biomass allocation, and yield formation for wheat, maize, and rice with normalized root mean square errors of the simulations of less than 20%. Our model-based yield estimation for the three major crops at the national scale for the period 1980-2012 is generally consistent with the national yield survey in China. The crop representation in the DLEM-AG2.0 is flexible for extrapolating to a global scale after rigorous testing with both site-specific and regional observations. Further advancement of agricultural modeling within the global land modeling framework will require consideration of human perception and behavior for adapting and mitigating global change.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of enhancing soil organic carbon sequestration in the topsoil by fertilization on crop productivity and stability: Evidence from long-term experiments with wheat-maize cropping systems in China,"Although organic carbon sequestration in agricultural soils has been recommended as a 'win-win strategy' for mitigating climate change and ensuring food security, great uncertainty still remains in identifying the relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and crop productivity. Using data from 17 long-term experiments in China we determined the effects of fertilization strategies on SOC stocks at 0-20 cm depth in the North, North East, North West and South. The impacts of changes in topsoil SOC stocks on the yield and yield stability of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) were determined. Results showed that application of inorganic fertilizers (NPK) plus animal manure over 20-30 years significantly increased SOC stocks to 20-cmdepth by 32-87% whilst NPK plus wheat/maize straw application increased it by 26-38% compared to controls. The efficiency of SOC sequestration differed between regions with 7.4-13.1% of annual C input into the topsoil being retained as SOC over the study periods. In the northern regions, application of manure had little additional effect on yield compared to NPK over a wide range of topsoil SOC stocks (18->50 Mg C ha(-1)). In the South, average yield from manure applied treatments was 2.5 times greater than that from NPK treatments. Moreover, the yield with NPK plus manure increased until SOC stocks (20-cmdepth) increased to similar to 35Mg C ha(-1). In the northern regions, yield stability was not increased by application of NPK plus manure compared to NPK, whereas in the South there was a significant improvement. We conclude that manure application and straw incorporation could potentially lead to SOC sequestration in topsoil in China, but beneficial effects of this increase in SOC stocks to 20-cm depth on crop yield and yield stability may only be achieved in the South.

Potential of Perennial Crop on Environmental Sustainability of Agriculture,"Since the advent of agriculture, more than one-fourth of Earth's land surface has been converted for agricultural purposes, which conversion from natural to agricultural landscapes dramatically changes the plant communities that are integral to ecosystem processes.

Simulating endogenous institutional behaviour and policy implementation pathways within the land system,"Policy interventions have substantial effects on land use change, providing key levers for multiple objectives, including mitigating climate change and biodiversity loss, and maintaining food security. Policy effects are often complicated, conflicting, and subject to regular change. Despite this, land system models typically treat policies as simple, exogenous modifications to models. To better represent the dynamic nature of policy-making, we develop an endogenous institutional model that can be embedded within land system models, here exemplified by an agent-based model. Numerical experiments are conducted to examine an institution with two policies targeting the production of ecosystem services. We find a clear scope for simulation-based exploration of policymaking, with emergent processes including the marginal diminishing effect of economic policy interventions, asymmetric spill-over effects for different ecosystem services, and trade-offs between policy goals. The endogenous institutional model demonstrates the potential to reveal various emergent patterns with important consequences for land systems.",Not About Sufficiency
Interdisciplinary linkages of biophysical processes and resilience theory: Pursuing predictability,"The global value of ecosystem services is approximately $33 trillion per year. Given the economic value, it is not surprising that billions of dollars are spent annually to protect, preserve, restore and conserve natural resources. Resilience describes the ability of ecological systems to recover from disturbance. Resilient ecosystems remain productive and thus maintain services including biophysical processes that are important for human well-being. Four system-wide characteristics, or biophysical signatures are reviewed, at least one of which is required to relate ecosystem structure or function to resilience. Biophysical signatures include (a) variable material and energy recycling, (b) biodiversity, (c) the rate of governing processes, and (d) bioenergetics. Fast recycling rates encourage ecosystem stability by dampening oscillations while slow recycling rates increase resistance by weakly propagating disturbances. The role of biodiversity in stabilizing ecosystems may be viewed as either a functional redundancy where increased diversity resists perturbation by maintaining key ecosystem functions, or as response diversity that ensures recovery processes. Governing ecosystem processes that respond slowly, such as those involving large storage reservoirs, resist perturbation and shift to alternative states. Several observational resilience studies featured bioenergetics as both the perturbation force (i.e., predation, food supply) and the thermodynamic orientor that organizes recovery (i.e., maximizing exergy storage). An energy balance approach is proposed as a possible method to assess ecosystem stability. Validating a mechanistic resilience model against high resolution data collected from a system undergoing regime shift is needed to advance theory toward practical application. As physical requirements bound the possibility space for ecosystems, it is not surprising that biophysical processes play a central role in resilience theory. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Symbiotic endolithic microbes reduce host vulnerability to an unprecedented heatwave,"Heatwaves are increasingly severe and frequent, posing significant threats to ecosystems and human well-being. Characterised by high thermal variability, intertidal communities are particularly vulnerable to heat stress. Microbial endolithic communities that are found in marine calcifying organisms have been shown to induce shell erosion that alters shell surface colour, lowering body temperatures and increasing survival rates. Here, we investigate how the symbiotic relationship between endolithic microbes and the blue intertidal mussel Mytilus edulis mitigates thermal stress during the unprecedented 2022 atmospheric heatwave in the English Channel. Microbial infestation of the shell significantly enhanced mussel survival, particularly higher on the shore where thermal stress was greater. Using data from biomimetic temperature loggers, we predicted the expected thermal buffer and observed differences up to 3.2 °C between individuals with and without symbionts under the known conditions of the heat wave-induced mortality event. The ecological implications extend beyond individual mussels, affecting the reef-building capacity of mussels, with potential cascading effects for local biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and coastal defence. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding small-scale biotic interactions during extreme climate events and provide insights into the dynamic nature of the endolith-mussel symbiosis along a parasitic-mutualistic continuum influenced by abiotic factors. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"How infrastructure development, technological innovation, and institutional quality impact the environmental quality of G7 countries: A step towards environmental sustainability","Despite the economic success, the G7 nations have not adequately prioritized environmental welfare. However, these nations must recognize that economic prosperity cannot be sustained without safeguarding environmental sustainability. In short, environmental protection is a necessary component of achieving sustainable development goals. For this matter, this study aims to analyze the effects of accumulative infrastructure development, economic growth, foreign direct investment, technological innovation, and institutional quality on the CO2 emissions of the G7 countries. Using annual panel data from 1996 to 2020, this study employs cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lags (CS-ARDL) to determine the environmental impacts of the variables under investigation. The findings show that foreign direct investment and institutional quality have a favorable effect and improve environmental quality. In contrast, the accumulative (transport, energy, financial, and information and communication [ICT]) infrastructure development, economic growth, and technological innovation stimulate environmental degradation by increasing CO2 emissions. These results are found robust, as validated by the Common Correlated Effect Mean Group (CCEMG). In line with these crucial findings, governments have suggested that specific measures supporting innovation in environmental-related technologies, infrastructure development, and economic growth must be implemented to mitigate CO2 emissions in the G7 countries. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"A narrative action on the battle against hunger using mushroom, peanut, and soybean-based wastes","Numerous generations have been affected by hunger, which still affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide. The hunger crisis is worsening although many efforts have been made to minimize it. Besides that, food waste is one of the critical problems faced by most countries worldwide. It has disrupted the food chain system due to inefficient waste management, while negatively impacting the environment. The majority of the waste is from the food production process, resulting in a net zero production for food manufacturers while also harnessing its potential. Most food production wastes are high in nutritional and functional values, yet most of them end up as low-cost animal feed and plant fertilizers. This review identified key emerging wastes from the production line of mushroom, peanut, and soybean (MPS). These wastes (MPS) provide a new source for food conversion due to their high nutritional content, which contributes to a circular economy in the post-pandemic era and ensures food security. In order to achieve carbon neutrality and effective waste management for the production of alternative foods, biotechnological processes such as digestive, fermentative, and enzymatic conversions are essential.

A TWO-STEP CASCADE MODELLING BETWEEN ENERGYSCOPE PATHWAY-BO AND PYPSA-BO FOR ENERGY TRANSITION PLANNING. PART A: IMPACTS OF DEMAND SCENARIOS,"As the transition of energy systems becomes more urgent worldwide, countries and communities are searching for pathways toward sustainable energy systems, which involves developing long-term energy plans and deciding on the key resources and technologies required to meet their future energy needs. In this context, bottom-up models are commonly used to analyze scenarios that assess the development of energy systems. Nevertheless, the technical, temporal, and spatial detail levels vary as systems and cases become more complex. Various modelling tools are currently available, each tackling issues using distinct approaches or addressing specific aspects of the system's behavior. Thus, considering a common objective and structure, redundancies among models could be used to check consistency across models and provide an additional validation layer. Alternatively, models can be enriched by including inputs or supplementary information from other tools, considering the aspects each tool focuses on. This research is split into two parts and addresses the coupling and comparison between two models. The first part, detailed in the current article, focuses on optimizing the investment strategy path from 2021 to 2050 (EnergyScope Pathway), while the second concentrates on optimizing the electrical network and dispatch (PyPSA-Earth). Within the scope of this paper, a critical gap in the literature was addressed by comprehensively characterizing energy demand patterns and evaluating the trajectory of the Bolivian energy system across various sectors-electricity, heat, cooling, and mobility-under three scenarios (business-as-usual (BAU), conservative effort towards transition (CET) and net zero emissions (NZE)) based on historical data for 2021 and energy demand projection of consumer groups until 2050. Prior to this investigation, no detailed analysis of energy demand had been conducted for Bolivia, leaving uncertainties regarding its evolution and impact on the country's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality. The analysis, utilizing the open-source EnergyScope Pathway model, identified electrification, synthetic fuels, efficiency improvements, and renewable integration as key to a sustainable transition. The NZE scenario reveals a 3% reduction in primary energy demand (due to energy efficiency) and a path to decarbonize the Bolivian energy system, emphasizing the importance of electrification, which grows to reach 135.23 TWh and a 48% share of energy consumption by 2050. At the same time, the total system cost (106.03 billion e2021) represents a lower value than the BAU and CET scenarios and emphasizes the necessity of dispatch & electricity network reinforcement in future endeavors (Part B). © 2024 37th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems, ECOS 2024.

Forest landscape restoration for environmental management,"Forest resources around the world have been under immense pressure mainly due to anthropogenic activities. Land use changes have taken place caused by an increase in commercial agricultural as well as an intensified development for human settlements and infrastructure advancement, leading to the decline in forest cover. In addition, a substantial amount of forest loss is also contributed by natural phenomena such as drought and tree diseases which are different in magnitude between countries. The dwindling forest area has negatively affected our ecosystem by decreasing the biodiversity as a direct result of habitat loss and depletion in food source. This could bring about a cascade of environmental issues including reduction in plant production, increase in soil erosion, water and air pollution, as well as reducing the efficiency of carbon sequestration. In order to moderate the negative impacts, an implementation of forest landscape restoration (FLR) could improve the health and productivity of forests. FLR involves various stakeholders coming together and reinstating the forest landscape at any scale using appropriate approaches. Through careful planning of FLR operations, forest restoration can be executed which will be beneficial not only to the forests, but also to the whole ecosystem by enhancing food security, air and water quality as well as reducing the adverse impact of climate change to our planet. This chapter aims at introducing the roles of FLR in restoring ecological functionality of degraded forest landscapes. The various tools used in conducting FLR to support human well-being and biodiversity will be highlighted. Finally, the implementation of FLR in meeting the present and future needs of mankind will also be discussed. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Achieving sustainable development goals in agricultural energy-water-food nexus system: An integrated inexact multi-objective optimization approach,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) take the global challenges into a new phase, calling for reasonable resources management from holistic perspectives. This study develops a novel integrated modelling framework for sustainable agricultural energy-water-food nexus (EWFN) management, with the objectives of maximum social welfare of water resources allocation, maximum hydroelectric generation, maximum grain crop production, maximum positive farmland ecosystem service value, and minimum negative farmland ecosystem service value. The proposed framework is capable of: (1) balancing benefit efficiency and allocation equity using social welfare function; (2) reconciling conflicting targets among socio-economic, resource, and eco-environmental spheres; (3) generating sustainable water and land resources allocation strategies considering complex and uncertain environment. The proposed model was applied to the Zhanghe Reservoir irrigation area, central China. Flexible water and land resources allocation schemes among different sectors, crops, and periods were generated, as well as managerial insights into what efforts should be done were provided for decision-makers. After optimization, efficiency-equity tradeoff was balanced with social welfare index reaching [0.94, 0.99]. Optima results show that GHGs emission contributed majority of the total loss, which cannot be totally neutralized by carbon sequestration, causing negative eco-environmental impacts of [2.3, 3.4] x 10(8) CNY. The proposed model performs well on generating robust and coordinated solutions according to scenarios analysis and models comparison.

Large scale reforestation of farmlands on sloping hills in South China karst,"Context South China karst is undergoing large scale land-use conversions driven by reforestation projects aiming at combating land degradation. However, the spatial extent of these human induced land-use changes is largely unknown. Objectives This study aims at quantifying land use changes in South China karst in the context of large scale restoration and reforestation projects. Results We apply an extensive field survey on land-use mapping and find that 45,406 km(2) of farmland have been converted to forest, while 41,811 km(2) have been deforested (likely due to timber harvest), which corresponds to a forest expansion of 6%, and an 8% contraction of farmlands. We find that the converted areas agree well with satellite observed greening trends, explaining why South China karst is considered a global hot-spot of vegetation cover increase. In total, 43% of the farmland to forest conversions have taken place on sloping hills steeper than 25 degrees and predominantly at larger distances from settlements. However, 19,464 km(2) of the steep sloping areas were still farmland in 2016, which is 15% of the total farmland in South China karst.

In total, 43% of the farmland to forest conversions have taken place on sloping hills steeper than 25 degrees and predominantly at larger distances from settlements. However, 19,464 km(2) of the steep sloping areas were still farmland in 2016, which is 15% of the total farmland in South China karst. Conclusions Large scale forest dynamics are observed on sloping hills. Given the low agricultural productivity but high erosion risk, considerations regarding loss of crop production and local food security must be balanced against gains in expected provisioning of ecosystem services (e.g. carbon sequestration, timber production).",Not About Sufficiency
How to achieve emission reduction without hindering economic growth? The role of judicial quality,"Existing literature has carried out fruitful research on the effects of environmental regulation policies. Due to differences in policies, regions, and data analysis methods, however, the previous studies have not reached a consensus on the effects of environmental regulation policies, especially on the effects of environmental regulation policies of developing countries from the perspective of environmental justice. This paper takes the establishment of the environmental court in China's intermediate people's court as a quasi-natural experiment and uses the multi-period difference-in-differences method to examine the effect of the establishment of the environmental court on environmental governance and economic performance, based on the panel data of 284 cities in China from 2003 to 2019. The results show that the establishment of the environmental court can significantly reduce the emission intensity of industrial SO2 in the short term. This reduction effect is resulted from the joint emission reduction effect of the establishment of the environmental court on local cities and adjacent cities. The mechanism analysis shows that the establishment of the environmental court has the dual effect of emission reduction without hindering economic growth. This effect is mainly achieved by improving energy efficiency, stimulating green technology innovation, increasing environmental investment, and improving the green finance level. Furthermore, the emission reduction effect of the establishment of the environmental court shows differential effects under the constraints of regional rule-of-law level, environmental awareness, fiscal pressure, and level of innovation and entrepreneurship. In addition, the establishment of the environmental court can facilitate the achievement of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
Recent advancements and challenges in emerging applications of biochar-based catalysts,"The sustainable utilization of biochar produced from biomass waste could substantially promote the development of carbon neutrality and a circular economy. Due to their cost-effectiveness, multiple functionalities, tailorable porous structure, and thermal stability, biochar-based catalysts play a vital role in sustainable biorefineries and environmental protection, contributing to a positive, planet-level impact. This review provides an overview of emerging synthesis routes for multifunctional biochar-based catalysts. It discusses recent advances in biorefinery and pollutant degradation in air, soil, and water, providing deeper and more comprehensive information of the catalysts, such as physicochemical properties and surface chemistry. The catalytic performance and deactivation mechanisms under different catalytic systems were critically reviewed, providing new insights into developing efficient and practical biochar-based catalysts for large-scale use in various applications. Machine learning (ML)-based predictions and inverse design have addressed the innovation of biochar-based catalysts with high-performance applications, as ML efficiently predicts the properties and performance of biochar, interprets the underlying mechanisms and complicated relationships, and guides biochar synthesis. Finally, environmental benefit and economic feasibility assessments are proposed for science-based guidelines for industries and policymakers. With concerted effort, upgrading biomass waste into high-performance catalysts for biorefinery and environmental protection could reduce environmental pollution, increase energy safety, and achieve sustainable biomass management, all of which are beneficial for attaining several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Valuation of Ecosystem Services for the Sustainable Development of Hani Terraces: A Rice-Fish-Duck Integrated Farming Model,"As a complementary and symbiotic agro-ecological cycle system, a nature-based integrated rice-fish-duck farming ecosystem was developed in the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces. The main research objective was to evaluate the ecosystem services based on case studies of the Hani integrated rice-fish-duck terraced farming system and determine its potential and its importance as an ecological asset. We developed a valuation model to assess the value of the integrated farming system based on the three aspects of provisioning, regulation and maintenance, and cultural services; we selected eight groups and 10 indictors to evaluate the ecosystem services of the integrated ecosystem in Honghe Hani Rice Terraces was 3.316 billion CNY, of which the provisioning service value was 1.76 billion CNY, the regulation and maintenance service value was 1.32 billion CNY, and the cultural services value was 230.85 million CNY. The evaluation will be useful as a theoretical reference for poverty alleviation policy makers in similar poverty-stricken areas, enabling them to better protect and promote this mode of farming and further promote the protection of the natural environment and cultural heritage alongside the sustainable development of natural resources and human well-being.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon Emission Calculation and Low Carbon Transition Path Optimization Method for Electric Power Industry,"With economic development, the energy and power industry must balance power supply growth and carbon reduction requirements. To achieve the goal of 'double carbon', the power system needs to be transformed into green and low-carbon, and accurate carbon emission accounting has become a critical support. Due to the significant differences between cities and regions, emission reduction strategies vary. To this end, the article firstly clarifies the carbon emission accounting boundary of power generation enterprises, establishes a carbon emission accounting model for the power industry based on the IPCC inventory method of fuel consumption, and secondly constructs an enterprise low-carbon transition planning model by integrating technological, economic, environmental and other factors, researches and analyzes the path of power generation enterprises to achieve carbon-neutral transition by 2060, and simulates different low-carbon transition scenarios. The results show that achieving carbon neutrality appropriately in advance is beneficial to power generation enterprises to a certain extent, but advancing the process of carbon neutrality too early will lead to soaring costs. In addition,future policies will push forward the scale of installed energy storage, and enterprises should make good use of technical and resource reserves. The power industry needs to formulate appropriate low-carbon transformation strategies according to its reality to ensure that it realizes a win-win situation regarding economic and social benefits while realizing the goal of carbon neutrality. © 2024 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
Enhancing China's ecological sustainability through more optimized investment,"China has tremendously invested in a set of ecological sustainability programs since the late 1970 s. Although the positive ecological benefits for human well-being have dramatically increased, these large-scale investments are still confronted with some drawbacks and lack a more comprehensive and precise understanding. Here, we quantitatively presented an overall portrait of spatial distribution, temporal trends and inter-annual variations of ecological investments for ten representative programs in the period 1978-2018 from national to provincial levels. Overall, the Chinese government has invested US$197.59 billion (in 2015 US$) for all the programs in total with the top three amounts in Southwest China, North China and Northwest China. We found that the investments for all the programs had gone through a rapid increase since 2000 with a much faster growth rate in Central China and East China. At the national level, the investments of ecological sustainability programs showed good stability and continuity. However, their annual investments varied greatly among different provinces. For instance, the Shelterbelt Development Program in Five Regions including the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River coastal areas was interrupted for more than ten years and showed weak stability in some specific provinces. It is suggested that China should adopt more optimized investment strategies in terms of distribution, stability and continuity through augmenting government funds and diversifying financial pathways for the ecological sustainability programs.",Not About Sufficiency
"Turkish challenges for low-carbon society: Current status, government policies and social acceptance","Turkey's rapid economic growth followed by increasing gap between domestic energy production and consumption signifies the large-scale integration of low-carbon and renewable resources into energy system. Turkey's energy demand is increasing and supplying fossil energies such as oil and gas is becoming more challenging due to the lack of domestic hydrocarbon resources. The country is facing two main issues; first, maintaining energy balance and second, handling environmental issues. Nevertheless, Turkey has substantial renewable and low-carbon energy resources with co-benefits for the country's fast growing economy and environmental sustainability. This paper aims to present a comprehensive update on Turkey's renewable and low-carbon energy sector. It reviews not only the current status of the technology, policy and economy, but also provides an insight into the social aspects as well. From a policy point of view, the paper critically discusses Turkey's energy strategy and perspectives and from the social point of view, the paper argues that there is a research gap in recent literature regarding public awareness and social acceptance of low-carbon energy technologies. Also, the future challenges for promoting low-carbon society in Turkey are discussed in terms of sustainable development and socio-environmental conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Achieving carbon neutrality with smart supply chain management: a CE imperative for the petroleum industry,"PurposeWith refineries contributing 68% of CO2 emissions from stationary combustion sources alone, smart technologies and the circular economy (CE) model for resource loop optimization can be a solution for carbon neutrality, especially within petroleum. Thus, this study aims to explore energy conservation by green technology improvement as a CE strategy for resource loop optimization and digital incorporation to maximize reprocessing lead ability rate and carbon-neutral benefits.Design/methodology/approachA game theory approach with Stackelberg equilibrium is considered under government cap-and-trade regulation to stimulate green technology improvement. The refinery acts as a Stackelberg leader and invests in green technology and the retailer as the Stackelberg follower, collects end-of-life lubricants against refund price and offers a two-part-tariff contract to the manufacturer having a significant role in smart technologies.FindingsFirst, green technology improvement is directly influenced by the reprocessing capability and refund price and digital technologies are significant to consider. Second, a two-part-tariff contract coordinates the supply chain for limited reprocessing capability by the retailer. Lastly, the government can effectively manipulate the development of green technology by changing the permit price depending on the intentions.Research limitations/implicationsThe primary limitation is this study has focused on the petroleum sector and data was referenced from the oil refineries of a single country.Practical implicationsOverall, this study provides empirical guidance for policymakers on how to leverage energy-efficient smart technologies for lubricant reprocessing, enabling resource optimization as part of a CE strategy in the petroleum industry and advancing sustainable development goals.Originality/valueThe suggested model responds to the contemporary literature related to CO2 emissions and CE initiatives across the petroleum sector with the extended role of smart technologies and government cap-and-trade regulations.",Not About Sufficiency
"Energy, economic, and environmental impacts of sustainable biochar systems in rural China","Biochar production from biomass is a promising solution to tackle the energy and environmental challenges of rural China such as air pollution, soil contamination and degradation, sustainable agricultural waste management, and climate change. Small- and medium-scale (a few kW to 3 MW) gasification systems consisting of a gasification reactor and a gas engine had an energy efficiency of 15-20% and large-scale (>5 MW) systems via an integrated gasification combined cycle had an electrical efficiency of 26-30%. Low system efficiencies and high costs incurred by collection, transport, and pretreatment are some of the major barriers to the economic feasibility of biochar production systems in China. Mobile systems or distributed biochar production systems serve as promising solutions to reduce the biomass cost by utilizing locally generated waste biomass and catering for the bioenergy and biochar demands of local rural communities. From an energy application perspective, biochar production systems can generate heat and electricity, and biochar can serve as an energy storage material in supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries systems and can be used in anaerobic digestion to enhance overall energy recovery. Biochar can be used to achieve carbon sequestration and remediation of soil, and odor control in livestock farms. Systems converting locally generated biomass into energy and biochar that are used by local villages wait to be tested to clarify the intricacies of their viability and large-scale environmental and energy impacts in rural China.",Not About Sufficiency
Modern and traditional renewable energy sources and CO2 emissions in emerging countries,"Sustainable development goals aim to promote the implementation of environmental and energy policies towards establishing a sustainable environment. Considering that energy demand has steadily increased in emerging countries along with their rapid economic growth, controlling CO2 emissions in these countries is crucial to achieving global environmental sustainability. An important concern is that renewable energy is generally classified into traditional and modern sources, and their relationships with environmental degradation can differ at the macroeconomic level. This study examines the link of the two renewable energy sources to CO2 emissions by employing an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model for 31 emerging countries from 1990 to 2016. This analysis provides clear evidence of heterogeneity of the effects between traditional and modern renewable energy sources. Although CO2 emissions have negative associations with both traditional and modern renewable energy sources in the long-term, they are more sensitive to modern renewable energy sources than to traditional ones. These results suggest that modern renewable energy sources are an effective target for environmental and energy policies in emerging countries. Policy regulators and international communities should strengthen domestic and international schemes that facilitate the transfer of green technology, particularly, that related to modern renewable energy sources, from advanced countries to emerging countries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
"Ecosystem restoration along the ""pattern-process-service-sustainability"" path for achieving land degradation neutrality","Ecosystem restoration is critical in attaining land degradation neutrality (LDN) by fostering synergistic relationships between land use patterns, ecological processes, ecosystem services, and sustainable development, i. e., the ""pattern-process-service-sustainability"" cascading pathway. However, a comprehensive investigation examining the ecosystem restoration required to achieve LDN within the ""pattern-process-service-sustainability"" framework is yet to be undertaken. This study analysed the challenges associated with ecosystem restoration and proposed strategic approaches to promote restoration efforts aimed at LDN. Overall, various challenges exist encompassing trade-offs or conflicts between degradation and compensation, restoration and protection, area and structure, local and transboundary, as well as social and ecological factors. To address these challenges, potential restoration solutions for implementing LDN entail establishing restoration patterns that integrate conservation with restoration and co-manage plantations with natural ecosystems. Additionally, to foster resilient and self-regulating ecological processes, the focus is on improving ecological structure and harmonizing vegetation restoration with animal management. Enhancing overall ecosystem services requires reducing tradeoffs within biophysical thresholds and compensating degraded land with equivalent quality land. Finally, integrating local livelihoods and well-being in ecosystem restoration and promoting transboundary land management are vital for fostering sustainability among social-ecological systems. This article underscores the practical significance of ecosystem restoration along the landscape pattern - ecological process - ecosystem services sustainability continuum. The insights presented herein provide valuable support for enhancing global initiatives on ecosystem restoration, thereby facilitating the achievement of LDN and the SDGs.",Not About Sufficiency
Far-UVC Photolysis of Peroxydisulfate for Micropollutant Degradation in Water,"Increasing radical yields to reduce UV fluence requirement for achieving targeted removal of micropollutants in water would make UV-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) less energy demanding in the context of United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and carbon neutrality. We herein demonstrate that, by switching the UV radiation source from conventional low-pressure UV at 254 nm (UV254) to emerging Far-UVC at 222 nm (UV222), the fluence-based concentration of HO• in the UV/peroxydisulfate (UV/PDS) AOP increases by 6.40, 2.89, and 6.00 times in deionized water, tap water, and surface water, respectively, with increases in the fluence-based concentration of SO4•- also by 5.06, 5.81, and 55.47 times, respectively. The enhancement to radical generation is confirmed using a kinetic model. The pseudo-first-order degradation rate constants of 16 micropollutants by the UV222/PDS AOP in surface water are predicted to be 1.94-13.71 times higher than those by the UV254/PDS AOP. Among the tested water matrix components, chloride and nitrate decrease SO4•- but increase HO• concentration in the UV222/PDS AOP. Compared to the UV254/PDS AOP, the UV222/PDS AOP decreases the formation potentials of carbonaceous disinfection byproducts (DBPs) but increases the formation potentials of nitrogenous DBPs. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatiotemporal Evolution and the Influence Mechanism of Public Opinion on the Occurrence of Northward Migration of Wild Elephants,"The analysis of network public opinion plays a significant role in the scientific management and timely response of emergencies. In this paper, we established a process of spatiotemporal evolution for the structured analysis of dynamics of public opinion on emergencies, taking the first case of long- range wild elephants' northward migration in China in 2021 as a case study. We adopted a sentiment analysis method combining key sub- event extraction and extended BosonNLP to study the emotional concern response and cascade effect of the wild elephants' northward migration event reported in news and social media. A geodetector spatial statistical analysis method was used to reveal the influence mechanism, and then to explore the differences in the dissemination and evolution of such emergencies and the related public opinions. The results showed that: (1) public opinion on the northward migration of wild elephants exhibited a long starting period but a short outbreaking period, and the information diffusion was less influenced by the decay law of spatial distance, but mainly depended on the regional distribution of Internet resource supply and communication media, which differed from the evolution law of public opinions on major cross- region emergencies such as public health and natural disasters; (2) public opinion was prone to be triggered when the northward moving elephant herd approached the densely populated urban areas, where the news media paid full attention to the wild elephant migration dynamics with obviously positive attitudes and became an important force to promote a construction of positive social public opinion; (3) a significant spatial clustering of Weibo sentiment was observed at the nation-wide and province-wide scales. At the national scale, Yunnan, where the event occurred, and its neighbouring provinces were identified as the low- low clustering emotional cold areas, while some concentrated areas with domestic media and Weibo users such as Beijing, Shandong, and Jiangsu were identified as the high- high clustering emotional hot areas; at the provincial scale, Kunming and its neighbouring prefectures/cities were also identified as the high-high clustering hot areas, whereas the major distribution areas of China's wild elephants such as Xishuangbanna and Pu'er were identified as the hot emotional areas. Therefore, the government departments and news media should exhibit differentiated responses to public concerns in the hot and cold emotional zones and then precisely guide local public opinion. These findings are important for enriching the methods and framework of public opinion geography in the era of big data, and promoting biodiversity conservation to achieve a harmonious society. © 2023 Journal of Geo-Information Science.

Modeling and Analysis of the Impact of Quality Growth and Financial Development on Environmental Sustainability: Evidence from EU Countries,"This study examines the impact of financial development and quality growth on environmental sustainability in European Union (EU) countries, making a significant contribution to the existing literature by introducing a composite index for environmental sustainability and emphasizing quality growth as a more inclusive alternative to traditional economic growth indicators. Unlike conventional studies, which often measure environmental sustainability using single indicators, this research introduces a composite index that includes both environmental damage (e.g., carbon emissions) and protective factors (e.g., forest area, renewable energy consumption). This innovative approach provides a more holistic assessment of environmental sustainability, distinguishing this study from existing research. The results emphasize the role of a robust financial system in promoting environmental sustainability, as each unit increase in financial development is positively correlated with the environmental sustainability ratio, encouraging investments and projects that prioritize environmental goals. In addition, the study shows that quality growth, which takes into account social welfare and resource efficiency in addition to economic expansion, is crucial for promoting sustainability. By focusing on quality growth, this study shifts the paradigm from mere quantitative economic expansion to a more comprehensive understanding of growth that integrates social and environmental dimensions. This nuanced approach contrasts with traditional models that focus on quantitative economic growth, highlighting that both quality growth and financial development are critical to supporting long-term environmental goals. This research provides actionable insights for policymakers by emphasizing the need for financial reforms, such as green bond markets and sustainable credit mechanisms, to support sustainable development. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatio-Temporal Dynamics and Drivers of Ecosystem Service Bundles in the Altay Region: Implications for Sustainable Land Management,"Understanding the dynamics of ecosystem services (ESs) in arid landscapes and socio-ecological systems is crucial for sustainable development and human well-being. This study uses the Invest model to quantify the spatio-temporal changes in four key ecosystems services in Altay from 1990 to 2020: water yield (water yield), carbon stock (carbon stock), soil retention (soil retention), and habitat quality (habitat quality). The trade-offs/synergies between different ESs were investigated via Spearman's correlation analysis. Ecosystem service bundles (ESBs) were mapped using self-organizing mapping (SOM), and the key drivers of ES relationships and the spatio-temporal dynamics of ESBs were revealed through redundancy analysis. The results showed that water yield increased by 33.7% and soil retention increased by 1.2%, while carbon stock and habitat quality decreased by 3.5% and 1.24%, respectively. The spatial distribution pattern had a clear zonal pattern, with the northern mountainous areas higher than the southern desert areas. The six pairs of ESs, in general, showed mainly low trade-off and high synergistic relationships, with trade-offs between water yield and carbon stock, soil retention and habitat quality, and a decreasing trend of trade-offs over time. Four types of ESBs were distinguished, and the compositional differences and spatial distribution within each ESB were determined by interactions between ESs and landscape types. There are complex non-linear relationships between the drivers and the four ESBs in different years. Before 2010, ecological factors were the key drivers influencing the spatio-temporal changes in ESBs, whereas social and environmental factors combined to drive changes in ESB allocations after 2010. Additionally, this study found that the implementation of conservation measures, such as reforestation and sustainable land management practices, positively influenced the provision of ecosystem services in the Altay region. These findings underscore the importance of integrating conservation efforts into land use planning and decision-making processes to ensure the sustainable delivery of ecosystem services in arid landscapes.",Not About Sufficiency

Does digital service trade promote inclusive domestic growth? - Empirical research of 46 countries,"This study utilises panel data of 46 countries from 2005 to 2019 to examine the impact of digital service trade (DST) on inclusive growth. Inclusive growth is a growth model that promotes economic growth and development, while also building social equity and inclusiveness and balancing environmental sustainability. The findings indicate that a nation's DST development significantly fosters domestic economic growth and development, specifically through its employment enhancement effect. DST substantially promotes social equity and inclusiveness, mainly through the inclusive innovation effect. However, DST is also found to increase carbon emissions, impeding environmentally sustainable growth, specifically via the energy demand effect. Hence, DST exerts diverse impacts on different facets of inclusiveness. The study also reveals heterogeneity in the effects of DST on the three aspects of inclusive growth related to trade's import-export dynamics, income levels, and DST barrier intensities. This paper contributes to and refines the body of research on the relationship between DST and inclusive growth. It offers policy suggestions for crafting more open and mutually beneficial DST policies to foster social equity and inclusive global trade. © The Author(s), 2024.

Exploring advanced and sustainable bioaugmentation-enhanced ultrafiltration processes for the removal of emerging contaminants,"The development of cost-effective and sustainable water treatment technologies is crucial for supporting the water sector and the public in achieving global sustainable development goals (SDG 6) and carbon neutrality targets. Ultrafiltration (UF), known for its compactness, relatively high performance, and ease of operation, has been widely deployed in water treatment. However, its limitations in removing some emerging contaminants (ECs) and membrane fouling issues have hindered its broader application. This study investigated the incorporation of bioaugmented filtration into conventional UF processes to enhance ECs removal and mitigate membrane fouling during the treatment of real drinking water sources. In addition to effectively removing microorganisms (eukaryotes and bacteria), polysaccharides (13.9%), and inorganic pollutants (CaCO3, MgO, SiO2, and Al2O3), the proposed approach also demonstrated superior removal (4.6%-100.0%) of four target ECs (atenolol, carbamazepine, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole) compared to direct UF process (1.5%-47.5%). After 56 days of operation, the bioaugmented pre-treatment significantly reduced transmembrane pressure (TMP) by 80.2% compared to the direct UF process. Mechanisms studies further reassured that ECs removal followed oxidation during bioaugmentation pre-treatment. The time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry with in-depth analysis capability (around 5 nm) revealed that the UF membrane primarily removed atenolol through adsorption. The toxicity prediction results of typical ECs and their degradation intermediates indicated a significant reduction in ecological risk for most intermediates. The findings from this work demonstrate the feasibility of using low-carbon and few-chemical water treatment technologies to secure drinking water quality.",Not About Sufficiency
"Targeted Synergistic Priorities for Conserving Biodiversity, Carbon, and Water on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau","The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) highlights developing effective targets to halt and reverse the biodiversity and ecosystem services crisis. Although biodiversity and ecosystem services are tightly interlinked and interact in complex ways, a uniform global or national target has long ignored their interdependencies and uneven distribution to guide region- or ecoregion-specific planning. Here, we use a flexible and stepwise approach, incorporating high conservation values of biodiversity, carbon and water and their complex interactions, to identify three targeted priority areas at regional and ecological jurisdictions on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). We find that 49% of the targeted priority areas could effectively protect about 60% of biodiversity, carbon, and water at the ecoregion scale. However, at the regional scale, 48% of the targeted priority areas have the potential to conserve up to 70% of biodiversity, carbon and water. Although the QTP has achieved the target three of the Kunming-Montreal GBF (i.e., to protect 30% of areas), more than 75% and 70% of priority areas remain unprotected at the regional and ecoregion scales, respectively. More importantly, over 55% of the unprotected priority areas at the regional scale are under moderate to high human pressure. Our spatially explicit insights demonstrate the importance of expanding existing protected areas on the QTP, while highlighting the potential of targeted conservation initiatives at the subnational level to ensure the Kunming-Montreal GBF in a more efficient manner. © 2025.

"Human-wildlife conflict and community perceptions towards wildlife conservation in and around Wof-Washa Natural State Forest, Ethiopia","Background: Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is forecasted to increase globally in the vicinity of protected areas and covers various dimensions. It occurs in several different contexts and involves a range of animal taxonomic groups where the needs and requirements intersect with humans’ needs and development. More often, human-monkey conflict occurs in developing countries and is amongst the main threats to biodiversity conservation in these regions. Grivet monkeys are slender agile monkeys of the genus Cercopithecus. This study was conducted to investigate the status of human grivet monkey conflict and the attitude of local communities towards grivet monkey conservation in and around Wof-Washa Natural State Forest (WWNSF), Ethiopia from September 2017 to May 2018. A questionnaire survey (143 respondents) was used to study the human-grivet monkey conflict and its conservation status. Results: The majority of respondents (male = 67.1%; female = 74.1%) were not supporting grivet monkey conservation due to the troublesome crop-damaging effect of the animal. Respondents having settlements/farmland nearer to the forest have significantly negative perceptions towards grivet monkey conservation than those far from it. The majority of respondents opined that eradication/relocation of grivet monkeys and financial compensation are the options to mitigate human-grivet monkey conflict. Based on the questionnaire result, 42.5 ± SD 8.68 of respondents in all villages elucidated that the main cause of crop damage by grivet monkeys was habitat degradation. Conclusion: In the study area, Human-Grivet Monkey Conflict (HGMC) is exacerbated by the encroachment of local communities into the forest area, exploitation of resources that would be used by grivet monkeys, and enhanced crop damage by grivet monkeys. As a result grivet monkeys have been persecuted as a consequence of crop damage. This was due to the negative attitude developed from human perspective. Thus, awareness creation education programs and feasible crop damage prevention techniques need to be implemented. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Do the effects of aggregate and disaggregate energy consumption on different environmental quality indicators change in the transition to sustainable development? Evidence from wavelet coherence analysis,"In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations (UN) member states in 2015, half of the target period has been exceeded. However, China, whose energy consumption relies heavily on fossil resources, remains at the top of the list of global polluters. Therefore, investigating the environmental impacts of energy types is essential to China’s path towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)-7 and SDG-13. Based on this motivation, the paper offers new insights into the energy-environment literature for China with wavelet coherence analysis (WCA). This approach can investigate the relationship between variables in a periodic manner based on the frequency behavior of the models. The paper separately analyzes the effects of primary energy consumption (PEC), fossil energy consumption (FEC), renewable energy consumption (REC), nuclear energy consumption (NEC), GDP, and population (POP) on three different environmental indicators in China. Using two environmental pollution indicators (carbon emission (CO2) and ecological footprint (EF)) and one environmental quality indicator (load capacity factor (LCF)), the paper allows for comparison and robustness checks on the environmental impacts of energy indicators. Empirical findings reveal the following: (i) Except for REC and POP in the CO2 model, the variables in all three models largely move together during the period under observation; (ii) variables other than POP have consistent coefficient signs; (iii) PEC, FEC, NEC, and GDP increase CO2 and EF while decreasing LCF; (iv) the effect of NEC on LCF is more obvious until 2000; (v) unlike the others, REC affects CO2 and EF negatively and LCF positively; (vi) there is bidirectional causality between PEC and environmental indicators but not for REC; (vii) the causality relations of other variables with environmental indicators differ in terms of model, time, and direction of causality. In light of the findings, the paper highlights that only the REC improves environmental quality in China. Other energy indicators contribute to environmental degradation. China, whose ecological deficit has increased dramatically in recent years, urgently needs to reduce its dependence on fossil energy sources by accelerating investments in REC. Governments should also review nuclear energy policies, which are expected to help achieve carbon neutrality. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
"A simultaneous impact of digital economy, environment technology, business activity on environment and economic growth in G7: Moderating role of institutions","This study investigates the simultaneous influence of the digital economy, environmental technologies, business activity, and institutional quality on both the environment and economic growth in G7 economies from 1996 to 2020. The study provides an in-depth analysis to investigate the influence of institutional quality, particularly the regulatory environment, on business activity. Employing a rigorous methodology encompassing correlation analysis, long-term examination using Driscoll and regression estimators, and the utilization of various digital economy indicators such as internet usage and cell subscriptions, we uncover significant insights. The findings underscore the substantial impact of digital economies in mitigating carbon emissions and driving economic growth at an accelerated rate. Moreover, the study reveals that certain regulatory constraints on corporate operations can paradoxically facilitate carbon emission management while also fostering economic expansion. The study validates the presence of an inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) in G7 economies. This suggests that there is a specific point at which economic activities start to contribute more to carbon emissions. Moreover, the study highlights the importance of achieving a balance between economic growth driven by foreign direct investment and the goals of environmental sustainability. Environmental technology is becoming increasingly important in the regulation of emissions. Significantly, the study highlights the need to enhance the quality of implementing institutional regulations. It suggests that G7 economies can improve both environmental quality and economic growth by adopting superior regulatory methods. These findings are relevant for governments seeking economic growth and environmental protection. They suggest the need for specific policy actions to accomplish sustainable development goals. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Estimating carbon stocks and biomass accumulation in three different agroforestry patterns in the semi-arid region of Pakistan,"Due to higher atmospheric greenhouse gasses concentrations, global warming is undoubtedly the most critical environmental issue that needs an immediate solution. Agroforestry has attained worldwide recognition to cope with this global problem due to its greater potential to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide along with other ecosystem services, including food security. However, quantitative information about the biomass and carbon sequestration in poplar-maize agroforestry systems is not available in semi-arid climatic zones in Pakistan. The current study was carried out to evaluate the vegetation biomass and carbon stocks under three poplar-maize agroforestry planting patterns under semi-arid climatic conditions in a subdivision Jaranwala, District Faisalabad, Pakistan. The data was collected in three agroforestry patterns like; A (192 trees ha(-1)), B (255 trees ha(-1)), and C (296 trees ha(-1)). Allometric equations were used to estimate the biomass and carbon stock in plant species. Results showed that the poplar tree carbon stock among three planting patterns was significantly different, with maximum carbon stock of 35.62 t ha(-1) in pattern C, and it was 8% and 33.5% greater than the carbon stock of pattern B and pattern A, respectively. The maximum aboveground biomass assimilated by maize crop was (11.95 t ha(-1)) in pattern B, and it was 10.3% and 3.6% greater than pattern A and pattern C, respectively. The grain yield was highest in pattern A as compared to the other two patterns. Additionally, the maximum soil carbon stock in soil was estimated (22.72 t ha-1) in pattern C, at 0-15 cm depth, while it was 13.42% and 6.61% greater than pattern A and pattern B, respectively. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggested that pattern C with maximum biomass production and carbon stocks is the optimum poplar maize planting pattern in requisites of both financial and environmental benefits in the form of carbon sequestration.",Not About Sufficiency
"Traditional home garden agro-biodiversity dynamics, agro-ecosystem services, and management practices in smallholder farmers setting, South-Central Ethiopia","Traditional home gardens are rich in agro-biodiversity and are crucial for improving and diversifying the livelihood of smallholder farmers. Though many researches are carried out on home gardens in tropical regions, there are only few studies on the dynamics of traditional home gardens, agro-ecosystem services, indigenous management practices, and roles in mitigating climate shocks, which is the objective of the present study. For the same purpose, three sites were purposively selected out of which 308 sample smallholder households were chosen using a simple random sampling technique for a household survey. Key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and field observations were also used to collect data for cross-checking the data collected through the house hold survey. Results demonstrate that there was a wide-ranging diversity of crops in traditional home garden landscape. Both annual and perennial crops were incorporated into the home gardens to enhance their multiple agro- ecosystem services, including enhancing resilience to climate shocks. They ranged from herbaceous to large trees and food to cash crops. The primary agro-ecosystem services that the home garden agro-biodiversity delivered were diversifying the sources of food, income, and medicine, as well as improving food security. Home gardens were largely managed by indigenous knowledge, including hand weeding, manure and compost application, nursery preparation, fencing, and flood run-off control. The agro-biodiversity in traditional home gardens is more diverse, dynamic, and resilient to climate shocks. Nonetheless, they are neglected hotspots of agro-biodiversity and sociocultural diversity. In conclusion, the agro-biodiversity in traditional home gardens promotes food availability, accessibility, and utilization virtually all year round as well as contributes to the preservation of agricultural genetic and cultural diversity.",Not About Sufficiency
Restoration patterns and influencing factors for the vegetation structure and carbon storage in mangroves converted from abandoned ponds,"Afforestation of mangroves in abandoned ponds is considered an effective approach for global mangrove restoration. Although several studies have assessed recovery outcomes of reforested mangroves, the studies about the synergistic recovery of mangrove vegetation and ecosystem carbon stocks in abandoned ponds are still limited. The present study compared the vegetation structure and carbon stocks of pond-to-mangrove sites with different restored methods in Dongzhaigang Bay, Hainan Province, China. We found that the vegetation structure (tree density and Shannon diversity) had no significant differences between afforestation sites and natural mangroves. The total ecosystem carbon stocks of all the sample sites ranged from 64.07 to 224.91 (mean ± SD: 114.82 ± 49.30) Mg C ha−1, while there were no significant variations between restoration sites in 2014 (p > 0.05). In addition, 85.44 % of the total carbon stocks were stored in the soil among the study sites. The soil physicochemical properties such as soil pH, total organic carbon, total nitrogen had effects on tree height, diameter at breast height and carbon stocks composition. Meanwhile, in-situ soil redox potentials, Shannon diversity, tree height, density and diameter at breast height affected carbon stock. Moreover, the soil physicochemical properties, absolute elevation and vegetation structural variables could explain 76.83 % of the carbon stock variance. This study demonstrated that artificial planting had no superiority in vegetation restoration and carbon sequestration over natural regeneration. Under appropriate environmental conditions, natural regeneration is an economically effective way to restore mangroves from abandoned ponds to realize the co-benefits of biodiversity and carbon storage restoration. © 2025",Not About Sufficiency
A new approach to assessing natural capital consumption inequities from a nonlinear perspective,"The rate of decline in ecosystem services has been exacerbated by inefficient and inequitable natural resource use and management. This study analyzes the natural capital stock and outflow in the Arid and Semi-Arid Northern Region of China (ASRNC) from 2000 to 2020. The Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation are used in the equity assessment of natural capital consumption. Over-appropriation of natural capital is a prerequisite for the inequitable distribution of natural resources, and all variables were accounted for through a geographic probe. Since most of the variables in this study have a nonlinear relationship, an in-depth analysis was conducted using NARDL. The results show that (1) natural capital flow occupancy generally shows an upward and downward trend and peaks in 2015. Natural capital stock occupancy was on a linear upward trend over the study period, rising from 14.580hm2/cap to 18.272hm2/cap. Depletion of natural capital is increasing and construction land has become the land type that leads to deep footprint changes (2) A city's consumption of natural capital matches its ecological carrying capacity to contribute to economic growth. However, the Gini coefficient for the depth of the ecological footprint from 2000 to 2020 is on a fluctuating upward trend. It reached its maximum in 2020 (1.457), indicating that the inequitable use of natural capital stock is increasing. (3) In the long run, population density and urbanization rate have different adverse effects on utilizing natural capital stock. In addition, the equity of planted forest area on natural capital use is heterogeneous in the long and short term. There is a negative effect of planted forest area on natural capital stock under long-term development. The study helps to judge the equity of regional consumption of natural capital and provides a scientific basis for the harmonious development between socio-economic systems and ecosystems.",Not About Sufficiency

A global assessment of the impact of individual protected areas on preventing forest loss,"Globally, the number and extent of terrestrial protected areas (PAs) are expanding rapidly. Nonetheless, their impacts on preventing forest loss and the factors influencing the impacts are not well understood, despite the critical roles of forests in biodiversity conservation, provision of ecosystem services, and achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. To address this important knowledge gap, we quantified the impacts of 54,792 PAs worldwide on preventing forest loss from 2000 to 2015, and assessed important landscape and management factors affecting the impacts of PAs. Although the majority (71 .4%) of the PAs contributed to preventing forest loss, only 30.5% of forest loss in the PAs have been prevented. PAs with higher rates of forest loss in their surrounding regions, located at lower elevations, within a few hours of travel from the nearest city, with higher agricultural productivity, and permission for fewer human uses were better able to prevent forest loss. Impacts on preventing forest loss were similar regardless of whether the PAs were privately or publicly owned. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of strict protections, involving private entities in the establishment of PAs, and situating PAs in areas exposed to high risks of forest loss to enhance the capacity to combat global forest loss.

Restoring Abandoned Farmland to Mitigate Climate Change on a Full Earth,"Degraded farmlands have been abandoned worldwide, especially in high- and middle-income countries. These lands help combat climate change as they undergo natural recovery of vegetation and soil carbon and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, recovery can be slow, requiring decades to centuries to approach pre-cultivation or natural states, and in some cases, soils remain degraded without active restoration. In this perspective, we present an overview of how carbon capture and storage on abandoned farmland can be accelerated and maximized via managing plant diversity as both a means and an end of restoration, creating and applying biochar to soil, and co-developing with renewable energy as techno-ecological synergies. These strategies can jointly tackle climate change and land degradation while contributing to and reinforcing multiple other Sustainable Development Goals. Although challenges exist, adoption of these strategies could be facilitated by increasing governmental and corporate initiatives at global and regional levels, especially developing carbon-offset markets for agriculture.",Not About Sufficiency
Range-wide evaluation of wildlife habitat change: A demonstration using Giant Pandas,"Information on wildlife habitat distribution and change is crucial for the design and evaluation of conservation efforts. While habitat distribution has been evaluated for many species, information on habitat change is often unclear, particularly across entire geographic ranges. Here we use the iconic giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) as a model species and present an advanced approach to evaluate its habitat change across an entire geographic range through the integration of time-series satellite imagery and field data. Our results show that despite a few areas showing habitat degradation, both the overall habitat suitability and habitat area increased between the early 2000s and the early 2010s. Our results also indicate that conservation efforts in China have achieved success beyond the boundaries of nature reserves, since panda habitat outside nature reserves shows a higher proportional growth than inside the reserves. Despite these promising trends, we found habitat fragmentation remains a threat to the species' long-term survival. These results provide valuable information to assess the appropriateness of recent decision by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) that down-listed the giant panda from endangered to vulnerable species, while laying a good foundation for the design of future conservation efforts. The approach described here may also be easily implemented for evaluating range-wide habitat change for many other species around the world and thus help achieve biodiversity conservation objectives such as those set by the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Sustainable Development Goals.",Not About Sufficiency
Going Beyond the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: An Index System of Human Well-Being,"Understanding the linkages between ecosystem services (ES) and human well-being (HWB) is crucial to sustain the flow of ES for HWB. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) provided a state-of-the-art synthesis of such knowledge. However, due to the complexity of the linkages between ES and HWB, there are still many knowledge gaps, and in particular a lack of quantitative indicators and integrated models based on the MA framework. To fill some of these research needs, we developed a quantitative index system to measure HWB, and assessed the impacts of an external driver - the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake - on HWB. Our results suggest that our proposed index system of HWB is well-designed, valid and could be useful for better understanding the linkages between ES and HWB. The earthquake significantly affected households' well-being in our demonstration sites. Such impacts differed across space and across the five dimensions of the sub-index (i.e., the basic material for good life, security, health, good social relations, and freedom of choice and action). Since the conceptual framework is based on the generalizable MA framework, our methods should also be applicable to other study areas. © 2013 Yang et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Poplar Forests in NE China and Possible Influences on Soil Properties: Ecological Importance and Sustainable Development,"The importance of poplar forests in Northeast (NE) China and possible influences on soil properties were discussed both by a review of previous published data and laboratory measurements of neighboring soil samples from farmland and poplar plantations. The following conclusions were derived. (1) Total area, timber volume and carbon storage of poplar forests in NE China were 2.11 Mha, 153.1Mm3, 63.82 Tg, respectively. (2)Take one million ha poplar plantation in this region as an example, the total benefit is estimated as 284 billion RMB. Most of it (88%) is from ecological values in soil erosion reduction, fertility conservation, biomass carbon sequestration, and oxygen production. Only 8% is from the economic values in forestland rent, timber and other biomass residue for firewood, and 4% is from social benefits in increasing job and disaster prevention. (3) In NE China, over 30% poplar plantations are afforested as farmland shelterbelt plantations. Compared to farmlands, significant changes were found in different soil layers and different sites in poplar SOC concentration and stock changes (P < 0.001); Regression analysis showed that the SOC sequestration potential was affected by changes in total N (P < 0.001); Poplar shelterbelt plantations 4.3% and 7.4% decreased soil bulk density and soil moisture (P < 0.001), respectively, a 4.8% increase in soil porosity (P < 0.01), and an evident recovery in soil fertility (4.4% increase in total K, 15.1% increase in available K) (P < 0.05); Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and potential N mineralization rate (PNM) declined 22.00% and 41.67%, while soil metabolic quotient (qCO2) increased 26.35% following plantation of agricultural lands; The concentration of total extracted glomalin-related soil protein (TGRSP) in poplar forests (6.29 g kg-1) was 9% higher than that in farmlands (5.77 g kg-1), and a weak decrease trend of easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (EE-GRSP) was discovered in poplar forests. The long history of poplar plantation in NE China have shown some potential problems (e.g., diseases for leaves, stems and roots), and implications for sustainable poplar afforestation in NE China are also discussed in this paper. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"Implementation of ""green"" economy principles in the forest sector","This work focuses on the principles of green economy in relation to the role of the forest sector in combating the effects of climate change. The threat to humanity comes from deforestation and forest degradation, leading to an increase in global carbon dioxide emissions. It is indicated that the implementation of the ""green"" principles of forestry development is aimed at reducing carbon emissions, efficient use of resources and social integration. The key elements of the developed mechanism are institutional and economic tools, ""green"" principles, indicators and a set of measures for the preservation and increase of natural capital, carbon sequestration, prevention of loss of ecosystem services and biodiversity, income growth and employment. Green economy is an important subsystem of sustainable development that integrates low-carbon, resource efficiency and social welfare. It has been proven that criteria and indicators are an important tool for the implementation of forest policy. Introduction of the green economy principles in the forest sector is aimed at fulfilling international obligations, introducing a system for regulating greenhouse gas emissions, obtaining additional income from tax collections, land rent, protecting the interests of all stakeholders, including the population and forest workers, efficient use of resources forests, taking into account the value of ecosystem services when making decisions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

"Unveiling nano-empowered catalytic mechanisms for PFAS sensing, removal and destruction in water","Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are organofluorine compounds used to manufacture various industrial and consumer goods. Due to their excellent physical and thermal stability ascribed to the strong C[sbnd]F bond, these are ubiquitously present globally and difficult to remediate. Extensive toxicological and epidemiological studies have confirmed these substances to cause adverse health effects. With the increasing literature on the environmental impact of PFAS, the regulations and research have also expanded. Researchers worldwide are working on the detection and remediation of PFAS. Many methods have been developed for their sensing, removal, and destruction. Amongst these methods, nanotechnology has emerged as a sustainable and affordable solution due to its tunable surface properties, high sorption capacities, and excellent reactivities. This review comprehensively discusses the recently developed nanoengineered materials used for detecting, sequestering, and destroying PFAS from aqueous matrices. Innovative designs of nanocomposites and their efficiency for the sensing, removal, and degradation of these persistent pollutants are reviewed, and key insights are analyzed. The mechanistic details and evidence available to support the cleavage of the C[sbnd]F bond during the treatment of PFAS in water are critically examined. Moreover, it highlights the challenges during PFAS quantification and analysis, including the analysis of intermediates in transitioning nanotechnologies from the laboratory to the field. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
Nanoparticle-Based Plant Disease Management: Tools for Sustainable Agriculture,"Plant diseases cause huge crop loss on a global scale and are the chief yield-limiting factor in agriculture. Due to greater utilization of land for agriculture and excessive use of fungicides and pesticides, resistant plant pathogens are spreading unprecedentedly and require an immediate check to corroborate food security. Based on need the newer crop protection technologies are emerging to ensure higher crop yield and are contributing in feeding the rapidly growing human population. Nanotechnology is one such novel technology with great potentials. From the last decade, nanotechnology as a technological science has grown to the extent that its presence can now be felt in the fields of automobiles, construction, cosmetics, electronics, and medicine. But, unlike medical nanotechnology, agriculture nanotechnology is one such technology whose potential in agriculture is yet to be fully explored. Nanotechnology deals with materials in the size range of 0.1–100 nm. Due to their minuscule size, such particles interact at an atomic or molecular level to form structures in the nanometer range. These very small particles, called nanoparticles (NPs), show properties very different from larger particles of the same element. NPs show phenomenon like Coulomb blockade, quantum nature, superparamagnetism, and surface plasmon resonance. They show surface effects due to higher surface atoms (Sharma et al Adv Colloid Interface Sci 145(1–2): 83–96, 2009) because the small size increases the surface area to volume ratio of particles (Prasad J Nanopart 2014:963961, 2014; Prasad et al. WIREs Nanomed Nanobiotechnol 8:316–330, 2016; Prasad et al Front Microbiol 8:1014, 2017a). Due to variable surface compositions, NPs have different reactivities to processor like adsorption and redox reactions (Waychunas et al. J Nanopart Res 7(4): 409-433, 2005). NPs are made from materials like carbon nanotubes, magnetic particles, metals, metal oxides, polymers (synthetic and natural), and quantum dots. They can be a designed application specific to catalyze chemical reactions. Based on NP type, the nanotechnological devices can detect pathogen quickly and cost-effectively with high accuracy. Besides, NPs can act against pathogens like chemical fungicides or pesticides or are used as carriers to deliver such agents. Because of their very small size, the targeted delivery of agents can be ensured inside the pathogen or pest at the cellular level. The targeted delivery can ensure lesser soil contamination due to xenobiotic agricultural chemicals. Besides this nanotechnological intervention can be used in fertilizer nanoformulations, understanding the mechanism of host-parasite interaction, food preservation, salt-affected land reclamation, reducing soil erosion, etc. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Nitrogen fertilizer induced greenhouse gas emissions in China,"China is facing great challenges in both food security and environmental sustainability against the background of global climate change. In order to meet the increasing demand for food in China, increasingly more reactive nitrogen (Nr) species have been synthesized by the Haber-Bosch process. Overuse of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has occurred widely in Chinese agriculture. Motor vehicles, power plants and industrial facilities are consuming large amounts of fossil fuels. As a consequence, gaseous Nr emissions including NH3, NOx and N2O have increased substantially since 1980, directly or indirectly contributing to the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and climate change. The GHG emissions from N fertilizer production and transport (274TgCO2eqyr-1) and use for crop (403TgCO2eqyr-1) application occupied a major part of total agricultural emissions in China, in spite of small carbon (C) sequestration in croplands (28-37TgCO2eqyr-1) induced by N fertilizer. Strategies to reduce N fertilizer loss and GHG emissions are mentioned briefly. China has also witnessed detectable climate warming, fluctuations in precipitation and other extreme weather conditions over the last 30 years. This climate change has threatened national cereal production and may accelerate N cycling (i.e., N2O emissions) in croplands and non-arable soils. These N feedbacks should be taken into account when considering mitigation of GHG emissions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon footprint analysis and carbon neutrality potential of desalination by electrodialysis for different applications,"Low-carbon water production technologies are indispensable for achieving sustainable development goals and mitigating global climate change. However, at present, many advanced water treatment processes lack a sys-tematic assessment of related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, quantifying their life-cycle GHG emissions and proposing strategies toward carbon neutrality is urgently needed. This case study focuses on electrodialysis (ED), an electricity-driven desalination technology. To analyze the carbon footprint of ED desalination in various applications, a life cycle assessment model was developed based on industrial-scale ED processes. For seawater desalination, the carbon footprint is 59.74 kg CO2-eq/metric ton removed salt, which is one order of magnitude lower than that of high-salinity wastewater treatment and organic solvent desalination. Meanwhile, the power consumption during operation is the main hotspot of GHG emissions. Power grid decarbonization and improved waste recycling in China are projected to reduce the carbon footprint up to 92%. Meanwhile, the contribution operation power consumption is expected to reduce from 95.83% to 77.84% for organic solvent desalination. Through sensitivity analysis, significant non-linear impacts of process variables on the carbon footprint were determined. Therefore, it is recommended to optimize the process design and operation to reduce power con-sumption based on the current fossil-based grid.

"Electrochemical advanced oxidation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs): Development, challenges and perspectives","Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been globally distributed since 1940, resulting in their widespread existence in natural environments. This is due to the remarkable stability of carbon–fluorine bonds, which are difficult to degrade chemically in a natural setting. PFASs accumulate in the human body through daily consumption of water and food, which can lead to potential health effects such as immune, metabolic, and neurodevelopmental effects. As a result, there is a growing global concern regarding PFAS remediation, given their toxicity and bio-accumulative properties in recent years. Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have been developed for the remediation of PFASs and have been applied in wastewater treatment. In these processes, a highly powerful oxidizing agent, hydroxyl radical (([rad])OH), is generated electrochemically in solution, which can oxidize organic contaminants. EAOPs have become an environmentally friendly and effective treatment process for destroying PFASs. However, their slow reaction rate, poor performance stability, high energy consumption, and electrode erosion hinder their commercialization for water treatment. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art anode materials and their corresponding degradation efficiency of PFASs through electrochemical remediation, along with future recommendations. A worldwide perspective on the fundamentals and experimental setups is provided, examining, and discussing different anode electrodes, as well as the challenges of EAOPs for PFAS remediation. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Cleaner production evaluation system for textile industry: An empirical study from LCA perspectives,"The contradiction between the rapid textile expansion and intensive energy consumption, highly environmental pollution calls for the adoption of cleaner production (CP). However, current evaluation system mainly targeted on CP at production stage, guidance and support on the life cycle assessment is still in its infancy. Meanwhile few studies brought the combination of water conservation and carbon reduction into considerations. This study compared the existing CP evaluation systems including guidelines for the whole industry, standards for textile industry and indicators for the dyeing and finishing sector by quantifying the differences of indicator score compositions. Comparisons analysis from six aspects suggested that all the evaluation systems had relevant indicators regarding “pollutant emissions”. “Management”, “process equipment and techniques” and “resource and energy consumption” have also been well concerned while “product characteristic” seemed to be overlooked at current stage. From the perspective of whole life cycle, the key of textile processing is the “printing and dyeing” (44.23 %) followed by “fabric manufacturing”(28.85 %) and setting (15.38 %). With regards to the environmental impacts, resources depletion gained the highest attention since their indicator scores reached up to 25.71 %, 18.47 % and 20.62 % for EMAS, ERG 2018 and HJ-1852006. Cleaner production awareness and social impact also played significant roles in ISO 14031:2021 and WMG. Subsequently, a set of new comprehensive CP evaluation indicator system was established, including 3 scopes and 7 goals. The newly-built indicator system incorporated with life cycle perspectives gave a powerful tool to measure the CP level in textile industry and of CP will benefit from water reuse and energy utilization with high efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatio-Temporal Evolution and Drivers of Carbon Emission Efficiency in China's Iron and Steel Industry,"Improving the carbon emission efficiency (CEE) of the iron and steel industry (ISI) is crucial for China to achieve the goal of carbon peak and carbon neutrality. This study employed the undesirable SBM and Dagum Gini coefficient to measure the ISI's CEE and analyzed the spatial heterogeneity among three regions of China. This study also used the Tobit model to clarify the influencing factors. The conclusions show that (1) the CEE in eastern provinces is the highest, the central ones rank second, while the western ones rank the worst; the promoting effect of Technical Change is greater than that of Efficiency Change. (2) ISI's CEE shows a positive spatial correlation and an apparent spatial heterogeneity. The CEE gap between the regions contributes most to the CEE difference among provinces. The regional CEE gap within the western region is the largest, with a maximum difference of 0.520 in the Dagum Gini coefficient. Furthermore, the total CEE gap shows a narrowing trend from 2009 to 2020, with the Dagum Gini coefficient decreasing from 0.414 in 2009 to 0.357 in 2020. (3) Industrial structure, enterprise scale, foreign direct investment, and technology level positively correlate with ISI's CEE; the marginal impacts are 0.6711, 0.1203, 0.0572, and 3.5191, respectively. While energy intensity, environmental regulation, and product structure negatively correlate with it, the marginal impacts are 0.0178, 1.4673, and 0.2452, respectively.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental lifecycle assessment of CO2-filled triboelectric nanogenerators to help achieve carbon neutrality,"Industrialization activities in recent decades have achieved an unprecedentedly prosperous civilization. Nevertheless, energy-shortage crises and environmental problems have increased. In particular, the exacerbated greenhouse effect and global warming caused by the sharp rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere cause threats and challenges to the living environment, thereby making the vision of carbon neutrality our immediate need. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can harvest very small amounts of mechanical energy from the surrounding environment and convert it into electrical energy, thereby providing a new avenue for energy architectures. Taking advantage of the simple structure, low cost, and high energy density of TENGs, this work proposes a method to inflate CO2 gas into TENGs for energy-harvesting of ocean waves to minimize the carbon footprint. Analysis of lifecycle assessment showed that the CO2 emissions generated by this scheme were minimal, and that the generated electricity could provide clean energy to compensate for CO2 emissions and, ultimately, achieve negative carbon emission. This research may provide a pathway for applying TENGs in green-energy harvesting and attaining the sustainable development goals set by United Nations and carbon neutrality.",Not About Sufficiency
Research on the speed control strategy of low carbon power transition based on CGE model—take the GBA as an example,"In order to discuss the supply security of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in the process of carbon neutrality and low-carbon power transition, a dynamic CGE model was built for the GBA. Fifty-one scenarios were designed to simulate the annual variation range of each type of power generation, and the maximization of social welfare was taken as the evaluation index. The optimal time node and development speed of coal power decommissioning to minimum guaranteed capacity and complete decommissioning, as well as gas power capacity to peak were studied. The results show that the coal power generation capacity will be decommissioned by 6.6 billion kW∙h per year from 2020 to the minimum guaranteed capacity in 2032, and then it will be completely decommissioned by 4.0 billion kW∙h per year in 2045. The gas-power generation capacity will increase by 6.1 billion kW∙h per year from 2020 to reach the peak in 2038, and then retire at the rate of 5.1 billion kW∙h per year to maintain a minimum guaranteed capacity of 132.3 billion kW∙h in 2050. Further, according to the constant growth rate of local total electricity generation from 2020 to 2050, the growth rate of non-fossil power can be obtained, and the combination of the development rate of coal power, gas power and non-fossil power is the most economical. Compared with the baseline scenario, the optimized power transition combination scenario can reduce the fossil energy consumption by 110 million tce, reduce carbon emissions by 280 million t CO2, increase the added value of the power sector by CNY 23.8 billion, and increase the added value of other sectors by CNY 17.2 billion. The optimal power generation speed regulation strategy proposed in this study is conducive to supporting the economic, effective, safe, reliable, coordinated and orderly transition of the power system in the GBA and the formulation of low-carbon policies. © 2021 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

In this study, the land system (combinations of land cover and land use intensity) evolution trajectories of the Luanhe River Basin (LRB), China, and major challenges that the LRB may face in 2030, were explored by applying the CLUMondo and InVEST models. The results indicate that the LRB is likely to experience agricultural intensification and urban growth under all four scenarios that were explored. The cropland intensity and the urban growth rate were much higher under the historical trend (Trend) scenario compared to those with more planning interventions (Expansion, Sustainability, and Conservation scenarios). Unless the forest area and biodiversity conservation targets are implemented (Conservation scenario), the forest areas are projected to decrease by 2030. The results indicate that water scarcity in the LRB is likely to increase under all scenarios, and the carbon storage will increase under the Conservation scenario but decrease under all other scenarios by 2030. Our methodological framework and findings can guide regional sustainable development in the LRB and other large river basins in China, and will be valuable for policy and planning purposes to the pursuance of SDGs at the sub-national scale.",Not About Sufficiency
Hidden Loss of Wetlands in China,"To counter their widespread loss, global aspirations are for no net loss of remaining wetlands [1]. We examine whether this goal alone is sufficient for managing China's wetlands, for they constitute 10% of the world's total. Analyzing wetland changes between 2000 and 2015 using 30-m-resolution satellite images, we show that China's wetlands expanded by 27,614 km2 but lost 26,066 km2—a net increase of 1,548 km2 (or 0.4%). This net change hides considerable complexities in the types of wetlands created and destroyed. The area of open water surface increased by 9,110 km2, but natural wetlands—henceforth “marshes”—decreased by 7,562 km2. Of the expanded wetlands, restoration policies contributed 24.5% and dam construction contributed 20.8%. Climate change accounted for 23.6% but is likely to involve a transient increase due to melting glaciers. Of the lost wetlands, agricultural and urban expansion contributed 47.7% and 13.8%, respectively. The increase in wetlands from conservation efforts (6,765 km2) did not offset human-caused wetland losses (16,032 km2). The wetland changes may harm wildlife. The wetland loss in east China threatens bird migration across eastern Asia [2]. Open water from dam construction flooded the original habitats of threatened terrestrial species and affected aquatic species by fragmenting wetland habitats [3]. Thus, the “no net loss” target measures total changes without considering changes in composition and the corresponding ecological functions. It may result in “paper offsets” and should be used carefully as a target for wetland conservation. Xu et al. examine the sufficiency of the “no net loss” goal for managing wetlands. China's wetlands had a net increase of 1,548 km2 between 2000 and 2015. This number hides considerable complexities of wetland changes such as those in composition and ecological functions. The “no net loss” goal should not be used alone for wetland conservation. © 2019 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Technology pathway to decarbonisation in the building sector based on a policy review of major economies,"Building decarbonisation is crucial to achieve the carbon neutrality targets. Although many studies have been conducted, a gap remains in the research concerning technology development and policy design. This study conducted a comprehensive review of the decarbonisation pathways proposed by the ten largest economies globally for the building sector at the national level. By synthesising the relevant literature, a systemic framework of technologies applicable to the building sector is proposed, encompassing five major categories of technologies: energy efficiency, electrification and clean heating, on-site generation and flexible utilisation, green construction materials and processes, and sufficiency in operation and maintenance. An overview of each country's emphasis on technological development, future expectations and prevailing trends in technology deployment is summarised and discussed. Most countries' policy documents address energy efficiency, electrification, and clean heating; however, the importance of flexibility and sufficiency warrants further emphasis. The balance among different technologies, the impacts of lock-in effects, and the considerations of equity and justice in renovation processes are critical concerns for the future deployment of technologies. This study can provide a meaningful reference for the following research phase and the development of pathways to decarbonise buildings for countries worldwide. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Ecological deficit tax: A tax design and simulation of compensation for ecosystem service value based on ecological footprint in China,"The expansion of resource tax to the occupation of natural ecological space is an important part of China's tax reform. This paper quantifies the occupation of natural ecological space based on the demand for energy, water, and agriculture resources in terms of an ecological footprint, and creatively convert the carbon emissions from energy consumption to occupation of carbon sinks such as woodlands and grasslands, to obtain the ecological deficits in various regions of China. Based on the evaluation of the ecological service value, the paper determines the correspondence between consumption projects, land types and ecological functions, realized the accounting of the economic value of the national ecological deficit as the sum of the regional deficits. Based on this, the ecological deficit is used as an unpaid input factor in the construction of a green Social Accounting Matrix table, and a recursive dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model is used to analyze the effects of a tax policy on the compensation for the ecological deficit value. The simulation results show that the double-dividend hypothesis exists in the primary and tertiary industries, and employment in the secondary industry that with a high value-added labor decreased, resulting in decreases in both the labor income of residents and their proportion of the national income. The growth rate of GDP decreases in the short term and then gradually increases. Capital appreciation and net exports contribute greatly to economic growth. Based on the positive role of taxation schemes in reducing ecological deficits and their negative impacts on economic growth and the income distribution, this paper suggests that, with the improvement of big data on ecological occupation, an ecological deficit tax can be introduced to target the energy sector, which has a large ecological footprint. In addition, household income should be protected through tax cuts, transfer payments, and earmarked funds, among other means, to promote economic growth and protect the environment.

Study on the Effects of Reducing Nitrogen Fertilizer: Stabilizing Yield and Carbon Sequestration by Synergistic Utilization of Chinese Milk Vetch and Rice Straw in Double-Cropping Rice Area,"The excessive application of chemical fertilizers in rice fields exacerbates soil degradation and poses a threat to food security. Achieving an increase in rice production and minimizing environmental costs are inevitable requirements for achieving sustainable rice production. The synergistic utilization of rice straw (RS) and Chinese milk vetch (MV) is a sustainable measure to improve soil quality in Southern China. How this management strategy impacts agricultural productivity and soil carbon (C) sequestration under different fertilization conditions is unclear. Several treatments, including only chemical fertilizer (F), F + MV (FM), F + RS (FS), and F + MV + RS (FMS) under a standard rate of nitrogen (N-100) and 40% reduced nitrogen (N-60) levels were designed to explore changes in rice yields and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, stocks, and soil labile organic C fractions (permanganate oxidizable C) during 2018-2020 in a double-rice-cropping system. The results show that the FMS treatment reduced soil bulk density to alleviate soil compaction and improved the soil carbon management index. The synergistic utilization of MV and RS replacing 40% of the chemical N fertilizer could still maintain the rice yield. Compared to the F treatment, the average annual grain yield was significantly increased by 9.82% and 5.84% in the FMS treatment; SOC concentration was increased by 16.05% and 19.98% on average (p < 0.05), and SOC stock was increased by 1.78 Mg C ha(-1) and 2.37 Mg C ha(-1) under the N-60 and N-100 levels, respectively. The random forest regression model and correlation analysis demonstrated that the inputs of chemical N, organic N and C, and appropriate C/N ratio promoted soil C accumulation. Furthermore, the structural equation model analysis exhibited that the C input affects the highly labile organic carbon (HLOC) and total labile organic carbon (LOC); the HLOC had a positive effect on SOC (p < 0.05). N input had a significant effect on LOC and yield. Our results suggest that the synergistic utilization of MV and RS plays an important role in ensuring stable grain production, improving soil C sequestration capacity, and maintaining soil environmental health in Southern China.",Not About Sufficiency
China's power industry's carbon emission intensity in the context of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality: measurement and regional difference,"PurposeTo cope with the severe situation of the global climate, China proposed the ""30 60"" dual-carbon strategic goal. Based on this background, the purpose of this paper is to investigate scientifically and reasonably the interprovincial pattern of China's power carbon emission intensity and further explore the causes of differences on this basis. Design/methodology/approachConsidering the principle of ""shared but differentiated responsibilities,"" this study measures the carbon emissions within the power industry from 1997 to 2019 scientifically, via the panel data of 30 provinces in China. The power carbon emission intensity is chosen as the indicator. Using the Dagum Gini coefficient to explore regional differences and their causes. FindingsThe results of this paper show that, first, China's carbon emission intensity from the power industry overall is significantly different. From the perspective of geospatial distribution, the three regions have unbalanced characteristics. Second, according to the decomposition results of the Gini coefficient, the overall difference in power carbon emission intensity is generally expanding. The geospatial and economic development levels are examined separately. The gaps between the eastern and economically developed regions are the smallest, and the regional differences are the source of the overall disparity. Research limitations/implicationsFurther exploring the causes of differences on this basis is crucial for relevant departments to formulate differentiated energy conservation and emission reduction policies. This study provides direction for analyzing the green and low carbon development of China's power industry. Practical implicationsAs an economic indicator of green and low-carbon development, CO2 intensity of power industry can directly reflect the dependence of economic growth on the high emission of electricity and energy. and further exploring the causes of differences on this basis is crucial for relevant departments to formulate differentiated energy conservation and emission reduction policies. Social implicationsFor a long time, with the rapid economic development, resulting in the unresolved contradiction between low energy efficiency and high carbon emissions. To this end, scientifically and reasonably investigating the interprovincial pattern of China's power carbon emission intensity, and further exploring the causes of differences on this basis, is crucial for relevant departments to formulate differentiated energy conservation and emission reduction policies. Originality/valueThird, considering the influence of spatial factors on the convergence of power carbon emission intensity, a variety of different spatial weight matrices are selected. Based on the beta-convergence theory from both absolute and conditional perspectives, we dig deeper into the spatial convergence of electricity carbon emission intensity across the country and the three regions.",Not About Sufficiency
"Substituting nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer with optimal amount of crop straw improves rice grain yield, nutrient use efficiency and soil carbon sequestration","Crop straw return after harvest is considered an important way to achieve both agronomic and environmental benefits. However, the appropriate amount of straw to substitute for fertilizer remains unclear. A field experiment was performed from 2016 to 2018 to explore the effect of different amounts of straw to substitute for fertilizer on soil properties, soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, grain yield, yield components, nitrogen (N) use efficiency, phosphorus (P) use efficiency, N surplus, and P surplus after rice harvesting. Relative to mineral fertilization alone, straw substitution at 5 t ha-1 improved the number of spikelets per panicle, effective panicle, seed setting rate, 1 000-grain weight, and grain yield, and also increased the aboveground N and P uptake in rice. Straw substitution exceeding 2.5 t ha-1 increased the soil available N, P, and K concentrations as compared with mineral fertilization, and different amounts of straw substitution improved SOC storage compared with mineral fertilization. Furthermore, straw substitution at 5 t ha-1 decreased the N surplus and P surplus by up to 68.3 and 28.9%, respectively, compared to mineral fertilization. Rice aboveground N and P uptake and soil properties together contributed 19.3% to the variation in rice grain yield and yield components. Straw substitution at 5 t ha-1, an optimal fertilization regime, improved soil properties, SOC storage, grain yield, yield components, N use efficiency (NUE), and P use efficiency (PUE) while simultaneously decreasing the risk of environmental contamination.",Not About Sufficiency
Race to environmental sustainability: Can renewable energy consumption and technological innovation sustain the strides for China?,"Several Asian nations, including China, are experiencing issues with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets. Consequently, this research discusses the design of an SDG agenda for China that can be utilized as a model for other Asian nations. Accordingly, we scrutinize the effect of technological innovation and renewable energy on CO2 in China. The study also incorporates other CO2 drivers such as economic growth and structural change into the framework. The current research employed a dataset covering the period from 1985 to 2019. Furthermore, we utilized autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) to capture the associations between CO2 emissions and the exogenous variables. In addition, we employed the gradual shift causality test to identify the causal interconnection. This technique can capture smooth or gradual changes and does not require prior knowledge of the dates, number, or form of a break (s). The outcomes from the ARDL disclosed that 1% increases in structural change and economic growth cause CO2 to increase by 1.600% and 0.819%, respectively, while 1% increases in renewable and technological innovation lessen CO2 by 0.688% and 0.090%, respectively. Moreover, the EKC hypothesis is supported. Moreover, the combined effect of renewable energy and innovation demonstrates that innovation enhances environmental quality by regulating the interrelationship between renewable energy and CO2. Lastly, the gradual shift causality test disclosed that CO2 emissions could be predicted by the exogenous variables. Based on these results, policy recommendations are proposed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Soil Organic Carbon Sequestration under Long-Term Chemical and Manure Fertilization in a Cinnamon Soil, Northern China","To mitigate climate change and improve food security, it is essential to understand how fertilizer strategies impact the dynamics of soil organic carbon and its fractions. The soil organic carbon (SOC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), and particulate organic carbon (POC) were investigated every five years in a corn (Zea mays L.) cropping system with chemical fertilization and manuring over twenty-four years (1992-2016) in a semiarid area of northern China. There were four treatments with chemical fertilizer (i.e., N1P1, N2P2, N3P3, N4P4), three treatments with chemical fertilizer plus manure (i.e., N2P1M1, N3P2M3, N4P2M2), and one treatment with manure alone (i.e., M6), and an unfertilized treatment (control). The carbon sequestration rate (C-SR) and efficiency (C-SE) of SOC, POC, and LFOC were identified. The results revealed that the fertilization treatments (N2P2, N3P3, N2P1M1, N3P2M3, N4P2M2, and M6) promoted SOC sequestration, with a sequestration rate of 0.19 similar to 1.29 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). The excess application of chemical fertilizer caused a reduction in POC, whereas the application of NP, NPM or manure resulted in greater POC sequestration in soil, with a carbon sequestration rate of 0.04 similar to 0.24 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). The LFOC stocks were 1.43 similar to 2.24 Mg ha(-1) under the NP treatments, 2.47 similar to 6.68 Mg ha(-1) under the NPM treatments and 8.12 Mg ha(-1) under the M treatment; these stocks were all higher than that of the control treatment. Different fertilization strategies affected the pools of SOC with different sequestration rates. We found the carbon sequestration rates of SOC and LFOC were logarithmically correlated with the annual carbon input. When the annual C input is approximately 1.39 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), the SOC level will be maintained; when the annual C input is higher than 0.8 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), the LFOC level increases. This study describes the relationship between carbon inputs and the SOC(LFOC) sequestration rates under continuous fertilization in arid cropland. The results further evidence that the long-term fertilization of NPM and M increases the potential for SOC sequestration and quantifies the amount of exogenous carbon input required for soil organic matter enhancement.",Not About Sufficiency
"Realising environmental rights civic action, leverage, and litigation","[Despite strong arguments] against putting environmental rights on the already crowded agenda of struggle, the greening of our land is basic to its healing. - Former Constitutional Court Judge Albie Sachs (1990, p. 140) Introduction Environmental rights have been given new prominence by their inclusion in the South African Constitution (Act 108 of 1996), which pronounces clearly on the imperative of ecologically sustainable economic and social development (Glazewski, 2005). Moreover, the constitutional shift laid the foundation for the development of specific principles of South African environmental law, including those relating to sustainability, public participation, and accountability. The necessity of such an approach is unequivocal. Accumulating evidence suggests a deterioration of the natural environment over the past decade (e.g. Wynberg, 2002; Department of Environment and Tourism, 2006; Green Drop Report, 2009) and a growing disparity between environmental sustainability and the drive for economic growth at all costs (e.g. South African Press Association, 2007; Curtis, 2008; Davenport, 2010; Roberts, 2010). At the same time, the poorest have borne the brunt of environmental degradation and change, such as flooding, drought, and pollution (e.g. Meadows and Hoffman, 2002; Momba et al, 2006; Goebel, 2007). Adopting an environmental rights approach that incorporates human rights and socio-economic agendas is essential for the attainment of environmental goals. Few studies, however, analyse the extent to which environmental rights have been realised in South Africa, or the relationships between environmental rights and other constitutionally entrenched socio-economic rights, which, as Feris (2008) remarks, are extremely unclear. There has also been little discussion as to whether the current approach is sufficient to deal with the complexity of the trade-offs that are inevitably made when short-term powerful economic interests and long-term environmental imperatives coincide. In the popular media, a rather hackneyed version of environmental rights has been portrayed, pitching ‘environment’ as the antithesis of economic development rather than recognising the inter-relatedness of environmental sustainability and the enhancement of human well-being (Gough and McGregor, 2007). © Cambridge University Press 2014.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecological illiteracy can deepen farmers' pesticide dependency,"Nearly 2.5 billion smallholders cultivate the world's arable land, strategically positioned to tackle multiple Anthropocene challenges. When consciously adopting ecologically-based pest management practices, they can improve resource use efficiency, slow biodiversity loss, curtail environmental pollution and safeguard human health. Yet, the effective implementation of knowledge-intensive management practices requires underlying ecological concepts to be well-understood. Here, drawing upon published social science research spanning 1910-2016, we illuminate deficiencies in the world's farmers' ecological literacy and in their valuation of insect-mediated ecosystem services. Though tribal people and indigenous folk possess sophisticated knowledge of insects that occur within farm settings, contemporary farmers on average know a mere 1.9-2.3 pestiferous herbivores and 0.5-0.9 pest-killing organisms (out of a respective 8 and 3 taxa) in a particular crop or cropping system. Ecosystem services such as biological pest control are annually worth hundreds of dollars ha-1 but remain unknown to nearly 70% of farmers globally. Also, agricultural systems with deficient ecological literacy tend to foster a greater dependency upon chemically-synthesized pesticides. If this 'cognitive handicap' can be remediated, farmers could become agro-biodiversity stewards and champions in redressing multiple aspects of global environmental change. © 2019 The Author(s).

The Road to Eliminating Energy Poverty: Does Renewable Energy Technology Innovation Work?,"Under the constraint of carbon neutrality targets, the issue of energy poverty has garnered increasing concerns. This study aims to measure energy poverty and assess the impact of renewable energy technology innovation in 30 provinces across China. Furthermore, it calculates city-level energy poverty in 274 cities. By examining the influence of renewable energy technology innovation on energy poverty, this study proposes a new approach to accelerate energy transition and promote sustainable development. The regression results, which have undergone rigorous robustness and endogeneity tests, demonstrate that renewable energy technology innovation significantly alleviates energy poverty. Moreover, the treatment effect of policies is determined through the regression control method. Specifically, the cities of Zhangjiakou, Baotou, and Qiqihar are analyzed to provide targeted suggestions for China's energy development. The treatment effects of both provincial and city-level policies indicate that implementing renewable energy demonstration zones can effectively alleviate energy poverty.JEL Classification: Q48; O31",Not About Sufficiency
Life cycle assessment of transparent wood in building industry: a sustainable solution for global warming mitigation,"Transparent wood produced from renewable resources offers a sustainable alternative to conventional petroleum-based polymers for potential building industry applications such as rooftop structures, windows, and decorations. Here, we conducted a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) to characterize and quantify the environmental footprint in terms of global warming, acidification, cancer, noncancer, air pollutions, eutrophication, ecotoxicity, smog, natural resource depletion, habitat alteration, water intake and ozone depletion from production and disposal processes of transparent wood. The results of LCA showed that the most environmental-friendly transparent wood would be produced using the modified lignin bleaching method, epoxy infiltration, and increase in cellulose volume up to 65 %. In those processing conditions, the global warming impact was 57 %, 57 %, and 13 % lower than that by the transparent polymethyl methacrylate, polycarbonate, and polyethylene terephthalate, respectively. These findings suggest that transparent wood provides great opportunities to replace conventional transparent petroleum-based materials, thereby mitigating global warming, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services to meet planetary health under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Biochar single application and reapplication decreased soil greenhouse gas and nitrogen oxide emissions from rice-wheat rotation: A three-year field observation,"Biochar application to soil has been proposed as a promising tool for sequestering carbon, ensuring food security, mitigating greenhouse gases (GHGs), and lowering nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions. Efforts and observations to determine whether biochar can be repeatedly amended to soil to further sequester carbon while meeting those targets from long term and practical perspective are limited. A three-year field experiment was conducted to observe simultaneous methane (CH4), N2O, and NO emissions in a rice-wheat rotation system, where six treatments were established as follows: control plot without biochar (B0), biochar-enriched soil with biochar applied once in 2012 at 20 t ha-1 (B20-) and 40 t ha-1 (B40-), reapplication of half rate biochar in 2015 at 10 t ha-1 (B20+) and 20 t ha-1 (B40+) to the above described biochar-enriched soils, single application of biochar in 2015 to the control soil at 40 t ha-1 (B40). Then a series of incubation experiments explored the mechanism for mitigating trace gases. The results showed that compared with nonamended soils, the soils with the single biochar application and the biochar reapplication had similar effects on CH4, N2O, and NO emissions, significantly decreasing them by 14.5%-27.1%, 31.5%-43.4%, and 22.4%-33.6%, respectively, when compared with non-amended soils. The decrease in CH4 emissions was largely due to the decrease in CH4 production and the increase in CH4 oxidation in the biochar application treatments. Biochar single and reapplication significantly decreased yield-scaled GHGs by an average of 31.5% and yield-scaled N-oxides by an average of 41.0%. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of biochar in decreasing yield-scaled GHGs and yield-scaled N-oxides did not increase with the biochar reapplication at the two different application rates. Both single and reapplied biochar appeared to be promising practices to mitigate GHG and N-oxide emissions from the rice-wheat rotation system. Biochar can be repeatedly applied for further carbon sequestration while not hindering improvements in crop yield or mitigation of other GHGs and N-oxides.",Not About Sufficiency
Features and drivers of China's urban-rural household electricity consumption: Evidence from residential survey,"China's rapid urbanization has resulted in increasing household electricity consumption (HEC). However, significant urban-rural disparity exists due to different consumption behaviors and income levels. Thus, it is crucial to uncover the key drivers of HEC so that appropriate policies can be raised to facilitate the achievement of China's carbon neutrality targets. This study aims to uncover the heterogeneity of urban-rural HEC by accounting electricity consumption from six household services. Then, multiple regression models, containing both household internal and external factors, are established to investigate the drivers of urban-rural HEC based on the data from Chinese General Social Survey in 2015 and 2018. The results present that urban HEC is higher than rural HEC at both aggregate and single service levels. Household appliances are major positive drivers of urban-rural HEC. Household size and home life time also promote HEC, and their positive effects on urban households are higher. Non-electric energy has different substitution effects on urban-rural HEC. Pipeline gas and liquefied petroleum gas are major alternative energy sources for urban HEC. Coal and biomass usage can reduce rural HEC. Time-of-use electricity pricing restricts urban-rural HEC under different services. Publicity slightly facilitates urban household electricity conservation. Finally, policy recommendations, including electricity-saving appliances and technological promotion, economic instruments, and capacity building, are proposed to facilitate clean and efficient HEC. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Challenges in trade-off governance of ecosystem services: Evidence from the Loess Plateau in China,"Trade-offs of ecosystem services (ESs) are valuable for decision-making when integrating growth, the achievement of human well-being, and the maintenance of ecosystem functions. Incorporating trade-offs of ESs into land-use decisions has become a major challenge for regional environmental governance, and a deeper understanding of the complex interaction patterns between ESs is a prerequisite for achieving sustainable management of social and ecological systems. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics and trade-off changes in eight ESs on the Loess Plateau during 2000-2015 using multi-source data and integrated explicit assessment methods, with the following results: 1) Grain production was widely distributed, raw material provision and net primary productivity (NPP) showed northwest to southeast stepwise growth, carbon sequestration and soil conservation were concentrated in high vegetation coverage areas in the southeast, oxygen production was similarly distributed to raw material provision, and recreational and cultural services were centered in urbanized areas. 2) There were significant synergies among raw material provision, oxygen production and NPP, with trade-offs existing mainly between water conservation and NPP, oxygen production, and raw material provision, all of which had consistently increasing correlation coefficients. 3) The number of trade-off service pairs increased, and the intensity of trade-offs strengthened where the pairs between grain production and oxygen production, recreation, and NPP changed from synergy to trade-off. It is recommended that the long-term impacts of urban land expansion, slope afforestation, and climatic factors such as precipitation and temperature on water conservation and other services be assessed in an integrated manner in ecosystem management and that appropriate, scientific response strategies be developed. This study provides theoretical and decision-making references for regulating the complex trade-offs of ESs in ecologically fragile regions worldwide.",Not About Sufficiency
Biodiverse coffee plantations provide co-benefits without compromising yield,"Introduction: Coffee is a ubiquitous global commodity that is cultivated with a wide range of practices, each with different, yet poorly understood trade-offs between management intensity, yield, and biodiversity. For example, monocultures prioritise coffee production, but do not necessarily deliver the highest coffee yields, nor the greatest profits. Understanding these trade-offs is key to informing sustainable coffee production. Methods: We synthesized the literature on these relationships, finding that agroforestry farming systems support greater biodiversity while often producing coffee yields that are comparable to monoculture systems. Results: Over half of studies (57%) failed to detect a trade-off between yield and biodiversity in agroforestry systems. Of the 16 cases that investigated pollinators and yield, 85% showed a positive relationship. Farm proximity to natural forests also improved both biodiversity outcomes and coffee yields. Conclusion: Studies in our data set revealed that agroforestry systems can deliver additional ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and pest control, with economic benefits accrued through income diversification and improvements to coffee bean quality. Our results illustrate how agroforestry systems within the coffee sector can return positive socio-ecological outcomes. © 2024 The Author(s).

Testing the ecosystem service cascade framework for Atlantic salmon,"Aligning nature protection with human well-being for the UN Sustainable Development Goals implies that conservation monitoring should indicate the sustainability of ecosystem services (ES). Here we test the value of the ES cascade framework using national, multi-decadal data for an iconic freshwater fish, the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. For the first time, we assemble all long-term monitoring data for England and Wales along the ES cascade for this species from resource to benefit: juvenile density to measure the biological resource, returning adult numbers to measure potential ES use, and rod catches and angling effort as measures of actual ES use. We aimed to understand how the ES cascade framework reconciled conservation with ES sustainability targets. Only some linkages along the ES cascade could be evidenced: in catchments where juveniles declined, rod catches also generally decreased, but angling effort declined everywhere irrespective of the biological resource trends. We suggest that i) programmes focused on juvenile monitoring provide an early-warning system for ES provision as well as nature conservation, ii) the ES cascade framework can reconcile nature conservation and ES sustainability if monitoring efforts link biological resources fully to the ES, and ES monitoring explicitly relates biological resources to human use.",Not About Sufficiency
Land restoration in food security programmes: synergies with climate change mitigation,"Food-insecure households in many countries depend on international aid to alleviate acute shocks and chronic shortages. Some food security programmes (including Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program-PSNP - which provides a case study for this article) have integrated aid in exchange for labour on public works to reduce long-term dependence by investing in the productive capacity and resilience of communities. Using this approach, Ethiopia has embarked upon an ambitious national programme of land restoration and sustainable land management. Although the intent was to reduce poverty, here we show that an unintended co-benefit is the climate-change mitigation from reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increased landscape carbon stocks. The article first shows that the total reduction in net GHG emissions from PSNP's land management at the national scale is estimated at 3.4 millionMgCO(2)ey(-1) - approximately 1.5% of the emissions reductions in Ethiopia's Nationally Determined Contribution for the Paris Agreement. The article then explores some of the opportunities and constraints to scaling up of this impact.Key policy insights Food security programmes (FSPs) can contribute to climate change mitigation by creating a vehicle for investment in land and ecosystem restoration.Maximizing mitigation, while enhancing but not compromising food security, requires that climate projections, and mitigation and adaptation responses should be mainstreamed into planning and implementation of FSPs at all levels.Cross-cutting oversight is required to integrate land restoration, climate policy, food security and disaster risk management into a coherent policy framework.Institutional barriers to optimal implementation should be addressed, such as incentive mechanisms that reward effort rather than results, and lack of centralized monitoring and evaluation of impacts on the physical environment.Project implementation can often be improved by adopting best management practices, such as using productive living livestock barriers where possible, and increasing the integration of agroforestry and non-timber forest products into landscape regeneration.",Not About Sufficiency
Meeting global land restoration and protection targets: What would the world look like in 2050?,"Land restoration has received increased attention recently as a tool to counteract negative externalities of unsustainable land management on human well-being. This is reflected in targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Framework of the Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). However, the implications of these targets for land use, especially considering their potential conflict with growing food production demands, are largely unexplored. We study the potential and aggregated consequences of meeting these targets on land cover and land system change. We do so by analyzing targets originating from these global commitments towards land restoration and protection and implement them in a global land system change model. We compare this Restoration and Protection scenario with simulation results of two plausible pathways of socio-economic development in the absence of these targets, following the Shared Socio-Economic Pathway (SSP) storylines. We find that meeting global land restoration and protection targets would increase global tree cover by 4 million Km(2), increasing forest carbon stocks by 50 Gt and protecting 28% of the terrestrial area with the highest value of both biodiversity and carbon storage. Gains in tree cover and natural land systems would cause a contraction of crop, pasture- and bare land. This results in further cropland intensification and the expansion of land systems that are combining land use demands in mosaics of forest and agriculture. Without these targets, land system architecture tends to become more specialized, while many carbon and biodiversity hotspots, such as in the Americas, India, and Indonesia would be lost. Grassland-agriculture mosaics were threatened by land use change under all scenarios, requiring greater consideration in research and environmental policy. Our results emphasize the need for targeted land management in line with the analyzed policy targets if global restoration and protection targets are to be achieved.",Not About Sufficiency
Importance of soil fertility for climate-resilient cropping systems: The farmer's perspective,"Healthy and productive agricultural soils are the basis for global food security as they are a prerequisite for yield-stable cropping systems under climate change. Despite the expansion of agricultural research activities in this area through field experiments, lab analyses, and modelling frameworks, current empirical insights from farming practice on a more national scale are still rare. For this reason, the agronomic importance of soil fertility for farming practice was the focus of this nationwide empirical study conducted in Germany (winter/spring 2022) with a total sample size of 585. The views and needs of 370 farmers and 215 agricultural institutionalists were evaluated, i.a., regarding the importance of soil fertility and related soil properties, as well as preferred agronomic management strategies and needs for the promotion of soil fertility. The results showed that most farmers and institutionalists consider soil fertility to be very important. Moreover, it was emphasized that the importance of this factor will increase in the future due to changing climatic conditions (e.g., heat/drought stress) and the need for more sustainable land use including the protection of biodiversity. The main motivations for agronomic investments in greater soil fertility were improving the climate resilience and yield stability of cropping systems. In this context, the top soil properties of interest were ranked by the respondents as follows: (1) water storage capacity, (2) rootability, (3) biological activity, and (4) water infiltration rate. To promote soil fertility, farmers mainly considered catch cropping, diversified crop rotations with a positive humus balance, and year-round ground plant cover/mulch as the most useful agronomic measures. In terms of methods for the assessment of soil fertility, soil structure analyses, biological indicators, yield/biomass production, soil nutrient analyses, and field methods were most important, whereas sensor systems and apps/digital tools were of minor importance. For the future improvement of soil fertility promotion in farming practice, simple indicators and reference values for assessing soil fertility as well as 'workshops, field days, and field schools' for training aspects were suggested by the participants. Overall, there were few differences between the perceptions of farmers and agricultural institutionalists. Both groups pointed out the need for improved communication between politics, science, and practice such that agriculture can respond more quickly to changing climatic conditions in the future. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
A social–ecological perspective on harmonizing food security and biodiversity conservation,"The major challenges of improving food security and biodiversity conservation are intricately linked. To date, the intersection of food security and biodiversity conservation has been viewed primarily through an agricultural “production lens”—for example, via the land sparing/sharing framework, or the concept of sustainable intensification. However, a productionist perspective has been criticized for being too narrow, and failing to consider other relevant factors, including policy, equity, and diversity. We propose an approach that conceptualizes rural landscapes as social–ecological systems embedded within intersecting multi-scalar processes. Based on such a framing, empirical research can be more clearly set in the context of system properties that may influence food security, biodiversity conservation, or both. We illustrate our approach through a description of contrasting agricultural systems within Brazil’s Cerrado region. We emphasize the need for new empirical research involving systematic comparisons of social–ecological system properties in landscapes threatened by food insecurity and ecosystem degradation. © 2016, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

"Mangrove status, its ecosystem, and climate change in Myanmar: A study in Ayeyarwaddy Delta Coastal Zone","Myanmar is a country belonging mangrove and its ecosystem, a unique vegetative species with a high ecosystem services: much higher carbon sequestration than terrestrial forests and climate change induced disaster defence power to community and biodiversity. The degree of its ecosystem services depends on their biological and physical system status. Alternatively, it is one of the most fragile ecosystems and vulnerable to disturbances including climate change. 80 % of the Ayeyarwaddy mangroves was seriously damage by the cyclone Nargis (2008). The study was conducted in Ayeyarwaddy Delta Coastal Zone by adopting transect survey, climate data analysis and reviewing scientific papers and policy documents with two main objectives: understanding climate change, awareness raising on ecosystem and local livelihood status, and enhancing mangrove ecosystem conservation and protection in terms of technology and policy. To recover the mangrove back it took for eight years minimum. Mangrove tree species number is decreasing from 45 to 30 in 37 years. Salinity variation is driving habitat of aquatic fauna species and local livelihoods. Myanmar climate change policy, National Environmental Policy, and Forest Policy become powerful tools to achieve the Nation's sustainable development goal in the context of addressing climate change and the ecosystem protection through institution and technology enhancement. Ecosystem conservation is suggested to minimize not only to minimize climate change impacts but also to improve sustainability of the local community and the ecosystem. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Land-use strategies to balance livestock production, biodiversity conservation and carbon storage in Yucatan, Mexico","Balancing the production of food, particularly meat, with preserving biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem services is a major societal challenge. Research into the contrasting strategies of land sparing and land sharing has suggested that land sparingcombining high-yield agriculture with the protection or restoration of natural habitats on nonfarmed landwill have lower environmental impacts than other strategies. Ecosystems with long histories of habitat disturbance, however, could be resilient to low-yield agriculture and thus fare better under land sharing. Using a wider suite of species (birds, dung beetles and trees) and a wider range of livestock-production systems than previous studies, we investigated the probable impacts of different land-use strategies on biodiversity and aboveground carbon stocks in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexicoa region with a long history of habitat disturbance. By modelling the production of multiple products from interdependent land uses, we found that land sparing would allow larger estimated populations of most species and larger carbon stocks to persist than would land sharing or any intermediate strategy. This result held across all agricultural production targets despite the history of disturbance and despite species richness in low- and medium-yielding agriculture being not much lower than that in natural habitats. This highlights the importance, in evaluating the biodiversity impacts of land use, of measuring population densities of individual species, rather than simple species richness. The benefits of land sparing for both biodiversity and carbon storage suggest that safeguarding natural habitats for biodiversity protection and carbon storage alongside promoting areas of high-yield cattle production would be desirable. However, delivering such landscapes will probably require the explicit linkage of livestock yield increases with habitat protection or restoration, as well as a deeper understanding of the long-term sustainability of yields, and research into how other societal outcomes vary across land-use strategies.",Not About Sufficiency
Meeting the climate change challenge: Pressing issues in southern China and SE Asian coastal ecosystems,"The coastlines of southern China and SE Asia represent some of the most anthropogenically impacted ecosystems in the world, yet they support a rich biodiversity and provide important ecosystem services, including being the source of the vast majority of the world's aquaculture production. The challenges faced by coastal ecosystems in this region are exacerbated by the rapid impacts of climate change, which is occurring at a faster pace than in many other parts of the globe. Of the many possible threats, this paper discusses three main areas of concern: loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; habitat loss and shoreline development; and food security and aquaculture; all of which are significant for the southern China and SE Asia region. Whilst a number of impacts within these areas have been anticipated, accurate predictions of future effects are difficult due to a lack of adequate baseline data on environmental conditions, species distribution patterns and physiological vulnerabilities. There is thus a critical need to develop and maintain cross-national boundary databases to address these knowledge-gaps. It is clear, however, that despite incomplete data, proactive management strategies are needed to counter ongoing economic and food security threats. Whilst acknowledging these impacts, and drawing from experiences learned in other countries is a reasonable approach, this must occur in tandem with the development of region-specific studies and collaborations. Clearly this presents a major challenge, and requires a variety of interdisciplinary responses, from both scientists and managers. Given the combined pace of anthropogenic modification, exploitation and climate change, we must move quickly if we are to create effective and timely strategies based on best-available science to document, conserve and manage the region's coastal ecosystems.

After Copenhagen: New strategy for the realization of the 2° max-climate goal,"For Germany and the European Union to succeed with their global climate protection objectives, the development and implementation of a more effective and more just climate protection strategy is required. A mere continuation of the current international climate regime with its lack of coherence and effectiveness is associated with important long-term risks for nature and humankind. In a best-case scenario, emissions reduction efforts in line with the non-binding pledges made during the Copenhagen negotiations would still lead to an average global mean temperature increase of around 3.5°C. This in turn would be well beyond the globally accepted 2°C guard rail to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. What is required therefore is a new approach that overcomes the limitations of the existing framework while taking into account the diverging negotiation positions of countries around the globe. The 2°max climate strategy proposed in this paper is based on elements of the WBGU budget approach (2009; allocation of remaining carbon budgets to nation states according to fundamental principles of justice) and contains a number of specific mechanisms for implementation. The core elements are: • A fixed, global emissions limit compatible with the 2°C guard rail, beginning with a global emissions peak, stabilization phase and ensuing stepwise reduction • Allocation principle ""one human-one emissions right"": initial equal per capita allocation to enable active participation of developing countries with incentives for low carbon development and financial benefits through the sale of unused emissions allowances • A global price for carbon dioxide (CO2) by means of a global ""peak and trade"" emissions trading scheme targeting upstream carbon sources; as a result, a level playing field for CO2 emissions is established worldwide with widespread incentives for low carbon development • Integrated support and redistribution mechanisms to advance sustainable development and elimination of poverty while at the same time avoiding an over-burdening of industrialized countries and the world economy as a whole • Enhancing chances for acceptance of all (groups of) states by taking their economic and socio-cultural interests into account The failure of the Copenhagen negotiations can also be an opportunity to refocus efforts on the development of a global climate protection system that can deliver. Convincing new concepts are needed to reinvigorate the international negotiation process.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying key needs for the integration of social–ecological outcomes in arctic wildlife monitoring,"For effective monitoring in social–ecological systems to meet needs for biodiversity, science, and humans, desired outcomes must be clearly defined and routes from direct to derived outcomes understood. The Arctic is undergoing rapid climatic, ecological, social, and economic changes and requires effective wildlife monitoring to meet diverse stakeholder needs. To identify stakeholder priorities concerning desired outcomes of arctic wildlife monitoring, we conducted in-depth interviews with 29 arctic scientists, policy and decision makers, and representatives of indigenous organizations and nongovernmental organizations. Using qualitative content analysis, we identified and defined desired outcomes and documented links between outcomes. Using network analysis, we investigated the structure of perceived links between desired outcomes. We identified 18 desired outcomes from monitoring and classified them as either driven by monitoring information, monitoring process, or a combination of both. Highly cited outcomes were make decisions, conserve, detect change, disseminate, and secure food. These reflect key foci of arctic monitoring. Infrequently cited outcomes (e.g., govern) were emerging themes. Three modules comprised our outcome network. The modularity highlighted the low strength of perceived links between outcomes that were primarily information driven or more derived (e.g., detect change, make decisions, conserve, or secure food) and outcomes that were primarily process driven or more derived (e.g., cooperate, learn, educate). The outcomes expand monitoring community and disseminate created connections between these modules. Key desired outcomes are widely applicable to social–ecological systems within and outside the Arctic, particularly those with wildlife subsistence economies. Attributes and motivations associated with outcomes can guide development of integrated monitoring goals for biodiversity conservation and human needs. Our results demonstrated the disconnect between information- and process-driven goals and how expansion of the monitoring community and improved integration of monitoring stakeholders will help connect information- and process-derived outcomes for effective ecosystem stewardship. © 2018 Society for Conservation Biology",Not About Sufficiency

A penny saved is a penny earned: Exploring the synergistic effect between carbon trading and energy carbon-content tax,"Currently, numerous studies are being conducted on various carbon reduction policies, but their synergies have been poorly investigated. This paper examines the synergistic effect of combining emissions trading schemes (ETS) and energy carbon-content taxes (ECT), using China as a case study. A computable general equilibrium model is used to identify the synergistic effect of these two carbon mitigation policies. The results show that the synergistic effect helps to reduce GDP loss by approximately 5.44 billion CNY, which accounts for 2.83% of the overall GDP losses caused by ETS and ECT. Additionally, the synergistic effect reduces an additional 5.25 million tons of CO2 emissions and decreases the negative impact on social welfare resulting from the two policies. Although these achievements are commendable, there are costs associated with this synergy. The effect on energy security presents mixed results and leads to increased carbon leakage. Therefore, policymakers should take heed of the potential “cocktail effects” that may arise in their pursuit of carbon neutrality. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Equity in ecosystem restoration,"The importance of equity has been emphasized in climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and ecosystem restoration. However, equity implications are rarely considered explicitly in restoration projects. Although the role of equity has been studied in the context of biodiversity conservation and environmental governance, environmental variables are often ignored in equity studies, and spatial analyses of equity are lacking. To address these gaps, we use a mixed methods approach, integrating spatially explicit ecological and social data to evaluate, through an equity lens, a restoration project in a semi-arid rangeland socioecological system in Kenya. We use questionnaires and semi-structured key informant interviews to explore four dimensions of equity: distributional, procedural, recognitional, and contextual. Our results show that restoration employment and distance to the restoration site strongly influence perceived distributional and procedural equity. Employment and distance to restoration site can interact in counterintuitive ways in their influence on aspects of perceived equity, in this case, the fairness of site selection. Our findings exemplify that equity dimensions are intimately linked, and trade-offs can occur between equity dimensions, across socio-temporal scales, and in choosing the ethical framework to apply. Our work demonstrates how restoration is influenced by different dimensions of equity and we opine that incorporating equity in project planning and implementation processes can improve restoration outcomes. We emphasize the importance of respecting plurality in the values systems and ethical frameworks that underlie what is considered equitable, while negotiating trade-offs between diverse ethical positions in the design and implementation of ecosystem restoration projects. © 2021 The Authors.

A Multi-Scenario Prediction and Spatiotemporal Analysis of the Land Use and Carbon Storage Response in Shaanxi,"The role of carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems is crucial for achieving carbon neutrality. This study primarily focuses on examining the carbon storage in Shaanxi Province under different land-use scenarios. This study employed the LP-PLUS-InVEST model to explore the characteristics and spatial and temporal changes in carbon storage across four scenarios (business-as-usual (BUS), ecological protection (EPS), water-energy-food (WEF), and rural revitalization (RRS)) in Shaanxi Province. The results show that from 2000 to 2020, the carbon storage in Shaanxi Province is on a decreasing trend mainly due to the large occupation of ecological land by economic development. EPS has the largest increase in carbon storage under the four scenarios in 2030 and 2060. On the contrary, BUS has a rapid expansion of construction land, which leads to a gradual decreasing trend in carbon storage. WEF has a gradual increasing trend in carbon storage, while RRS has a trend of increasing and then slowly decreasing carbon storage. The spatial distribution trends of carbon storage in all scenarios were similar; high-carbon-reserve areas were mainly distributed in southern and central Shaanxi, which has a better ecological environment and less construction land, while low-value areas were distributed in the Central Shaanxi Plain, which has high land-use intensity. In terms of the stability of carbon reserves, the stable areas are predominantly concentrated in the Qinling Mountains, while the unstable areas are concentrated in the plain urban areas. Specifically, returning cultivated land to forest and grassland is an important initiative to promote the increase in carbon storage in Shaanxi Province. The decrease in carbon storage is mainly affected by strong urban expansion. Our study optimizes the land-use pattern according to the development needs of Shaanxi Province, and promotes the integrated development of ecological protection, food security, and economic development.

Dual carbon goals and the impact on future agricultural development in China: a general equilibrium analysis,"Purpose: This paper aims to explore the future path of agricultural development in China toward 2060 under the dual carbon goals, so as to inform better policy choices for facilitating agricultural and rural transformation toward the goal of maintaining food security, sustainable income growth and low carbon emission. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a single-country, multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium model, CHINAGEM model and develops eight illustrative scenarios to simulate the impacts of attaining dual carbon goals on agricultural development in China. Additional two scenarios have also been designed to inform better policy making with the aim to offset the negative impact of the decarbonization schemes through facilitating agricultural technology progress. Findings: Dual carbon goals are projected to impose substantial negative impact on agricultural productions and consumptions in China in the coming four decades. Under the assumption of business as usual, agricultural production will reduce by 0.49–8.94% along with the attainment of carbon neutrality goal by 2060, with the production of cereals and high-value being more severely damaged. To mitigate the adverse impact of the decarbonization schemes, it is believed that fastening technology progress in agriculture is one of the most efficient ways for maintaining domestic food security without harming the dual carbon goals. In particular, if agricultural productivity (particularly, for cereals and high-value products) can be increased by another 1% per year, the production losses caused by carbon emission mitigation will be fully offset. This implies that promoting technology progress is still the best way to facilitate agricultural development and rural transformation in future China. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature in better informing the impact of dual carbon goals on China's agriculture and the effectiveness of technology progress in agriculture on buffering the adverse impact of the decarbonization schemes and promoting agricultural development. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Recent advances in energy demand for residential space heating,"Energy consumption for residential space heating has experienced a dramatic increase, driven by continuous income growth and demand for thermal comfort. Technology innovation, demand-side management, and system transition have been promoted to meet these needs while reducing negative impacts on the environment and public health. This special issue on “Energy Demand for Residential Space Heating: History and Outlook” improves our understanding of energy consumption for space heating. The purpose of this introductory article is to present research advances by summarizing recent literature as well as new findings and insights from this special issue. This research shows that heating energy systems show increasing disparity due to various local resources, building characteristics, climatic conditions, technology adoption, and economic status. Thus, more advanced algorithms and more detailed classification of these factors can more accurately measure and predict the energy demand for space heating. The goal of heating energy systems is to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions without sacrificing thermal comfort. Most research focuses on how technology innovation, demand-side management strategies, or public policies can help achieve this goal. Current findings suggest that a comprehensive evaluation, considering technological feasibility, economic affordability, and environmental sustainability, is needed to promote the sustainable transition of heating energy systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Representation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in East Africa's protected area network,"The dramatic increase in anthropogenic activity severely threatens the biodiversity and life-support services that underpin human well-being. The broadened focus of protecting ecosystem services (ESs) better aligns the interests of people and biodiversity conservation. In this study, we used species richness as a surrogate for biodiversity and mapped the key ESs in East Africa with the goal to assess the spatial congruence between biodiversity and ESs, and evaluate the representation of current protected areas (PAs) network for biodiversity and ESs. The results showed that PAs well represented for species richness and regulating services but underrepresented for provisioning services. The PAs network occupies 10.96% of East Africa's land surface, and captures 20.62-26.37% of conservation priorities for vertebrate and plant species. It encompasses more than 16.23% of priority areas for three regulating services, but only 6.17% and 5.22% for crop and livestock production, respectively. Strong correlations and high overlaps exist between species richness and regulating services, particularly for carbon storage, water yield and plants. Thus, we believe that actions taken to conserve biodiversity also will protect certain ESs, which in turn will create new incentives and funding sources for the conservation of biodiversity. Overall, our results have wide-ranging policy implications and can be used to optimize conservation strategies for both biodiversity and multiple ESs in East Africa.",Not About Sufficiency
"Linking ecosystem services supply, social demand and human well-being in a typical mountain-oasis-desert area, Xinjiang, China","Identifying the links among ecosystem services (ES) supply, social demand and human well-being is important to realize sustainability, especially in mountain-oasis-desert (MOD) areas, which are facing an intense conflict between socioeconomic development and ecological conservation. Using a biophysical model, we mapped six ES in the Manas River Basin, which is a typical MOD area. A questionnaire survey was employed to evaluate social demand for ES and human well-being in four different regional units (i.e., high mountain, low hills, oasis and desert) in our site. Spider diagrams were applied to identify the links among ES supply, social demand and human well-being. The results showed that a high supply of provisioning services occurred in the oasis, while a high supply of regulating services existed in the high mountain region. The ES social demand was not completely accordant with the biophysical supply in spatial distribution, and the factors from the supply side and demand side could both cause ES supply-demand mismatches. The total well-being level of all indicators was higher in the oasis and desert than in the upstream areas (i.e., the high mountain region and low hills region), but some indicators (e.g., water consumption) were the inverse. The supply-demand mismatches in provisioning services had a strong impact on human well-being, while the supply-demand mismatches in regulating services had a low impact on human well-being. This can be explained by the ES social demand questionnaire results, which showed that the level of social importance was higher for provisioning services than for regulating services at our site. In accordance with our results, we recommended several policies to promote ecological conservation and improve human well-being in the Manas River Basin, and these policies could also be applied in other MOD areas.

Contribution of aquaculture to future food security: Economic analysis and development in Indonesia,"Aquaculture has developed into one of the key sectors in global fisheries, contributing greatly to food security around the world. Amidst a growing population and an increasing need for protein sources, aquaculture offers a real and sustainable solution. This study aims to analyze the contribution of aquaculture to food security in Indonesia, especially in the face of future challenges such as population growth, climate change, and limited natural resources. This research used a qualitative approach to explore and understand the contribution of aquaculture to food security in Indonesia, with a focus on economic analysis and development. A qualitative approach was chosen as it can provide deep insights into the experiences, views, and practices associated with aquaculture, as well as its impact on food security. In this complex context, a qualitative approach allows researchers to explore the meaning behind the data obtained, explain the relationships between variables, and understand the social, economic, and environmental factors that influence aquaculture development. The results show that aquaculture has significant potential in increasing the sustainable supply of animal protein and supporting food security, particularly through increased productivity, species diversification, and technology integration. However, challenges such as access to technology, capital, and environmental sustainability still need to be addressed. The managerial implications of these findings call for stronger policy support in terms of technology investment and training for aquaculture farmers, as well as the integration of sustainable aquaculture practices in national development plans to optimize the sector's role in supporting food security in the long term. In terms of managerial implications, these results indicate the importance of policy interventions that support investment in environmentally friendly technologies, human resource capacity building, and strengthening more efficient distribution networks. This research suggests that the government and private sector collaborate in creating an appropriate regulatory framework to support the development of sustainable aquaculture to meet future food security challenges. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of Climate Change on Ecosystem Services in the Northern Rockies,"Ecosystem services are increasingly valued on federal lands, beyond just their economic value. Climate change effects will vary greatly within different sub-regions of the Northern Rockies, with some ecosystem services being affected in the short term and others in the long term. Of the many ecosystem services provided in the Northern Rockies, eight are considered here, including annual water yield, water quality, wood products, minerals and mineral extraction, forage for livestock, viewsheds and air quality, regulation of soil erosion, and carbon sequestration. Although annual water yield is not expected to change significantly, timing of water availability will likely shift, and summer flows may decline. These changes may result in some communities experiencing summer water shortages, although reservoir storage can provide some capacity. Rural agricultural communities will be disproportionately affected by climate change if water does become limiting. Water quality will also decrease in some locations if wildfires and floods increase, adding sediment to rivers and reservoirs. Hazardous fuel treatments, riparian restoration, and upgrading of hydrologic infrastructure can build resilience to disturbances that damage water quality. Forage for livestock is expected to increase in productive grasslands as a result of a longer growing season and in some cases elevated carbon dioxide. Therefore, ranching and grazing may benefit from climate change. Primary effects on grazing include loss of rural population, spread of nonnative grasses, and fragmentation of rangelands. Viewsheds and air quality will be negatively affected by increasing wildfires and longer pollen seasons. A growing percentage of the Northern Rockies population will be in demographic groups at risk for respiratory and other medical problems on days with poor air quality. Hazardous fuel treatments can help build resilience to disturbances that degrade air quality. Carbon sequestration will be increasingly difficult if wildfires, insect outbreaks, and perhaps plant disease increase as expected, especially in the western part of the Northern Rockies. At the same time, managing forests for carbon sequestration is likely to become more important in response to national policies on carbon emissions. Hazardous fuel treatments can help build resilience to disturbances that rapidly oxidize carbon and emit it to the atmosphere.",Not About Sufficiency
Pyrolyzed and unpyrolyzed residues enhance maize yield under varying rates of application and fertilization regimes,"Biochar is increasingly gaining popularity due to its extensive recommendation as a potential solution for addressing the concerns of food security and climate change in agroecosystems, with biochar application for increased carbon sequestration, enhanced soil fertility, improved soil health, and increased crop yield and quality. There have been multiple studies on crop yield utilizing various biochar types and application amounts; however, none have focused on the influence of diverse biochar types at various pyrolysis temperatures with different application amounts and the integration of fertilizer regimes in maize crops. Therefore, a two-year factorial field experiment was designed in a temperate Himalayan region of India (THRI) to evaluate the residual effect of different biochar on maize yield under different pyrolysis temperatures, various application rates and fertilizer regimes. The study included three factors viz. , amendment type (factor 1), rate of application (factor 2) and fertilizer regime (factor 3). Amendment type included 7 treatments: No biochar- control (A1), apple biochar @ 400 degrees C pyrolysis temperature (A2), apple biochar @ 600 degrees C pyrolysis temperature (A3), apple residue biomass (A4), dal weed biochar @ 400 degrees C pyrolysis temperature (A5), dal weed biochar @ 600 degrees C pyrolysis temperatures (A6), and dal weed residue biomass (A7). The rate of application included 3 levels: Low (L- 1 t ha - 1 ), medium (M- 2 t ha - 1 ), and high (H- 3 t ha - 1 ). At the same time, the fertilizer regimes included 2 treatments: No fertilizer (N) and recommended dose of fertilizer (F). The results revealed that among the various amendment type, rate of application and fertilizer regimes, the A3 amendment, H rate of application and F fertilizer regime gave the best maize growth and productivity outcome. Results revealed that among the different pyrolyzed residues used, the A3 amendment had the highest plant height (293.87 cm), most kernels cob - 1 (535.75), highest soil plant analysis development (SPAD) value (58.10), greatest cob length (27.36 cm), maximum cob girth (18.18 cm), highest grain cob yield (1.40 Mg ha - 1 ), highest grain yield (4.78 Mg ha - 1 ), higher test weight (305.42 gm), and highest stover yield (2.50 Mg ha - 1 ). The maximum dry weight in maize and the number of cobs plant - 1 were recorded with amendments A4 (14.11 Mg ha - 1 ) and A6 (1.77), respectively. The comparatively 2 nd year of biochar application than the 1 st year, the H level of the rate of application than the L rate and the application and integration of the recommended dose of fertilizer in maize results in significantly higher values of growth and productivity in maize. Overall, these findings suggest that the apple biochar @ 600 degrees C pyrolysis temperature (A3) at a high application rate with the addition of the recommended dose of fertilizer is the optimal biochar for enhancing the growth and productivity of maize in the THRI.",Not About Sufficiency
Grazing weakens the carbon sequestration capacity of dry temperate grassland ecosystems in Central Asia,"The impact of grazing on carbon (C) stocks in grasslands is significant and is influenced by grazing management practices and abiotic conditions, both of which are spatially heterogeneous. Here, we used highly-precision meteorological and grassland management data with an improved ecological model (Biome-BGCMuSo) to assess the effects of grazing on C dynamics in dry temperate grasslands in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Our findings indicate that grasslands in Xinjiang acted as a weak net C sink (0.45 kg C m- 2 ) between 1975 and 2020, mainly due to elevated CO2 concentrations. Mean annual gross primary productivity, net ecosystem production, soil organic carbon (SOC), and vegetation carbon (VegC) were 0.87 kg C m- 2 yr- 1 , 27.72 g C m- 2 yr- 1 , 9.14 kg C m- 2 , and 0.28 kg C m- 2 , respectively. Further investigation revealed that the increase in grazing intensity from 0.42 head ha- 1 to 0.73 head ha- 1 reduced the C sequestration capacity of grasslands from 0.53 kg C m- 2 to 0.45 kg C m- 2 over the study period under climate change. Most of this reduction resulted from SOC loss, which accounted for 78.07 % of total net C loss (42.46 Tg C in SOC and VegC combined). The magnitude of C loss was positively correlated with grazing intensity. However, environmental factors that promote productivity may mitigate the adverse effects of grazing. Therefore, strategies to protect grassland ecosystems are urgently needed and should extend beyond merely reducing grazing intensity to address the competing priorities of food security and atmospheric CO2 mitigation.",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of supply chain digitisation on sustainable development in global panel data. Does the energy efficiency matter?,"To deal with climatic changes and resource depletion, sustainable development has become a focal strategy in global discussion. Digitization in the supply chain sector is flourishing and its impact is not limited to one aspect of life but further extended to sustainable development. The present work estimates the role of supply chain digitization and energy efficiency in sustainable development. The study mainly explores different dimensions of sustainable development, for instance economic, social, and environmental aspects. The study uses produced capital as a measure of the economic aspect of sustainability, human capital as a social measure of sustainable development and emissions footprint, and natural capital as an environmental measure of sustainable development. The study investigates the empirical analysis of panel data of 146 economies from 1990 to 2023. The estimation has performed with the assistance of pooled OLS, the Driscoll and Kraay method, and rigorous Simultaneous Quantile Regression model. The findings indicate the constructive role of both supply chain digitization and energy efficiency in all aspects of sustainable development. The analysis highlighted the negative association between supply chain digitization and sustainable development in economic and social aspects. Whereas the correlation coefficient of +0.484 suggests the positive association between supply chain digitization and social measure of sustainable development. Furthermore, the analysis reports a more intense impact of supply chain digitization and energy efficiency on sustainable development in the highest quantiles. The research suggests to implement policies supporting sustainable supply chain practices such as carbon pricing, renewable energy targets and circular economic initiatives. Furthermore, promoting supply chain digitization and energy efficiency investments can, not only enhance social, economic and environmental sustainability but can foster global cooperation and knowledge sharing to develop standardized sustainable supply chain operations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
High-Resolution Mapping of Cropland Soil Organic Carbon in Northern China,"Mapping the high-precision spatiotemporal dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) in croplands is crucial for enhancing soil fertility and carbon sequestration and ensuring food security. We conducted field surveys and collected 1121 soil samples from cropland in Changzhi, northern China, in 2010 and 2020. Random Forest (RF) models combined with 19 environmental covariates were used to map the topsoil (0-20 cm) SOC in 2010 and 2020, and uncertainty maps were used to calculate the dynamic changes in cropland SOC between 2010 and 2020. Finally, RF and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were employed to explore the effects of climate, vegetation, topography, soil properties, and agricultural management on SOC variation in croplands. Compared to the prediction model using only natural variables (RF_C), the model incorporating agricultural management (RF_A) significantly improved the simulation accuracy of SOC. The coefficient of determination (R2) increased from 0.77 to 0.85, while the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) decreased from 1.74 to 1.53 g kg-1, and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was reduced from 1.10 to 0.94 g kg-1. The uncertainty in our predictions was low, with an average value of only 0.39-0.66 g kg-1. From 2010 to 2020, SOC in the Changzhi croplands exhibited an overall increasing trend, with an average increase of 1.57 g kg-1. Climate change, agricultural management, and soil properties strongly influence SOC variation. Mean annual precipitation (MAP), drainage condition (DC), and net primary productivity (NPP) were the primary drivers of SOC variability. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of agricultural management for predicting SOC in croplands. Overall, the study confirms that improved agricultural management has great potential to increase soil carbon stocks, which may contribute to sustainable agricultural development.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimal Incentives for Eco-Environment-Oriented Development of Disused Mines Based on Differential Games: Ecological Rehabilitation Compensation or Carbon Quota Exchange,"Ecological rehabilitation of disused mines can enhance terrestrial carbon sinks and sequestration, accelerating progress toward global carbon neutrality. A differential game model between government and firm players involved in such a rehabilitation project is developed in this study based on the Eco-environment-oriented Development (EOD) paradigm. The model examines decision-making dynamics under grandfathering and benchmarking rules. The effects of various government policies (e.g., ecological rehabilitation compensation, carbon quota exchange policies) on multiple factors (including investment levels in mine rehabilitation and greener industries, the size of ecological rehabilitation, the quality of greener industries, and the revenues of both sides) are investigated comprehensively. The findings reveal several insights, (1) To incentivize firms with high carbon emissions to participate in EOD projects for disused mines, the government must differentiate land appreciation income distribution ratios and tax rates for greener industries. (2) Extended concession periods could motivate firms to invest more in ecological rehabilitation and greener-industry development. (3) The benchmarking rule consistently yields optimal outcomes, regardless of whether the government implements an ecological rehabilitation compensation or a carbon quota exchange policy. (4) Setting a higher carbon quota exchange factor can lead to Pareto improvements in both environmental and economic outcomes for the ecological rehabilitation compensation policy.",Not About Sufficiency
Insights into the environmental–economic sustainability of rice production in China,"Rice plays dominant roles in ensuring food security and sustainable agricultural production. However, detailed assessments and clear insights remain lacking to address the conundrum on the sustainability of rice production. This study introduces an innovative methodological framework that integrates life cycle impact assessment based economic analysis, allowing for the comprehensive quantification of energy, carbon, and water footprints. This integrated approach not only elucidates the environmental and economic dimensions of rice production but also explores the interconnections within the energy-carbon-water footprint system, providing valuable insights into the sustainability of rice production in China. Results show that the rice production in China is displaying a certain trend of green development. However, rice production still exerts a considerable environmental impact, with methane emissions reaching 204 million tons of CO2 eq. In 2020, accounting for 17.93% of the national methane emissions. In terms of water footprint, the human health impact of producing 1 ton of rice in 2020 is 3.52 × 10−4 DALY/t, which represents 72.65% of the water footprint impact of grain production. Methane, carbon dioxide, chromium, and water are key substances contributing to this environmental degradation. The proportion of external costs has already exceeded that of internal costs in 2020, reaching 55.73%. The results of the spatiotemporal analysis combined with socioeconomic factors analysis indicate a significant coupling nexus in energy–carbon–water footprint, while socioeconomic policies (e.g., the reduction of labor inputs, the transformation of agricultural development models, and the promotion of mechanization) may be potential measures to promote the environmental–economic sustainability of rice production. Driven by this coupling nexus, we can propose specific optimization measures for the key categories identified. Utilizing biodiesel can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the alternating wetting and drying irrigation model is an important strategy to address water scarcity. This study offers valuable insights into the environmental and economic sustainability of rice production in China. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluation and analysis of carbon neutralization capacity in the Yangtze River Economic Belt: Based on time weighted-rough set and unascertained model,"The carbon neutralization process continues to be a significant concern in China, particularly in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. This study defines carbon neutrality and presents a regional capacity measurement index system that includes 12 indicators across four dimensions: production reduction, lifestyle reduction, ecological removal, and technological removal. To assess the relative and absolute levels of carbon neutrality capacity in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the study uses the time-weighted rough set theory and the uncertain measurement model. Additionally, the study also uses Kernel density estimation, Dagum Gini coefficient decomposition, and convergence analysis to examine the development differences in the relative capacity of carbon neutrality in the region. The findings indicate that from 2013 to 2021, the relative capacity of carbon neutrality in the Yangtze River Economic Belt exhibited an upward trend with fluctuations, and there were significant disparities in development between the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the region. However, these differences showed signs of convergence and a general convergence trend. Moreover, the production reduction and lifestyle reduction aspects in the Yangtze River Economic Belt region are currently at a moderate level, while there is still considerable room for improvement in terms of ecological reduction and technological reduction. Furthermore, there are obvious regional differences in the absolute carbon neutral capacity of the Yangtze River Economic Belt region: the upstream region of the Yangtze River Economic Belt is primarily driven by carbon emissions reduction, the middle reaches are driven by production reduction and the downstream region is driven by carbon removal. Consequently, it is crucial to consider the regional development characteristics of the Yangtze River Economic Belt and implement targeted strategies tailored to local conditions. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the complex trade-offs and synergies of global ecosystem services,"The trade-off and synergy relationship of ecosystem services is an important topic in the current assessment. The value of each service provided by the ecosystem is substantially affected by human activities, and conversely, its changes will also affect the relevant human decisions. Due to varying tradeoffs among ecosystem services and synergies between them that can either increase or decrease, it is difficult to optimize multiple ecosystem services simultaneously, making it a huge challenge for ecosystem management. This study firstly develops a global Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) accounting framework. It uses remote sensing data with a spatial resolution of 1 km to estimate the ecosystem services of forests, wetlands, grasslands, deserts, and farmlands in 179 major countries in 2018. The results show that the range of global GEP values is USD 112e197 trillion, with an average value of USD 155 trillion (the constant price), and the ratio of GEP to gross domestic product (GDP) is 1.85. The tradeoffs and the synergies among different ecosystem services in each continent and income group have been further explored. We found a correspondence between the income levels and the synergy among ecosystem services within each nation. Among specific ecosystem services, there are strong synergies between oxygen release, climate regulation, and carbon sequestration services. A trade-off relationship has been observed between flood regulation and other services, such as water conservation and soil retention services in low-income countries. The results will help clarify the roles and the feedback mechanisms between different stakeholders and provide a scientific basis for optimizing ecosystem management and implementing ecological compensation schemes to enhance human well-being.

Can carbon tax revenue recycling coordinate climate mitigation and energy poverty alleviation?,"Energy poverty is a key dimension of multidimensional poverty and a major challenge for climate action. This study examines how climate policies affect energy poverty, especially the role of carbon tax revenue recycling in coordinating climate mitigation and energy poverty alleviation. Using an integrated Climate-Economy-Energy Poverty (RICE-EP) model that incorporates inequality aspects of energy poverty, the study analyzes the effects of climate policies on household energy consumption. The study simulates various scenarios of climate actions and carbon tax revenue recycling and finds that: i) Carbon tax revenue recycling can simultaneously advance climate change mitigation and energy poverty reduction goals, it can promote climate mitigation and enhance equity by lowering the abatement costs borne by low-income populations; ii) However, the interactions between stringent climate targets and energy affordability are complex. Modeling suggests that even optimal revenue recycling fails to prevent exacerbated energy poverty among disadvantaged groups under ambitious 2 °C climate targets; iii) Analysis indicates that an emissions reduction rate approaching 43 %, enabled by a carbon tax calibrated to incentivize an equitable transition, could maximize alleviation of energy poverty by directing subsidy support to low-income groups. The study methodology and findings offer valuable, actionable insights into coordinating equitable climate and economic policies. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Characterization and environmental applications of soil biofilms: a review,"Despite the major influence of soils on climate change, carbon sequestration, pollution remediation, and food security, soil remains a largely unexplored media with an extreme complexity of microbes, minerals, and dead organic matter, most of them being actually poorly known. In particular, soil biofilms have recently attracted attention because they strongly influence biogeochemical reactions and processes. Here we review biofilms with focus on their behavior, proliferation, distribution, characterization methods, and applications. Characterization methods include optical, electron, scanning probe, and X-ray microscopy; metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, metabolomics; and tracking approaches. Applications comprise pollution remediation by metal immobilization or organics degradation; and methane oxidation, carbon dioxide reduction, and carbon sequestration. Advanced methods such as DNA-stable isotope probing and meta-omics have uncovered the multiple functions of soil biofilms and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Investigations have improved our understanding of inter- and intra-kingdom interactions, and of gene transfer. Extracellular materials such as polysaccharides enhance the transport of substances and electrons flow among microorganisms. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Analysis of the sustainability index for ecologically low-input integrated farming: A comprehensive assessment of environmental, economic, and social impact","A comprehensive sustainability index was designed in this study to evaluate the effectiveness and environmental impact of ecologically low-input integrated farming systems. By integrating diverse agricultural practices while minimizing reliance on external, non-renewable resources, this approach aims to enhance ecological harmony and sustainability. The index provides a multi-dimensional assessment, encompassing environmental, economic, and social aspects, to gauge the overall sustainability of these integrated farming practices. The procedure involved defining critical sustainability criteria across environmental, economic, and social dimensions, collecting relevant data on farming practices, and constructing a model to assess and score these practices. The index was validated through real-world applications and engaged with various stakeholders for insights and practical verification. Environmental data involves measuring soil nutrients (5 %), water usage (500 gallons/ acre), and biodiversity (30 species/acre) to assess the ecological impact of farming practices. Economic data focuses on recording crop yields, input costs, and market prices to evaluate the financial viability of these practices. Social data is collected through surveys on labor practices, job satisfaction, and community impact, providing insights into the social implications and acceptability of the farming methods. The data revealed that the farming system aligned well with sustainability benchmarks, exhibiting no deviation from optimal levels in soil nitrogen content and water usage. Strong profitability and input cost efficiency were observed in the economic dimension, with a net income per acre of $400/acre and an input cost efficiency of 50 %. In the social aspect, although reasonably scored, specific labor metrics and regional/industry standards were lacking for a comprehensive evaluation. Overall, the farming system demonstrated commendable sustainability practices, with an environmental score of 7.5/10, an economic score of 8/10, and a social score of 7/10, suggesting potential for further improvements, particularly in addressing social sustainability factors.",Not About Sufficiency
Enhanced open biomass burning detection: The BranTNet approach using UAV aerial imagery and deep learning for environmental protection and health preservation,"Open biomass burning (OBB) in agriculture presents a significant and well-documented challenge, posing severe consequences for both environmental and human health. OBB releases air pollutants that degrade air quality and contribute to climate change, leading to premature deaths in regions with high concentrations of open crop straw burning (OCSB) emissions. Although policies aimed at prohibiting OBB are in place, the efficacy of these regulations in mitigating OCSB emissions remains ambiguous. Consequently, early prevention and monitoring of open biomass combustion are imperative for environmental preservation. Traditional monitoring techniques, reliant on fixed-position cameras, are constrained by their location and monitoring intensity, making concealed fire recognition a complex problem. To address this limitation and monitor the human living environment more flexibly and accurately, we propose a new method to identify straw fires in UAV Aerial Image Using CNN Branch Reinforce Transformer which named BranTNet, enabling early detection and rapid response to crop straw fires. By integrating computer vision technology and deep learning algorithms, straw fires in UAV-acquired aerial survey images can be detected and categorized. In the realm of artificial intelligence algorithms, we skillfully merge convolution and attention mechanisms, harnessing the full potential of both methodologies. Moreover, we seamlessly incorporate transfer learning, skillfully unifying self-training convolution modules with pre-trained transformer modules. This strategic amalgamation not only minimizes time costs but also ensures optimal experimental outcomes. Regarding data, we meticulously collected a substantial number of authentic samples, ensuring the sufficiency of our experimental dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits exceptional accuracy and robustness in detecting and identifying straw fires in UAV aerial survey images. Our approach outperforms the use of convolution or attention mechanisms alone. By integrating this approach with drone technology, we unlock the potential for developing more versatile and precise monitoring solutions, expanding the application of drones to diverse domains. This progress contributes significantly to the early detection and prevention of crop straw fires, fundamentally reducing environmental pollution, curbing carbon emissions, and advancing the cause of carbon neutrality. This innovative technique for monitoring and preventing OBB holds substantial promise in mitigating the adverse effects of OBB on the environment and human health. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Does renewable energy consumption improve environmental efficiency in 121 countries? A matter of income inequality,"Renewable energy is a key component of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations, and is an important factor in facilitating the energy transition and carbon neutrality of countries. This study aims to examine the interaction between renewable energy consumption and carbon efficiency to achieve the goal of carbon reduction for environmental sustainability. This study measures the carbon efficiency globally and countries in each income group through the data envelopment analysis method. Then, this study empirically analyzes the impact of renewable energy consumption on carbon efficiency by controlling for heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence and generalized moments estimation. The results show that (1) carbon efficiency enhances with the increase of income level, and the global carbon efficiency improvement is mainly due to the change of technological progress. (2) There is a weak improvement in scale efficiency in LI and LMI, dragged down by the decline in pure technical efficiency, which is the opposite of countries at higher income levels. (3) Renewable energy consumption has a positive effect on the improvement of carbon efficiency at all income levels, and there is a two-way causal relationship between renewable energy consumption and carbon efficiency. The effect of renewable energy on carbon efficiency is most significant in countries with middle income levels. Policy makers in each country should promote the renewable energy development to achieve energy transition and reduce carbon emissions. In addition, this study emphasizes that countries should consider the interaction between the renewable energy consumption and income level in ensuring sustainable development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Impacts of climate change on the wetlands in the arid region of Northwestern China over the past 2 decades,"Climate change has caused inland wetlands shrinkage and exacerbated problems, such as sustainable development and ecological security, for years. These issues are mainly pronounced in the inland arid area. The ecological environment's deterioration is especially severe in the drylands of the interior. However, dryland wetland changes and their response to climate are poorly understood. This study uses the K-means algorithm in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to classify two typical dryland wetlands (Ebinur and Bosten Lakes) for rapidly and accurately detecting dryland wetland changes. Moreover, it explores the long-term spatial-temporal variation in wetland distribution. In addition, it investigates the response of various lakes to climate change in northern and southern Xinjiang using wavelet analysis. The study's results showed that K-means clustering in the GEE platform has a high classification accuracy (Kappa > 0.8) in wetland classification, making it a feasible approach. The terminal lake wetland types, represented by the Ebinur Lake, changed significantly between 2001 and 2021. In contrast, the inflow-outflow lake wetland types, represented by the Bosten Lake, perform more consistently. Significant spatial-temporal variation is observed at Ebinur Lake, with the lake gradually shrinking and trans-forming into a marsh, where the largest marsh proportion degrades into non-wetland during the year. Bosten Lake experienced frequent conversions between marsh and non-wetland throughout the year. Furthermore, the responses of various dryland lakes to climate change are consistent, and a low precedes precipitation and follows evapotranspiration. However, their sensitivity to climate response varies, with the terminal lake being most affected by climate change. Mastering the dynamic changes and climate response of dryland wetlands achieves the sustainable development goals of drylands, including carbon neutrality and peak carbon dioxide emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecological Function Service Value and Quantity of Fruit-tree Economic Forests in the Semi-arid Loess Hilly and Gully Region of Central Gansu—A Case Study of the Hulu River Basin,"The compensatory effect and deep impact of the fruit tree economic forest on water and soil conservation ecology in a semi-arid region are investigated by exploring the ecological service value and ecological functions of the fruit tree economic forest, and further by analyzing its functional effects on reducing water and soil loss, conserving water and soil, conserving the water source, improving environmental quality and maintaining biodiversity. This analysis provides a theoretical basis and support for coordinating the relationship between economic and social development, ecological protection, agriculture and forestry in the semi-arid area of the Loess Plateau; promoting the systematic management of mountain, water, forest, farmland, lake grass and sand; and promoting the ecological protection and high-quality development of the whole Hulu River Basin. According to the Standards for Evaluation of Forest Ecosystem Service Function (GB/T38582-2020), the forestry industry standard of the People’s Republic of China, the current market method, shadow price method, opportunity cost method, Swedish Carbon Tax law and other methods were adopted. The main functions of the fruit-tree economic forest ecosystem and its eco-economic value in the Hulu River Basin in Pingliang City were quantitatively analyzed, and the existing measured data from domestic ecological stations were combined with quantitative analysis and qualitative evaluation. The calculations included the ecological service values of the fruit tree economic forest ecosystem in water conservation, soil conservation, carbon sequestration, oxygen production, nutrient accumulation, environment purification and biodiversity protection, and the dynamic change characteristics of the ecological function quantity corresponding to its value were systematically analyzed. (1) In the four developmental stages of the fruiting economic forest in the Hulu River Basin in Pingliang City, the ecological function service value showed an increasing trend. Among the stages, the total value contribution of the first stage (2005–2009) is 1.299×1010 yuan; the second stage (2010–2013) is 2.497×1010 yuan; the third stage (2014–2017) is 2.662×1010 yuan; and total value contribution of the fourth stage (2018–2020) is 2.774×1010 yuan. (2) In the composition of the ecological functional service value of the fruit tree economic forest, the value of water conservation is the highest, accounting for the largest proportion at 32.97% of the total value of ecosystem services. Therefore, it plays an important role in regulating the hydrological balance of the basin in the arid and semi-arid region of the Loess Plateau. The function value of the purifying environment is relatively small, accounting for only 0.19% of the total value, followed by the function value of species conservation, accounting for 5.42%. In order of service value, the ecological function values of water conservation, oxygen release, carbon sequestration, nutrient accumulation, soil conservation, fertility maintenance, species conservation and environment purification accounted for 32.97%, 25.94%, 11.63%, 11.34%, 6.37%, 6.14%, 5.42% and 0.19% of the total value, respectively. The conclusions of this study are basically consistent with other domestic studies. Compared with the annual output value of fruit trees in the same period, the total value of ecological services was 2.42 times of the annual output value of the fruit. Therefore, the fruit tree economic forest not only provides a large amount of fresh fruit products and creates tremendous economic and social benefits for the people, but it also provides a major increase in ecological service value, and the contribution of local GEP is greater than that of GDP. (3) After accounting, the water conservation amount of the fruit tree economic forest (2005–2020) in the Hulu River Basin in Pingliang City was 2.586×109 m3, with 2.135×109 t of soil fixation, 2.264×105 t of fertilizer retention, 9.568×106 t of carbon fixation, 2.562×107 t of oxygen production, 9.278×105 t of nutrient accumulation, and 1.137×105 t of environmental purification function (and within that function, the amount of sulfur dioxide absorbed is 94656.02 t, the amount of fluoride absorbed is 1793.82 t, the amount of nitrogen oxide absorbed is 6406.50 t, and the amount of dust fall is 10794.95 t), and the amount of negative ions provided is 1.564×1025, which greatly regulates and improves the ecological environmental quality of the region. © 2023, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

Quantifying Carbon Sequestration Service Flow Associated with Human Activities Based on Network Model on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,"The flow of ecosystem services between regions as a result of the mismatch of supply and demand has increasingly become a new research focus. Clarifying the spatial regularity of ecosystem service flow is of great significance for realizing regional sustainable development and improving human well-being. This study applied a network model to map the interregional carbon flow based on the supply and demand of carbon sequestration service, and the driving effect of various driving factors was further analyzed. The results showed that the demand for carbon sequestration service on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau increased steadily from 2000 to 2019, resulting in an increasingly significant difference between supply and demand with more than 20 million tons. In the carbon sequestration service flow network, the number of defined deficit nodes increased to 22 in 2010, but decreased to 21 in 2019. The interrupted edges continued to increase to 16, and the network density dropped to 0.022. The carbon sequestration service flow network on the northeastern parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was severely damaged. With the high-quality development of animal husbandry, the impact of grazing intensity on the difference between the supply and demand of carbon sequestration service has been weakened. When urbanization reached a certain level, the driving effects of urbanization and agricultural activities increased significantly. The study provided a reference for the use of network models to analyze ecosystem service flow, and provided a theoretical basis and data support for local ecological management decisions.",Not About Sufficiency
Regionalization and classification of water eco-environment in Zhejiang Province based on ecosystem service,"Integrated water environmental management has been world widely treated as a fundamental means to support sustainable watershed development. Ecosystem Services (ESs), which refer to the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well-being and subsistence, are important factors for water quality maintenance and improvement. With increasing attention paid to the spatial management and control, ""zoning classification"" based on the ecosystem characteristics has become an important content of integrated watershed management. Based on the relationships between ecosystem characteristics and water quality, four ecological features including soil type, land usage, normalized vegetation index and population density were selected for aquatic ecoregion zoning using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Combining the spatial distribution of ecological features, catchments and administrative management units, Zhejiang Province was divided into ten aquatic ecoregions and 510 water environmental control units through cluster analysis and spatial overlap. The ES value of each unit was evaluated with the method of equivalent factor. The results showed that in 2015, the total ES value in Zhejiang Province reached 512.37 billion RMB, and those of individual units ranged from 5.98 to 13.65 billion RMB. Four ES bundles were obtained by K-means clustering method, and the service types and spatial distribution characteristics of the bundles were analyzed. Subsequently, the relationships between water quality and ecosystem services were analyzed for each unit. The results showed that Bundle I covered most of the mountain and hilly areas mainly located in the west and southwest, accounting for 52.68% of the province's total area, while Bundle II had the smallest area but a relatively high water occupation ratio, mainly covering the Qiandao Lake and the estuary of the Qiantang River. Bundle III was distributed relatively scattered, mostly in hilly and plain areas, while Bundle IV was primarily distributed in plain areas where cities and towns were located. The dominant ESs varied significantly in different ES bundles. For example, ESs such as raw material production, soil conservation, biodiversity protection, gas regulation, and climate regulation dominated in the Bundle 1, while the regulatory services were the dominant ESs in Bundle II, including gas regulation, water regulation and waste treatment. Food production contributed significantly to both Bundles III and IV. The results also indicated that the characteristics of water quality are closely related to the ecological service, i.e., the higher the ES value, the better the water quality. As a result, the units were classified into four types, including protection, maintenance, improvement and remediation according to the characteristics of the water quality of each ES bundle. The differentiated water quality control and improvement approaches were proposed for the units in the four types of ES bundle, to support the water eco-environment management of Zhejiang Province. © 2022 Science Press.

"Recycling of lithium iron phosphate batteries: Status, technologies, challenges, and prospects","The limited fossil fuel supply toward carbon neutrality has driven tremendous efforts to replace fuel vehicles by electric ones. The recycling of retired power batteries, a core energy supply component of electric vehicles (EVs), is necessary for developing a sustainable EV industry. Here, we comprehensively review the current status and technical challenges of recycling lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. The review focuses on: 1) environmental risks of LFP batteries, 2) cascade utilization, 3) separation of cathode material and aluminium foil, 4) lithium (Li) extraction technologies, and 5) regeneration and transformation of cathode materials. Detailed analyses are elaborated with case examples and technical challenges. Our critical analysis demonstrates that compared with retired lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM) batteries, LFP batteries do not contain the high-value elements such as Co and Ni, so the economic drive for LFP recycling is compromised although future market prospects are substantial. It is of great practical significance to develop low-carbon and cost-effective Li extraction technologies and regeneration processes for cathode materials to ensure a sustainable and stable development of the LFP battery and EV industry. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Based on the Issue-Actor-Mechanism Framework, this paper systematically evaluates the outcomes achieved at COP26 and analyzes the tendency of post-COP26 climate negotiations. Overall, with the concerted efforts of all parties, COP26 has achieved a balanced and inclusive package of outcomes and concluded six years of negotiations on the Paris Rulebook. It is fair to say that COP26 is another milestone in climate governance following the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile, the Glasgow Climate Pact has cemented the consensus on a global commitment to accelerating climate action over the next decade and reached a breakthrough consensus on reducing coal, controlling methane, and halting deforestation. In the post-COP26 era, we still need to take concrete actions to implement the outcomes of the Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Climate Pact, innovate ways to speed up CO2 emissions reduction, and continue to strive for breakthroughs in important issues such as finance, technology, adaptation, and collaboration. In addition to avoiding the escalation of international conflicts, we need to collectively and properly handle the relationship between energy security, carbon reduction, and development and facilitate the efforts of countries to achieve their Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including climate-related goals. China will continue to maintain the existing multilateral mechanisms and processes for climate governance, unremittingly take concrete actions to address climate change, promote a domestic comprehensive green transition and global cooperation on carbon neutrality, and contribute constructively to global climate governance. © 2022, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Potential ecosystem service values of mangrove forests in southeastern China using high-resolution satellite data,"Mangrove forests provide a large number of important ecological, economic, and social benefits. This study proposes a pixel-based method for estimating the spatial variability of mangrove ecosystem services (coastal protection, carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and heavy metal retention) in the Jiulong River Estuary using a combination of high-resolution satellite data with market price and replacement cost approaches. The results indicated that there was a considerable variability in the ecosystem service values caused by the distance of mangroves to the coast and the different growth phases of mangrove forests. The total estimated value of the four selected ecosystem services was US$ 287,993/year for 174.58 ha (approximately US$ 1650/ha/year). Coastal protection was estimated to provide the highest value (US$ 239,683/year), amounting to 83.23% of the total value of the ecosystem services, followed by nutrient retention (US$ 25,283/year), contributing 8.78% of the total value of the ecosystem services and accounting for up to 52.33% of the total value of regulating services. Heavy metals retention (US$ 10,289/year) and carbon sequestration (US$ 12,738 in 2015/year) had relatively low values in comparison to those of coastal protection and nutrient retention. However, there was an underestimation of mangrove ecosystem services because we did not consider other services, such as fisheries, biodiversity, recreation, education and tourism, mainly due to the lack of primary data. Nevertheless, the estimated economic value of mangrove ecosystem services in this area is meaningful to raise awareness of the benefits provided by mangroves to local communities and policy makers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
GIS-based integrated assessment and decision support system for land use planning in consideration of carbon sequestration benefits,"As the major eligible land use activities in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), afforestation and reforestation offer opportunities and potential economic benefits for developing countries to participate in carbon-trade in the potential international carbon (C) sink markets. However, the design and selection of appropriate afforestation and reforestation locations in CDM are complex processes which need integrated assessment (IA) of C sequestration (CS) potential, environmental effects, and socio-economic impacts. This paper promotes the consideration of CS benefits in local land use planning and presents a GIS-based integrated assessment and spatial decision support system (IA-SDSS) to support decision-making on 'where' and 'how' to afforest. It integrates an Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Model (InTEC) and a GIS platform for modeling regional long-term CS potential and assessment of geo-referenced land use criteria including CS consequence, and produces ranking of plantation schemes with different tree species using the Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. Three land use scenarios are investigated: (i) traditional land use planning criteria without C benefits, (ii) land use for CS with low C price, and (iii) land use for CS with high price.

"Protecting mud crabs from pollution by microplastics, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and heavy metals in mangroves","Mangroves are essential ecosystems for coastal protection, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and food production. In particular, mud crabs, with an annual global landing of over 100,000 metric tons, are crucial for the economic livelihoods and food security of millions of small-scale fishers in Southeast Asia. Here, we review the impact of pollutants on mud crab populations in mangrove ecosystems, with emphasis on pollutant sources, toxic effects on crabs, and remediation using microbes and biochar. Pollutants include microplastics, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals. Pollution originates from agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, mining activities, urbanization, and domestic waste. We present the use of biochar for pollutant remediation and enhancing carbon sequestration. We observe that heavy metals, pesticides, and microplastics induce oxidative stress, disrupt antioxidant defense mechanisms, and impair the growth, reproduction, and survival rates of mud crabs. Microbial bioremediation can remove more than 90% of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

"Governance and the mangrove commons: Advancing the cross-scale, nested framework for the global conservation and wise use of mangroves","Mangroves provide critical ecosystems services, contributing an estimated 42 billion US dollars to global fisheries, storing 25.5 million tons of carbon per year, and providing flood protection to over 15 million people annually. Yet, they are increasingly threatened by factors ranging from local resource exploitation to global climate change, with an estimated 35% of mangrove forests lost in the past two decades. These threats are difficult to manage due to the intrinsic characteristics of mangrove systems and their provisioning services, and their transboundary and pan-global nature. Due to their unique intertidal ecological niche, mangroves are often treated as a “common pool resource” within national legal frameworks, making them particularly susceptible to exploitation. Moreover, they form ecological connections through numerous biotic and abiotic processes that cross political boundaries. Because of these qualities a cross-scale nested framework of international, regional, and local coordination is necessary to successfully sustain mangrove ecosystems and their valuable services. Although coordination across the geopolitical spectrum is often cited as a need for effective management of common resources such as mangroves, there has been no formal analysis of mangrove multiscale governance. In this paper we address this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of interactions between and within international, regional, and local mangrove management regimes and examine the challenges and opportunities such multiscale governance frameworks present. We highlight Costa Rica as a case study to demonstrate the universal relevance and potential of multi-scale governance and explore its downscale potential. Using Elinor Ostrom's principles for self-governance of the commons as our touchstone, we identify where improvements to the status quo could be implemented to increase its effectiveness of the current frameworks to meet the ongoing challenge of managing mangrove-derived resources and services in the face of a changing climate and human needs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
What influences farmers to grow trees for climate change mitigation or adaptation?,"Trees play a vital role in combating climate change by sequestering carbon and helping farmers adapt to and become more resilient to future climatic changes. Understanding the factors influencing households' tree-planting decisions is essential for shaping policies and initiatives aimed at increasing on-farm tree cover, improving farmers' incomes, and achieving national climate and land restoration goals. This study explores the determinants of farmers' tree-growing decisions in Kiambu County, Kenya. Data was collected through interviews with 120 households and analyzed using descriptive statistics, Probit, and double-hurdle models to assess the factors driving tree planting and diversification aspirations. Results reveal that 97% of farmers grow trees for their products, while 26% do so for ecosystem services. A majority (93%) are aware of climate change, with 66% and 71% willing to plant more trees for climate mitigation and adaptation, respectively. Probit analysis shows that factors such as land ownership, dependency ratio, labor availability, number of farms, and the belief in trees' importance to households significantly (p <= 0.05) encourage tree planting. Furthermore, education, availability of land for tree planting, and food security influence the decision to diversify tree species. Perceived benefits, livestock ownership, and access to piped water positively affect future tree-planting efforts. However, a one-level increase in food insecurity reduces tree species diversification by 0.88. Farmers are primarily motivated to plant trees that provide direct product benefits. Therefore, strengthening education, land ownership policies, and food security measures is crucial for promoting sustainable tree-growing initiatives.",Not About Sufficiency
Seaweed: A Multifaceted Marvel Driving Global Sustainability and Environmental Health,"This article delves into the untapped potential of seaweed as a sustainable resource for the environment. Seaweed has been traditionally consumed as food by coastal communities and used as animal feed, but it also has applications in other industries. Seaweed can capture carbon and can also provide a habitat for fish species. Its benefits extend to health by reducing the use of antibiotics and boost the immune system. Several types of seaweed are often utilized in medications in their raw form. It is an important biorefinery feedstock it is used to produce a variety of materials like cosmetic products, polymeric substances (Protein, cellulose), agrifood, and food supplements with several health advantages. Seaweed has the best nutritional profile and higher polysaccharide content making it the best choice to use as a fuel resource. Seaweed farming is a simple eco-friendly approach to sustainable development and provides massive biomass for the production of food and related products in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and agro-industries. Seaweed production significantly contributes to catalyzing sustainable aquaculture by providing food to aquaculture species. All three types of red, brown, and green seaweeds have been extensively used in various wastewater treatment processes as they can store high concentrations of nitrogen in their tissues. Seaweed is an enriched source of bioactive compounds that affect the rumen microbiome, enhance rumen digestibility, and check the levels of CH4 production in livestock. Seaweeds also act as bioindicators and bioremediation of eutrophied areas. Ultimately, seaweed represents a renewable energy powerhouse, poised to redefine the landscape of sustainable resources. © (2024). All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Development of an in vivo sensor to monitor the effects of vapour pressure deficit (VPD) changes to improve water productivity in agriculture,"Environment, biodiversity and ecosystem services are essential to ensure food security and nutrition. Managing natural resources and mainstreaming biodiversity across agriculture sectors are keys towards a sustainable agriculture focused on resource efficiency. Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) is considered the main driving force of water movements in the plant vascular system, however the tools available to monitor this parameter are usually based on environmental monitoring. The driving motif of this paper is the development of an in-vivo sensor to monitor the effects of VPD changes in the plant. We have used an in vivo sensor, termed “bioristor”, to continuously monitor the changes occurring in the sap ion’s status when plants experience different VPD conditions and we observed a specific R (sensor response) trend in response to VPD. The possibility to directly monitor the physiological changes occurring in the plant in different VPD conditions, can be used to increase efficiency of the water management in controlled conditions thus achieving a more sustainable use of natural resources. © 2019 by the authors.

Towards a just transition: Identifying EU regions at a socioeconomic risk of the low-carbon transition,"Europe has committed to turning climate neutral by 2050 while wider stakeholders acknowledge the need for a just low carbon transition that will alleviate any negative socio-economic impacts and leave no one behind. A key first step to this direction is to identify the regions at risk. We develop a dedicated socio-economic risk indicator which makes it possible to identify the EU regions likely to be affected the most from the transition. The indicator rests on the latest definition of the IPCC, which treats risk as the combination of Hazard, Exposure and Vulnerability. In our risk index, Hazard is described as the drop in production of fossil fuel-related sectors due to the transition risk, Exposure is the respective employment share, while Vulnerability is a composite index of socioeconomic sub-indicators that further describe Sensitivity and Adaptive Capacity of the regions. We find a wide divergence across the risk profiles of EU regions. 6 % of all EU regions are found to be at high risk, while 74 % of the regions face no risk. The 15 high-risk regions are also found to experience socioeconomic challenges prior to the low-carbon transition process, thus indicating the need for dedicated supporting policy mechanisms.",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of policy instruments on soil multifunctionality in the European Union,"Agricultural ecosystems provide a range of benefits that are vital to human well-being. These benefits are dependent on several soil functions that are affected in different ways by legislation from the European Union, national, and regional levels. We evaluated current European Union soil-related legislation and examples of regional legislation with regard to direct and indirect impacts on five soil functions: the production of food, fiber, and fuel; water purification and regulation; carbon sequestration and climate regulation; habitat for biodiversity provisioning; and the recycling of nutrients/agro-chemicals. Our results illustrate the diversity of existing policies and the complex interactions present between different spatial and temporal scales. The impact of most policies, positive or negative, on a soil function is usually not established, but depends on how the policy is implemented by local authorities and the farmers. This makes it difficult to estimate the overall state and trends of the different soil functions in agricultural ecosystems. To implement functional management and sustainable use of the different soil functions in agricultural ecosystems, more knowledge is needed on the policy interactions as well as on the impact of management options on the different soil functions. © 2017 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of agricultural land afforestation on soil water content in Central Bohemia,"In the Czech Republic, the afforestation of agricultural land has been supported by providing subsidies from the government and the European Union. Afforestation of less-productive agricultural land provides many benefits including carbon sequestration, soil erosion control, biodiversity, water retention, cooling, social benefits, decreasing noise and light pollution, increasing air quality, wind speed reduction, oxygen production, wood production and non-wood products. In some aspects, it is possible to produce wood of the same quality on former agricultural land compared to permanent forest land. In this study, we attempted to find out the course of temperatures and volumetric water content as well as some other physical soil properties (at depths of 20, 40 and 60 cm) 9 years after the afforestation of agricultural land (warm, mild dry region of the Czech Republic) with a mixture of broadleaved tree species (Quercus robur L., Quercus rubra L. and Acer platanoides L.) or monospecific Pinus sylvestris L. stand; the study was performed in the period from April to the beginning of November 2020. Concerning the studied physical soil properties, the value of bulk density was higher (and total porosity lower) at a depth of 20 cm in Pinus sylvestris L. compared with agricultural land or the mixture of broadleaves; the water stability of soil aggregates was higher after the afforestation with the mixture of broadleaves. The temperature was lower in the soil of afforested plots (at all studied depths) compared to the agriculturally used land. Differences in rainfall interception, transpiration, soil (and forest floor) properties and other factors could influence the obtained values of water content in the soil of the studied plots. The average volumetric water contents were the highest in the plots with Scots pine (depth of 20 cm) and broadleaves (depth of 40 cm), and on the control plot (depth of 60 cm). The volumetric water content at a soil depth of 20 cm was not significantly (P > 0.05) different when the plot with Scots pine and agriculturally used land were compared. In all other cases and depths, the differences between plots were significant (P < 0.05). © 2021 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Substantial sustainability innovation trends and drivers,"The world is changing faster than we think. Climate mega trends are affecting us all, and sustainability mega trends are becoming more crucial by the day. Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword; it has become a crucial aspect of our daily lives, as a matter of fact, even a matter of survival. From decreasing biodiversity to rising sea levels, these global issues demand our attention now more than ever before. From the food we eat to the clothes we wear, sustainable practices need to be implemented at every level. However, with so much focus on sustainability, how can one keep up with all the trends and changes? In this chapter, we will explore why considering sustainability trends is crucial for any organization. We will be discussing what micro trends, macro trends, and mega trends are, as well as why they are relevant to be considered. We will also discuss various lessons learned from those who have successfully understood sustainability trends, the drivers behind them, and created and implemented needed strategies. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Knowledge gaps and future research needs for assessing the non-market benefits of Nature-Based Solutions and Nature-Based Solution-like strategies,"Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) can be defined as solutions based on natural processes that meet societal challenges and simultaneously provide human well-being and biodiversity benefits. These solutions are envisioned to contribute to operationalizing sustainable development strategies, especially in the context of adaptation to climate change (e.g. flood risk reduction). In order to quantify NBS performance, ease their uptake and advocate for them as alternatives to ""business-as-usual"" infrastructures, a comprehensive, holistic valuation of their multiple benefits (multiple advantages and disadvantages) is needed. This entails quantifying non-market benefits for people and nature in addition to determining the (direct) cost-benefit of the risk-reduction measure. Despite the importance given to the assessment of non-tangible benefits for people and nature in the literature, systematic data collection on these dimensions seems to be missing. This study reviews publications that used stated preference methods to assess non-market human benefits of NBS and NBS-like strategies. Its aim is to highlight any biases or knowledge gaps in this kind of evaluation. Our results show that the valuation of non-tangible benefits of NBS (e.g. increased recreation and well-being, enhanced biodiversity) still suffers from a lack of common framing. Despite some steps being taken on enabling interconnected benefit assessments, unexploited opportunities concerning the integrated assessment of non-market human and nature benefits predominate. Moreover, the research to-date appears based on a case-to-case approach, and thus a shared holistic method does not emerge from the present literature, potentially delaying the uptake of NBS. We argue that future research could minimize missed opportunities by focusing on and systematically applying holistic benefits assessments.

Climate change and groundwater resources availability in the Great Limpopo National Park (Mozambique): the current state of knowledge,"This work outlines a comprehensive study of groundwater resources supply in Mozambique’s Great Limpopo National Park buffer zone in Southern Africa. To protect biological diversity and the water resources supply of dispersed communities of the buffer zone is a crucial problem to fix people in the region and, in the meantime, to boost the development of the Limpopo National Park. This work shows the current state of knowledge about this topic and try to point out some suggestions on technical solutions. Some previous studies concluded that two different main factors make a complex water supply in this area: (i) the rainwater distribution, it is hard to transform the rainwater into groundwater resources available for exploitation, and (ii) the common groundwater resources, rich in elements such as Boron (B), Mercury (Hg), Uranium (U), Zinc (Zn) and Lead (Pb). The occurrence of these elements is linked to the presence of groundwater with long residence times, unsafe for people’s health. The methodological approach adopted has been to assess the potential infiltration, applying the inverse hydrogeological budget technique, starting from the main outcropping geological units, in the study area. Due to the lack of meteorological data referred to Limpopo National Park, the gauge stations located in the Kruger National Park during the last 64 years have been, on the whole, considered. The target of the study has been to assess the trend of meteorological data and understand how precipitations could affect groundwater recharge and their availability. Without a strategy of biodiversity conservation and sustainable water resources management, they cannot be reached and guaranteed healthy conditions for local dispersed communities. A hydrogeoethical responsible approach is essential to protect biological diversity and hydrosocial cycle framework with integrative ecosystem services and nature-based solutions. © 2021, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Trade-offs, co-benefits and safeguards: Current debates on the breadth of REDD+","Fundamental trade-offs exist between different land uses for carbon, livelihoods, economic development, biodiversity, agriculture and energy (especially biofuels). This article analyses the scientific debates on REDD+ trade-offs, co-benefits and safeguards, and shows how the development and expanded scope of REDD+ mechanisms have shaped these debates over time. We find substantial evidence that the non-carbon values of biodiversity conservation, equity and sustainable livelihoods are critical to both the legitimacy and effectiveness of REDD+, and argue that they therefore are better viewed as prerequisites than as values to be safeguarded. Scientists can contribute to the development of a more integrative REDD+ through interdisciplinary research and through a 'learning architecture' that supports the REDD+ policy development process with research dedicated to finding durable solutions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
A global spectral library to characterize the world's soil,"Soil provides ecosystem services, supports human health and habitation, stores carbon and regulates emissions of greenhouse gases. Unprecedented pressures on soil from degradation and urbanization are threatening agro-ecological balances and food security. It is important that we learn more about soil to sustainably manage and preserve it for future generations. To this end, we developed and analyzed a global soil visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) spectral library. It is currently the largest and most diverse database of its kind. We show that the information encoded in the spectra can describe soil composition and be associated to land cover and its global geographic distribution, which acts as a surrogate for global climate variability. We also show the usefulness of the global spectra for predicting soil attributes such as soil organic and inorganic carbon, clay, silt, sand and iron contents, cation exchange capacity, and pH. Using wavelets to treat the spectra, which were recorded in different laboratories using different spectrometers and methods, helped to improve the spectroscopic modelling. We found that modelling a diverse set of spectra with a machine learning algorithm can find the local relationships in the data to produce accurate predictions of soil properties. The spectroscopic models that we derived are parsimonious and robust, and using them we derived a harmonized global soil attribute dataset, which might serve to facilitate research on soil at the global scale. This spectroscopic approach should help to deal with the shortage of data on soil to better understand it and to meet the growing demand for information to assess and monitor soil at scales ranging from regional to global. New contributions to the library are encouraged so that this work and our collaboration might progress to develop a dynamic and easily updatable database with better global coverage. We hope that this work will reinvigorate our community's discussion towards larger, more coordinated collaborations. We also hope that use of the database will deepen our understanding of soil so that we might sustainably manage it and extend the research outcomes of the soil, earth and environmental sciences towards applications that we have not yet dreamed of. © 2016 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Growth and Growth-Related Traits for a Range of Quercus Species Grown as Seedlings Under Controlled Conditions and for Adult Plants from the Field,"Forests and shrublands occupy a large area in the world (c. 31% of the total continental area) and in Spain (c. 36% of the area), in which around 30% of forests are formed by Quercus species. Therefore, the ecosystem services provided by Quercus species are critical to human well-being. Thus, it is essential to understand how Quercus species grow and how they will respond to global change. Bringing together data of comparative growth experiments with seedlings, field data and allometric equations developed for adult plants, our main objectives for this chapter are: (1) to quantify the relative growth rates (RGR) and growth components of seedlings of Quercus species and compare them to values of woody species belonging to other families; (2) to characterise biomass allocation patterns in leaves, stem and roots and RGR in Quercus adults; (3) to understand how temperature, precipitation, tree size and tree density affect the RGR of adult Quercus species; and (4) to compare the RGR of seedlings and adults, and identify which functional traits can explain the differences in RGR. Compared to woody species from other families, seedlings of Quercus species were characterized by low RGR and specific leaf area (SLA), a high proportion of biomass invested in roots (RMF, root mass fraction) and a large seed mass. One of the most important traits explaining differences in RGR among seedlings of Quercus species was the leaf area ratio (LAR, total leaf area per unit of total biomass). In Quercus species, the fraction of biomass in leaves (LMF) and roots (RMF) decreased with tree size, while the proportion of biomass in stems (SMF) increased. Thus, for a tree with 20 cm diameter at breast height, the values of LMF were only between 0.01 and 0.05 (i.e. 1-5% of total biomass invested in leaves) and SMF ranged from 0.50 to 0.80. RGR values of adult Quercus species were highly variable, due to differences in tree size, stand density and abiotic factors. Tree size and density negatively affected RGR, so bigger trees tend to grow more slowly. However, the variation in RGR explained by temperature and/or precipitation was relatively low (<7% of total variation). We observed a positive relationship between the RGR of seedlings in controlled conditions and those of adults in the field. Furthermore, median RGR values of adult plants for Quercus species were positively related to SLA and leaf nitrogen. To sum up, Quercus species differ in RGR and key leaf traits from other woody species and the RGR of adult trees depend on tree size, density, temperature and precipitation. Our results suggest that climate change synchronised with density might affect future trends on the growth of Quercus species.",Not About Sufficiency

Towards an EU Regulatory Framework for Climate-Smart Agriculture: The Example of Soil Carbon Sequestration,"This article assesses current and proposed European Union (EU) climate and environmental law, and the legal instruments associated with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), to see whether soil carbon sequestration is sufficiently promoted as a promising example of climate-smart agriculture'. The assessment shows that current and proposed policies and instruments are inadequate to stimulate large-scale adoption of soil carbon projects across Europe. Given the identified structural flaws, it is likely that this is true for all climate-smart agricultural practices. An alternative approach needs to be developed. Under EU climate policy, agriculture should be included in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) by allowing regulated industries to buy offsets from the agricultural sector, following the examples set by Australia and others. The second element of a new approach is aimed at the CAP, which needs to be far more focused on the specific requirements of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Yet, such stronger focus does not take away the need to explore new income streams for farmers from offsets under the ETS, as the CAP will never have sufficient funds for the deep and full transition of Europe's agriculture sector that is needed.",Not About Sufficiency
"Community-led development and collective land tenure for environmental justice: the case of the Cano Martin Pena community land trust, Puerto Rico","Community-led land ownership can contribute to environmental justice in disaster-prone areas, particularly as it protects vulnerable communities from market-driven displacement often occurring after natural disasters.

It brings into focus the case of the Cano Martin Pena communities in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where residents started a Community Land Trust (CLT) in Latin America and the Caribbean, resulting from an extensive process of community participation. We highlight the importance of this case as still one of the only CLT's in the Global South, a mechanism not yet sufficiently understood as a highly developed instrument for secure land tenure and adaptation to climate change in the Global South. We analyse the mechanisms by which the CLT's collective tenure model effectively ensures greater environmental justice - both regarding ongoing flooding issues, and specific extreme natural events such as hurricanes. Collective land ownership allows residents to remain in the area despite forces of gentrification and displacement after disasters induced by global warming.

"Removal of atmospheric pollutants using biochar: preparation, application, regeneration and its future research","Air quality management is critical for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3. Pollutants such as VOCs, NOx, and particulate matter contribute to over 3 million premature deaths each year. Annually, 140 Gt of biomass waste is produced mainly in the EU, Brazil, the USA, India, and China, with crop residue burning contributing to 18% of global CO₂ emissions and releasing harmful pollutants like PM and VOCs. This review highlights biochar as a viable solution for air pollution remediation, showcasing its strong adsorption capabilities for gases like CO₂ and NOx. Biochar can be produced from agricultural waste using methods such as pyrolysis as well as gasification and hydrothermal carbonization. These production methods create biochar with specific physicochemical properties that vary based on the type of feedstock used and the processing conditions. Activation techniques enhance adsorption capacity, achieving an 86% microporous structure with a surface area of 151 m2/g, with eucalyptus-activated biochar showing a 99.76% pollutant removal efficiency. Biochar has shown significant removal capabilities for various air pollutants, with miscanthus capturing MEK at 2.5 to 43 mg/g, bamboo-activated biochar achieving 89.19% removal of PM2.5, and rice husk biochar demonstrating a 95.7 mg/g capacity for NO and 100.181 mg/g for SO₂. Indoor pollution mitigation is enhanced as micro-gasification cookstoves reduce CO, CO₂, and PM2.5 emissions by 79%, while finer biochar particles achieve 6% to 75% removal for VOCs like formaldehyde. Its porous structure allows for effective pollutant adsorption via physisorption and chemisorption. Reactivation methods, both thermal and non-thermal, enhance its adsorption capacity while preserving its integrity. Despite its benefits for air quality and carbon sequestration, biochar faces challenges, including greenhouse gas emissions during production and costly regeneration. However, converting biomass to biochar could sequester 0.3 to 2 Gt of CO₂ annually by 2050, supporting carbon market initiatives and circular economy goals. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
"Land and environmental management through Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) system","Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) is one of the most important sectors for the food and livelihood security, as well as being among the leading greenhouse gases (GHG) emitters, especially from the developing countries. (AFOLU is responsible for about a quarter of human-induced GHG emissions.) Among the different AFOLU activities, deforestation and agriculture are leading drivers of growing emission. In order to reduce GHG from the AFOLU sector, it is necessary to develop cost-effective mitigation strategies and adaptation measures via investment for adequate land and environment management. Investments should be made in food security efforts, boosting carbon sinks, modernizing old technologies, and introducing new technical innovation in order to minimize AFOLU emissions. The AFOLU mitigation measure can also give a co-benefit in the form of ecosystem service, but the adverse effects of the mitigation strategies, implementation problems and barriers should not be overlooked. Nevertheless, there are ample potential and perspectives to minimize GHG emission from the AFOLU sector. Therefore, in this chapter, the different sub-sectors of AFOLU are explored in terms of their emission status along with proper land and environment management including cost-effective mitigation measures, challenges and opportunities for making the AFOLU sector net zero or negative emitter of GHG. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

Progress and challenges for the establishment of a sustainable blue economy in Chiloe (Chile): Exploring the connections of a socio-ecological system,"The use of coastal-marine resources is currently based on an unsustainable development model that leads to deterioration of the environment and consequent reductions in economic activities and the well-being of coastal societies. According to the conceptual framework provided by the sustainable blue economy model, this paper evaluates the effects of anthropogenic activities on the ecosystem services (ESs) of the coastal areas of the island and the sea of Chiloe, an archipelago located in Chilean Patagonia. It also analyzes how the degradation of the environment ultimately affects the economy itself and human well-being. The methodology employed is based on the construction of three matrices that connect 12 economic activities identified in the study area, with three ESs groupings (provisioning, regulating, and cultural) and four components of human well-being (security, material assets, health, and social relations). The impacts are assessed using four categories: high impact (3), moderate impact (2), low impact (1), and positive impact (0). The results reflect the domination of economic sectors that negatively affect the environment, among which salmon farming, the main activity in Chiloe, stands out. In contrast, small-scale fishing has been the highest evaluated sector, largely because of the new management instruments that have been developed in Chile. The establishment of a sustainable blue economy in Chiloe requires the application of sustainability standards –such as those proposed for small-scale fisheries– in the sectors that generate the most socio-ecological impacts. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Five culturally protected water body practices in Fiji: Current status and contemporarydisplacement challenges,"Community-based natural resource management in Oceania has its roots in culturally protected water body (CPWB) practices. However, CPWBs in Fiji have been under-researched regarding what practices exist, and the extent to which they are currently practiced. Archival research and interviews with 201 individuals across Fiji’s 189 districts revealed five CPWB types. Conception, Meconium, and Circumcision CPWBs are at risk of practice cessation, while Chiefly investiture and Funerary, have 15% and 42% actively practicing districts, respectively. Primarily serving a ceremonial and food provisioning service, the view that CPWBs do not contribute to biodiversity conservation can be counterproductive to conservation efforts. CPWBs as a place-based practice are eroding due to low awareness by conservation practitioners, and exclusion from community management plans. Knowledge of CPWBs and the practical challenges of implementing them can help conservation practitioners and Indigenous peoples maintain cultural practices, while ensuring food security and conservation into the future. © 2021, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",Not About Sufficiency
The effects of climate change associated abiotic stresses on maize phytochemical defenses,"Reliable large-scale maize production is an essential component of global food security; however, sustained efforts are needed to ensure optimized resilience under diverse crop stress conditions. Climate changes are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of both abiotic and biotic stress. Protective phytochemicals play an important role in both abiotic stress resilience and resistance to biotic challenges, yet the concentration and composition of these phytochemicals are also dependent on climate variables. We review the research on the effects of climate change associated abiotic stresses on three classes of maize defense metabolites, including benzoxazinoids, volatile organic compounds, and terpenoid phytoalexins. Despite significant knowledge gaps that still exist, it is evident that climate change will influence maize phytochemicals associated with resilient productivity. While broad generalizations are not yet possible, climate induced changes in phytochemicals are context specific and dependent upon developmental stage and tissue type. Under conditions of drought, maize modulates different classes of defense phytochemicals to protect the above-and belowground tissues. Aboveground the benzoxazinoid defenses are stimulated, but belowground terpenoid phytoalexins are predominantly deployed. Changes in the allocation or distribution of the different classes of defense metabolites or signaling molecules have the potential to further shape the biodiversity and abundance of pests within the maize agroecosystem. A better understanding of the underlying genetics, biosynthetic pathways, regulation and precise biological roles of maize phytochemicals modulated by arrays of climatic conditions will be required to ensure optimal plant resilience and productivity in the face of combined biotic and abiotic stresses.",Not About Sufficiency
Just transition pathways of energy decarbonization under the global environmental changes,"The decarbonization and the transition pathways from fossil fuels to green energy technologies in the era of global climatic change, poses great challenges. An effective management tool of all parameters related to a just transition plan could minimize the effects on local communities and maximize the long-term benefits creating conditions for the enhancement of regional sustainable development. For this reason, this paper develops a conceptual model for the evaluation of crucial aspects related to decarbonization projects, through a questionnaire to survey a sample of locals from a coal dependent region. A methodology based on the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to investigate a set of ten hypotheses which describe possible relationships between the aspects of the conceptual model. Although, respondents agree with the need for a change in the current fossil fuel resource management system, they do not regard that the decarbonization will have a positive effect on the sustainability of the coal-dependent region. Also, respondents who support such changes they do not believe that the climate change has serious impacts on humanity and natural ecosystems.

A just transition plan should be a result of effective public dialogue with the active participation of all stakeholder groups, which will be directly or indirectly affected by the major changes of decarbonization.",Not About Sufficiency
Complex problems and unchallenged solutions: Bringing ecosystem governance to the forefront of the UN sustainable development goals,"Sustainable development aims at addressing economic, social, and environmental concerns, but the current lack of responsive environmental governance hinders progress. Short-term economic development has led to limited actions, unsustainable resource management, and degraded ecosystems. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) may continue to fall short of achieving significant progress without a better understanding of how ecosystems contribute to achieving sustainability for all people. Ecosystem governance is an approach that integrates the social and ecological components for improved sustainability and includes principles such as adaptive ecosystem co-management, subsidiarity, and telecoupling framework, as well as principles of democracy and accountability. We explain the importance of ecosystem governance in achieving the SDGs, and suggest some ways to ensure that ecosystem services are meaningfully considered. This paper reflects on how integration of these approaches into policies can enhance the current agenda of sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Recycling of aquaculture wastewater and sediment for sustainable corn and water spinach production,"This study develops a method to reuse aquaculture wastewater and sediment from a catfish pond in order to increase agricultural productivity and protect the environment. Material flow analysis (MFA) is a central concept of this study that involves collecting catfish pond wastewater (CPW) and reusing it to irrigate five water spinach (Ipomoea aquatic) ponds before discharging it into a river. Typically, catfish pond sediment (CPS) was collected and composted to produce organic fertilizer for cornfields. The results revealed that pollutant removal efficiency of wastewater from CPW (by using water spinach) were total organic carbon (TOC) = 38.78%, nitrogen (N) = 27.07%, phosphorous (P) = 58.42%, and potassium (K) = 28.64%. By adding 20 tons of CPS compost per hectare of the cornfield, the corn yield boosted 15% compared to the control field. In addition, the water spinach grew and developed well in the medium of wastewater from the fish pond. Altogether, the results illustrate that catfish pond wastewater and sediment can act as organic fertilizers for crops meanwhile reduce environmental pollution from its reuse. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Promoting net-zero carbon in the Vietnamese construction sector: potential benefits and challenges identified by key stakeholders,"Purpose: Achieving net-zero carbon in construction offers immense environmental and economic benefits, but its widespread adoption in developing countries faces unique challenges. While research exists on net-zero carbon construction, the specific context of developing economies like Vietnam remains under-researched. This study bridges this gap by investigating potential benefits and challenges related to promoting net-zero carbon construction, as perceived by key stakeholders in the sector. Design/methodology/approach: Employing a rigorous research methodology with four main phases, data collected from construction professionals was analyzed using various statistical techniques. ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc analyses were employed to identify differences in stakeholders’ perceptions, while the identified benefits and challenges were evaluated and ranked based on their mean scores. Findings: The results highlight a significant difference in the perception of benefits and challenges among key stakeholders, including policymakers, contractors, suppliers and architects/designers. In addition, while all stakeholders acknowledge the environmental and social benefits, particularly improved air quality, climate change mitigation and enhanced corporate social responsibility; significant challenges persist, including high initial costs, inadequate business models and lack of clear standards. Practical implications: This study contributes significantly to the Vietnamese construction sector by providing valuable recommendations tailored to address the unique challenges faced by each stakeholder group. These efforts can not only contribute to Vietnam’s national climate goals but also serve as a valuable model for other emerging economies seeking to transition towards a more sustainable built environment. Originality/value: This study contributes to the body of knowledge by offering a comparative analysis of how stakeholders perceive the benefits and challenges of net-zero carbon construction in developing countries. This stakeholder-centered approach enhances the practical relevance of net-zero initiatives, promoting more effective and inclusive pathways toward sustainable construction practices in emerging markets. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency

Trade-offs of European agricultural abandonment,"Agricultural land abandonment is a policy challenge, especially for areas with unfavorable conditions for agriculture and remote and mountainous areas. Agricultural abandonment is an important land use process in many world regions and one of the dominant land use change processes in Europe. Previous studies have shown that abandonment can have both positive and negative effects on several environmental processes, influenced by location and scale. Preferred policies and management of these areas are debated given concerns for the loss of (traditional) agricultural landscapes and potential impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. We present a European-scale impact assessment of the possible effects of agricultural abandonment, based on eight indicators that are on the forefront of the agricultural abandonment debate. Using a multi-scale modelling approach, we expect between 71.277 and 211.814 km(2) of agricultural abandonment in 2040. Impacts on the indicators and trade-offs between the impacts are spatially variable. A typology of typical trade-off bundles at a 1 km(2) resolution resulted in four typical trade-off clusters. All clusters identified are characterized by a loss of agriculture-related values, such as agro-biodiversity and cultural heritage. For two clusters, this was accompanied by positive effects on indicators such as carbon sequestration, nature recreation and mammal habitat suitability. Overall, our results indicate that location and scale are key to assess the trade-offs originating from agricultural abandonment in Europe. Identification of typical trade-offs bundles can help to distinguish potential desirable outcomes of agricultural abandonment and assist in targeting measures to areas that face similar management challenges.

Dune dynamics safeguard ecosystem services,"Intensively used coastal zones often know a history of hard defense structures to prevent erosion and protect infrastructure against floods. The interruption of sand transport between sea, beach and dunes however causes a domination of late successional stages such as dune shrub. With the decline of young, dynamic vegetation types, a change occurs in the provision of ecosystem services. In spite of the growing awareness on the role of dune dynamics to support human well-being and biodiversity, redynamisation of dunes is rarely implemented in coastal zone management. It has been argued in research documents that this may be caused by a failure to make those benefits tangible and specific. This study aims to underpin the added value of dynamic versus fixed dunes. Five different ecosystem services in a case study in Belgium were quantified based on (compound) indicators and expressed in monetary units. The value of a natural, dynamic dune system covering the entire gradient of dune succession and dominated by young successional stages was compared with the value of a fixed dune system dominated by late successional stages. The results indicate that a dynamic dune complex may create up to 50% higher economic benefits, and that the main benefits are on account of recreation and coastal safety maintenance. The results underpin the statement that we can only continue benefitting from the services dunes provide if we accept their mobile nature, but that redynamisation requires a site-specific feasibility analysis.

"A synthesis of past, current and future research for protection and management of papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) wetlands in Africa","Papyrus wetlands (dominated by the giant sedge Cyperus papyrus L.) occur throughout eastern, central and southern Africa and are important for biodiversity, for water quality and quantity regulation and for the livelihoods of millions of people. To draw attention to the importance of papyrus wetlands, a special session entitled ""The ecology of livelihoods in papyrus wetlands"" was organized at the 9th INTECOL Wetlands Conference in Orlando, Florida in June 2012. Papers from the session, combined with additional contributions, were collected in a special issue of Wetlands Ecology and Management. The current paper reviews ecological and hydrological characteristics of papyrus wetlands, summarizes their ecosystem services and sustainable use, provides an overview of papyrus research to date, and looks at policy development for papyrus wetlands. Based on this review, the paper provides a synthesis of research and policy priorities for papyrus wetlands and introduces the contributions in the special issue. Main conclusions are that (1) there is a need for better estimates of the area covered by papyrus wetlands. Limited evidence suggests that the loss of papyrus wetlands is rapid in some areas; (2) there is a need for a better understanding and modelling of the regulating services of papyrus wetlands to support trade-off analysis and improve economic valuation; (3) research on papyrus wetlands should include assessment of all ecosystem services (provisioning, regulating, habitat, cultural) so that trade-offs can be determined as the basis for sustainable management strategies ('wise use'); (4) more research on the governance, institutional and socio-economic aspects of papyrus wetlands is needed to assist African governments in dealing with the challenges of conserving wetlands in the face of growing food security needs and climate change. The papers in the special issue address a number of these issues. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil carbon in the boreal region under climate and land use change,"Carbon cycling in boreal regions is controlled naturally by fire disturbance, climate, hydrology, snowmelt, soil heterogeneity, acidity, low nitrogen and phosphorus availability, mycorrhizal distribution, plant cover, and cryoturbation/permafrost at the northern edge. It is primarily altered by human management via and following land clearance. Each factor interacts with others in complex ways, creating a system characterized by high carbon storage and shaped by natural and anthropogenic disturbance. This paper examines boreal research to answer the question: ‘what are the primary factors controlling boreal carbon cycling?’ Though climate change threatens boreal systems, they may yet be resilient given many natural feedback loops that resist massive carbon loss. Perhaps the greatest danger is land conversion, which causes permanent losses and drastic alteration of certain carbon pools. Accordingly, it might be argued that it would be overall better to implement policies that keep these lands as forests, including managed forests, rather than convert to agriculture. Conversely, farming of marginal boreal soils might be managed to enhance carbon storage while satisfying local food security needs. However, the impact of agriculture on soil carbon storage is yet to be effectively quantified and initial results offer inconsistent assessments, reflected in the as-yet natural sciences data-scarce policy development. Research targeting long-term carbon cycling, land conversion practices, agroforestry, and communication between boreal scientists and other groups (climate scientists, policymakers, public, and farmers) must be addressed through creation of long-term experiments. © 2024 The Author(s).

Mapping drivers of land conversion among smallholders: A global systems perspective,"CONTEXT: Agriculture-driven land conversion poses a significant threat to global biodiversity conservation. Balancing agricultural expansion with conservation is a critical challenge for governments and development partners. Sustainability-oriented agriculture programs such as conservation agriculture and land intensification aim to reduce land conversion and deforestation; however, evidence of their effectiveness remains complex and elusive, especially regarding the role of smallholders. OBJECTIVE: This study addresses this knowledge gap by systematically mapping the drivers of smallholder land conversion and their interconnections across three focal biodiverse contexts including sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia as well as from a global scale. METHODS: Using literature that focuses on the nexus of smallholder farmers and agricultural intensification, this study systematically identified the potential of distinct factors and dynamic processes to serve as system leverage points toward improved outcomes for biodiversity, food security, and smallholder livelihoods, using a combination of structural factor analysis, centrality analysis, and feedback loop analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of strengthening land tenure systems, providing technical support to farmers, improving market access, and prioritizing smallholder livelihoods in mitigating land conversion. SIGNIFICANCE: Contextual differences emphasize the need for context-specific interventions and further research to explore factors driving land conversion more deeply within specific contextual boundaries. Future studies should map proposed policy interventions onto local systems driving land conversion and incorporate the diverse perspectives of local stakeholders to guide effective and sustainable agriculture interventions. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
The Best Solution for Renovation in Terms of Climate and Economy,"EU aims to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Besides energy consumption reduction, also greenhouse gas emissions have to be cut starting from the production of materials and construction work through the use phase to the end of the use of the building. Existing buildings are estimated to provide a high potential for reducing global warming. This paper focuses on research question, how reasonable are energy efficiency improvements of existing buildings, as the materials used in the process produce CO2 emissions and increase costs compared with conventional maintenance. This issue is a part of the Sustainable Development Goal 13 Climate Action, which integrates climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning and a part of Goal 11 Sustainable cities and communities, which tries to increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion resource efficiency mitigation and adaption to climate change. The carbon footprint of an existing renovated building constitutes mainly from energy consumption emissions. In life cycle costs, the deciding factor is investment. If the building was heated by zero-emission ground source heat, structural renovations would not be worth doing. On the other hand, structural improvement of energy efficiency is recommendable if a building is connected to district heating (DH). Strong reasons, either endogenous or exogenous, must exist for replacing an existing building with a new one. They cannot be justified with the carbon footprint or life cycle costs. These results apply to countries, where the energy efficiency of existing buildings is reasonably good.",Not About Sufficiency
Review on biochar as a sustainable green resource for the rehabilitation of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil,"Petroleum pollution is one of the primary threats to the environment and public health. Therefore, it is essential to create new strategies and enhance current ones. The process of biological reclamation, which utilizes a biological agent to eliminate harmful substances from polluted soil, has drawn much interest. Biochars are inexpensive, environmentally beneficial carbon compounds extensively employed to remove petroleum hydrocarbons from the environment. Biochar has demonstrated an excellent capability to remediate soil pollutants because of its abundant supply of the required raw materials, sustainability, affordability, high efficacy, substantial specific surface area, and desired physical-chemical surface characteristics. This paper reviews biochar's methods, effectiveness, and possible toxic effects on the natural environment, amended biochar, and their integration with other remediating materials towards sustainable remediation of petroleum-polluted soil environments. Efforts are being undertaken to enhance the effectiveness of biochar in the hydrocarbon-based rehabilitation approach by altering its characteristics. Additionally, the adsorption, biodegradability, chemical breakdown, and regenerative facets of biochar amendment and combined usage culminated in augmenting the remedial effectiveness. Lastly, several shortcomings of the prevailing methods and prospective directions were provided to overcome the constraints in tailored biochar studies for long-term performance stability and ecological sustainability towards restoring petroleum hydrocarbon adultered soil environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Examining the role of nuclear and renewable energy in reducing carbon footprint: Does the role of technological innovation really create some difference?,"The deployment of energy sources is considered the compassion of several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Countries should keep balance with the three major proportions of the global energy trilemma: energy security, affordability, energy access, and ecological balance to construct a solid basis for competitiveness and prosperity. In this regard, this study examines the influence of nuclear energy, technological innovations, renewable energy, non-renewable energy, and natural resources on carbon footprint in the highest nuclear energy-producing countries from 1990 to 2019. To do this, we developed an inclusive and comprehensive empirical investigation and applied modern econometric approaches. Panel second-generation long-run cointegration advocates long-run associations among the series. The findings reveal that nuclear and renewable energy consumption extensively improve environmental excellence. Conversely, technological innovations and non-renewable energy significantly reduce environmental sustainability. Moreover, natural resources play an adverse role in long-run. The findings of the panel causality test discovered unidirectional causality is running from carbon footprint to nuclear energy. Additionally, bidirectional causality exists between technological innovations, renewables, non-renewables, and natural resources with carbon footprint. This recommends that these nations should integrate energy policy activities and develop energy strategy consistency by harmonizing the vital global nuclear energy aspects to assist a well-calibrated energy structure. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Perceptions of forest cover and tree planting and ownership in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia","The forest cover of Ethiopia has suffered severe deforestation and degradation through heavy exploitation resulting from an escalating demand for fuelwood and land for cropping and grazing (Lisanework and Mesfin, 1989). Historical sources indicate that in the early twentieth century about 42 million hectares, or the equivalent of some 35 percent of Ethiopia's land area, might have been covered with forest (EFAP, 1994). With the inclusion of savannah woodland, the estimate rises to some 66 percent of the country. In the early 1950s, the remaining forest covered some 19 million hectares, or 16 percent of the total land area (EFAP, 1994). By 2000, the coverage was estimated at only 4.2 percent (FAO, 2001). Because of the nutrient content of ash and mobilization of some soil nutrients, crop yields increase after slash-and-burn forest clearing (Ehui and Hertel, 1992). This may motivate farmers unable to purchase the necessary agricultural inputs to convert forest land to agriculture every year. As a result of such activities in much of Ethiopia, deforestation has generated both an energy crisis and fears of desertification on a national level (Roundy, 1985). The depletion and degradation of the forest are a threat to ecosystem diversity and a fundamental influence on the declining standard of living of many households. Development projects have been undertaken to address the complex issues of deforestation, environmental degradation and rural poverty. Their success depends not only on an understanding of biophysical conditions, but also on an understanding of the social, economic and cultural context within which they operate (Awang, 1994). To ensure the success of such projects, people's participation and the assurance of ownership rights are very important.",Not About Sufficiency
"Decentralization, institutional quality, and carbon neutrality: Unraveling the nexus in China's pursuit of sustainable development","Achieving carbon neutrality is essential for environmental sustainability and should be pursued with minimal disruption to economic growth. China ' s recent commitment to carbon neutrality holds significant importance in current discussions. This study investigates strategies to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs), emphasizing carbon neutrality. It also examines the longterm impacts and causality between fiscal decentralization and institutional quality in relation to carbon dioxide (CO2). emissions Utilizing the quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) approach and the Granger causality in quantiles, our findings reveal a statistically negative ECM parameter across all quantiles. This indicates a stable, long-term relationship between fiscal decentralization (FDC), institutional quality (INSQ), and CO 2 emissions. The study verifies the presence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in China across different quantiles. In the long run, fiscal decentralization seems to increase CO 2 emissions, but robust institutional quality mitigates this impact. The Granger causality results highlight the intricate relationships among the variables. This research emphasizes the need for policymakers to bolster environmental protection and efficiency, ensuring fiscal decentralization benefits both environmental and economic agendas.",Not About Sufficiency
The use of coal combustion fly ash as a soil amendment in agricultural lands (with comments on its potential to improve food security and sequester carbon),"The growing dependence on coal-fired electricity generation has resulted accumulation of massive quantities of coal combustion by products such as fly ash and bottom ash which are regarded as problematic solid wastes all over the world. Being used beneficially in very less quantities, each year large amount of fly ash is disposed to arable lands which lead to degradation and contamination of land and ground water. However fly ash is identified as a useful soil ameliorant with its properties pertinent to the enhancement of soil fertility and productivity. Fly ash has the potential to improve soil physical, chemical and biological properties and is a source of readily available plant macro and micro-nutrients. Especially for countries whose soils show inherent structural and nutritional limitations for cropping and that need expensive and intensive management, fly ash creates a possible solution to improve crop yields and enhance food security. At the same time the soil added fly ash can involve in terrestrial carbon sequestration by enhancing the microclimate of the soils to facilitate organic matter humification to yield stable forms of soil carbon. This paper reviews the studies of fly ash as a soil amendment in order to present a comprehensive view of the possibility of using fly ash in agricultural lands to improve soil productivity while harvesting possible carbon sequestration benefits. Some identified adverse effects of fly ash addition that can hinder the crop growth in amended soils especially in long term applications have limited its potential use in cultivable lands. However more research work on existing gaps in knowledge to be filled (especially regarding the appropriate application rate and possible environmental contamination) may help to derive the maximum advantages of fly ash in terms soil improvement and waste disposal.

This study examined perceptions and responses from eight key stakeholder groups directly affected by M. strigata in Panguil Bay, Philippines. We also quantified its effects on human well-being (safety, material goods, social practices, health) and ecosystem services (biodiversity, aesthetics, water quality, livelihood, and food sources). Affected stakeholders were primarily young to middle-aged married adults with at least a high school education, living in households of 4 to 6 members. They identified various impacts of M. strigata, including biofouling and financial setbacks, as well as benefits like additional food sources and increased income. Responses ranged from manual removal to exploring alternative livelihoods. Stakeholders acknowledged significant negative effects on human well-being and ecosystem services, reflecting shifts in priorities based on direct interactions with bay resources. The limited use of M. strigata as food, aquaculture feed, and bait was noted, with varying local preferences regarding consumption and sale. Stakeholders recommended livelihood training, removal/control initiatives, market development, awareness campaigns, and policy support to address M. strigata challenges. These findings highlight the need for management strategies that balance ecological sustainability with economic stability.

"The environmental injustice of ""clean coal"": Expanding the national conversation on carbon capture and storage technology to include an analysis of potential environmental justice impacts","Over the past decade, the coal industry has created a multi-million dollar public relations campaign to insulate coal from the green energy revolution and the anticipated public backlash against dirty and unsustainable fuels. This campaign, promoting ""clean coal,"" has effectively shifted the national conversation on energy and climate change to situate coal as a viable clean energy source and the best option available to mitigate climate change. As the U.S. gets closer to passing national climate legislation and the deadline for achieving significant global reductions in carbon emissions draws near, opposition to the coal industry and its Clean Coal Campaign is organizing on a number of fronts. The environmental justice movement, through its leadership on climate justice, can serve as a centralizing force for these disparate advocacy efforts, bringing together students, scientists, policy advocates, community residents, and others engaged to fight clean coal and advance real green energy solutions. This article will look at the history of the Clean Coal Campaign and weigh the arguments for and against clean coal, focusing particularly on carbon capture and sequestration. It will then overview the advocacy efforts occurring across the U.S. to oppose coal and expose the fallacy of clean coal.

Uncovering the effect of waterlogging stress on plant microbiome and disease development: current knowledge and future perspectives,"Waterlogging is a constant threat to crop productivity and ecological biodiversity. Plants face multiple challenges during waterlogging stress like metabolic reprogramming, hypoxia, nutritional depletion, reduction in gaseous exchange, pH modifications, microbiome alterations and disease promotion all of which threaten plants survival. Due to global warming and climatic change, the occurrence, frequency and severity of flooding has dramatically increased posing a severe threat to food security. Thus, developing innovative crop management technologies is critical for ensuring food security under changing climatic conditions. At present, the top priority among scientists is to find nature-based solutions to tackle abiotic or biotic stressors in sustainable agriculture in order to reduce climate change hazards to the environment. In this regard, utilizing plant beneficial microbiome is one of the viable nature based remedial tool for mitigating abiotic stressors like waterlogging. Beneficial microbiota provides plants multifaceted benefits which improves their growth and stress resilience. Plants recruit unique microbial communities to shield themselves against the deleterious effects of biotic and abiotic stress. In comparison to other stressors, there has been limited studies on how waterlogging stress affects plant microbiome structure and their functional traits. Therefore, it is important to understand and explore how waterlogging alters plant microbiome structure and its implications on plant survival. Here, we discussed the effect of waterlogging stress in plants and its microbiome. We also highlighted how waterlogging stress promotes pathogen occurrence and disease development in plants. Finally, we highlight the knowledge gaps and areas for future research directions on unwiring how waterlogging affects plant microbiome and its functional traits. This will pave the way for identifying resilient microbiota that can be engineered to promote their positive interactions with plants during waterlogging stress.

The Potential of Payment for Ecosystem Services for Crop Wild Relative Conservation,"Crop wild relatives (CWR) have proven to be very valuable in agricultural breeding programs but remain a relatively under-utilized and under-protected resource. CWR have provided resistance to pests and diseases, abiotic stress tolerance, quality improvements and yield increases with the annual contribution of these traits to agriculture estimated at USD 115 billion globally and are considered to possess many valuable traits that have not yet been explored. The use of the genetic diversity found in CWR for breeding provides much-needed resilience to modern agricultural systems and has great potential to help sustainably increase agricultural production to feed a growing world population in the face of climate change and other stresses. A number of CWR taxa are at risk, however, necessitating coordinated local, national, regional and global efforts to preserve the genetic diversity of these plants through complementary in situ and ex situ conservation efforts. We discuss the absence of adequate institutional frameworks to incentivize CWR conservation services and propose payment for ecosystem services (PES) as an under-explored mechanism for financing these efforts. Such mechanisms could serve as a potentially powerful tool for enhancing the long-term protection of CWR.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental and public health co-benefits of consumer switches to immunity-supporting food,"During COVID-19, there has been a surge in public interest for information on immunity-boosting foods. There is little scientific support for immunity-supporting properties of specific foods, but strong evidence for food choice impacts on other health outcomes (e.g. risk of non-communicable disease) and environmental sustainability. Here, we relate online recommendations for “immunity-boosting” foods across five continents to their environmental and human health impacts. More frequently recommended food items and groups are plant based and have lower land use and greenhouse gas emission impacts plus more positive health outcomes (reducing relative risks of mortality or chronic diet-related diseases) per serving of food. We identify trade-offs between environmental outcomes of increasing consumption of recommended food items, with aquatic environment impacts increasing with food recommendation frequency. People’s reliance on the Internet for health information creates an opportunity to consolidate behaviour change towards consuming foods with multiple co-benefits.

Is FDI inflow bad for environmental sustainability?,"In the last few years, discussions and debates around environmental sustainability have become a key goal of the global agenda. This is because the latest studies and our direct experiences of the consequences of environmental degradation and climate change are showing that economic models need some urgent changes. The goal of this paper was to investigate the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) flow on environmental sustainability globally. The balanced panel data of 100 countries from 2000 to 2020 were used for empirical analysis to understand the relationship between FDI inflow and environmental performance index (EPI) for countries with different income levels. The estimation is made using the two-step system GMM model as it gives more robust and efficient results in this study. The results of the dynamic panel model do not support the pollution haven hypothesis, i.e., FDI inflow was not found to have any statistically significant effect on EPI. The findings of the paper suggest that to improve environmental quality globally, it is important for governments to invest more in renewable energy projects as clean energy consumption can be one of the most efficient solutions for reducing the impact of climate change. Moreover, countries need to reduce the unemployment rate as it significantly improves the environmental quality according to our estimation results. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency

Influence of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides on soil health and soil microbiology,"Under the global scenario of burgeoning population it is imperative to ensure food security by increasing crop production. There is increasing concern, however, that agricultural intensification leads to large-scale ecosystem degradation and loss of productivity by hampering the soil health in the long term. Further, application of excessive fertilizers and pesticides to improve crop production has negative environmental implications, including soil degradation, enhanced greenhouse gas emissions, accumulation of pesticides, and decline in the availability and quality of water. It is important to develop a sound understanding of the fate of a pesticide, particularly in soils where the microbial communities interact with plants to accomplish functions supporting a number of ecosystem services. Synthetic fertilizer application begins the destruction of soil biodiversity by suppressing the role of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and enhancing the role of everything that feeds on nitrogen. These feeders then amplify the decomposition of organic matter and humus. As organic matter decreases, the physical structure of soil changes. These changes lead to modulations in various associated soil physiological processes. However, there are several contradicting reports on abovementioned negative impacts of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. Therefore the present chapter intends to understand the interaction of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers with soil microbiome and soil processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatially Explicit Seagrass Extent Mapping Across the Entire Mediterranean,"The seagrass Posidonia oceanica is the main habitat-forming species of the coastal Mediterranean, providing millennial-scale ecosystem services including habitat provisioning, biodiversity maintenance, food security, coastal protection, and carbon sequestration. Meadows of this endemic seagrass species represent the largest carbon storage among seagrasses around the world, largely contributing to global blue carbon stocks. Yet, the slow growth of this temperate species and the extreme projected temperature and sea-level rise due to climate change increase the risk of reduction and loss of these services. Currently, there are knowledge gaps in its basin-wide spatially explicit extent and relevant accounting, therefore accurate and efficient mapping of its distribution and trajectories of change is needed. Here, we leveraged contemporary advances in Earth Observation-cloud computing, open satellite data, and machine learning-with field observations through a cloud-native geoprocessing framework to account the spatially explicit ecosystem extent of P. oceanica seagrass across its full bioregional scale. Employing 279,186 Sentinel-2 satellite images between 2015 and 2019, and a human-labeled training dataset of 62,928 pixels, we mapped 19,020 km(2) of P. oceanica meadows up to 25 m of depth in 22 Mediterranean countries, across a total seabed area of 56,783 km(2). Using 2,480 independent, field-based points, we observe an overall accuracy of 72%. We include and discuss global and region-specific seagrass blue carbon stocks using our bioregional seagrass extent estimate. As reference data collections, remote sensing technology and biophysical modelling improve and coalesce, such spatial ecosystem extent accounts could further support physical and monetary accounting of seagrass condition and ecosystem services, like blue carbon and coastal biodiversity. We envisage that effective policy uptake of these holistic seagrass accounts in national climate strategies and financing could accelerate transparent natural climate solutions and coastal resilience, far beyond the physical location of seagrass beds.",Not About Sufficiency
"Balancing economic gains and environmental sustainability: the role of artisanal gold mining in achieving SDGs 1 and 15 in Gaoua, Burkina Faso","The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to eliminate poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity by 2030. In Gaoua, artisanal gold mining is an essential source of income, but it also poses socio-economic and environmental challenges. This study assesses its impact on achieving SDG 1 (poverty eradication) and 15 (protecting and restoring terrestrial ecosystems), highlighting the synergies and trade-offs between economic development and environmental sustainability. The study uses a descriptive and analytical approach based on empirical data, focusing on the artisanal mining sites of Djikando and Gbourbi with qualitative and quantitative methods. The results show that 71% of artisanal miners exceed the guaranteed minimum wage (SMIG) of 45,000 FCFA, with an average annual income estimated at 1,800,000 FCFA, well above the poverty line of 351,170 FCFA per year in the commune. However, the sector faces economic and security instability, preventing the most vulnerable artisans from breaking out of their precarious situation in the long term, with 89% of them living in precarious conditions. About 27% of mining artisans use hazardous chemicals such as mercury and cyanide, threatening terrestrial ecosystems. Analysis of stakeholders' perceptions regarding environmental risks highlights major concerns such as deforestation, pollution, soil erosion and biodiversity loss, as well as their impacts on health. To achieve SDGs 1 and 15 simultaneously, the study recommends formalising the artisanal gold mining sector, restoring ecosystems through reforestation, regulating toxic substances and promoting gravimetric ore processing techniques. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
"Water resources management in vulnerable ecosystems: Quiroz river basin, Piura","According to the IPCC (2014), access to water resources is increasingly limited due to the effects of climate change; in consequence, vulnerability of ecosystems and their inhabitants increases. Thus, it is necessary to develop socio-organizational capacities to mitigate and adapt to this scenario, where retribution mechanisms for ecosystem services (MRSE for its Spanish acronym) become more relevant. The research attempts to analyze the coordination among agents involved in sustainable water resources management, to face climate change vulnerability in high biodiversity areas. For this purpose, the implementation of the Quiroz-Chira water fund will be studied as a case that generates institutionalism for sustainability of this mechanism and that represents an important social innovation that can be replicated. The methodology has a descriptive scope and applies qualitative techniques that complement secondary sources systematized with WebQDA software. Results indicate high vulnerability of the analyzed basin districts and a correct governance in this innovation, both with a sustainable development approach oriented to conservation of water potential. This implies good articulation for implementation of the MRSE and promotion of interests’ unification between contributors and water resources retributive entities. © 2020 The Authors.

Changes in agriculture-biodiversity trade-offs in relation to landscape context in the Argentine Chaco,"Context: Better balancing agricultural production and biodiversity conservation is a central goal for many landscapes. Yet, empirical work on how to best achieve such a balance has focused mainly on the local scale, thereby disregarding that landscape context might mediate biodiversity-agriculture trade-offs. Objectives: Focusing on vertebrates in the Argentine Chaco, we evaluate how trade-offs between agriculture and biodiversity vary with landscape context, from landscapes where agricultural and natural areas are separated to landscapes where both are interspersed. Methods: We modelled the distributions of 226 vertebrates and use the resulting maps to describe the species richness of ecosystem-service providing guilds. We calculated three agricultural intensity metrics, and evaluated how both species richness and agricultural intensity vary along a gradient of landscape configuration, while controlling for landscape composition. Results: Species richness and agricultural yields both varied with landscape configuration. Biodiversity was highest in mixed landscapes where agricultural and natural area are interspersed, whereas agricultural yields showed a more heterogeneous response, with some yield metrics highest in mixed and others in separated landscapes. As a result, agriculture/biodiversity trade-offs depended strongly on landscape configuration, irrespective of landscape composition. We also identified large areas with low vertebrate richness and agricultural yields, suggesting considerable potential for improving in at least one dimension. Conclusions: Agriculture/biodiversity trade-offs varied with landscape configuration, suggesting that landscape design can balance these trade-offs. Our simple and broadly applicable approach can provide baseline information for landscape planning aimed at realizing co-benefits between agriculture and biodiversity—in the Gran Chaco and elsewhere. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
The contribution of traditional agroforestry to climate change adaptation in the Ecuadorian Amazon: The chakra system,"This chapter presents the contribution of “chakra,” a traditional agroforestry system, to climate change adaptation and biodiversity conservation in Ecuador’s Amazonian communities. IPCC’s methodology was used for the estimation of carbon sequestration in soil, biomass, and cacao plantations. Carbon levels in multiple systems of land use were measured through temporary plots. Chakra is efficient to adapt to climate change due to higher levels of carbon sequestration and tree diversity in comparison to other forms of land use. Chakra allows for sustainable use of forests by combining cultivation of the Ecuadorian finest aromatic cacao, controlled timber extraction, production of staple food, and conservation of medicinal plants. Chakra enables Amazonian communities to contribute to both food security and well-being and conservation of the region’s high biodiversity. The chapter informs policy makers and communities about the importance of strengthening traditional agroforestry to achieve environmental and social sustainability. The Amazon region is a vulnerable ecosystem, where adaptation to climate change depends on the extent to which the options for land use are compatible with the conservation of biodiversity and the provision of the ecosystem services that sustain local communities’ livelihoods. The chapter provides solid evidence that this might be possible through traditional agroforestry. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",Not About Sufficiency
Disentangling the practice of landscape approaches: a Q-method analysis on experiences in socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes,"Landscape approaches are gaining momentum in both scientific and policy agendas. However, landscape approaches comprise a multitude of concepts, approaches and principles, which are in part similar, in some parts different or even contradictory. In this paper, we used a Q-method questionnaire to explore how landscape approaches are understood and employed in 45 case studies of socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes derived from the International Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative (IPSI), as well as the motivations for employing them. Our analysis revealed that all landscape approaches pursued very similar goals, namely to ensure that local communities as landscape stewards have the capacity to preserve context-specific values in the face of socio-economic and environmental changes. The tools for reaching such goals are built upon people and nature feedback dynamics that crystalize in rich biodiversity and local ecological knowledge. However, our analysis also showed that the means to reach those goals differed depending on many contextual factors, such as the dominant ecosystems and socio-economic activities in the landscape, the constellation of actors or the most relevant drivers of change affecting the social-ecological system. In particular, we identified four distinct lenses in which landscapes approaches are applied in practice to landscape sustainability: (1) for the preservation of natural values, (2) for the preservation of socio-cultural values, (3) for the promotion of social justice and participatory governance, and (4) for securing food security and local livelihoods. Our results showed an association between the choice of a lens and the value types motivating the use of a landscape approach. Relational values were associated with a focus on landscape conservation and safeguard of social-ecological values. Our study highlights the relevant and beneficial role of landscape approaches as a boundary concept and emphasizes the need for transdisciplinary and participatory methods within landscape research and practice to navigate the context-specific options for implementation of landscape approaches.",Not About Sufficiency
Biodiversity and nutrition: A common path toward global food security and sustainable development,"Food composition provides an important link for biodiversity and nutrition. Biodiversity at three levels-ecosystems, the species they contain and the genetic diversity within species-can contribute to food security and improved nutrition. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) are leading a new international initiative on biodiversity for food and nutrition under the umbrella of the Convention of Biological Diversity. The overall aim is to promote the sustainable use of biodiversity in programmes contributing to food security and human nutrition, and to thereby raise awareness of the importance of this link for sustainable development. Further research is needed to increase the evidence base by filling our knowledge gaps with better inventories and more data on composition and consumption. If nutrient analysis and data dissemination of the various food species and intra-species diversity are systematically undertaken, national information systems for food and agriculture will be strengthened and can be used to form the basis for priority setting and national policy making. For nutrition, this will mean introducing more compositional data on biodiversity in national food composition databases and tables; developing and using dietary assessment instruments that capture food intake at the species and variety/breed level; and allowing food labelling that encourages awareness of food plant varieties and food animal subspecies. Nutrition and biodiversity feature directly the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): halve the proportion of people who suffer from hunger; and ensure environmental sustainability. In combination, a nutrition and biodiversity initiative provides the very foundation for achieving these MDGs. © 2006.",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptation and mitigation: Trade-offs in substance and methods,"Adaptation to climate change and mitigation of climate change are policy substitutes, as both reduce the impacts of climate change.

Advanced Fungal Biotechnologies in Accomplishing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): What Do We Know and What Comes Next?,"The present era has witnessed an unprecedented scenario with extreme climate changes, depleting natural resources and rising global food demands and its widespread societal impact. From providing bio-based resources to fulfilling socio-economic necessities, tackling environmental challenges, and ecosystem restoration, microbes exist as integral members of the ecosystem and influence human lives. Microbes demonstrate remarkable potential to adapt and thrive in climatic variations and extreme niches and promote environmental sustainability. It is important to mention that advances in fungal biotechnologies have opened new avenues and significantly contributed to improving human lives through addressing socio-economic challenges. Microbe-based sustainable innovations would likely contribute to the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) by providing affordable energy (use of agro-industrial waste by microbial conversions), reducing economic burdens/affordable living conditions (new opportunities by the creation of bio-based industries for a sustainable living), tackling climatic changes (use of sustainable alternative fuels for reducing carbon footprints), conserving marine life (production of microbe-based bioplastics for safer marine life) and poverty reduction (microbial products), among other microbe-mediated approaches.

Life-cycle assessment to unravel co-benefits and trade-offs of large-scale biochar deployment in Norwegian agriculture,"Limiting temperature rise below 2 °C requires large deployment of Negative Emission Technologies (NET) to capture and store atmospheric CO2. Compared to other types of NETs, biochar has emerged as a mature option to store carbon in soils while providing several co-benefits and limited trade-offs. Existing life-cycle assessment studies of biochar systems mostly focus on climate impacts from greenhouse gasses (GHGs), while other forcing agents, effects on soil emissions, other impact categories, and the implications of a large-scale national deployment are rarely jointly considered. Here, we consider all these aspects and quantify the environmental impacts of application to agricultural soils of biochar from forest residues available in Norway considering different scenarios (including mixing of biochar with synthetic fertilizers and bio-oil sequestration for long-term storage). All the biochar scenarios deliver negative emissions under a life-cycle perspective, ranging from -1.72 ± 0.45 tonnes CO2-eq. ha−1 yr−1 to -7.18 ± 0.67 tonnes CO2-eq. ha−1 yr−1 (when bio-oil is sequestered). Estimated negative emissions are robust to multiple climate metrics and a large range of uncertainties tested with a Monte-Carlo analysis. Co-benefits exist with crop yields, stratospheric ozone depletion and marine eutrophication, but potential trade-offs occur with tropospheric ozone formation, fine particulate formation, terrestrial acidification and ecotoxicity. At a national level, biochar has the potential to offset between 13% and 40% of the GHG emissions from the Norwegian agricultural sector. Overall, our study shows the importance of integrating emissions from the supply chain with those from agricultural soils to estimate mitigation potentials of biochar in specific regional contexts. © 2021 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Arguments for biodiversity conservation: factors influencing their observed effectiveness in European case studies,"Making a strong case for biodiversity protection is central to meeting the biodiversity targets in international agreements such as the CBD and achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Effective arguments are needed to convince diverse actors that protection is worthwhile, and can play a crucial role in closing the implementation gap between biodiversity policy targets and outcomes. Drawing on a database of arguments from 11 European case studies, along with additional interview and case study material from all 13 case studies of the BESAFE project, we analysed relationships between potential and observed effectiveness of arguments. Our results show that strong logic, robustness, and timing of arguments are necessary but not sufficient conditions for arguments to be effective. We find that use of multiple and diverse arguments can enhance effectiveness by broadening the appeal to wider audiences, especially when arguments are repeated and refined through constructive dialogue. We discuss the role of framing, bundling and tailoring arguments to audiences in increasing effectiveness. Our results provide further support for the current shift towards recognition of value pluralism in biodiversity science and decision-making. We hope our results will help to demonstrate more convincingly the value of biodiversity to stakeholders in decision processes and thus build better cases for its conservation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency

Conservation agrivoltaics for sustainable food-energy production,"Societal Impact StatementTransformative agricultural strategies like agrivoltaics (AV) are essential for addressing the pressing global issues of sustainable energy and food production in a changing climate. Conservation-agrivoltaics (Conservation-AV) provides the potential to meet these needs while reinforcing natural resources and protecting the environment. It could enhance the ecological benefits of AV by improving soil health and biodiversity. It could create economic opportunities for farmers and increase the resilience and diversity of food crops under changing climate conditions. Furthermore, it could inform stakeholders about the benefits and challenges of implementing conservation agriculture management practices (CAMP) in AV and encourage further exploration and adoption of this innovative approach.SummaryTransformative strategies in agriculture are needed to address urgent global challenges related to energy and food production while reinforcing natural resources and the environment. Agrivoltaics (AV) has emerged in the past decade as one solution to this fundamental challenge of improving energy and food security. AV is defined as the co-location of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and crops on the same land to optimize food and energy production simultaneously and sustainably. Here, we propose that AV, together with conservation agriculture management practices (CAMP) strategies can help to intensify food security and energy production while reinforcing natural resources and the environment. Our main assertions in this opinion article are that: (1) AV systems need to overcome several agronomical, environmental, and ecological challenges to intensify food and energy production sustainably; (2) CAMP applied to AV systems can preserve the environment and ensure climate-resilient food production; (3) implementation of CAMP in AV can lead to long-term carbon sequestration, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and maintain or increase crop yields while preserving soil health and biodiversity; and (4) adoption of CAMP in AV can bring economic benefits, although challenges need to be overcome. This opinion article proposes a new ecosystem approach to integrate renewable energy and sustainable food production and encourages research on the effects of CAMP on AV systems. Transformative agricultural strategies like agrivoltaics (AV) are essential for addressing the pressing global issues of sustainable energy and food production in a changing climate. Conservation-agrivoltaics (Conservation-AV) provides the potential to meet these needs while reinforcing natural resources and protecting the environment.

Climate BufferNet: A Gaming Simulation Linking Biodiversity Conservation and Climate Change Adaptation with Agricultural Landscape Planning,"Climate BufferNet is an educational, visual simulation designed to engage higher education students in the Midwestern United States with ideas for improving rural landscape planning outcomes. Past and present social and economic forces shaping the midwestern agricultural landscape have fundamentally transformed its natural systems, impacting food security, biodiversity, and community and ecosystem resilience to climate change. However, the lack of specific knowledge concerning these socioecological and economic forces and their feedback loops constitutes an information barrier to stakeholders new to the decision-making frameworks that shape this complex socioagricultural landscape. This article presents a serious socio-ecological gaming simulation case study as a framework for familiarizing landscape architecture students with the complex interactive characteristics of these systems. The Climate BufferNet study immersed students in an interactive, co-learning visual media environment that confronted them with real-world challenges of balancing economic priorities with the degraded ecological feedback loops now prevalent in this multifunctional landscape. The results of student evaluations from initial playtesting, presented here, revealed that the simulation accurately demonstrates the difficulty in balancing environmental and economic goals. Further, qualitative coding of student responses shows that players were using the simulation to actively experiment with spatial configurations of conservation practices and decipher rules for targeting their actions. The results of these initial pilot tests, documented here, demonstrate both the potential for engaging landscape architects in rural landscape planning and the need for greater attention to the complexities of environmental and economic tensions between biodiversity, climate change, and ecosystem services. © 2022 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental footprint of dehydrated alfalfa production (Medicago sativa L.) in France,"The production of dehydrated alfalfa for animal feed requires substantial energy-consuming processes, which raises questions about the environmental sustainability of this sector; less energy-intensive processes and a transition to renewable energy are needed. In this study, we quantified the environmental footprint of dehydrated alfalfa production in France and its evolution over time using data collected over two periods (2006–2009 and 2016 to 2019). This study was based on twelve production units spread throughout the main alfalfa production areas in France, which represent more than 50% of the national production of dehydrated alfalfa. A life cycle assessment was performed for the three steps of this production: production in the field, transportation from the field to the factory and the dehydration process. The results showed that the adaptation and renewal of the production tools between the two time periods allowed a reduction in the consumption of nonrenewable energy per ton of dehydrated alfalfa: lignite and coal decreased from an average of 352.3 kg t−1 dehydrated alfalfa in 2006–2007 to an average of 100.6 kg t−1 dehydrated alfalfa in 2018–2019. At the same time, the introduction of biomass as an energy source represented 127.4 kg biomass t−1 dehydrated alfalfa in 2018–2019. The decrease in the moisture content of fodder due to climate change and a longer time in the field before plant transport also significantly decreased the energy needed for dehydration at the factory level. Consequently, the French production sector reduced its impact on the “climate change” impact category from 1.150 kg CO2-eq. kg−1 dry matter of dehydrated alfalfa (first period) to 0.494 kg CO2-eq. kg−1 dry matter of dehydrated alfalfa (second period). Among the eight environmental impact categories studied, only the “land competition” criterion increased from 0.840 to 1.222 m2.y between the two periods due to the substitution of fossil energies with renewable energies from wood and energy crops. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The role of land degradation in the agriculture and environment nexus,"The relationship between agriculture and environment could be viewed as conflicting (win-lose) or as synergistic (win-win). A win-lose situation is occurring when agricultural activities such as clearing forest for cultivation is leading to environmental degradation or when environmental protection prevents agricultural activity. A synergistic approach, on the other hand, assumes that sustainable environmental management and agricultural production can be achieved simultaneously. One central goal of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and UNEP is to mainstream sustainable land management into sectors such as agriculture and forestry, thus assuming that win-win situations are possible. The different conceptual frameworks that UNEP has applied and developed in its GEF-funded land degradation projects highlight different aspects of the relationship between agriculture and environment. The paper draws on 10 years of UNEP/GEF experience in working at the environment-agriculture nexus starting with the People, Land Management and Environmental Change Project (PLEC). PLEC illustrates the potential for synergies between environmental and developmental objectives by developing sustainable and participatory approaches to biodiversity management and conservation based on farmers' technologies and knowledge within agricultural systems. The Land Use Change, Impacts and Dynamics Project (LUCID) developed a model on how to use land use change analysis in combination with social and economic variables as a tool to assess biodiversity loss and land degradation across landscapes. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) assessment framework offers a mechanism for decision-makers to: (1) identify options that can better achieve core human development and sustainability goals; and (2) better understand the trade-offs involved in decisions concerning the environment. The Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands (LADA) uses the Driving Forces-Pressures-State-Impact-Responses (DPSIR) framework in analysing the environment-agriculture nexus in drylands. This overview shows how the relationship between agriculture and environment can be analysed using different models and approaches depending of scale and level of analysis. The PLEC model is useful at the local level in reconciling environmental and livelihood goals. Land use change analysis is a useful tool at the landscape level in analysing drivers of land degradation and biodiversity loss. The ecosystem services approach by the MA provides a tool for decision-makers at national level to make informed decisions about trade-offs between agriculture/human well-being and the environment. Finally, LADA will use the DPSIR framework for integration of information collected at different scales, from the local to the global.",Not About Sufficiency
Large mammals and trees in eastern monsoonal China: anthropogenic losses since the Late Pleistocene and restoration prospects in the Anthropocene,"Massive human-induced declines of large-sized animals and trees (megabiota) from the Late Pleistocene to the Anthropocene have resulted in downsized ecosystems across the globe, in which components and functions have been greatly simplified. In response, active restoration projects of extant large-sized species or functional substitutes are needed at large scales to promote ecological processes that are important for ecosystem self-regulation and biodiversity maintenance. Despite the desired global scope of such projects, they have received little attention in East Asia. Here, we synthesise the biogeographical and ecological knowledge of megabiota in ancient and modern China, with relevant data mostly located in eastern monsoonal China (EMC), aiming to assess its potential for restoring functionally intact ecosystems modulated by megabiota. We found that during the Late Pleistocene, 12 mammalian megafaunal (carnivores ≥15 kg and herbivores ≥500 kg) species disappeared from EMC: one carnivore Crocuta ultima (East Asian spotted hyena) and 11 herbivores including six megaherbivores (≥1000 kg). The relative importance of climate change and humans in driving these losses remains debated, despite accumulating evidence in favour of the latter. Later massive depletion of megafauna and large-sized (45–500 kg) herbivores has been closely associated with agricultural expansion and societal development, especially during the late Holocene. While forests rich in large timber trees (33 taxa in written records) were common in the region 2000–3000 years ago, millennial-long logging has resulted in considerable range contractions and at least 39 threatened species. The wide distribution of C. ultima, which likely favoured open or semi-open habitats (like extant spotted hyenas), suggests the existence of mosaic open and closed vegetation in the Late Pleistocene across EMC, in line with a few pollen-based vegetation reconstructions and potentially, or at least partially, reflecting herbivory by herbivorous megafauna. The widespread loss of megaherbivores may have strongly compromised seed dispersal for both megafruit (fleshy fruits with widths ≥40 mm) and non-megafruit plant species in EMC, especially in terms of extra-long-distance (>10 km) dispersal, which is critical for plant species that rely on effective biotic agents to track rapid climate change. The former occurrence of large mammals and trees have translated into rich material and non-material heritages passed down across generations. Several reintroduction projects have been implemented or are under consideration, with the case of Elaphurus davidianus a notable success in recovering wild populations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, although trophic interactions with native carnivorous megafauna have not yet been restored. Lessons of dealing with human–wildlife conflicts are key to public support for maintaining landscapes shared with megafauna and large herbivores in the human-dominated Anthropocene. Meanwhile, potential human–wildlife conflicts, e.g. public health risks, need to be scientifically informed and effectively reduced. The Chinese government's strong commitment to improved policies of ecological protection and restoration (e.g. ecological redlines and national parks) provides a solid foundation for a scaling-up contribution to the global scope needed for solving the crisis of biotic downsizing and ecosystem degradation. © 2023 Cambridge Philosophical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
A transdisciplinary approach to define and assess wild food plant sustainable foraging in Norway,"Societal Impact Statement Foraging wild food plants is sometimes perceived as a conservation threat or, alternatively, as an opportunity for sustainable development. Little is known of how foragers themselves define and ensure sustainable foraging. Here, we collaboratively assessed the activities and motivations of the forager community in Norway in order to achieve a combined social and ecological assessment of foraging sustainability. Current foraging of wild food plants in Norway contributes to an increased appreciation of nature rather than generating negative environmental impact and is hence an opportunity for sustainable development. Wild food plants are well recognized as local sources of nutrition that can contribute to food security, but foraging is sometimes viewed as a threat to biological conservation. Here, we characterize and assess sustainable foraging in Norway through transdisciplinary research co-constructed with the Norwegian Association for Mycology and Foraging. We conducted 19 face-to-face interviews with key stakeholders and produced an online questionnaire returned by 219 recreational and commercial foragers to enquire about what species are harvested, by whom and how, where do foragers learn and what are their perspectives on the sustainability of foraging. Foraging fosters a strong connection with the natural environment. Foragers decide when and how much can be harvested considering location, plant and plant part being harvested. They pay attention to native plants' conservation status and local abundance and plant individual's survival after foraging and aim to not spread invasive species. We define sustainable foraging as the knowledge and practices that enable enriching forager-biodiversity relationships over time. Such a definition can support collaborative sustainability efforts between the academic community and civil society.",Not About Sufficiency
Applying Systems Thinking to Sustainable Beef Production Management: Modeling-Based Evidence for Enhancing Ecosystem Services,"We used systems thinking (ST) to identify the critical components of beef cattle production through the lens of ecosystem services (ES), offering a holistic approach to address its adverse externalities. We identified eight critical feedback loops in beef production systems: (i) grazing and soil health, (ii) manure management and soil fertility, (iii) feed efficiency and meat production, (iv) water use and soil moisture, (v) cultural services and community engagement, (vi) energy use, (vii) carbon sequestration and climate regulation, and (viii) environmental impact. Our analysis reveals how these interconnected loops influence each other, demonstrating the complex nature of beef production systems. The dynamic hypothesis identified through the loops indicated that improved grazing and manure management practices enhance soil health, leading to better vegetation growth and cattle nutrition, which, in turn, have a positive impact on economic returns to producers and society, all of which encourage the continuation of interlinked beef and ecosystem stewardship practices. The management of beef production ES using ST might help cattle systems across the globe to contribute to 9 of the 17 different United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, including the “zero hunger” and “climate action” goals. We discussed the evaluation framework for agrifood systems developed by the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity to illustrate how ST in beef cattle systems could be harnessed to simultaneously achieve the intended environmental, economic, social, and health impacts of beef cattle systems. Our analysis of the literature for modeling and empirical case studies indicates that ST can reveal hidden feedback loops and interactions overlooked by traditional practices, leading to more sustainable beef cattle production outcomes. ST offers a robust framework for enhancing ES in beef cattle production by recognizing the interconnectedness of ecological and agricultural systems, enabling policymakers and managers to develop more effective and sustainable strategies that ensure the long-term health and resilience of humans and ES. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Managing Grazing to Restore Soil Health, Ecosystem Function, and Ecosystem Services","Ruminants including domestic livestock, have been accused of causing damaging impacts on the global environment and human well-being. However, with appropriate management, ruminant livestock can play a significant role in efforts to reverse environmental damages caused by human mismanagement and neglect. Worldwide, at least one billion people living in grazing ecosystems depend on them for their livelihoods, usually through livestock production, and for other ecosystem services that affect human well-being. For long-term rangeland sustainability and ecological resilience, agricultural production policies are urgently needed globally to transform current damaging industrial inorganic input agricultural practices to resource conservation practices that enhance ecosystem function. This is supported by evidence that farmers and ranchers who apply regenerative management practices to restore ecosystem functionality create sustainable, resilient agroecosystems cost-effectively. With enhanced management of grazing resources, domesticated ruminants can be used to produce higher permanent soil cover of litter and plants, which are effective in reducing soil erosion and increasing net biophysical carbon accumulation. Incorporating forages and ruminants into regeneratively managed cropping systems can also elevate soil organic carbon and improve soil ecological function and reduce production costs by eliminating the use of annual tillage, inorganic fertilizers and biocides. Ecosystem services that are enhanced using regenerative land management include soil stabilization and formation, water infiltration, carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling and availability, biodiversity, and wildlife habitat, which cumulatively result in increased ecosystem and economic stability and resilience. Scientists partnering with farmers and ranchers around the world who have improved their land resource base and excel financially have documented how such land managers produce sound environmental, social, and economic outcomes. Many of these producers have used Adaptive Multi-Paddock (AMP) grazing management as a highly effective approach for managing their grazing lands sustainably. This approach uses short-duration grazing periods, long adaptively varied post-grazing plant recovery periods requiring multiple paddocks per herd to ensure adequate residual biomass, and adjustment of animal numbers as environmental and economic conditions change.

Many of these producers have used Adaptive Multi-Paddock (AMP) grazing management as a highly effective approach for managing their grazing lands sustainably. This approach uses short-duration grazing periods, long adaptively varied post-grazing plant recovery periods requiring multiple paddocks per herd to ensure adequate residual biomass, and adjustment of animal numbers as environmental and economic conditions change. Using this approach, farmers and ranchers have achieved superior ecosystem and profitability outcomes. This manuscript summarizes the use of AMP grazing as regenerative tool for grazed and rotationally cropped lands. © Copyright © 2020 Teague and Kreuter.",Not About Sufficiency
"Biomass burning, humans and climate change in Southeast Asia","Biomass burning is an integral part of the Earth system, influencing and being influenced by global climate conditions, vegetation cover and human activity. Fire has long been associated with certain vegetation types and land uses in Southeast Asia, but has increasingly affected forests in Indonesia over the last 50 years or so, and peat swamp forests in particular during the last two to three decades. The role of humans, as igniters of fires and as contributors to the conditions that enable fires once ignited to spread widely, is discussed. Other factors, notably the involvement of anomalous climate conditions linked to variability in the Indian and Pacific oceans, are also considered. Global warming and changes in landuse could result in biomass burning becoming more frequent in the future, threatening biodiversity and human health and leading to positive feedbacks with climate change. Deliberate action is required to break a developing disequilibrium within the Earth system: incentives currently being considered under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change aimed at curbing climate change-causing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation could help mitigate biomass burning, while the effective management of biochar, a stable form of carbon produced from the incomplete combustion of organic matter, by farmers in Southeast Asia, and in other regions where biomass burning is common, could help in carbon sequestration. The paper concludes by stressing that in order to be effective any action needs to recognise the full range of environmental and human factors underpinning biomass burning. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Not About Sufficiency
Barriers and Opportunities in the Transition to a Circular Construction Sector in Portugal,"Transitioning from a linear to a circular economy (CE) is one of the main goals set by the European Union to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Portugal is currently revising the national CE action plan, and the construction sector has been identified as one of the key sectors. Barriers and opportunities in the transition to a CE were previously mapped in literature and national or sectorial CE action plans but still need to be identified for the Portuguese construction sector specificities. Over one-thousand stakeholders were interviewed during eleven working sessions to characterize the national construction sector, identifying and clustering barriers and opportunities in this transition. Barriers from the Political and regulatory pillar were critical, and an urgent need to adapt (and simplify) the regulatory framework to promote a circular construction sector was identified. In the Technology pillar, stakeholders acknowledged the need to support people and companies to make the transition. In the market pillar the lack of pilot projects applying CE principles and of a CDW market. Finally, in the Cultural pillar, the need to reskill workers and empower society with CE principles was highlighted. The actions to trigger the transition are a CE-prone framework, digitalization of construction, simplification of procedures, support research, and empowering the whole value chain. All these actions are in line with the just transition mechanism to ensure that “no one is left behind” and point the path towards a carbon–neutral construction sector. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Impact of aridity rise and arid lands expansion on carbon-storing capacity, biodiversity loss, and ecosystem services","Drylands, comprising semi-arid, arid, and hyperarid regions, cover approximately 41% of the Earth's land surface and have expanded considerably in recent decades. Even under more optimistic scenarios, such as limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C by 2100, semi-arid lands may increase by up to 38%. This study provides an overview of the state-of-the-art regarding changing aridity in arid regions, with a specific focus on its effects on the accumulation and availability of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in plant-soil systems. Additionally, we summarized the impacts of rising aridity on biodiversity, service provisioning, and feedback effects on climate change across scales. The expansion of arid ecosystems is linked to a decline in C and nutrient stocks, plant community biomass and diversity, thereby diminishing the capacity for recovery and maintaining adequate water-use efficiency by plants and microbes. Prolonged drought led to a -3.3% reduction in soil organic carbon (SOC) content (based on 148 drought-manipulation studies), a -8.7% decrease in plant litter input, a -13.0% decline in absolute litter decomposition, and a -5.7% decrease in litter decomposition rate. Moreover, a substantial positive feedback loop with global warming exists, primarily due to increased albedo. The loss of critical ecosystem services, including food production capacity and water resources, poses a severe challenge to the inhabitants of these regions. Increased aridity reduces SOC, nutrient, and water content. Aridity expansion and intensification exacerbate socio-economic disparities between economically rich and least developed countries, with significant opportunities for improvement through substantial investments in infrastructure and technology. By 2100, half the world's landmass may become dryland, characterized by severe conditions marked by limited C, N, and P resources, water scarcity, and substantial loss of native species biodiversity. These conditions pose formidable challenges for maintaining essential services, impacting human well-being and raising complex global and regional socio-political challenges. This study shows that increasing aridity in drylands has a significant impact on the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles within plant-soil systems, as well as on biodiversity and ecosystem services across different scales. As aridity increases, soil organic carbon, nutrient, and water content decrease, which can lead to the loss of critical ecosystem services. By 2100, half of the world's landmass may become dryland, creating significant challenges for maintaining essential services, impacting human well-being, and raising global and regional socio-political issues.image",Not About Sufficiency
China's household's energy poverty mitigation: An inclusive finance perspective,"Effectively tackling energy poverty is instrumental for ensuring public access to affordable energy, which can accelerate a country's shift toward a low-carbon economy. We explore the influence of financial inclusion in mitigating energy poverty, drawing on household survey data. The main results confirm that inclusive finance plays a significant role in eradicating energy poverty at the household level. The transmission mechanisms reveal that inclusive finance alleviates energy poverty by promoting digitalization, narrowing the digital divide, easing liquidity constraints, offsetting economic losses from natural disasters, and increasing educational investments. Additional heterogeneity analysis indicates that the impact of inclusive finance varies across demographic groups, including region, income, off-farm entrepreneurship, and gender. These findings can offer meaningful insights for policymakers aiming to alleviate energy poverty through financial inclusion.",Not About Sufficiency
Cropland soils in China have a large potential for carbon sequestration based on literature survey,"The carbon sequestration of soils has been of key concern particularly since the 4 per mille initiative was launched in COP21 in Paris. Here, we tried to understand three related important questions through literature survey: how did soil organic carbon (SOC) stock change in Chinese croplands in the past decades? What are the agronomic management practices and their potentials to increase the SOC of croplands in China? And how do changes in the SOC affect crop yields? The analyses showed that the SOC stock in the surface soil (0–20 cm) of Chinese croplands increased on average by 0.48% yr–1 from 1980 to 2011. The increase was significant in the eastern and northern China, and particularly in the paddy soils in southern China; however it decreased in the northeastern China. The increase of the SOC stock was attributed to substantial increase in organic inputs, resulted from increased crop productivity, the amendments of crop residues and organic manure, the increases in synthetic fertilizer application and the optimal combination of nutrients, as well as adopting no-tillage practice. Increase in the SOC can increase crop yield and reduce yield variability. Additional means to enhance soil carbon sequestration can be application of biochar, and improvement of synthetic nitrogen use efficiency through disseminating formula fertilizer application based on soil testing, optimized application of inorganic and organic fertilizers associated with extension of conservation tillage. Currently, the straw return ratio has reached about 50%, whereas organic fertilization and conservation tillage (about 6.6%) are still at relatively low levels, the recommended management practices can be further extended to the regions with degraded soils and high population pressure. Further implementation of the recommended management practices on Chinese croplands would increase the SOC stock by ≥25.0 Tg C yr–1 or 0.63% yr–1, compensating for Chinese CO2 emissions by ≥1.0%. In conclusion, Chinese croplands can meet the 4 per mille target and play a crucial role in food security, carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. The priority is to develop climate smart agronomic management practices to gain synergies between climate adaptation and mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Energy transition for meeting ecological goals: Do economic stability, technology, and government stability matter?","Unquestionably, energy transition, which entails increasing renewables in the energy mix, is among the most reliable strategies to discontinue the utilization of fossil fuels and achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this context, technological advancement can not only stimulate green energy supply but also promote resource efficiency for realizing ecological goals. Also, persistent long-term energy policies and uninterrupted investments are needed to progress on SDGs for climate control and sustainable development. Hence, factors such as economic and government stability are pertinent to implementing and governing energy strategies. Against this background, this study assesses the potential of energy transition in meeting ecological goals by taking into account the roles of economic stability, technology, and government stability in BRICS from 1992 to 2018. Using the second-generation Westerlund cointegration test, the study found a long-run association among variables. The findings from the Continuously Updated Fully Modified (CuP-FM) test disclosed that energy transition is effective in limiting the ecological footprint (EF) in BRICS. Alongside this, economic stability and technology reduce ecological degradation. In addition, government stability stimulates environmental sustainability, while population density decreases environmental sustainability. Finally, the implications of these conclusions for meeting SDGs are discussed and policy directions are provided. Copyright © 2022 Tang, Shahzad, Ahmed, Ahmad and Abbas.",Not About Sufficiency
"Biodiversity Conservation of National Parks and Nature-Protected Areas in West Africa: The Case of Kainji National Park, Nigeria","Due to rising global warming and climate change, biodiversity protection has become a critical ecological concern. Rich biodiversity zones are under threat and are deteriorating, necessitating national, regional, and provincial efforts to safeguard these natural areas. The effective conservation of national parks and nature-protected areas help to improve biodiversity conservation, forest, and urban air quality. The continuous encroachment and abuse of these protected areas have degraded the ecosystem over time. While exploring the geophysical ecology and biodiversity conservation of these areas in West Africa, Kainji National Park was selected for this study because of its notable location, naturalness, rich habitat diversity, topographic uniqueness, and landmass. The conservation of national parks and nature-protected areas is a cornerstone of biodiversity conservation globally. This study is aimed at the target United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 13, 2030-Climate Action targeted at taking urgent action towards combating climate change and its impacts. The study captures both flora and fauna that are dominant in the study area. The 15 identified tree species were selected from over 30 species with 563,500,000 (an average of 3,700,000 in each sample frame) trees for every tree species/type with a total of 63% tree green canopy cover. The study areas divided into three zones were randomly sampled within a stratum of 25 x 25 km frames divided into 150 sample frames for proper analyses using the i-Tree Eco v6.0.25. It is a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service peer-reviewed application (software) designed which includes tools for urban and rural forestry study and benefits evaluations. The following microclimatic data were captured and analyzed photosynthetically active radiation, rain/precipitation, temperature, transpiration, evaporation, water intercepted by trees, runoff avoided by trees, potential evaporation by trees, and isoprene and monoterpene by trees. This study also further discusses the tree benefits of a green, low carbon, and sustainable environment within the context of biodiversity conservation, considering carbon storage, carbon sequestration, hydrology effects, pollution removal, oxygen production, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). There is a quick need for remotely-sensed information about the national parks, protected areas and nature reserves at regular intervals, and government policies must be strict against illegal poaching, logging activities, and other hazardous human impacts.",Not About Sufficiency
Grazing exclusion alters denitrification N2O/(N2O + N2) ratio in alpine meadow of Qinghai–Tibet Plateau,"Grazing exclusion has been implemented worldwide as a nature-based solution for restoring degraded grassland ecosystems that arise from overgrazing. However, the effect of grazing exclusion on soil nitrogen cycle processes, subsequent greenhouse gas emissions and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of four-year grazing exclusion on plant communities, soil properties, and soil nitrogen cycle-related functional gene abundance in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. Using an automated continuous-flow incubation system, we performed an incubation experiment and measured soil-borne N2O, N2, and CO2 fluxes to three successive “hot moment” events (precipitation, N deposition, and oxic-to-anoxic transition) between grazing-excluded and grazing soil. Higher soil N contents (total nitrogen, NH4+, NO3−) and extracellular enzyme activities (β-1,4-glucosidase, β-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, cellobiohydrolase) are observed under grazing exclusion. The aboveground and litter biomass of plant community was significantly increased by grazing exclusion, but grazing exclusion decreased the average number of plant species and microbial diversity. The N2O + N2 fluxes observed under grazing exclusion were higher than those observed under free grazing. The N2 emissions and N2O/(N2O + N2) ratios observed under grazing exclusion were higher than those observed under free grazing in oxic conditions. Instead, higher N2O fluxes and lower denitrification functional gene abundances (nirS, nirK, nosZ, and nirK + nirS) under anoxia were found under grazing exclusion than under free grazing. The N2O site-preference value indicates that under grazing exclusion, bacterial denitrification contributes more to higher N2O production compared with under free grazing (81.6 % vs. 59.9 %). We conclude that grazing exclusion could improve soil fertility and plant biomass, nevertheless it may lower plant and microbial diversity and increase potential N2O emission risk via the alteration of the denitrification end-product ratio. This indicates that not all grassland management options result in a mutually beneficial situation among wider environmental goals such as greenhouse gas mitigation, biodiversity, and social welfare. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
Utilization of current pyrolysis technology to convert biomass and manure waste into biochar for soil remediation: A review,"Traditional disposal of animal manures and lignocellulosic biomass is restricted by its inefficiency and sluggishness. To advance the carbon management and greenhouse gas mitigation, this review scrutinizes the effect of pyrolysis in promoting the sustainable biomass and manure disposal as well as stimulating the biochar industry development. This review has examined the advancement of pyrolysis of animal manure (AM) and lignocellulosic biomass (LB) in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and operability. In particular, the applicability of pyrolysis biochar in enhancing the crops yields via soil remediation is highlighted. Through pyrolysis, the heavy metals of animal manures are fixated in the biochar, thereby both soil contamination via leaching and heavy metal uptake by crops are minimized. Pyrolysis biochar is potentially use in soil remediation for agronomic and environmental co-benefits. Fast pyrolysis assures high bio-oil yield and revenue with better return on investment whereas slow pyrolysis has low revenue despite its minimum investment cost because of relatively low selling price of biochar. For future commercialization, both continuous reactors and catalysis can be integrated to pyrolysis to ameliorate the efficiency and economic value of pyrolysis biochar. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing bivalve growth using bio-energetic models,"Aquaculture can play a key role in providing sustainable and low-cost protein sources, with the potential to help particularly the socially and economically vulnerable population. Although many coastal populations already complement their diet by extracting wild brown mussels (Perna perna, Mytilidae) from the environment, an explicit assessment for mussel growth potential along the Brazilian coast has been conspicuously lacking. We provide a large-scale assessment for prospecting and developing mussel culture by applying a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model coupled with remote sensing. We estimated DEB parameters for the P. perna Brazilian population and used satellite-derived yearly data was used as forcing variables, containing information of chlorophyll-a concentration as a proxy for food concentration, sea-surface temperature to modulate metabolic performance, and particulate organic carbon - discounted the contribution of chlorophyll-a - to take into account the negative effect of particles in the mussel ingestion rates. We then simulated mussel growth along a large region of the Brazilian coast and obtained the time it takes for the mussel to reach a 5 cm market-relevant length within each pixel as a means to visualize mapped mussel growth potential indicating the time it takes to reach commercial length. Our results highlight the regions where mussel growth can be relevant for supporting subsistence livelihoods and also for securing income for local communities by performing economic activities, as many of the identified regions do not yet have active mussel culture sites. We also show that mussels can be used for ecosystem services in regions where farming for human consumption is not advisable. Our study provides further evidence that bioenergetic models coupled with remote sensing allow for a pragmatic and cost-effective path to assess growth performance along large regions with implications for developmental policy and spatial planning.",Not About Sufficiency
Peatland restoration as an affordable nature-based climate solution with fire reduction and conservation co-benefits in Indonesia,"Ecosystem restoration is increasingly employed as a nature-based solution to a range of crises. Decisions over restoration must balance limited resources, land constraints, and competing demands. Peatlands in Southeast Asia have been heavily impacted by agricultural expansion over the past three decades, with Indonesia now accounting for a substantial proportion of degraded tropical peatlands globally. Using spatial linear programming, we focus on prioritizing peatland restoration sites in Indonesia for fire risk reduction, climate change mitigation, species conservation, and cost-effectiveness. The study finds that restoring peatlands at 1 km2 planning units can generate multiple co-benefits such as reduced fire risks by 6%-37%, attenuated extinction risks of peatland specialist bird species and mitigated climate change potential of 0.002-0.36 Pg CO2e yr-1. These benefits were reduced but still of comparable magnitude when larger areas of planning (defined by village and catchment boundaries) were used. The results, although indicative, support tropical peatland restoration as a cost-efficient strategy for mitigating climate change, reducing fire, conserving biodiversity, and supporting sustainable development that can be offset by carbon prices of USD 2-37/Mg CO2e. © 2022 The Author(s).

Carbon neutrality potential of the ASEAN-5 countries: Implications from asymmetric effects of income inequality on renewable energy consumption,"The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries are lagging behind the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to increase the share of renewable energy use and to reduce income inequality. Therefore, this study scrutinises the asymmetric effect of income inequality on renewable energy consumption in order to assess the possibility of the major ASEAN-5 countries adopting the carbon neutrality goal. The study employs a nonlinear panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, from 1990 to 2015. By using four income inequality proxies, the empirical results show, firstly, that an alleviation of income inequality promotes the consumption of renewable energy in the long run, and vice versa. Secondly, the asymmetric effect is found and confirms that the positive shock (worsening of inequality) of income inequality generates a larger impact on the consumption of renewable energy compared to the result from negative shock (improvement of inequality). Lastly, the Hatemi-J asymmetric Granger causality tests reveal bidirectional causality between the positive inequality shock and the consumption of renewable energy. Consequently, in terms of policy implication, there is a strong argument to reduce the degree of income inequality in ASEAN-5 in order to promote the consumption of renewable energy and to increase the feasibility of adoption of carbon neutrality targets in the region. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Integrated energy system-Hydrogen natural gas hybrid energy storage system optimization model based on cooperative game under carbon neutrality,"Under the background that carbon emission reduction has become an important research issue in the world, China has put forward the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.

Secondly, based on the cooperative game, it constructs the clearing model of IES-HGESS in the day ahead market and real-time market. Thirdly, in order to realize the long-term and stable cooperation between IES and HGESS, the cooperation gain coefficient was introduced and the income distribution strategy of IES-HGESS was designed.

Degradation of soil fertility can cancel pollination benefits in sunflower,"Pollination and soil fertility are important ecosystem services to agriculture but their relative roles and potential interactions are poorly understood. We explored the combined effects of pollination and soil fertility in sunflower using soils from a trial characterized by different long-term input management in order to recreate plausible levels of soil fertility. Pollinator exclusion was used as a proxy for a highly eroded pollination service. Pollination benefits to yield depended on soil fertility, i.e., insect pollination enhanced seed set and yield only under higher soil fertility indicating that limited nutrient availability may constrain pollination benefits. Our study provides evidence for interactions between above- and belowground ecosystem services, highlighting the crucial role of soil fertility in supporting agricultural production not only directly, but also indirectly through pollination. Management strategies aimed at enhancing pollination services might fail in increasing yield in landscapes characterized by high soil service degradation. Comprehensive knowledge about service interactions is therefore essential for the correct management of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable futures: Aligning climate actions and socio-economic justice through the just energy transition,"The transition towards a just and equitable energy system is a crucial pathway to reconciling climate action with socio-economic justice, as outlined by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Climate Agreement. This systematic review examines the evolving scope of the Just Energy Transition, which has expanded from labor concerns to broader socio-economic and environmental dimensions. It presents a compelling case for safeguarding marginalized and vulnerable communities as economies shift to low-carbon models. The review investigates the synergies and trade-offs between SDG implementation and climate action, emphasizing the need to balance economic growth, energy access, food security, and infrastructure development with climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. Achieving a just energy transition requires prioritizing renewable energy investments, sustainable infrastructure, and policies that promote equity. Decentralized energy systems have effectively reduced energy poverty and alleviated regional disparities. However, the review also identifies potential trade-offs, such as economic disruption and increased inequality, if the transition is not managed inclusively. These challenges require an integrated policy framework that promotes cross-sectoral collaboration, drives clean energy innovation, accelerates the mobilization of private capital, and implements targeted subsidies. Such a comprehensive approach is indispensable for securing sustainable futures that meet climate action and socio-economic justice mandates. Comprehensive stakeholder engagement and capacity-building initiatives are critical to executing a just transition that aligns economic policy with environmental stewardship. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Mitigation for one & all: An integrated framework for mitigation of development impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services,"Emerging development policies and lending standards call for consideration of ecosystem services when mitigating impacts from development, yet little guidance exists to inform this process. Here we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing both biodiversity and ecosystem service mitigation. We have clarified a means for choosing representative ecosystem service targets alongside biodiversity targets, identified servicesheds as a useful spatial unit for assessing ecosystem service avoidance, impact, and offset options, and discuss methods for consistent calculation of biodiversity and ecosystem service mitigation ratios. We emphasize the need to move away from area- and habitat-based assessment methods for both biodiversity and ecosystem services towards functional assessments at landscape or seascape scales. Such comprehensive assessments more accurately reflect cumulative impacts and variation in environmental quality, social needs and value preferences. The integrated framework builds on the experience of biodiversity mitigation while addressing the unique opportunities and challenges presented by ecosystem service mitigation. These advances contribute to growing potential for economic development planning and execution that will minimize impacts on nature and maximize human wellbeing. © 2015 The Author.",Not About Sufficiency
From research to roadmaps: Electric vehicle studies driving sustainable policy frameworks,"Achieving sustainable development goals requires transformative approaches, with transportation offering significant decarbonization potential.

This paper fills this gap by analyzing how EV research influences policy using a methodological framework. A dataset of 44,246 Scopus articles, cross-referenced with Overton database quantifies the policy impact of EV research, identifying key contributors such as influential journals (Transportation Research Part A & D, Energy Policy), authors, and countries. Our findings reveal that articles on cost comparisons, environmental metrics, and integration solutions hold significant policy influence despite low traditional citation counts.

Income heterogeneity and the environmental kuznets curve turning points: Evidence from Africa,"The concept of environmental sustainability aims to achieve economic development while achieving a sustainable environment. The inverted U-shape relationship between economic growth and environmental quality, also called Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), describes the correlation between economic growth and carbon emissions. This study assesses the role of agriculture and energy-related variables while evaluating the EKC threshold in 54 African economies, and income groups, according to World Bank categorization, including low income, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income in Africa. With 1990–2015 panel data, the results are estimated using panel cointegration, Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS), and granger causality tests. The results are: (1) The study validated the EKC hypothesis in the low-income, lower-, and upper-middle-income economies. However, there is no evidence of EKC in the full African and high-income panels. Furthermore, the turning points of EKC in the income group are meagerly low, showing that Africa could be turning on EKC at lower income levels. (2) The correlation between agriculture with CO2 is found positive in the high-income economy. However, agriculture has a mitigation effect on emissions in the lower-middle-income and low-income economies, and the full sample. Also, renewable energy is negatively correlated with emissions in Africa and the high-income economy. In contrast, non-renewable energy exerts a positive effect on emissions in all income groups except the low-income economies. © 2021 by the authors.

Expanding horizon of invasive alien plants under the interacting effects of global climate change: Multifaceted impacts and management prospects,"Anthropogenic disturbances driven introduction of invasive alien plants (IAP) threatened the native biodiversity and environmental sustainability. IAP induced biotic homogenization can also disrupt ecosystem functioning/-services and socio-economy. Multifaceted threats of IAP can further be exacerbated under the interactive effects of climate change. However, IAP-climate change interaction is insufficiently addressed. Therefore, present review attempts to explicitly elucidate this linkage for cross-sectoral invasion ecology and management research. Changes in climatic variables also facilitated IAP to expand their horizon irrespective of the extreme climate and geographical barriers, which enhanced the vulnerability of protected areas rich in endemics. Moreover, IAP-climate change impacted the forestry/agroforestry systems by restricting abiotic resources and influencing forest regeneration, litter stock, and nutrient cycling. Consequently, IAP-climate change can influence ecological economics, livelihood, and human well-being.

"Characterising the biophysical, economic and social impacts of soil carbon sequestration as a greenhouse gas removal technology","To limit warming to well below 2°C, most scenario projections rely on greenhouse gas removal technologies (GGRTs); one such GGRT uses soil carbon sequestration (SCS) in agricultural land. In addition to their role in mitigating climate change, SCS practices play a role in delivering agroecosystem resilience, climate change adaptability and food security. Environmental heterogeneity and differences in agricultural practices challenge the practical implementation of SCS, and our analysis addresses the associated knowledge gap. Previous assessments have focused on global potentials, but there is a need among policymakers to operationalise SCS. Here, we assess a range of practices already proposed to deliver SCS, and distil these into a subset of specific measures. We provide a multidisciplinary summary of the barriers and potential incentives towards practical implementation of these measures. First, we identify specific practices with potential for both a positive impact on SCS at farm level and an uptake rate compatible with global impact. These focus on: (a) optimising crop primary productivity (e.g. nutrient optimisation, pH management, irrigation); (b) reducing soil disturbance and managing soil physical properties (e.g. improved rotations, minimum till); (c) minimising deliberate removal of C or lateral transport via erosion processes (e.g. support measures, bare fallow reduction); (d) addition of C produced outside the system (e.g. organic manure amendments, biochar addition); (e) provision of additional C inputs within the cropping system (e.g. agroforestry, cover cropping). We then consider economic and non-cost barriers and incentives for land managers implementing these measures, along with the potential externalised impacts of implementation. This offers a framework and reference point for holistic assessment of the impacts of SCS. Finally, we summarise and discuss the ability of extant scientific approaches to quantify the technical potential and externalities of SCS measures, and the barriers and incentives to their implementation in global agricultural systems. © 2019 The Authors.

Potential of Purple Non-Sulfur Bacteria in Sustainably Enhancing the Agronomic and Physiological Performances of Rice,"Cereal grains and tubers are among the highly consumed staple foods globally; however, due to unfavorable weather conditions and the competition for natural resources, the major staple cereal crops, such as rice, are under production threat. On the other hand, the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to increase crop yield is deteriorating the growing environment for plants and animals, including humans. As such, sustainable management practices are the key method that can be employed to increase crop production without harming the environment. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), such as the purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB), have recently gained much attention in crop production due to their ability to accumulate higher-value compounds that are highly beneficial to crops. Some of the major benefits PNSB holds are that it can fix atmospheric nitrogen, solubilize phosphate, remediate heavy metals, suppress methane emissions from waterlogged paddy fields, and assist in carbon sequestration. These benefits allow PNSB to be an important bacterium for improving plant growth and yield much more sustainably while benefiting the environment. This review article discusses the beneficial effects of PNSB on rice crop plants through careful screening of previous work in this area. The review also identifies the research gaps and suggests future research pathways to make PNSB an important bacteria for sustainable rice crop production. The review paper aims for the United Nation’s sustainable development goal number two, “Zero Hunger,” target 2.4, indicator 2.4.1, “Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture”. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Air Quality, Health, and Equity Benefits of Carbon Neutrality and Clean Air Pathways in China","In the pursuit of carbon neutrality, China’s 2060 targets have been largely anchored in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with less emphasis on the consequential benefits for air quality and public health. This study pivots to this critical nexus, exploring how China’s carbon neutrality aligns with the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines (WHO AQG) regarding fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure. Coupling a technology-rich integrated assessment model, an emission-concentration response surface model, and exposure and health assessment, we find that decarbonization reduces sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and PM2.5 emissions by more than 90%; reduces nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) by more than 50%; and simultaneously reduces the disparities across regions. Critically, our analysis reveals that further targeted reductions in air pollutants, notably NH3 and non-energy-related NMVOCs, could bring most Chinese cities into attainment of WHO AQG for PM2.5 5 to 10 years earlier than the pathway focused solely on carbon neutrality. Thus, the integration of air pollution control measures into carbon neutrality strategies will present a significant opportunity for China to attain health and environmental equality. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of solar energy in achieving net-zero emission and green growth: a global analysis,"This study explores sustainable development and achieving net-zero emissions by assessing the impact of solar energy adoption on carbon emissions in 40 high and upper middle-income nations and 22 low and lower middle-income countries from 2000 to 2021. Dynamic GMM analysis reveals substantial potential in mitigating emissions, with a 1% increase in solar energy consumption corresponding to a 0.25% reduction in wealthier nations and a 0.10% reduction in lower-income countries. Green power generation positively influences emission reduction in both income groups. However, challenges arise in the green trade mechanism, where increased solar energy trade paradoxically links to higher CO2 emissions. Promising opportunities for environmental sustainability in high-income economies include prioritizing the development of a digital green finance market. In low-income economies, establishing a regulatory framework for the green finance market is crucial, emphasizing standards, guidelines, responsible lending, and incentives for environmentally friendly projects. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Research on Biomass Waste Utilization Based on Pollution Reduction and Carbon Sequestration,"Biomass waste in agricultural and forestry production has low value, large volume, disordered texture, high water content, and high recycling costs, disturbing its biomass waste treatment. In terms of mainstream treatment methods, incineration directly releases carbon dioxide, dust, and other pollutants, while landfills produce carbon dioxide and methane with stronger greenhouse effects. In response to this problem—taking pollution reduction, carbon sequestration, and the resource utilization of biomass waste as the purpose—a mode of in-situ, harmlessness, homogenization, reduction, automation, inorganic transformation, resource utilization, and carbon sequestration is proposed, which reduces recycling costs and improves economic efficiency and operability with carbonization as the key technique. The carbonization mechanism of biomass waste was first investigated using TGA analysis to obtain the key technical parameters of in-situ carbonization, and then biomass carbonization was divided into two stages: in-situ carbonization and factory carbonization. Thus, a process is constructed for in-situ crushing, carbonization, screening, and recycling, which promotes the recovery efficiency of biomass waste, including domestic waste. Moreover, on the basis of massive experiments, a carbon-based material was invented where, through wide applications in architecture, huge carbon can be stored in building materials; thus, a novel method of biomass waste resource utilization, carbon sequestration, and artificial carbon pool construction was established. Among them, with the convenient collection of biomass waste as the premise, the economic and reasonable carbonization process is a pivotal step to guarantee the wide application of carbon-based materials, and pollution reduction and carbon sequestration are the final purposes. This novel mode is conducive to saving resources and realizing carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals with significant economic, ecological, and social benefits. The novelty lies in five aspects. Firstly, differing from current research on pollution reduction, carbon reduction, and carbon balance, further research on carbon sequestration was proposed. Secondly, the feasibility of reducing re-emission through carbon transfer was demonstrated. Thirdly, in-situ carbonization to recycle biomass waste was constructed. Fourthly, through carbonization, the inorganic transformation of biomass waste avoided carbon re-emission, especially methane emissions. Last but not the least, carbonization products achieved carbon sequestration and constructed an artificial carbon pool. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Enhancing biofilm formation in biofilters for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene removal by modifying the packing material surface","Polyurethane (PU) sponges are popular packing material in biofilters and their smooth and hydrophobic surface often leads to an uneven distribution and detachment of biofilms. In this work, the surface of PU sponge was modified to obtain higher roughness and positive charge. The performances of two biofilters (BF1 with pristine sponge and BF2 with modified sponge) for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) removal were investigated. Total Volatile Organic Compound (TVOC) removal efficiency and CO2 increment were 61% and 804 ppm for BF2 respectively after start-up, compared with 51% and 538 ppm for BF1. Analysis on biofilms showed that the modification of PU sponge significantly improved the microbial growth, viability and adhesive strength in biofilms, reduced extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and changed the microbial community. These results demonstrate that modified sponge can enhance biofilm formation and BTEX removal in biofilters and may applied in large-scale applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem services and poverty alleviation: A review of the empirical links,"We present the results of a review of the empirical evidence and of the state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms linking ecosystem services and poverty alleviation. The review was undertaken to determine the state of current knowledge about the scale and nature of these linkages, and focus the future research agenda. Research has, to date, focussed largely on provisioning services, and on just two poverty dimensions concerning income and assets, and food security and nutrition. While many papers describe links between ecosystem services and dimensions of poverty, few provide sufficient context to enable a thorough understanding of the poverty alleviation impacts (positive or negative), if any. These papers contribute to the accumulating evidence that ecosystem services support well-being, and perhaps prevent people becoming poorer, but provide little evidence of their contribution to poverty alleviation, let alone poverty elimination. A considerable gap remains in understanding the links between ecosystem services and poverty, how change occurs, and how pathways out of poverty may be achieved based on the sustainable utilisation of ecosystem services.

Food System and Water-Energy-Biodiversity Nexus in Nepal: A Review,"Water, energy, and biodiversity are essential components for building a sustainable food system in a developing country like Nepal. Green Revolution technologies and the package of practices largely ignored the role of ecosystem services, leaving a large population of small farmers' food- and nutrition-insecure. Biodiversity, especially, agrobiodiversity is in decline and this vital cross-cutting element is less discussed and interlinked in nexus literature. The interlinking food system with water-energy-biodiversity nexus, therefore, is essential to achieve a resilient food system. It ensures the vital structures and functions of the ecosystem on which it is dependent are well protected in the face of increasing socio-economic and climatic stress. This paper reviews the food system of Nepal through the lens of the food-water-energy-biodiversity (FWEB) nexus to develop a more robust food system framework. From this approach, food system foresight can benefit from different nature-based solutions such as agro-ecosystem-based adaptation and mitigation and climate-resilient agro-ecological production system. We found that the FWEB nexus-based approach is more relevant in the context of Nepal where food and nutrition insecurity prevails among almost half of the population. Improvement in the food system requires the building of synergy and complementary among the components of FWEB nexus. Hence, we proposed a modified framework of food system foresight for developing resilience in a food system, which can be achieved with an integrated and resilient nexus that gives more emphasis to agro-ecological system-based solutions to make the food system more climate resilient. This framework can be useful in addressing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, and 15 and can also be used as a tool for food system planning based on a broader nexus.",Not About Sufficiency
Identification of climate-resilient integrated nutrient management practices for rice-rice cropping system-an empirical approach to uphold food security,"Yield datasets of long-term experiments on integrated nutrient management in rice-rice cropping systems were used to investigate the relationship of variability in rainfall, temperature, and integrated nutrient management (INM) practices in rice-rice cropping system in three different agroecological regions of India. Twelve treatments with different combinations of inorganic (chemical fertilizer) and organic (farmyard manure, green manure, and paddy straw) were compared with farmer's conventional practice. The intraseasonal variations in rice yields are largely driven by rainfall during kharif rice and by temperature during rabi rice. Half of the standard deviation from the average monthly as well as seasonal rainfall during kharif rice and 1 A degrees C increase or decrease from the average maximum and minimum temperature during rabi rice has been taken as the classification of yield groups. The trends in the date of effective onset of monsoon indicate a 36-day delay during the 30-year period at Rajendranagar, which is statistically significant at 95 % confidence level. The mean annual maximum temperature shows an increasing trend in all the study sites. The length of monsoon also showed a shrinking trend in the rate of 40 days during the 30-year study period at Rajendranagar representing a semiarid region. At Bhubaneshwar, the application of 50 % recommended NPK through chemical fertilizers and 50 % N through green manure resulted in an overall average higher increase of 5.1 % in system productivity under both excess and deficit rainfall years and also during the years having seasonal mean maximum temperature a parts per thousand yen35 A degrees C. However, at Jorhat, the application of 50 % recommended NPK through chemical fertilizers and 50 % N through straw resulted in an overall average higher increase of 7.4 % in system productivity, while at Rajendranagar, the application of 75 % NPK through chemical fertilizers and 25 % N through green manusre resulted in an overall average higher increase of 8.8 % in system productivity. This study highlights the adaptive capacity of different integrated nutrient management practices to rainfall and temperature variability under a rice-rice cropping system in humid, subhumid, and semiarid ecosystems.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimization of construction program for economic and environmental sustainability,"The construction industry plays a significant role in promoting economic development; however, it causes several environmental problems. Balancing economic and environmental sustainability (EES) is a key challenge for contractors. Obtaining a sustainable construction program necessitates a significant amount of time, manpower, and expertise in practice. This study develops a method to optimize the construction program with the goal of EES, which deploys the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III to rapidly solve this multi-objective optimization problem through Pareto front approximation. Variables and search spaces are defined, and two databases are established for global search. A fast and automated tool is developed based on the proposed optimization method, featuring a convenient workflow and user-friendly graphic user interfaces to lower the entry barrier. The effectiveness, applicability, and robustness of the developed method were validated through four diverse case studies, demonstrating its capacity to achieve carbon reductions of up to 49.02 % and cost savings of 34.54 %. This research helps contractors make informed decisions about the design of optimal construction programs and the sustainability challenges in construction. In addition, it contributes to the intelligent development of the construction industry. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Dynamic Optimal Control Strategy of CCUS Technology Innovation in Coal Power Stations Under Environmental Protection Tax,"Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology is an essential technology for achieving low-carbon transformation and upgrading of the coal power industry. This study applies optimal control theory to analyze the dynamic optimization of CCUS technological innovation investment in coal power stations under environmental protection tax.

The study shows that under both profit maximization and social welfare maximization conditions, a distinct saddle-point steady-state; the environmental protection tax affects technological innovation investment in coal power stations, which in turn affects electricity prices; the learning rate of knowledge accumulation also impacts technological innovation investment: under the social welfare maximization condition, the investment levels in technological innovation, technology, and knowledge accumulation are higher than those under profit maximization. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Wood processing for energy and char,"Australia's current interest in renewable energy is based on a desire to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions. Wood from sustainable sources offers a unique opportunity to combine greenhouse gas benefits with other significant environmental and social benefits, including salinity mitigation, carbon sequestration, soil replenishment and rural industry. The challenge is to make renewable energy from wood in a cost competitive manner, so that this broad range of benefits may be best realised. Bioenergy and carbon products are of great interest as new. commercial forestry products that can drive large-scale environmental tree planting: • In Western Australia, Enecon has worked with Western Power Corporation to build the first full-scale plant for integrated processing of mallee eucalypts, to produce activated carbon, renewable power and eucalyptus oil. It is intended that this plant is the first of a number of such plants to help catalyse environmental ttee planting in Western Australia. • New technologies being developed overseas may provide competitive bioenergy in areas where traditional markets for wood do not exist. For example, pyrolysis converts wood into a bio-oil that may be transported to remote sites for power generation in gas turbines. Pyrolysis also produces wood char. Pyrolysis and wood-to-ethanol technologies, coupled with short rotation coppicing trees, offer the long-term prospect of large-scale production of renewable fuels around the country.",Not About Sufficiency
Economics and planning of biodiversity conservation under uncertainty of climate change,"This chapter discusses the need for biologically and economically well-reasoned conservation decisions in a dynamic world, and stresses the potential insights gained using sound and theoretically consistent approaches combining biodiversity, valuation and decision modelling under uncertainty. Recent research on the potential long-term influence of climate change on biodiversity distributions and persistence is revisited. Environmental valuation may provide insight into how this may affect human well-being. The methodological challenges of measuring how society values biodiversity effects under climate change and the inherent scarcity and uncertainty are discussed. This indeed imposes changes in conservation priorities and the chapter illustrates and discusses adaptive management and the value of flexibility. The chapter concludes with an address to the need for geopolitical coordination of conservation efforts to halt the decline of biodiversity under climate change. © 2014 Shashi Kant and Janaki R.R.

Climate change impacts on sea-ice ecosystems and associated ecosystem services,"A rigorous synthesis of the sea-ice ecosystem and linked ecosystem services highlights that the sea-ice ecosystem supports all 4 ecosystem service categories, that sea-ice ecosystems meet the criteria for ecologically or biologically significant marine areas, that global emissions driving climate change are directly linked to the demise of sea-ice ecosystems and its ecosystem services, and that the sea-ice ecosystem deserves specific attention in the evaluation of marine protected area planning. The synthesis outlines (1) supporting services, provided in form of habitat, including feeding grounds and nurseries for microbes, meiofauna, fish, birds and mammals (particularly the key species Arctic cod, Boreogadus saida, and Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, which are tightly linked to the sea-ice ecosystem and transfer carbon from sea-ice primary producers to higher trophic level fish, mammal species and humans); (2) provisioning services through harvesting and medicinal and genetic resources; (3) cultural services through Indigenous and local knowledge systems, cultural identity and spirituality, and via cultural activities, tourism and research; (4) (climate) regulating services through light regulation, the production of biogenic aerosols, halogen oxidation and the release or uptake of greenhouse gases, for example, carbon dioxide. The ongoing changes in the polar regions have strong impacts on sea-ice ecosystems and associated ecosystem services. While the response of sea-ice–associated primary production to environmental change is regionally variable, the effect on ice-associated mammals and birds is predominantly negative, subsequently impacting human harvesting and cultural services in both polar regions. Conservation can help protect some species and functions. However, the key mitigation measure that can slow the transition to a strictly seasonal ice cover in the Arctic Ocean, reduce the overall loss of sea-ice habitats from the ocean, and thus preserve the unique ecosystem services provided by sea ice and their contributions to human well-being is a reduction in carbon emissions. © 2021 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Quality of bio-based fertilizers is decisive for improving soil quality in Europe-A meta-analysis,"Organic matter is a vital component of soils and decisive for soil health and sustainable food production. Agricultural soil use often decreases soil organic matter stocks and climate change may aggravate the situation, putting food security and ecosystem functioning at risk. Bio-based fertilizers (BBFs, most often waste or residue-derived) are a vital part of future circular economies focussing on closed nutrient cycles in food production and agriculture. It is unclear if BBFs have positive effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) because studies on BBFs were so far mostly focussed on plant nutrition and ran mainly as short-term pot experiments. We filtered, extended and reclassified the comprehensive meta-analysis of Chen et al. (2018) to elucidate the effects of bio-based fertilizers on SOC concentrations in European and North American long-term experiments. The revised data set consisting of 260 observations from 60 field trials (now including a minimum duration of 5 years) showed significant effects of BBF quality on SOC concentration when compared with minerally fertilized plots and elucidated the role of soil and site properties on the efficiency of BBFs to increase SOC. The extended data set showed that solid and carbon-rich BBFs were most efficient in increasing SOC concentrations.

Rio (1992) to Glasgow (2021): Three decades of inadequate mitigation of climate change and its slow onset effects,"This study reviews the global increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), alongside the accelerated climatic change and its slow onset effects (or events) between 1992 and 2021. The establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, and the simultaneous UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, generated the international efforts to tackle climatic change. Over the years, the UNFCCC-Conference of the Parties (COP) has led the efforts in climate change mitigation and adaptation, with many sequential meetings across the world. Three decades later, at the COP26 meeting in Glasgow in 2021, it is evident that climate change impacts have substantially worsened. Despite some uncertainties, it seems that over the last three decades, the climate change slow onset events, including 1) increasing temperatures, 2) glacial retreat, 3) sea level rise, 4) ocean acidification, 5) soil salinization, 6) land and forest degradation, 7) loss of biodiversity, and 8) desertification, have substantially exacerbated. Simultaneously, other (non-GHGs related) anthropogenic impacts, including habitat fragmentation, land-use and sea-use change and misuse, species overexploitation, environmental pollution, infrastructure constructions, and urbanization, have considerably increased. With the aim of achieving the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways 1.9 (SSP1-1.9) or SSP1-2.6 ultimate goals-keeping global warming in 2,100 below 1.5? or 2.0?, respectively, compared to preindustrial levels-it may still be possible to avoid climate change's irreversible tipping points. To reach this target, policymaking must become more decisive and proactive, with continuous risks assessment, frequent monitoring of outcomes and their compatibility to goals, implementing practical legislation tools, and assigning specific financial instruments, aimed at effectively tackling climate change slow onset events and related environmental issues. Substantial efforts should be invested in boosting climate change mitigation, while simultaneously targeting effective climatic change adaptation measures and promoting environmental conservation and restoration. Relying on tools such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will sustain provisioning, supporting, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services, thus improving water(-), food(-), environmental(-), energy(-), economic(-), health(-), and governance-security, while lessening the risks of social unrest, violent conflicts, mass migration, and other humanitarian catastrophes.",Not About Sufficiency
"Effects of microbial inoculants on soil carbon stock, enzymatic activity, and above ground and belowground biomass in marginal lands of Northern India","Restoration practices in marginal lands for food production are the most important sustainability challenge for humans at the global level. Nature-based solutions (NBS) are among the best interventions to improve soil health, which directly enhances the soil productivity and biodiversity for improved sustainability of ecosystems. Our field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of three inoculants, two of which were bacterial: Azotobacter chroococcum (T1), Acetobacter diazotrophicus (T2), and the third fungal: Aspergillus awamori (T3) on soil properties, plant biomass, enzymatic activities (phosphatase, dehydrogenase activity), and soil carbon stock in marginal lands. The experimental results clearly revealed that the inoculations significantly enhanced plant growth and biomass (p < 0.01). The soil enzyme (dehydrogenase and phosphatase) activities increased under T3 and T2 treatments in response to inoculation. Interestingly, the significant results were observed in T3 and T1 treatment in the 4th year of observation for soil carbon stock (53.06 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 51.41 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). The total soil carbon stock was found to be 38.60 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in control plots. The inoculation enhanced (p <= 0.05) the soil biological properties like microbial biomass carbon as 267.62 +/- 18.73 mu gg(-1) to 894.24 +/- 41.65 mu g g(-1). We conclude that selected inoculations in marginal lands can provide a suitable option for eco-restoration and can sequester more atmospheric CO2 in to stable carbon pools to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals and food security.",Not About Sufficiency
Biochar: A Synthesis of Its Agronomic Impact beyond Carbon Sequestration,"Biochar has been heralded as an amendment to revitalize degraded soils, improve soil carbon sequestration, increase agronomic productivity, and enter into future carbon trading markets. However, scientific and economic technicalities may limit the ability of biochar to consistently deliver on these expectations. Past research has demonstrated that biochar is part of the black carbon continuum with variable properties due to the net result of production (e.g., feedstock and pyrolysis conditions) and postproduction factors (storage or activation). Therefore, biochar is not a single entity but rather spans a wide range of black carbon forms. Biochar is black carbon, but not all black carbon is biochar. Agronomic benefits arising from biochar additions to degraded soils have been emphasized, but negligible and negative agronomic effects have also been reported. Fifty percent of the reviewed studies reported yield increases after black carbon or biochar additions, with the remainder of the studies reporting alarming decreases to no significant differences. Hardwood biochar (black carbon) produced by traditional methods (kilns or soil pits) possessed the most consistent yield increases when added to soils. The universality of this conclusion requires further evaluation due to the highly skewed feedstock preferences within existing studies. With global population expanding while the amount of arable land remains limited, restoring soil quality to nonproductive soils could be key to meeting future global food production, food security, and energy supplies; biochar may play a role in this endeavor. Biochar economics are often marginally viable and are tightly tied to the assumed duration of agronomic benefits. Further research is needed to determine the conditions under which biochar can provide economic and agronomic benefits and to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for these benefits.",Not About Sufficiency
Determining an equitable allocation of global carbon dioxide emissions,"Finding an equitable mitigation policy to combat global climate change is a major problem facing society today. Successful mitigation of climate change will require a decrease in global CO2 emissions and economic costs associated with reduced production of consumer goods. A critical consideration is the existence of an uneven distribution of benefits and damages associated with climate change, stressing the need for an equitable way to reduce CO 2 emissions. Literature in philosophy provides an outline of carbon allocation methods that advocate the use of ethical and moral reasoning behind international climate policy. However, evidence from recent economic and behavioral studies may be developed into a more equitable method of allocation by taking a capabilities approach, rather than consumption- or income-based measures of human welfare. Using the Human Development Index as a proxy for human welfare and a climate damage function representing the cost of lost ecosystem services, we determine a more equitable global allocation of CO 2 emissions. The implication is that developed countries that emit more CO2, may be able to reduce their consumption without necessarily reducing their quality of life. Also, less developed nations, that emit less, have an incentive to focus development efforts on improving the lives of its citizens, rather than increasing consumption of material goods.",Not About Sufficiency
Are Stakeholders Aware of the Contributions of Ecosystem Services for Their Well-Being? A Case Study of a UNESCO Geopark Project in Brazil,"Policy makers, scientists, non-governmental organizations, and practitioners are increasingly acknowledging the relevance of biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. This is however influenced by the personal awareness and interests of stakeholders, which can lead to conflicts about ecosystem management and conservation priorities. In the Global South, where poverty and power asymmetries are more pronounced, inclusive approaches to decision making are crucial to achieve sustainable development ""leaving no one behind."" We assessed awareness of different stakeholder groups in the Corumbata & iacute; watershed, a UNESCO Geoparks project, about the relevance of ES for their well-being (WB) to determine if the perceptions about their relevance differ among them. We found that stakeholders selected regulating and cultural services as the most relevant ES, while security and health emerged as the most relevant categories of WB. Meanwhile, we found lack of awareness about the relevance of some ES underpinning WB categories they highly valued, e.g., groundwater recharge or rain regulation and its relevance for potable water availability. Gender, education, and age had a significant effect on the valuation of ES and WB categories, with women linking provisioning ES to both security and basic material WB and men connecting provisioning services more often to security. Assessing stakeholders' perceptions about the relevance of ES for their WB can shed light on personal socio-ecological relations.

The role of taxation in environmental sustainability in G-20 economies: A double dividend theoretical assessment,"This study analyses the influence of environmental taxes, renewable energy, economic growth, green innovation and financial development on environmental sustainability in G-20 countries from 1990 to 2022. To this end, the Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) was applied to obtain the reference results, complemented with Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS) and Driscoll-Kraay techniques to perform a comparative analysis. Our results confirm a negative relationship between environmental taxes and sustainability in all quantiles, although this relationship is only significant in the middle and upper quantiles. Furthermore, it is evident that economic growth significantly improves environmental sustainability, supporting the “double dividend” hypothesis, which argues that revenues generated by environmental taxes can be used to finance tax reductions in other areas while contributing to the regulation of environmental degradation. Our findings also show that renewable energy and green innovations play a key role in improving environmental sustainability, underlining the relevance of such variables as fundamental pillars for the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG-7. On the other hand, a positive relationship between financial development and environmental sustainability is identified in the lower quantiles. In contrast, in the upper quantiles, this relationship becomes negative, although not significant. These findings are consistent with the robustness tests performed, which incorporate the use of FMOLS and Driscoll-Kraay standard error estimators. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Bridging the gap in deep seafloor management: Ultra fine-scale ecological habitat characterization of large seascapes,"The United Nations' sustainable development goal to designate 30% of the oceans as marine protected areas by 2030 requires practical management tools, and in turn ecologically meaningful mapping of the seafloor. Particularly challenging is the mesophotic zone, a critical component of the marine system, a biodiversity hotspot, and a potential refuge. Here, we introduce a novel seafloor habitat management workflow, integrating cm-scale synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) and multibeam bathymetry surveying with efficient ecotope characterization. In merely 6 h, we mapped ~5 km2 of a complex mesophotic reef at sub-metric resolution. Applying a deep learning classifier on the SAS imagery, we classified four habitats with an accuracy of 84% and defined relevant fine-scale ecotones. Visual census with precise in situ sampling guided by SAS images for navigation were utilized for ecological characterization of mapped units. Our preliminary fish surveys indicate the ecological importance of highly complex areas and rock/sand ecotones. These less abundant habitats would be largely underrepresented if surveying the area without prior consideration. Thus, our approach is demonstrated to generate scalable habitat maps at resolutions pertinent to relevant biotas, previously inaccessible in the mesophotic, advancing ecological modeling and management of large seascapes. © 2025 The Author(s).

Patterns of mekong mollusc biodiversity: Identification of emerging threats and importance to management and livelihoods in a region of globally significant biodiversity and endemism,"The Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) is a key biodiversity hotspot. To facilitate conservation and management, we examine mollusc biodiversity patterns and distribution along LMB's longitudinal gradients, identify environmental drivers, and discuss the importance of these drivers to management. Cluster analysis, redundancy analysis (RDA), and variation partitioning were conducted using mollusc data collected from 63 sampling sites. Results indicated that species diversity is dominated by gastropods (61%) and bivalves (39%) and feeding trait diversity by scrapers (52%) and filter-collectors (37%). Only 48 species (49%) out of 98 taxa have been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) including a growing number of invasive species. The lack of complete, up-to-date information highlights the need for more research on both native and alien species. Cluster analysis revealed a clear mollusc biodiversity structure along the LMB's longitudinal segments. Diversity was lowest in upstream tributaries, increased in upstream main channels, and was highest in downstream channels and the Mekong delta, the exception being the observed high gastropod abundance in Chi-Mun river mouth and Luang Prabang areas. The RDA and variation partitioning demonstrated that combined physical-chemical and climatic conditions are the key drivers of biodiversity patterns. Given the potential spread of invasive alien species and increasing anthropogenic impacts, further ecological research, regular monitoring, and adaptive management are needed to sustain mollusc biodiversity and associated ecosystem services, which contribute to food security, nutrition, and livelihoods in the LMB. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Tourism and Protected Areas in India-A Symbiotic Relationship,"Protected areas (PAs) and tourism share a symbiotic relationship, with PAs offering unique and pristine environments for tourism, while tourism provides economic support for conservation efforts. This review explores the status and growth of PAs in India, which cover approximately 5% of the country’s geographical area, and highlights the interrelationship between tourism and PAs. The study also examines the legislative framework, acts, programs, and bodies responsible for notifying and managing PAs, with an emphasis on tourism in India. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) defines PAs as clearly defined geographical spaces dedicated to the long-term conservation of nature, associated ecosystem services, and cultural values. Protected areas play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation, maintaining key habitats, providing refugia, and ensuring the maintenance of natural processes across the landscape. They also contribute to human well-being by providing livelihoods, drinking water, and food security. Well-managed PAs with participatory and equitable governance mechanisms yield significant benefits beyond their boundaries, contributing to poverty reduction and sustainable development. As the impact of climate change threatens the planet, PAs offer a solutionfor both mitigation and adaptation responses. The study emphasizes the importance of better managed, connected, governed, and financed PAs in addressing the challenges posed by climate change and achieving conservation goals. © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Multi-structure hollow nanofibers electrode materials for secondary batteries,"With the diversified development of human energy consumption, traditional fossil energy such as coal, oil and natural gas can no longer satisfy people’s needs for industry and high quality life. Furthermore, the use of these energy sources often leads to severe environmental pollution. The emergence of clean energy sources like wind energy, water energy and solar energy not only effectively alleviates the issues of energy scarcity and environmental pollution but also promises a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future for global society. However, the efficient storage and utilization of these clean energy sources have become particularly crucial. The development of the new clean energy has continuously stimulated researchers to explore advanced devices for the electrochemical energy storage. Secondary battery has many advantages in electrochemical energy storage technology, such as portability and flexibility, high energy conversion efficiency and environmental friendliness, and is considered to be one of the most promising energy storage technologies at present. Therefore, the development of efficient new energy secondary batteries is the important way to achieve the goal of “carbon peak and carbon neutrality”. As typical representatives of new-generation secondary batteries, lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries play significant roles in our daily lives. Especially with the improvement of human living standards, there are higher demands for battery capacity, rate performance, and long-term cycling stability. In recent years, it has been discovered that the reasonable design of the structure and composition for anode/cathode materials is the key to achieve high performance secondary batteries. Structural design can significantly enhance the effective capacity and long-term cycling stability of existing materials. The design of electrode material composition can achieve synergistic effects between multiple components, enabling efficient redox reactions. Multi-structure hollow nanofiber materials have the advantages of controllable structure and adjustable composition, and are widely used as electrode materials for secondary batteries. In terms of structure, the multi-structure hollow nanostructure effectively alleviates the volume change of the electrode material in the electrochemical reaction process, prevents the electrode material pulverization and aggregation, increases the effective contact area between the electrolyte and the electrode material, and shorters the ion/electron transport path. In terms of composition, it is easy to achieve reasonable coupling of materials with different characteristics, so as to achieve specific adsorption of different materials, improve the conductivity of electrode materials, and accelerate the kinetics of redox reaction. In this review, representative methods for preparing multi-structure hollow nanofibers are summarized, including single-needle electrospinning, multi-fluid electrospinning and other synthesis methods (template method, hydrothermal method, and self-assembly method, etc.). Subsequently, we have summarized the application progresses of multi-structure hollow fibers with different structures and compositions in secondary batteries (including lithium-/sodium-/potassium-ion batteries, lithium/sodium-sulfur batteries, lithium-metal/air batteries, supercapacitors, etc.). Finally, we present the challenges and the application potential on the future research of multi-structure hollow nanofiber materials in the field of electrochemical energy storage. © 2024 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

An Integrative lifecycle design approach based on carbon intensity for renewable-battery-consumer energy systems,"Driven by sustainable development goals and carbon neutrality worldwide, demands for both renewable energy and storage systems are constantly increasing. However, the lack of an appropriate approach without considering renewable intermittence and demand stochasticity will lead to capacity oversizing or undersizing. In this study, an optimal design approach is proposed for integrated photovoltaic-battery-consumer energy systems in the form of a m2-kWp-kWh relationship in both centralized and distributed formats. Superiorities of the proposed matching degree approach are compared with the traditional uniformity approach, in photovoltaic capacity, battery capacity, net present value and lifecycle carbon intensity. Results showed that the proposed method is superior to the traditional approach with higher net present value and lower carbon intensity. Furthermore, the proposed method can be scaled and applied to guide the design of photovoltaic-battery-consumer energy systems in different climate zones, promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality globally. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Path and Method of Urban Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutralization Based on Random Matrix,"With the intensification of global climate change and environmental degradation, achieving urban carbon peak and carbon neutrality has become a common focus of international attention. Traditional optimization methods often overlook uncertainty factors and dynamic changes in data when dealing with urban energy systems and carbon emissions issues. Therefore, this study introduces random matrix theory and proposes a new path and method for urban carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. This work explores the concept of building thermal inertia in depth and establishes a mathematical model of building temperature considering thermal inertia, providing strong model support and theoretical basis for the formulation of optimization strategies for community level integrated energy systems. By analyzing the total and per capita carbon emissions at the provincial level, the distribution pattern of ""high in the north and low in the south"" was revealed, and the important impact of climate factors on carbon emission differences was emphasized. Through a double-layer optimization algorithm, we fully utilized the thermal inertia of buildings and achieve more economical carbon emission optimization than traditional algorithms. In addition, we also used the relative index of the Theil index and the absolute index of the Gini coefficient to rigorously test the fairness of the allocation results, and the results showed that the per capita carbon emissions of Chinese urban residents in 2025 after comprehensive allocation were relatively fair. This study not only provides new theoretical support and empirical methods for urban carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, but also helps to promote fair distribution of carbon emissions at the provincial level, providing useful references for achieving national and even global low-carbon development goals. © 2025 The author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Enhancement of anaerobic treatment of antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater through the development of iron-based and carbon-based materials: A critical review,"The extensive use of antibiotics has created an urgent need to address antibiotic wastewater treatment, posing significant challenges for environmental protection and public health. Recent advances in the efficacy and mechanisms of conductive materials (CMs) for enhancing the anaerobic biological treatment of antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater are reviewed. For the first time, the focus is on the various application forms of iron-based and carbon-based CMs in strengthening the anaerobic methanogenic system. This includes the use of single CMs such as zero-valent iron (ZVI), magnetite, biochar (BC), activated carbon (AC), and graphene (GP), as well as iron-based and carbon-based composite CMs with diverse structures. These structures include mixed, surface-loaded, and core-shell combinations, reflecting the development of CMs. Iron-based and carbon-based CMs promote the rapid removal of antibiotics through adsorption and enhanced biodegradation. They also mitigate the inhibitory effects of toxic pollutants on microbial activity and reduce the expression of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Additionally, as effective electron carriers, these CMs enrich microorganisms with direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) functions, accelerate interspecies electron transfer, and facilitate the conversion of organic matter into methane. Finally, this review proposes the use of advanced molecular detection technologies to clarify microbial ecology and metabolic mechanisms, along with microscopic characterization techniques for the modification of CMs. These methods can provide more direct evidence to analyze the mechanisms underlying the cooperative anaerobic treatment of refractory organic wastewater by CMs and microorganisms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Implementation of good agricultural practices for rural environmental management,"The rural systems have been submitted to a process of increasing conversion that has provoked big structural and functional changes in the agroecosistemas of the region. The replacement of natural pastures and native forests for artificial meadows and the substitution of these for annual cultures with the incorporation of technology, allowed to raise significantly the economic productivity of these lands. But at the same time, they modified the flows of energy, the mineral cycles, the hydrological process, the stability and fertility of the soils, the habitat and the biodiversity of the region. The Region Pampeana Austral (RPA) is an example of how the changes in the use of the land sharpen the environmental problems and drive to a structural and functional simplification of the productive systems. The aim of this study is evaluate the environmental situation of a rural representative establishment of Tandil for the application of Good Agricultural Practices (BPA). The methodology has been divided in two stages: a) analysis of the points of control raised by the BPA, were used primary sources (direct observation in fieldwork, check list of the Manual BPA (2013), interviews semi-structured directed) and secondary sources (documentary records of the activities realized in the establishment, Manual of Good Agricultural Practices Global Gap (2013); and b) Matriz FODA was created for the comprehension of the environmental situation of the rural establishment evaluated of a cuali-quantitative and synthetic way. Of the total of the evaluated aspects, 60% of the points of control analyzed presents an environmental situation ideal or adapted for the incorporation of BPA and 40% of them an awkward situation. Then, it is possible to conclude that most of the processes and actions carried out in the rural establishment are favorable for the putting in BPA’s march. Nevertheless, it should be noted that there are impacts, such as those produced on biodiversity, that must be overcome to improve the environmental situation of unfavorable control points. The conclusions show that different measures to reduce impacts were identified. However, while incorporating techniques that increase sustainability in terms of soil conservation, the demand for energy inputs, agrochemicals and the amount of liters used per year increases. It is expected to provide a preliminary overview for the implementation of GAP, not only analyzing strengths and opportunities, but also taking corrective measures regarding threats and weaknesses. At the same time, it is intended to contribute to the analysis of the environmental management of agroecosystems, starting from the application to a specific case study and with a possible methodology to apply in other rural establishments of similar characteristics. It would be fundamental from this work the awareness of the producers, the incorporation of practices tending to the environmental sustainability and the development of policies for a future environmental territorial order. © 2018 Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria.

Unlocking synergies and managing trade-offs: how climate actions in Indian agriculture support the Sustainable Development Goals,"This paper assesses four relevant climate actions in Indian agricultural sector through the lens of United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to understand how climate actions (SDG 13) are linked with other SDGs and their targets and what measures can be taken to scale up these actions. Four board categories of climate actions are considered for this exercise: shift to less-flooded paddy water management practices; minimizing overuse of nitrogen-based fertilizer, system of rice intensification and climate smart agricultural practices. A mixed method has been followed: first, scoping review of literature between 2010 and 2022 is undertaken to capture the growing body of literature and then a normalized weighted score is used to understand the net strength of the linkages. Scoping review helped in identifying 100 studies spanned across Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and the eastern part of Peninsular India. Findings from the scoring method suggest that these practices have linkages with 15 SDGs and as many as 43 SDG targets. Almost all linkages are positive (synergy) but there are a few negative linkages (trade-offs) as well. Trade-offs include exacerbating inequalities including gender, high upfront cost, requirement of skilled labor, lack of access to information and finance.

Global Warming in Pakistan and Its Impact on Public Health as Viewed Through a Health Equity Lens,"Pakistan is extremely vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change. The recent monsoon season caused widespread, deadly flooding, affecting 15% of the total population when extreme heat waves were followed by the worst rains and floods in the country's history. But Pakistan was not the cause of its own misfortune. The atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) is the greatest contributor to climate change. If we look at the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we find that Pakistan is, like all developing nations, essentially a non-contributor of the problem, contributing considerably less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, although significant factors exacerbating the effects of climate change in Pakistan include an inadequate sewage system, air pollution from industrial waste, and deforestation, the country could not afford to proactively fix these, nor prepare for flooding and heavy rains. It lacks the funding for climate resilience efforts. As a result, Pakistan is suffering from a high prevalence of poor health outcomes. Children, the elderly, women, and the homeless, especially those living with poverty and disease, are at a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Since mitigating the devastating effects of climate change will continue to be an ongoing challenge for Pakistan, it urgently needs financial investment so that it can build climate-resilient infrastructures and institute mechanisms to deal with global warming's worst effects. Industrialized nations are responsible for global warming, and they must take responsibility for fighting global warming by helping developing countries cultivate greater public health emergency preparedness. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
"Economic growth, institutional quality and deforestation: Evidence from Russia","Forestry reserves have a crucial role in preserving ecosystems and global climate regulation, and Russia boasts the largest forested area in the world. Economic development entails various challenges for the environment, including a lack of forestry legislation or compliance, poor governance and unrestrained privatisation. This study investigates the role of institutional quality in explaining deforestation using panel-time series data for 75 Russian regions from 2009 to 2019. We apply a one-way autoregressive fixed-effect model with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors due to spatial dependence and time lags across Russian regions. The findings affirm the hy-pothesis of the environmental Kuznets curve for deforestation, implying that after surpassing a threshold point of gross regional product per capita, deforestation decreases. Poor institutional quality significantly increases the deforestation rate, which remains robust when considering the timber harvesting volume. The results affirm our proposition that the Russian forestry preservation policy is somewhat effective in reducing the deforestation rate.

Severe ecological impacts caused by one of the worst orphan oil spills worldwide,"Orphan oil spills pose a severe risk to ocean sustainability; however, they are understudied. We provide the first synthetic assessment of short-term ecological impacts of the most extensive oil spill in tropical oceans, which affected 2900 km of Brazil's coastline in 2019. Oil ingestion, changes in sex ratio and size of animals, morphological abnormalities of larvae and eggs, mutagenic, behavioral, and morphological alterations, contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and mortality were detected. A decrease in species richness and abundance of oil-sensitive animals, an increase in opportunistic and oil-tolerant organisms, and simplification of communities was observed. The impacts were observed in sponges, corals, mollusks, crustaceans, polychaetes, echinoderms, turtles, birds, fish, and mammals. The majority of studies were conducted on bioindicator substrate-associated organisms, with 68.4% of the studies examining the benthos, 21.2% the nekton, and 10.4% the plankton. Moreover, most of the current short-term impacts assessment studies were focused on the species level (66.7%), with fewer studies on the community level (19%), and even fewer on oil-affected ecosystems (14.3%). Oil-related impacts were detected in five sensitive habitats, including blue-carbon ecosystems (e.g., mangroves and seagrass beds) and coastal reefs. These results call for the development of new ocean-basin observation systems for orphan spills. Finally, we discuss how these mysterious oil spills from unknown sources pose a risk to sustainable development goals and ocean-based actions to tackle global climate change. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Embracing complexities in agricultural water management through nexus planning,"A major challenge for agricultural water management (AWM) in the 21st century is to feed a growing population in the face of increasing intersectoral resource competition, evolving diets, degradation, pandemics, geopolitical conflicts and climate change. This has to be achieved within the planetary boundaries and without compromising the livelihood and environmental (ecosystem) objectives linked to water, including provisioning, supporting and regulating services. This paper uses a systems and nexus lens to unravel the centrality and complexities in AWM, with particular emphasis on the interconnected dimensions and objectives of AWM, as well as its practices and technologies. AWM exists beyond water and food with linkages to human and environmental well-being. AWM needs to catalyse transformation and integrate approaches across systems, users and scales to meet its objectives in a changing climate. It must provide perspectives beyond productivity, managing water risks and safeguarding food security – as important as these are – and integrate our understanding of the interconnected climate, land, water, food and ecosystems to address planetary health outcomes. By doing so, AWM could catalyse contextualised, equitable, innovative solutions that acknowledge local socio-economic and institutional structures and limitations while catalysing sustainable development and climate resilience. © 2024 The Author(s).

Strengthening mycology research through coordinated access to microbial culture collection strains,"Well-managed genetic resources and associated metadata are essential to underpin research addressing the challenges to food security, healthcare, climate change, biodiversity, environment, education and our bio-based economy. Culture collections have supported microbiology research for over 100 years, whether they are collections belonging to individual scientists or institutional repositories. The 790 collections registered with the World Data Centre for Microorganisms (WDCM) together hold over three million strains representing a wide range of microbial diversity. This review provides an overview of the uses and outputs of collections that support work in mycology, agriculture and the environment. Further, it focusses on the advantages of coordinating efforts and establishes recommendations to improve resource provisions for research and the development of the necessary infrastructure. The CABI living resource collection provides an example that holds over 28,000 strains of fungi from 100 years of research in mycology. In the modern era, microbial interventions and solutions require knowledge not only of those microorganisms that can be grown and preserved axenically but also whole microbial communities: i.e. ‘microbiomes’. Current technologies enable us to access this latter, hidden resource, thereby facilitating a better understanding of how to harness and manipulate microbial communities to improve crop yields and allow successful interventions such as biocontrol of pests, diseases and invasive species. The WDCM Analyzer of Bio-resource Citations reports that 79,224 strains from 131 collections from 50 countries have been cited in 145,133 papers published in 50,307 journals from January, 1953 until April, 2020. These organisms have a multitude of uses, for example as sources of antibiotics, therapeutic drugs and other active agents. They have been applied widely including in the biodegradation, bioremediation, biotransformation and biotreatment of wastes. Further uses include interventions in agriculture for soil and plant health or biological control of pests and diseases. All of the above may be achieved by individual institutions but, by working together, collections can form a critical mass to focus on key global issues and can achieve much more. Mechanisms are suggested for coordinating collections in order to deliver a more comprehensive support system in the advancement of science and innovation. © 2020, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"How to measure, report and verify soil carbon change to realize the potential of soil carbon sequestration for atmospheric greenhouse gas removal","There is growing international interest in better managing soils to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) content to contribute to climate change mitigation, to enhance resilience to climate change and to underpin food security, through initiatives such as international ‘4p1000’ initiative and the FAO's Global assessment of SOC sequestration potential (GSOCseq) programme. Since SOC content of soils cannot be easily measured, a key barrier to implementing programmes to increase SOC at large scale, is the need for credible and reliable measurement/monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) platforms, both for national reporting and for emissions trading. Without such platforms, investments could be considered risky. In this paper, we review methods and challenges of measuring SOC change directly in soils, before examining some recent novel developments that show promise for quantifying SOC. We describe how repeat soil surveys are used to estimate changes in SOC over time, and how long-term experiments and space-for-time substitution sites can serve as sources of knowledge and can be used to test models, and as potential benchmark sites in global frameworks to estimate SOC change. We briefly consider models that can be used to simulate and project change in SOC and examine the MRV platforms for SOC change already in use in various countries/regions. In the final section, we bring together the various components described in this review, to describe a new vision for a global framework for MRV of SOC change, to support national and international initiatives seeking to effect change in the way we manage our soils. © 2019 The Authors.

"Ensuring Co-benefits for Biodiversity, Climate Change and Sustainable Development","Significant investments are required by Parties to the three Rio Conventionsâ€”Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), as well as the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda), to meet the ambitious goals that countries have agreed to. When the development of national and subnational frameworks to meet global commitments are conducted in isolation, the opportunity is lost to: (1) leverage co-benefits from the same investment; (2) use resources more efficiently; and (3) ensure that one action does not negatively affect another policy priority. For example, investments in greenhouse gas reduction have the potential either to positively impact biodiversity and sustainable development, or to result in unintended negative consequences; chances of positive synergies are greatly increased by cooperation and joint policy, planning and implementation. The challenge now is to learn lessons from the vast and diverse number of approaches being tried around the world and to enhance co-benefits. This paper describes the major inter-linkages between global commitments for conservation and development. It demonstrates the importance of enhancing synergies among global agreements and avoiding unintended and negative consequences, particularly on biodiversity, by providing examples of best practices and describing some of the pitfalls that occur when implementation of one agreement does not explicitly seek to enhance co-benefits with other agreements. In conclusion, the paper presents the case for the central role of nature-based solutions in simultaneously attaining global commitments for biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Lagoons of Effluvia: Worlding Beyond Energy Feedstock,"Environmental justice and climate justice activists routinely find themselves participating in state-led processes to determine energy futures and the built environment that follows. At stake is reproducing worlds of enclosure in the name of resilience, sustainability, innovation, carbon neutrality, and just transitions. This narrative performs a close reading of environmental justice activists' participation in California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) alongside the landscape of San Joaquin Valley's lagoons of effluvia. I draw on extensive fieldwork with environmental justice activists, decolonial theories on worlding, and the theory of agonism to present interventions that interrupt state-led imaginaries to instead multiply worlds within worlds.",Not About Sufficiency
Addressing Abiotic Stresses and Advancing SDGs by Biochar for Sustainable Agriculture and Environmental Restoration,"G LOBAL FOOD production is declining due to land degradation and cultivation issues, influenced by various factors, such as erratic changes in the climate, growing industrial and mining sectors, pesticide usage, and a greater reliance on wastewater for farming. Biochar offers a solution to maintain agricultural productivity by mitigating the adverse effects of climate fluctuations for example drought and waterlogging conditions are deteriorated factors for soil. They can immobilize both inorganic and organic pollutants through mechanisms such as co-precipitation, ion exchange adsorption, electrostatic attraction, and surface complexation, which lower their toxicity and bioavailability to plants in contaminated soils. Biochar application enhances the capacity of cation exchange and balance the acidity of the soil, water retention, microbial activity, and soil aeration. Consequently, biochar has been widely used as an additive to alleviate biotic stress in crops. This review examines how biochar amendments can assist plants in coping with adverse conditions, including salt and drought stress, and the role of biochar in fulfilling the goals of the different SDGs set by the United Nations. On pairing with stimulants like humic acid, compost, microbes, phytohormones, and nanoparticles, biochar may enable plants to endure and even flourish in harsh environments. Overall, biochar is an economical and effective method for addressing soil degradation and nutrient deficiencies, making it particularly suitable for plant cultivation in the affected areas.",Not About Sufficiency
"Agroforestry for sustainable livelihoods: role of geo-informatics, ICT, and citizen science","Agroforestry, an integrated land use system that combines trees, crops, and livestock, offers significant ecological and socioeconomic benefits, which are crucial for sustainable agriculture and climate resilience. This system enhances biodiversity, soil structure, and water management while providing livelihoods and reducing vulnerability to market fluctuations. Recognized for its potential to meet various sustainable development goals, agroforestry contributes to carbon sequestration, food security, and ecosystem services. The United Nation’s declaration of the International Decade of Restoration underscores its importance. In India, agroforestry practices align with diverse agroclimatic zones, supporting approximately 70% of the timber needs and significantly contributing to the rural economy. Advances in geo-informatics and data analytics have further enhanced agroforestry implementation by providing tools for effective monitoring, species mapping, and site suitability analyses. Challenges such as data accessibility and integration remain, necessitating investments in digital technologies and public-private partnerships to bolster agroforestry’s role in sustainable development.

Agroforestry: A Green Solution for Climate-Resilient Farming,"Agroforestry is an ecologically based management system that uses trees on farms and agricultural landscapes to diversify and sustain production, providing social, economic, and environmental benefits. It is particularly beneficial for small-scale farming in countries like India, which often face weather disruptions. Agroforestry promotes ecological stability and food security and mitigates climate change’s negative effects. This chapter explores the pivotal role of agroforestry in bolstering climate resilience within agricultural systems while examining the factors that influence its widespread adoption. Agroforestry offers a multifaceted approach to climate adaptation, enhancing soil health, water management, conservation of soil and water, and biodiversity, besides helping to ensure food and nutritional security and improve environmental quality. It contributes to mitigation efforts through carbon sequestration and diversified income streams. However, barriers such as policy constraints, land tenure issues, and limited technical knowledge hinder its adoption. To harness its full potential, concerted efforts from governments, non-government organizations (NGOs), and the private sector are essential. Addressing these barriers and promoting knowledge sharing can unlock agroforestry’s potential to create a sustainable, climate-resilient agricultural landscape. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

Microalgae from wastewaters to wastelands: Leveraging microalgal research conducive to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"The scientific evidence on applications of microalgae in bioremediation of wastewaters, increasing agricultural productivity, and biomass production strengthens their potential in supporting global socio-economic and environmental sustainability. Microalgae can consume organic compounds and pollutants present in domestic, agricultural, and industrial wastewater. This leads to biomass production in wastewater and water being relatively safe to be disposed of into water bodies and safeguard life in water. The extensive diversity of microalgae, encompassing a distinct array of physiological, reproductive, and functional traits, along with their remarkable efficiency in wastewater treatment, positions this group of organisms as exceptionally superior to other organisms. Molecular and biotechnological approaches have provided promising tools for improving the biomass production of microalgae from wastewater. Recent technological innovations have facilitated harvesting algal biomass from wastewater treatment plants for developing a range of bioproducts like bioenergy, biofertilizer and other various high value biochemicals. Microalgal communities and their biomass produced from wastewater are investigated for the restoration of degraded lands. The potential use of diverse microalgal species and their biomass from wastewater for restoration of degraded lands such as salt-affected lands, drought ridden arid areas, fly ash contaminated lands, and metal-polluted mine spoils is discussed. Moreover, this review elaborates on how use of microalgae from wastewater to wastelands can contribute to various sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Biomonitoring-Supported Land Restoration to Reduce Land Degradation in Intensively Mined Areas of India,"Land degradation due to mining is a major concern leading to massive losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services. The biomonitoring of metals in mine voids can help to keep track of ecosystem health. The present study was carried out in a large mine void that is presently used for fly ash disposal in the Angul district of Odisha, India. For the biomonitoring of the fly ash, composite soil and plant samples (non-edible as well as edible, naturally growing in and around the mine void) were collected seasonally four times between April 2018 and February 2019 from the sampling locations. We monitored the metal uptake (Al, Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) and bioaccumulation to assess the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) in the collected plant samples. The Fe concentration was reported to be high in Tragia involucrate (24.82 mg/kg) and Digitaria ciliaris (24.818 mg/kg), while the soil at the study site is also rich in Fe and Al. Higher concentrations of metals in fruit trees such as Psidium guajava and other plants such as Ficus religiosa, Ipomoea batatas, Delonix regia, Digitaria ciliaris, and Cynodon dactylon were reported from nearby areas. Understanding the presence of metals should be a guiding factor for reducing land degradation. Our study stresses the need for corporate commitment to ensure regular biomonitoring and biomonitoring-supported land restoration for degraded mining areas.

"Agrobiodiversity, Status, and Conservation Strategies","Agrobiodiversity is a critical subset of biodiversity and significant from the perspective of biodiversity conservation. India is one of the megadiverse countries that holds around 8% of the global biodiversity and has 18% of the world’s livestock. The country also has around 91, 000 animal species and 46, 000 plant species and which is 7% and 6.5% of the global flora and fauna, respectively. A large portion of the Indian residents is dependent on natural ecosystems for fuel, food, water, and medicine. Agrobiodiversity comprises the world’s diversity of genetic resources (species used for food, fiber, fuel, fodder, pharmaceuticals, varieties, breeds). Moreover, it encompasses the diversity of non-harvested species that support production (pollinators, predators, soil microorganisms, etc.) and the diversity of the agroecosystems. In addition to being essential for environmental stability, agrobiodiversity is also crucial for local economic development and livelihood. The locals’ dependence on agrobiodiversity is even more significant in areas without government-managed forests or protected areas. In India, the gene pool of native species of crops and cattle remained unnoticed for a long time. Around 140 native species of cattle are on the verge of extinction. The National Gene Bank has more than 300, 000 samples of indigenous plants which are no longer cultivated. Many crops are grown, but only a few are consumed in large quantities, causing food security and health issues. Agrobiodiversity management has been analyzed in this chapter to provide conservation options, processes, methods, and good practices to help create a shared understanding of agrobiodiversity and conservation. In situ, ex situ, and on-farm conservation practices need priority, and their strengthening and integration with the overall conservation plans of the Central government are required. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",Not About Sufficiency

Impacts of ecosystem service message framing and dynamic social norms on public support for tropical forest restoration,"The effectiveness of strategic psychology-based marketing techniques for increasing public support for conservation is poorly understood. We assessed how such techniques affect support for tropical rainforest restoration with a controlled online experiment with 1166 nationally representative residents of the United Kingdom. We tested whether support increased when adding ecosystem service (ES) framings to typical nongovernmental organizations’ (NGOs) biodiversity-focused messages that emphasize benefits to UK residents or people living near the tropical restoration site and a dynamic social norm nudge that emphasized increasing popularity of environmental restoration. We considered how respondents’ psychological traits (nature connection, self-efficacy, psychological benefits of supporting charities, awareness of environmental degradation in the Global South, and climate change skepticism) influenced responses. Outcomes included respondents’ reported advertisement sufficiency, sympathetic attitudes, behavioral support, and financial support. The study population typically found advertisements sufficient and exhibited sympathetic attitudes and financial, but not behavioral, support. Younger people exhibited greater conservation support than older respondents. Messages framed solely on biodiversity conservation were as effective as those highlighting additional ES benefits received by UK residents and people near the tropical restoration site. This suggests that framing around ESs, rather than nature's intrinsic value, may not strengthen public support for conservation. The dynamic social norm nudge had perverse effects. It reduced perceived social norms and most outcome variables. Alternative dynamic norm nudges warrant testing, but our results support research suggesting dynamic norm nudges can be ineffective when associated with activism, challenging their use by conservation NGOs. Psychological benefits of supporting charities and perceived self-efficacy increased support for advertisements, highlighting the benefits of including impact statements relating respondents’ support to specific outcomes. Climate change skepticism decreased support, whereas nature connection and perceived static social norms increased it, highlighting the need to increase nature connection and pro-environmental social norms to elevate public support for conservation. © 2024 The Author(s).

Estimating the Trade-Offs between Wildfires and Carbon Stocks across Landscape Types to Inform Nature-Based Solutions in Mediterranean Regions,"Climate and land-use changes have been contributing to the increase in the occurrence of extreme wildfires, shifting fire regimes and driving desertification, particularly in Mediterranean-climate regions. However, few studies have researched the influence of land use/cover on fire regimes and carbon storage at the broad national scale. To address this gap, we used spatially explicit data from annual burned areas in mainland Portugal to build a typology of fire regimes based on the accumulated burned area and its temporal concentration (Gini Index) between 1984 and 2019. This typology was then combined with carbon stock data and different landscapes to explore relationships between landscape types and two important ecosystem services: wildfire reduction and carbon stock. Multivariate analyses were performed on these data and the results revealed a strong relationship between landscapes dominated by maritime pine and eucalypt plantations and highly hazardous fire regimes, which in turn hold the highest carbon stocks. Shrubland and mixed landscapes were associated with low carbon stocks and less hazardous fire regimes. Specialized agricultural landscapes, as well as mixed native forests and mixed agroforestry landscapes, were the least associated with wildfires. In the case of agricultural landscapes, however, this good wildfire performance is achieved at the cost of the poorest carbon stock, whereas native forests and agroforestry landscapes strike the best trade-off between carbon stock and fire regime. Our findings support how nature-based solutions promoting wildfire mitigation and carbon stock ecosystem services may prevent and revert land degradation harming Mediterranean regions. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Opportunities to increase soil carbon sequestration in grazing lands in the southeastern United States,"Background: Grazing lands provide numerous ecosystem services, including the capacity to store large amounts of soil carbon (C); however, our understanding of the factors affecting soil C responses to management is inadequate. Methods: In this paper, we synthesized information about the impacts of grazing land management on soil C within the southeastern region of the United States. Results: Most studies (68%) demonstrated that proper management increased soil C stocks with an average C accumulation rate of 1.4 Mg C ha−1 year−1. The remaining (32%) studies showed no effect of management on soil C. None of the studies reported negative impacts of management on soil C. The largest increase in soil C (8 Mg C ha−1 year−1) was associated with the conversion of cropland to pastureland while overseeding legumes into grass pastures resulted in the lowest C sequestration rates (0.2 Mg C ha−1 year−1). Conclusions: Considering the rates of soil C accretion and the extensive area occupied by grazing lands, data in this synthesis confirm that the adoption of improved management practices can increase soil C sequestration in the southeastern United States. In addition, because most improved management practices can also have co-benefits, they may be favorable for forage and livestock production and other ecosystem services. © 2024 The Authors.

Who benefits from public sustainable finance in the EU?,"At this critical juncture in the climate crisis, public sustainable finance is increasingly recognised as crucial to addressing society’s socio-ecological challenges. However, we still know surprisingly little about its actual implementation. This paper examines the EU Just Transition Mechanism (JTM), a pioneering sustainable finance policy aimed at alleviating the costs of the transition to a sustainable economy. I present a political economy framework to analyze who benefits from these investments and why, highlighting the role of bureaucratic departments with different types of expertise and interests. Based on original data collection, I show substantial regional variation in allocation of the JTM to 1) employment, 2) equality, and 3) carbon neutrality. Moreover, a substantial part of the JTM is not used for any of these three areas. Regression analysis further reveals that allocation to employment projects is more likely when a ‘Social Affairs’ department is involved, while ‘Environmental Affairs’ departments are linked to carbon neutrality.

Biochar as a negative emission technology: A synthesis of field research on greenhouse gas emissions,"Biochar is one of the few nature-based technologies with potential to help achieve net-zero emissions agriculture. Such an outcome would involve the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from agroecosystems and optimization of soil organic carbon sequestration. Interest in biochar application is heightened by its several co-benefits. Several reviews summarized past investigations on biochar, but these reviews mostly included laboratory, greenhouse, and mesocosm experiments. A synthesis of field studies is lacking, especially from a climate change mitigation standpoint. Our objectives are to (1) synthesize advances in field-based studies that have examined the GHG mitigation capacity of soil application of biochar and (2) identify limitations of the technology and research priorities. Field studies, published before 2022, were reviewed. Biochar has variable effects on GHG emissions, ranging from decrease, increase, to no change. Across studies, biochar reduced emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) by 18% and methane (CH4) by 3% but increased carbon dioxide (CO2) by 1.9%. When biochar was combined with N-fertilizer, it reduced CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in 61%, 64%, and 84% of the observations, and biochar plus other amendments reduced emissions in 78%, 92%, and 85% of the observations, respectively. Biochar has shown potential to reduce GHG emissions from soils, but long-term studies are needed to address discrepancies in emissions and identify best practices (rate, depth, and frequency) of biochar application to agricultural soils. © 2023 The Authors.

Multi-Scale Soil Salinization Dynamics From Global to Pore Scale: A Review,"Soil salinization refers to the accumulation of water-soluble salts in the upper part of the soil profile. Excessive levels of soil salinity affects crop production, soil health, and ecosystem functioning. This phenomenon threatens agriculture, food security, soil stability, and fertility leading to land degradation and loss of essential soil ecosystem services that are fundamental to sustaining life. In this review, we synthesize recent advances in soil salinization at various spatial and temporal scales, ranging from global to core, pore, and molecular scales, offering new insights and presenting our perspective on potential future research directions to address key challenges and open questions related to soil salinization. Globally, we identify significant challenges in understanding soil salinity, which are (a) the considerable uncertainty in estimating the total area of salt-affected soils, (b) geographical bias in ground-based measurements of soil salinity, and (c) lack of information and data detailing secondary salinization processes, both in dry- and wetlands, particularly concerning responses to climate change. At the core scale, the impact of salt precipitation with evolving porous structure on the evaporative fluxes from porous media is not fully understood. This knowledge is crucial for accurately predicting soil water loss due to evaporation. Additionally, the effects of transport properties of porous media, such as mixed wettability conditions, on the saline water evaporation and the resulting salt precipitation patterns remain unclear. Furthermore, effective continuum equations must be developed to accurately represent experimental data and pore-scale numerical simulations. Soil salinization refers to the excess accumulation of salt in soil to a level that affects crop production and ecosystem functioning. This poses existential threat to sustainable agriculture, food security, and soil fertility. Soil salinization is considered as one of the major drivers for desertification, resulting in a persistent loss of ecosystem services. It also imposes nutritious imbalances in plants that may induce significant alterations in Earth's organisms, ecosystems, and biodiversity. We synthesized recent advances on soil salinization at different length and time scales, ranging from pore to global scale, offering new insights, and presenting future perspective on the key challenges and open questions on soil salinization.

Regional comparison of the structure of human well-being related to ecosystem services in coastal areas of Japan: possible effect of anxiety unique to the ria coast,"People living in coastal areas have the advantage of accessing a high level of ecosystem services, but are also exposed to the dangers inherent in living by the sea in an area prone to natural disasters. To achieve sustainable utilization of the high ecosystem services of coastal areas, establishment of an effective marine policy based on regional characteristics of human–nature interactions is essential. We compared the structure of perceived satisfaction for five components of human well-being (‘Security’, ‘Basic material for a good life’, ‘Good social relations’, ‘Health’, and ‘Freedom of choice and action’) derived from coastal ecosystem services among three sites in Japan (Wakasa, Sanriku, and Shima) that share the same natural and social backgrounds: highly dependent on fisheries industry, located in the same climate regime (temperate zone), and have similar topographical features (ria coast). Structural equation modeling using the results from questionnaire surveys showed that the three sites shared a common basic structure of the interactions among the five components of human well-being. However, the intensity of interactions among components differed among the three sites. Questionnaire surveys on anxiety about natural disasters and future access to marine ecosystem services were simultaneously conducted at the three sites. The site-specific anxieties were responsible for the difference in the interactions among the five components of human well-being. We propose a method that quantitatively evaluates both positive (satisfaction) and negative (anxiety) aspects of respondents’ subjective assessment as a useful tool for understanding the diversity of human–nature interactions caused by the region-specific natural and social backgrounds of coastal areas. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Actions to halt biodiversity loss generally benefit the climate,"The two most urgent and interlinked environmental challenges humanity faces are climate change and biodiversity loss. We are entering a pivotal decade for both the international biodiversity and climate change agendas with the sharpening of ambitious strategies and targets by the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Within their respective Conventions, the biodiversity and climate interlinked challenges have largely been addressed separately. There is evidence that conservation actions that halt, slow or reverse biodiversity loss can simultaneously slow anthropogenic mediated climate change significantly. This review highlights conservation actions which have the largest potential for mitigation of climate change. We note that conservation actions have mainly synergistic benefits and few antagonistic trade-offs with climate change mitigation. Specifically, we identify direct co-benefits in 14 out of the 21 action targets of the draft post-2020 global biodiversity framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity, notwithstanding the many indirect links that can also support both biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. These relationships are context and scale-dependent; therefore, we showcase examples of local biodiversity conservation actions that can be incentivized, guided and prioritized by global objectives and targets. The close interlinkages between biodiversity, climate change mitigation, other nature's contributions to people and good quality of life are seldom as integrated as they should be in management and policy. This review aims to re-emphasize the vital relationships between biodiversity conservation actions and climate change mitigation in a timely manner, in support to major Conferences of Parties that are about to negotiate strategic frameworks and international goals for the decades to come. © 2022 The Authors.

"Assessment the impact of drought on vegetation carbon source/sink at a spatial scale and identify the dominant factors in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River Basin, China","Drought poses a severe threat to terrestrial ecosystems’ carbon sequestration function, which in turn affects regional sustainable development. Understanding its impact on carbon source/sink dynamics is crucial for addressing extreme climate change challenges. This study, based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model and soil heterotrophic respiration equation, the Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) of the middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin (MRYRB) from 2001 to 2019 were estimated and utilized to characterize the vegetation carbon source/sink. Additionally, four factors, namely, average surface temperature (AST), root-zone soil moisture (RM), drought frequency (DF), and drought intensity (DI), were selected and a multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model was applied to assess the dominant factors influencing vegetation carbon source/sink dynamics at the spatial scale. The results indicated that: (1) MRYRB vegetation acted as a carbon sink, showing an increasing trend.

Assessment of bioenergy plant locations using a GIS-MCDA approach based on spatio-temporal stability maps of agricultural and livestock byproducts: A case study,"Addressing the global challenge of energy sustainability and global directives on farming emissions, the United Nations, the European Union, and China have led with strict targets for clean energy, renewable share growth, and carbon neutrality, highlighting a commitment to collective sustainability. This work is situated within the ambit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), advocating for a transition towards renewable energy sources. With substantial and accessible bioenergy resources, notably in Hubei Province, China, biogas technology has emerged as an emission-cutting solution. This research, focused on the Jianghan Plain, employs an integrated approach combining spatial analyses with machine learning tools to evaluate crop yield stability over two decades, with the aim of maximising the biogas yield from agricultural byproducts, i.e., crop straw and livestock manure. Using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), which is informed by grey-based DEMATEL, 9 constraints and 13 environmental, social, and economic criteria were assessed to identify optimal sites for biogas facilities. The findings underscore the significant bioenergy potential of agricultural byproducts from the plain of 6.3 × 1012 kJ/year at an 11.4 kJ/m2 density. Stability analyses revealed consistent biomass availability, with rice in Gongan and Shayang and wheat in Jiangling being the primary contributors. Through the MCDA, 45–66 optimal biogas plants were identified across 4 critical counties (Zhongxiang, Shangyang, Jingshan, and Yichen), balancing the energy supply and demand under various stable scenarios. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the criticality of moderate biomass stability for stakeholder consensus and identified areas of high stability essential for energy demand fulfilment. Theoretically, this study offers a practical model for bioenergy resource exploitation that aligns with global sustainability and carbon neutrality goals to address the urgent need for renewable energy solutions amidst the global energy crisis. Practically, this study sets a precedent for policy and planning in environmental, agricultural, and renewable sectors, signifying a step forwards in achieving environmental sustainability and an energy-efficient future. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Assessment the impact of drought on vegetation carbon source/sink at a spatial scale and identify the dominant factors in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River Basin, China","Drought poses a severe threat to terrestrial ecosystems' carbon sequestration function, which in turn affects regional sustainable development. Understanding its impact on carbon source/sink dynamics is crucial for addressing extreme climate change challenges. This study, based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model and soil heterotrophic respiration equation, the Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) of the middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin (MRYRB) from 2001 to 2019 were estimated and utilized to characterize the vegetation carbon source/sink. Additionally, four factors, namely, average surface temperature (AST), root-zone soil moisture (RM), drought frequency (DF), and drought intensity (DI), were selected and a multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model was applied to assess the dominant factors influencing vegetation carbon source/sink dynamics at the spatial scale. The results indicated that: (1) MRYRB vegetation acted as a carbon sink, showing an increasing trend. Carbon sink was primarily located in Shaanxi's central region, while carbon source was primarily located in Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi's northern part. (2) Both the extent and severity of drought in the MRYRB showed a mitigating trend, presenting a spatial distribution of high-intensity low-frequency and low-intensity high-frequency.

Handling ecosystem service trade-offs: the importance of the spatial scale at which no-loss constraints are posed,"Context: Managing land use to promote an ecosystem service (ES) without reducing others is challenging. The spatial scale at which no-loss constraints are imposed is relevant. Objectives: We examined the influence of the spatial scale of no-loss constraints on ESs when one ES was optimised. Specifically, we investigated how carbon sequestration could be maximized at different spatial scales in France with constraints of no-loss on other ESs. Methods: We used a statistical model linking land use and land cover variables to ESs [carbon sequestration (CS), crop production (CP), livestock production, timber growth] in French small agricultural regions (SARs). We optimised CS at the country scale posing no-loss constraints on other ESs at increasing spatial scales, i.e., SARs (scenario ‘SARs’), department (‘DEP’), administrative region (‘REG’), and France (“FRANCE”). We analysed differences between optimized and initial configurations. Results: Optimized CS at the country scale increased with the spatial scale at which no-loss constraints were posed (~+ 0.51% for ‘DEP’ and ~+ 2.05% for ‘FRANCE’). The variability of ES variation among the SARs similarly increased. This suggested that constraints at larger scales lead to ES segregation. Correlations among ES variations changed with the scenarios (Spearman’s ρ between CS and CP was − 0.43 for ‘DEP’ and − 0.70 for ‘FRANCE’). This indicated that different land use strategies produce different degrees of enhancement/softening of ES trade-offs/synergies. Conclusions: A trade-off was highlighted: larger spatial scales promoted better performance of the target ES but also spatial inequality. We argue that addressing smaller scales will lead to land-sharing solutions that avoid the local environmental impacts of land-sparing strategies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Development and validation of an approach to the environmental and economic assessment of decarbonization projects in the oil and gas sector,"This article addresses the problem of selecting a priority decarbonization project for an oil and gas company aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The wide range of decarbonization options and assessment methods prompted the development of a comprehensive ranking system for project selection. This system incorporates both internal and external factors of project implementation, a two-stage algorithm that filters out unsuitable projects taking into account sustainable development goals, and a quantitative evaluation approach using absolute and relative indicators. The proposed system evaluates decarbonization projects by considering not only the reduction of emissions in both absolute and relative terms, but also the broader environmental, social, and economic aspects relevant to the oil and gas company and the national economy. It includes a ranking mechanism for identifying priority projects and integrates carbon regulation incentives and green taxonomy tools into the economic assessment for more precise comparative analysis. The quantitative assessment in absolute terms involves a specialized net present value calculation, which accounts for revenue from both carbon credit sales and the potential sale of new low-carbon products, if applicable. The proposed assessment provides for targeted analysis of specific performance indicators, such as the cost per unit of emissions reduced, tax and social security contributions per unit of emissions reduced, energy efficiency improvements, and other indicators used for additional assessments of projects under otherwise equal conditions.",Not About Sufficiency

"Carbon Sequestration and Biomass Assessment of Mott Grass (Pennisetum purpureum), in three Growth Stages in Barani Areas of Pothwar, Pakistan","Alternative renewable energy is getting progress in current era keeping in view of energy insecurity in the coming years and the ever increasing threat of environmental and social health due to the use of fossil fuel. Lingo-cellulosic biomass has seen getting fame as bioenergy crops in maintaining food security alongside fulfilling energy demands. Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) has turn out the promising nutritious forage to the livestock on the sustainable basis, feedstock for biofuel and also has proven to be environmental friendly. The purpose of this study is to assess the biomass production of mott grass and its capability to sequester Carbon from the environment in the barani areas of Pothwar region in Pakistan. The research study was conducted under rained condition in the field area of Rangeland Research Institute National Agricultural Research Centre Islamabad. In this regard an experimental plot of one acre area was established in the field area of RRI, NARC, Islamabad. Grass tuft of sized 15 cm was collected from the grass nursery of range land Research Institute (RRI) and plantation was carried out in one acre in barani condition. The area was laid down and plant to plant distance was 60 cm and row to row distance 90 cm kept in the research study area in RRI, NARC. The parameters of this experiment were included biomass production (BP) kg/ ha, carrying capacity (CC) kg/ha and carbon stock (CS) kg C/ha after interval of 21, 45 and 60 days along with the proximate analysis including protein content, crude fiber, ether extract, and total digestible nutrients. Significant results were obtained by applying ANOVA test on the data retrieved. All three factors (BP, CC and CS) showed maximum results after 60 days of growth. The result indicated that after the 60 days interval the animal unit per month gave the maximum fodder (7.0667 AU/M/Ha) that proposed to be grazed for large ruminants and then 21 small ruminants on the same biomass and also maximum forage production recorded 3882 kg/ha and it sequester carbon to up to 3560 kg C/ha in the given interval. Increase in fiber and ash content also justify the increase in biomass yield of the plant after interval of 60 days. The study indicates that Mott grass or Napier grass based on its high biomass yield is an effective approach in maintaining the fodder quality for animals on the sustainable basis and being bioenergy crop could make it a viable asset in declining the carbon burden off from environment and fulfilling the upcoming energy demands. © 2021, Pakistan Journal of Agricultural Research.

"Governance, financial development, and environmental degradation: evidence from symmetric and asymmetric ARDL","The relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation has been exhaustively explored from a theoretical and empirical perspective. However, most of the studies explore symmetric relationships, and none of these studies explicitly address the role of governance and financial development. Hence, this study uses both symmetric and asymmetric methods to investigate the linkage between governance, financial development, economic growth, and CO2 emissions in Pakistan over 1990–2018. The empirical findings show that governance supports environmental sustainability by reducing CO2 emissions. Moreover, adverse shocks in governance increase CO2 emissions. However, the findings of linear and nonlinear ARDL revealed that financial development increases environmental degradation by exacerbating CO2 emissions. Moreover, the results validated the Environment Kuznets Curve in Pakistan as more income reduces emissions. Our empirical results have several policy implications for environmental sustainability and sustainable development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable farming practices and soil health: a pathway to achieving SDGs and future prospects,"Sustainable farming practices aim to produce agricultural products at a low environmental cost, ensuring food availability for future generations. These approaches combine the production of agricultural crops and livestock for site-specific uses, with an emphasis on long-term objectives including satisfying the food supply worldwide, improving the environment, making the most efficient use of resources and boosting the welfare of farmers and society as a whole. Sustainability in farming is mostly dependent on soil health, which is the soil’s capacity to function within ecological and land-use boundaries. It enhances general wellness, maintains the purity of the air and water, and supports biological productivity. The depletion of soil functions brought about by modern agricultural intensification has an impact on ecosystem services and long-term productivity. The goal of sustainable farming is to raise fertility and organic matter in the soil. Key practices include carbon farming, conservation agriculture, integrated pest management (IPM), and precision farming. In order to support sustainable crop production, these techniques improve soil fertility, structure, and biodiversity. Going forward, research should concentrate on developing novel approaches to tackle the issues of climate change and global food security. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Socio-ecological evidence highlights that native Prosopis species are better for arid land restoration than non-native ones,"The selection of species for restoration projects requires decision-making to be based on scientific evidence as well as input and approval from local communities. To better guide future restoration initiatives, this study assessed the socio-ecological effects of two Prosopis congeners including the native Prosopis cineraria and the non-native P. juliflora (mesquite) in two different sites in Southern Iran. Soil parameters including pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, and total nitrogen as well as vegetation indices including native vegetation cover, diversity, and density were measured under both of the congener tree species. Furthermore, pastoralists' perceptions toward the colonizing ability of both Prosopis congeners, their impacts on ecosystem services, and people's livelihoods and human well-being were assessed through interviews and semi-structured questionnaires. The ecological results showed that areas with native P. cineraria had higher native vegetation cover, density, and diversity as compared to sites with the non-native P. juliflora. Soils under P. cineraria and P. juliflora generally showed similar properties, with some small differences between sites (especially for pH and nitrogen). The social results showed that pastoralists in both study regions perceived P. cineraria to be better for local ecosystem services and livelihoods and viewed it to have lower colonizing or invasion potential. It can be concluded that native P. cineraria is a better candidate for restoration because it provides more ecological and social benefits and poses fewer long-term threats. Caution should be taken when promoting non-native species such as P. juliflora for restoration. © 2022 Society for Ecological Restoration.",Not About Sufficiency
Can cropland management practices lower net greenhouse emissions without compromising yield?,"Smart cropland management practices can mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while safeguarding food security. However, the integrated effects on net greenhouse gas budget (NGHGB) and grain yield from different management practices remain poorly defined and vary with environmental and application conditions. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis on 347 observation sets of non-CO2 GHG (CH4 and N2O) emissions and grain yield, and 412 observations of soil organic carbon sequestration rate (SOCSR). Our results show that for paddy rice, replacing synthetic nitrogen at the rate of 30%-59% with organic fertilizer significantly decreased net GHG emissions (NGHGB: -15.3 +/- 3.4 [standard error], SOCSR: -15.8 +/- 3.8, non-CO2 GHGs: 0.6 +/- 0.1 in Mg CO2 eq ha(-1) year(-1)) and improved rice yield (0.4 +/- 0.1 in Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). In contrast, intermittent irrigation significantly increased net GHG emissions by 11.2 +/- 3.1 and decreased rice yield by 0.4 +/- 0.1. The reduction in SOC sequestration by intermittent irrigation (15.5 +/- 3.3), which was most severe (>20) in alkaline soils (pH > 7.5), completely offset the mitigation in CH4 emissions. Straw return for paddy rice also led to a net increase in GHG emissions (NGHGB: 4.8 +/- 1.4) in silt-loam soils, where CH4 emissions (6.3 +/- 1.3) were greatly stimulated. For upland cropping systems, mostly by enhancing SOC sequestration, straw return (NGHGB: -3.4 +/- 0.8, yield: -0.5 +/- 0.6) and no-tillage (NGHGB: -2.9 +/- 0.7, yield: -0.1 +/- 0.3) were more effective in warm climates. This study highlights the importance of carefully managing croplands to sequester SOC without sacrifice in yield while limiting CH4 emissions from rice paddies.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable applications of rice feedstock in agro-environmental and construction sectors: A global perspective,"Rice is second only to maize among the world's most important cereal crops, with a global harvested area of approximately 158 million hectares and an annual production of more than 700 million tonnes as paddy rice. At this scale, rice production generates vast amounts of waste in the form of straw, husk, and bran. Because of high cellulose, lignin, and silica contents, rice biowaste (RB) can be used to produce rice biochar (RBC) and rice compost (RC). Furthermore, RB can be used as sorbents, soil conditioners, bricks/concrete blocks, flat steel products, and biofuels, all of which make significant contributions to meeting United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). Although previous reviews have explored individual applications of rice feedstocks, inadequate attention has been paid to multifunctional values and potential multi-utilities. Here, we offer a comprehensive review of RBC and RC with respect to: (1) preparation and characterization; (2) applications as soil conditioners and organic fertilizers and their effects on soil-carbon sequestration; (3) remediation of toxic element–contaminated soils and water; (4) removal of colors, dyes, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, personal-care products, and residual pesticides from water; and (5) applications in the construction industry. Specifically, we describe the opportunities for the sustainable use of RBC and RC in the management of contaminated soils and water as well as the construction industry.

Waste management businesses and sustainable development goals-exploring linkages,"This study attempts to map the linkages between Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and waste management businesses. It also tries to understand the role that waste management businesses can play in achieving the common goals through the case of a waste management firm in Mumbai (India). Interviews with the firm’s key personnel are used for data collection in addition to other external sources. Using content analysis, we find that the firm’s presence can be seen on all the 17 SDGs. While 12 out of the 17 SDGs are impacted due to the business operations, the remaining five SDGs are affected due to the societal orientation of the firm. These impacts are weak, moderate or strong in nature. The findings of this study can be useful to policymakers in framing policies that can help businesses in this area and achieve SDGs at the same time.

The human and social dimensions of invasion science and management,"Biological invasions are a leading cause of global environmental change given their effects on both humans and biodiversity. Humans introduce invasive alien species and may facilitate their establishment and spread, which can alter ecosystem services, livelihoods, and human well-being. People perceive the benefits and costs of these species through the lens of diverse value systems; these perspectives influence decisions about when and where to manage them. Despite the entanglement of humans with invasive alien species, most research on the topic has focused on their ecological aspects. Only relatively recently have the human and social dimensions of invasions started to receive sustained attention in light of their importance for understanding and governing biological invasions. This editorial draws on contributions to a special issue on the “Human and Social Dimensions of Invasion Science” and other literature to elucidate major trends and current contributions in this research area. We examine the relation between humans and biological invasions in terms of four crosscutting themes: (1) how people cause biological invasions; (2) how people conceptualise and perceive them; (3) how people are affected – both positively and negatively – by them; and (4) how people respond to them. We also highlight several ways in which research on the human and social dimensions of invasion science improves understanding, stakeholder engagement, and management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Co-digestion of rice straw and cow dung to supply cooking fuel and fertilizers in rural India: Impact on human health, resource flows and climate change","Anaerobic digestion of cow dung with new feedstock such as crop residues to increase the biogas potential is an option to help overcoming several issues faced by India. Anaerobic digestion provides biogas that can replace biomass cooking fuels and reduce indoor air pollution. It also provides digestate, a fertilizer that can contribute to compensate nutrient shortage on agricultural land. Moreover, it avoids the burning of rice straw in the fields which contributes to air pollution in India and climate change globally. Not only the technical and economical feasibility but also the environmental sustainability of such systems needs to be assessed. The potential effects of implementing community digesters co-digesting cow dung and rice straw on carbon and nutrients flows, human health, resource efficiency and climate change are analyzed by conducting a Substance Flow Analysis and a Life Cycle Assessment. The implementation of the technology is considered at the level of the state of Chhattisgarh. Implementing this scenario reduces the dependency of the rural community to nitrogen and phosphorus from synthetic fertilizers only by 0.1 and 1.6%, respectively, but the dependency of farmers to potassium from synthetic fertilizers by 31%. The prospective scenario returns more organic carbon to agricultural land and thus has a potential positive effect on soil quality. The implementation of the prospective scenario can reduce the health impact of the local population by 48%, increase the resource efficiency of the system by 60% and lower the impact on climate change by 13%. This study highlights the large potential of anaerobic digestion to overcome the aforementioned issues faced by India. It demonstrates the need to couple local and global assessments and to conduct analyses at the substance level to assess the sustainability of such systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying change trajectory over the Sumatra's forestlands using moderate image resolution imagery,"Land use land cover change (LULCC) is the key to a wide range of regional and global environmental issues including land degradation, loss of biodiversity, climate change, food security, human vulnerability and environmental sustainability. Recently, the awareness on the LULCC has increased considerably in tropical regions, especially in related to the change in forestlands and other highly vulnerable areas such as the tropical peat swamp area. The high rate of forest conversion as well as agricultural development in inappropriate areas of Indonesia, particularly in Sumatra, has attracted international environmental concern as scientists further demonstrate the relationship between these changes and global climate change, biodiversity and other ecosystem services. In this study, we applied spatial analysis to investigate the feasibility in using long-term satellite datasets for detecting and quantifying the forest cover change in Sumatra. Then, we systematically identified the change trajectory of those changes. The results indicated several types of change such as agricultural development, forest cover change, either by forest fire or human factors, and temporary change in forest plantation area. Each change category has specific change mechanisms or processes, which then reveals the specific spatial model for each type. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Revamping ecosystem services through agroecology—the case of cereals,"Globally, farming systems are mostly dominated by monoculture, which has the advantage of profitability at the expense of ecological systems. Recent years have witnessed an increasing mo-mentum in global efforts to deploy sustainable agriculture practices that mimic ecological processes, with agroecology at the forefront. In addition to the ecological aspect, agroecology also encompasses economic and social aspects targeting the whole food system. Transformative agroecology has been recognized as a stepping stone to achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), due to its great potential to build climate change-resilient farming systems while enhancing ecosystem services and reducing biodiversity loss. Nonetheless, the available literature on the recent developments and future trajectories of the adoption of agroecology approaches for improving the production of cereals, the most important group of food crops, is limited. This review aims to highlight the blueprint of agroecology that can contribute to the achievements of the SDGs, allowing explicit interpretation of the term that will benefit twenty-first century agriculture. Using cereal crops as the case study, we provide insights into how far this field has come and the main barriers to its adoption, and conclude that this approach of “science for and with society” is the way forward for building a resilient future. © 2021 by the authors.

Using a Game to Educate About Sustainable Development,"Sustainable natural resource management is a high priority in the 21st century as it plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change and preventing some of its consequences like loss of biodiversity, land degradation, desertification, and the exhaustion of natural resources. This concern is reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which emphasize, among other factors, sustainable cities and communities, responsible production and consumption, and climate action. Achieving sustainable natural resource management begins with raising awareness and educating the next generation. Therefore, it is essential to develop educational initiatives that prepare young people to become responsible and proactive adults in promoting environmental sustainability across industries and communities. Additionally, these initiatives should develop critical and analytical thinking skills, nurture innovative mindsets for creating environmentally sound solutions, and enhance the ability to collaborate within multidisciplinary teams.

An innovative approach to combine solar photovoltaic gardens with agricultural production and ecosystem services,"Biodiversity and crop productivity are compromised by the ongoing worldwide decline of pollinator insects primarily driven by the narrow specialization of modern agricultural industry, dominated by monocultures and characterized by intensive herbicide and pesticide inputs. This approach has the double drawback of indiscriminately killing both invasive and beneficial insects while pauperizing the landscape limiting the areas of natural vegetation that normally provide habitat for pollinators. Here, an approach to develop green infrastructures (GI) is proposed (Ground Photovoltaic farms, GPv) to synergistically address ecological emergencies and socio-economic needs. Mainly, we focused on Nature-based Solutions (NbS) to foster pollination as a priority ecosystem service and medicinal herb production as a co-benefit, creating a shared value in the landscape. The results suggest that the replacement of ruderal herbaceous vegetation with selected autochthonous cultivated species in the area of GPv farms could increase land revenues by simultaneously improving the pollination ecological network and agricultural activities. The economic analysis of the proposed solutions indicates that the annual return rate of the initial investment for GPv farms-to-GI conversion is between 9 and 43%, with potential payback in three years. Hence, GI could become an ecological business model, capable of improving ecosystem services in the landscape, both private and public benefits. However, a transdisciplinary approach is important to share knowledge across the different stakeholders and bridge the information gaps typical of a sectoral perspective, creating a holistic vision of the involved professional skills and experiences. Its proper implementation requires the joint effort of all economic stakeholders together with technical and scientific experts to promote multifunctional land-use in GPv farms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Harnessing landscape heterogeneity for managing future disturbance risks in forest ecosystems,"In order to prevent irreversible impacts of climate change on the biosphere it is imperative to phase out the use of fossil fuels. Consequently, the provisioning of renewable resources such as timber and biomass from forests is an ecosystem service of increasing importance. However, risk factors such as changing disturbance regimes are challenging the continuous provisioning of ecosystem services, and are thus a key concern in forest management. We here used simulation modeling to study different risk management strategies in the context of timber production under changing climate and disturbance regimes, focusing on a 8127 ha forest landscape in the Northern Front Range of the Alps in Austria. We show that under a continuation of historical management, disturbances from wind and bark beetles increase by +39.5% on average over 200 years in response to future climate change. Promoting mixed forests and climate-adapted tree species as well as increasing management intensity effectively reduced future disturbance risk. Analyzing the spatial patterns of disturbance on the landscape, we found a highly uneven distribution of risk among stands (Gini coefficients up to 0.466), but also a spatially variable effectiveness of silvicultural risk reduction measures. This spatial variability in the contribution to and control of risk can be used to inform disturbance management: Stands which have a high leverage on overall risk and for which risks can effectively be reduced (24.4% of the stands in our simulations) should be a priority for risk mitigation measures. In contrast, management should embrace natural disturbances for their beneficial effects on biodiversity in areas which neither contribute strongly to landscape-scale risk nor respond positively to risk mitigation measures (16.9% of stands). We here illustrate how spatial heterogeneity in forest landscapes can be harnessed to address both positive and negative effects of changing natural disturbance regimes in ecosystem management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"New directions in pollinator research: Diversity, conflict and response to global change","Interactions between pollinators and their plant hosts are central to maintaining global biodiversity and ensuring our food security. In this special issue, we compile reviews that summarize existing knowledge and point out key outstanding research areas to understand and safeguard pollinators, pollinators-host plant interactions and the pollination ecosystem services they provide. The vast diversity of the pollinator-plant interactions that exists on this planet still remains poorly explored, with many being associations involving a specialist pollinator partner, although historically most focus has been given to generalist pollinators, such as the honeybee. Two areas highlighted here are the ecology and evolution of oligolectic bee species, and the often-neglected groups of pollinators that forage solely at night. Advances in automated detection technologies could offer potential and complementary solutions to the current shortfall in knowledge on interactions occurring between less well-documented plant-pollinator associations, by increasing the collection range and capacity of flower visitation data over space and time. Pollinator-host plant interactions can be affected by external biotic factors, with herbivores and pathogens playing particularly important roles. Such interactions can be disrupted by modifying plant volatile and reward chemistry, with possible effects on pollinator attraction and pollination success. Mechanisms which underpin interactions between plants and their pollinators also face many anthropogenic disturbances. Reviews in this issue discuss threats from parasites and climate change to pollinator populations and plant-pollinator networks, and suggest new ways to mitigate these threats. While the protection of existing plant-pollinator networks will be a crucial goal for conservation biology, more research is needed to understand how lost interactions in degraded habitats may be restored with mutual benefits to plants and pollinators. © 2020 The Author(s).

"Swidden counts: A Petén, Guatemala, Milpa system: Production, carrying capacity, and sustainability in the southern Maya lowlands","The traditional swidden (milpa) system practiced in Petén, Guatemala (in the southern Maya subtropical moist lowlands) closely resembles pre-Spanishconquest milpa farming. Evidence suggests that the Petenero milpa (a type of agroforesty)-based on 1:6-year crop:fallow cycles and two harvests/plot/year-is sustainable across time, does not deplete the resource base, is compatible with biodiversity conservation, and enables one farm family to produce enough to feed itself and two to three other families. By managing no more than 60% of Petén's 35,854 km2, traditional milperos (farmers) could have provisioned, by very conservative estimate, 3-4 million people. Greater knowledge of traditional milpa farming can help explain certain aspects of precolumbian Petén history and may help impoverished families in contemporary Petén cope with chronic food insecurity.

The Role of Sustainable Investment in Climate Policy,"Reaching the Sustainable Development Goals requires a fundamental socio-economic transformation accompanied by substantial investment in low-carbon infrastructure. Such a sustainability transition represents a non-marginal change, driven by behavioral factors and systemic interactions. However, typical economic models used to assess a sustainability transition focus on marginal changes around a local optimum, whichby constructionlead to negative effects. Thus, these models do not allow evaluating a sustainability transition that might have substantial positive effects. This paper examines which mechanisms need to be included in a standard computable general equilibrium model to overcome these limitations and to give a more comprehensive view of the effects of climate change mitigation. Simulation results show that, given an ambitious greenhouse gas emission constraint and a price of carbon, positive economic effects are possible if (1) technical progress results (partly) endogenously from the model and (2) a policy intervention triggering an increase of investment is introduced. Additionally, if (3) the investment behavior of firms is influenced by their sales expectations, the effects are amplified. The results provide suggestions for policy-makers, because the outcome indicates that investment-oriented climate policies can lead to more desirable outcomes in economic, social and environmental terms.",Not About Sufficiency
Making the most of our land: Managing soil functions from local to continental scale,"The challenges of achieving both food security and environmental sustainability have resulted in a confluence of demands on land within the European Union (EU): we expect our land to provide food, fiber and fuel, to purify water, to sequester carbon, and provide a home to biodiversity as well as external nutrients in the form of waste from humans and intensive livestock enterprises. All soils can perform all of these five functions, but some soils are better at supplying selective functions. Functional Land Management is a framework for policy-making aimed at meeting these demands by incentivizing land use and soil management practices that selectively augment specific soil functions, where required. Here, we explore how the demands for contrasting soil functions, as framed by EU policies, may apply to very different spatial scales, from local to continental scales. At the same time, using Ireland as a national case study, we show that the supply of each soil function is largely determined by local soil and land use conditions, with large variations at both local and regional scales. These discrepancies between the scales at which the demands and supply of soil functions are manifested, have implications for soil and land management: while some soil functions must be managed at local (e.g., farm or field) scale, others may be offset between regions with a view to solely meeting national or continental demands. In order to facilitate the optimization of the delivery of soil functions at national level, to meet the demands that are framed at continental scale, we identify and categorize 14 policy and market instruments that are available in the EU. The results from this inventory imply that there may be no need for the introduction of new specific instruments to aid the governance of Functional Land Management. We conclude that there may be more merit in adapting existing governance instruments by facilitating differentiation between soils and landscapes. © 2015 Schulte, Bampa, Bardy, Coyle, Creamer, Fealy, Gardi, Ghaley, Jordan, Laudon, O'Donoghue, ó'hUallacháin, O'Sullivan, Rutgers, Six, Toth and Vrebos.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem Services from Ecological Agroforestry in Brazil: A Systematic Map of Scientific Evidence,"(1) Brazil has great potential to expand the area under agroforestry, and thereby simultaneously enhance multiple ecosystem services. However, divergent interests are currently polarized between drastic environmental deregulation and public resource allocation to chemical-intensive land use versus conservation and sustainable agriculture. This highlights an urgent need for a comprehensive overview of the evidence of the benefits to society generated by agroforestry across Brazil. (2) We present a systematic map of the scientific evidence related to the effects of agroforestry on ecosystem services in Brazil. (3) Reviewing 158 peer-reviewed articles, published in international scientific journals (database: Web of Science), we identified a disproportionate emphasis on the Atlantic Forest. Very little research has been published on the Cerrado savanna, Pampa grasslands and Pantanal wetlands. Regulating services were much more frequently studied (85%) than provisioning (13%), while cultural services represent a major gap. A consistent positive effect of agroforestry was demonstrated for soil quality, habitat and food provisioning. Trade-offs were demonstrated for soils and habitats. (4) Our analysis identifies high-priority gaps given their critical importance for human well-being which should be filled: agroforestry effects on water provision and regulation. Moreover, they should assess other ES such as erosion control, flood protection and pest control to enable a more reliable inference about trade-offs.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecology: Ecosystem service supply and vulnerability to global change in Europe,"Global change will alter the supply of ecosystem services that are vital for human well-being. To investigate ecosystem service supply during the 21st century, we used a range of ecosystem models and scenarios of climate and land-use change to conduct a Europe-wide assessment. Large changes in climate and land use typically resulted in large changes in ecosystem service supply. Some of these trends may be positive (for example, increases in forest area and productivity) or offer opportunities (for example, ""surplus land"" for agricultural extensification and bioenergy production). However, many changes increase vulnerability as a result of a decreasing supply of ecosystem services (for example, declining soil fertility, declining water availability, increasing risk of forest fires), especially in the Mediterranean and mountain regions.",Not About Sufficiency
Research and development on climate change and greenhouse gases in support of climate-smart livestock production and a vibrant industry,"Climate change represents a feedback-loop in which livestock production both contributes to the problem and suffers from the consequences. The impact of global warming and continued, uncontrolled release of greenhouse gasses (GHG) has twofold implications for the livestock industry, and consequently food security. Firstly, the continuous increase in ambient temperature is predicted to have a direct effect on the animal, as well as on food and nutrition security, due to changes associated with temperature itself, relative humidity, rainfall distribution in time and space, altered disease distribution, changes in the ecosystem and biome composition. Secondly, the responsibility of livestock production is to limit the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) or the carbon footprint, in order to ensure future sustainability. This can be done by implementing new or adapted climate-smart production systems, the use of known and new technologies to turn waste into assets, and by promoting sustainable human diets with low environmental impacts. The following elements, which are related to livestock production and climate change, are discussed in this paper: (1) restoring the value of grasslands/rangelands, (2) pastoral risk management and decision support systems, (3) improved production efficiency, (4) global warming and sustainable livestock production, (5) the disentanglement between food and nutritional needs, focusing on nutrient rich core foods, (6) GHG from livestock and carbon sequestration, and (7) water and waste management. No single organization (or industry) within South Africa can perform this research and the implementation thereof on its own. The establishment of a (virtual) centre of excellence in climate-smart livestock production and the environment for the livestock industries, with the objective to share research expertise and information, build capacity and conduct research and development studies, should be a priority.",Not About Sufficiency
Global cropland could be almost halved: Assessment of land saving potentials under different strategies and implications for agricultural markets,"The pressure on land resources continuously increases not only with the rising demand for agricultural commodities, but also with the growing need for action on global challenges, such as biodiversity loss or climate change, where land plays a crucial role. Land saving as a strategy, where agricultural productivity is increased to allow a reduction of required cropland while sustaining production volumes and meeting demand, could address this tradeoff. With our interdisciplinary model-based study, we globally assess regional potentials of land saving and analyze resulting effects on agricultural production, prices and trade. Thereby, different land saving strategies are investigated that (1) minimize required cropland (2) minimize spatial marginalization induced by land saving and (3) maximize the attainable profit. We find that current cropland requirements could be reduced between 37% and 48%, depending on the applied land saving strategy. The generally more efficient use of land would cause crop prices to fall in all regions, but also trigger an increase in global agricultural production of 2.8%. While largest land saving potentials occur in regions with high yield gaps, the impacts on prices and production are strongest in highly populated regions with already high pressure on land. Global crop prices and trade affect regional impacts of land saving on agricultural markets and can displace effects to spatially distant regions. Our results point out the importance of investigating the potentials and effects of land saving in the context of global markets within an integrative, global framework. The resulting land saving potentials can moreover reframe debates on global potentials for afforestation and carbon sequestration, as well as on how to reconcile agricultural production and biodiversity conservation and thus contribute to approaching central goals of the 21st century, addressed for example in the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement or the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.",Not About Sufficiency
Community-based native seed production for restoration in Brazil – the role of science and policy,"Large-scale restoration programmes in the tropics require large volumes of high quality, genetically diverse and locally adapted seeds from a large number of species. However, scarcity of native seeds is a critical restriction to achieve restoration targets. In this paper, we analyse three successful community-based networks that supply native seeds and seedlings for Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado restoration projects. In addition, we propose directions to promote local participation, legal, technical and commercialisation issues for up-scaling the market of native seeds for restoration with high quality and social justice. We argue that effective community-based restoration arrangements should follow some principles: (i) seed production must be based on real market demand; (ii) non-governmental and governmental organisations have a key role in supporting local organisation, legal requirements and selling processes; (iii) local ecological knowledge and labour should be valued, enabling local communities to promote large-scale seed production; (iv) applied research can help develop appropriate techniques and solve technical issues. The case studies from Brazil and principles presented here can be useful for the up-scaling restoration ecology efforts in many other parts of the world and especially in tropical countries where improving rural community income is a strategy for biodiversity conservation and restoration. © 2018 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Not About Sufficiency
"Ecological Sustainability Assessment of Water Distribution for the Maintenance of Ecosystems, their Services and Biodiversity","Water provision and distribution are subject to conflicts between users worldwide, with agriculture as a major driver of discords. Water sensitive ecosystems and their services are often impaired by man-made water shortage. Nevertheless, they are not sufficiently included in sustainability or risk assessments and neglected when it comes to distribution of available water resources. The herein presented contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6) and Life on Land (SDG 15) is the Ecological Sustainability Assessment of Water distribution (ESAW-tool). The ESAW-tool introduces a watershed sustainability assessment that evaluates the sustainability of the water supply-demand ratio on basin level, where domestic water use and the water requirements of ecosystems are considered as most important water users. An ecological risk assessment estimates potential impacts of agricultural depletion of renewable water resources on (ground)water-dependent ecosystems. The ESAW-tool works in standard GIS applications and is applicable in basins worldwide with a set of broadly available input data. The ESAW-tool is tested in the Danube river basin through combination of high-resolution hydro-agroecological model data (hydrological land surface process model PROMET and groundwater model OpenGeoSys) and further freely available data (water use, biodiversity and wetlands maps). Based on the results, measures for more sustainable water management can be deduced, such as increase of rainfed agriculture near vulnerable ecosystems or change of certain crops. The tool can support decision making of authorities from local to national level as well as private enterprises who want to improve the sustainability of their supply chains. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Positive effects of payments for ecosystem services on biodiversity and socio-economic development: Examples from Natura 2000 sites in Italy,"Payments for ecosystem services (PES) are promising instruments to create additional funding for biodiversity conservation, but related socio-economic effects are rarely assessed. This study aimed at evaluating socio-economic benefits using a set of indicators related to 13 topics. Based on 50 cases in 21 Natura 2000 sites in Italy, our results revealed positive effects on the socio-economic development of the local communities as well as an improvement in the defined conservation objectives. At greater spatial scales, potential effects were related to an increase in knowledge, innovation, and public finances supporting a green economy. Our results suggest that the level of socio-economic impacts is determined by a combination of several factors, including the type of ecosystem services, the conditions of the PES agreement, and the general socio-economic context. Specifically, PES related to regulating (e.g., water recharge, flood mitigation) and cultural services (e.g., recreational value) had positive effects on ecological and socio-economic conditions. Our findings highlight how PES schemes in protected areas can contribute to overcoming biodiversity finance gaps and strengthen sustainable development. However, PES should be planned carefully to not privilege individual ecosystems or services. As PES focus on a rather short period, long-term effects need to be evaluated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Post-Soviet cropland abandonment and carbon sequestration in European Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus","Widespread cropland abandonment occurred after the collapse of socialism across the former Soviet Union, but the rates and spatial patterns of abandoned lands are not well known. As a result, the potential of this region to contribute to global food production and estimates of the carbon sink developing on currently idle lands are highly uncertain. We developed a spatial allocation model that distributes yearly and subnational sown area statistics to the most agriculturally suitable plots. This approach resulted in new, high-resolution (1 km(2)) annual time series of cropland and abandoned lands in European Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus from 1990 to 2009. A quantitative validation of the cropland map confirms the reliability of this data set, especially for the most important agricultural areas of the study region. Overall, we found a total of 87 Mha of cropland and 31 Mha of abandoned cropland in European Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus combined, suggesting that abandonment has been severely underestimated in the past. The abandonment rates were highest in European Russia. Feeding our new map data set into the dynamic vegetation model LPJmL revealed that cropland abandonment resulted in a net carbon sink of 470 TgC for 1990 to 2009. Carbon sequestration was generally slow in the early years after abandonment, but carbon uptake increased significantly after approximately 10 years. Recultivation of older abandoned lands would be associated with high carbon emissions and lead to substantial amounts of carbon not being sequestered in vegetation formations currently developing on idle croplands. Our spatially and temporally explicit cropland abandonment data improve the estimation of trade-offs involved in reclaiming abandoned croplands and thus in increasing agricultural production in this globally important agricultural region.",Not About Sufficiency
BRIC and MINT countries' environmental impacts rising despite alleviative consumption patterns,"The BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) and MINT countries (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey) shifted the economic weight from developed to emerging countries. They will continue to grow rapidly by population and gross domestic product (GDP), which could also imply environmental changes. We use the environmentally extended multi-regional input-output database EXIOBASE in a consumption-based approach to assess carbon, land, and water footprints of four income groups within each of these emerging economies in 2050 compared to our base year 2010. We estimate that consumption changes make environmental impacts increase by a factor of 1.6 (for Russia's water footprint) to a factor of 7.0 (for Nigeria's carbon footprint). This rise is mostly driven by GDP growth, but often also by population growth. Changes in consumption patterns due to income growth, however, attenuate the effect. The attenuation appeared to be much stronger for water (for India and Indonesia over 50%) than for land or carbon footprints. It is hence important that forward-looking modelling exercises account for different income categories and related expenditure patterns. The results further indicate how much our technologies must improve to compensate for impact increases induced by rising consumption. To cope with that, not only established economies, but also some BRIC and MINT countries, especially Russia and China, must increase their efforts towards environmental sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Trade-off decisions in ecosystem management for poverty alleviation,"The academic literature on trade-offs in ecosystem management has paid relatively little attention to justice and poverty reduction objectives. The aim of this paper is to highlight the multiple dimensions of trade-offs in ecosystem services management for poverty alleviation, and to support decision-makers in planning for the almost inevitable trade-offs arising from environmental interventions. The paper brings together different dimensions or lenses through which to analyse trade-offs in ecosystem management for poverty alleviation in a low-income country context. Following a literature review of trade-off decisions, the paper introduces the Balance Sheets Approach to structure trade-off analysis and appraise decisions. We apply the Balance Sheets Approach to analyse five case studies set in very different social-ecological systems where trade-offs were pertinent and undermined poverty alleviation. We show how the combination of 'positive' approaches, often used at strategic level, with 'value' approaches which analyse multiple values, multi-scale governance, power and capacity, is necessary to analyse complex trade-offs. Based on the case studies we identify four lessons for future trade-off analysis in the context of ecosystem management for poverty alleviation in low-income settings.",Not About Sufficiency
A Global Assessment of the State of Plant Health,"The Global Plant Health Assessment (GPHA) is a collective, volunteer-based effort to assemble expert opinions on plant health and disease impacts on ecosystem services based on published scientific evidence. The GPHA considers a range of forest, agricultural, and urban systems worldwide. These are referred to as (Ecoregion x Plant System), i.e., selected case examples involving keystone plants in given parts of the world. The GPHA focuses on infectious plant diseases and plant pathogens, but encompasses the abiotic (e.g., temperature, drought, and floods) and other biotic (e.g., animal pests and humans) factors associated with plant health. Among the 33 (Ecoregion x Plant System) considered, 18 are assessed as in fair or poor health, and 20 as in declining health. Much of the observed state of plant health and its trends are driven by a combination of forces, including climate change, species invasions, and human management. Healthy plants ensure (i) provisioning (food, fiber, and material), (ii) regulation (climate, atmosphere, water, and soils), and (iii) cultural (recreation, inspiration, and spiritual) ecosystem services. All these roles that plants play are threatened by plant diseases. Nearly none of these three ecosystem services are assessed as improving. Results indicate that the poor state of plant health in sub-Saharan Africa gravely contributes to food insecurity and environmental degradation. Results further call for the need to improve crop health to ensure food security in the most populated parts of the world, such as in South Asia, where the poorest of the poor, the landless farmers, are at the greatest risk. The overview of results generated from this work identifies directions for future research to be championed by a new generation of scientists and revived public extension services. Breakthroughs from science are needed to (i) gather more data on plant health and its consequences, (ii) identify collective actions to manage plant systems, (iii) exploit the phytobiome diversity in breeding programs, (iv) breed for plant genotypes with resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses, and (v) design and implement plant systems involving the diversity required to ensure their adaptation to current and growing challenges, including climate change and pathogen invasions.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of Natural Ventilation on Carbon Dioxide Concentrations in Pandemic Situation,"In this pandemic situation, healthy indoor air quality is needed. To ensure that, an assessment needs to look at the efficiency of ventilation in providing clean air into the room.

"Do natural resource dependence, economic growth and transport energy consumption accelerate ecological footprint in the most innovative countries? The moderating role of technological innovation","Climate change coupled with environmental degradation is primary concern of the modern society. Natural resource dependence has been widely recognized as a principal stimulator of environmental degradation. However, little is known whether natural resource dependence may take part in environmental sustainability of the most innovative countries via the channel of technological innovation. Against this backdrop, this study aims to explore whether natural resource dependence, transport energy consumption, economic growth, and technological innovation explain ecological footprint of the seven most innovative countries under the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) framework in the period from 1990 through 2018. This study utilizes both, the patent applications and research, development and demonstration budget as proxies for the technological innovation. By employing panel Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR), this study's outcomes outlined that both transport energy consumption and natural resource dependence significantly increase ecological footprint while technological innovation reduces environmental degradation. Moreover, empirical findings of this study verified the legitimacy of EKC hypothesis. Additionally, natural resource dependence with interactive term of technological innovation provided evidence to reduce the harmful environmental effect of natural resources. The findings are robust to the selection of technological innovation proxy variable. The present empirical outcomes shed new light on the key role of technological innovation in attaining environmental sustainability clearly outlining that the most innovative countries should align the natural resources use, economic growth and transport energy consumption with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research",Not About Sufficiency
Natural tree regeneration in agricultural landscapes: The implications of intensification,"Concern about food security is prompting a push to intensify agriculture globally. However, agricultural intensification can inhibit regeneration of vegetation in natural ecosystems. This may jeopardise the persistence of trees in agricultural landscapes and the ecosystem services these treed landscapes offer. Here, we study one of the world's most altered ecosystems - temperate eucalypt woodlands - to explore patterns in natural regeneration of trees, and factors influencing regeneration occurrence, across 300 000 km(2) of south-eastern Australia between 2008 and 2014. During this period, we found the proportion of remnants supporting natural regeneration was stable, and that regeneration occurrence was negatively associated with variables coincident with agricultural intensification: continuous livestock grazing by sheep and cattle, increased exotic plant cover, increased natural soil fertility, and lower elevation. These results indicate that intensive agriculture is incompatible with natural regeneration in our study area. Left unaddressed, low levels of regeneration may result in the widespread loss of trees and the ecosystem services they provide in agricultural landscapes. Thus, strategic implementation of land-sparing and land-sharing strategies is required across broad spatial scales to satisfy production and conservation needs. Based on our results, we recommend that land sharing be prioritised where: (1) livestock grazing can be removed or employed intermittently, (2) exotic plants do not dominate the ground layer, and (3) natural soil fertility is low. For locations that are continuously grazed or dominated by exotic plants, a land-sparing strategy may be more appropriate. Here, farmland should be managed to maximise production, and the next generation of trees should be 'moved' to areas where natural regeneration can be supported. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Studies on the Short-and Long-Term Effects of Rubber-Canna Agroforestry Through Soil Analysis and a Metagenomic Approach,"Agroforestry combines trees and crops for sustainable benefits. We explore rubber and canna integration into agroforestry, emphasizing sustainability, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. This study assesses C. indica's viability beneath 7-8-year-old rubber plantations, examining its impact on soil,microbial communities, and latex production. The research site in Subang, Indonesia, features, at the beginning, six-year-old rubber trees with variations in sunlight under canopies. Wild C. indica rhizomes from Mid Java are planted beneath rubber trees and open ground. No significant difference was found in plant height, rhizome weight, leaf area, number of leaves, r/s ratio, SLA, LWR, and LAR between C. indica cultivated beneath rubber trees (RC agroforestry) and on open ground. Although not significant, RC soil had higher N, P, K, and organic C levels than rubber monoculture (RM) soil two years after adopting the rubber-canna agroforestry system. After six years, RC soil had a greater pH, C, N, P, and K, clay and silt content, and Shannon E index than RM soil. Analysis of soil metagenomics showed the phylum Proteobacteria dominates and enhances soil fertility, particularly in RC soils. These results increase latex output at the RC site over the RM location. In conclusion, the Rubber-Canna agroforestry system enhances sustainability, soil fertility, and crop yield, addressing food security and environmental concerns. The primary novelty of this six-year study lies in the integration of C. indica into Southeast Asia's rubber agroforestry systems, highlighting its unique characteristics such as low-light survival, which can contribute to food security and soil protection. © 2024, Universitas Negeri Semarang.

Organic interventions conferring stress tolerance and crop quality in agroecosystems during the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration,"Excessive use of synthetic chemicals in conventional agriculture largely degraded the agroecosystems that constitute approximately 40% of the global terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, changing climate resulted in a substantial loss in agricultural productivity (both in quantity and in quality) mainly due to diverse abiotic and biotic stresses. This draws public awareness about depleting natural resources, viz., soil, land, and water due to unsustainable agricultural practices and equivalently concerns for food-related animal and human health risks. Modern organic agriculture has shown positive impacts in terms of food/biomass production, climate resilience, soil health, biodiversity, nutritional security, and good quality of life; and is of prodigious demand for nutrient-rich organic food products. In the ensuing decade, owing to the principal focus for the quality aspects or health benefits of organic agriculture, this review explores how organic interventions affect the nutritional value and yield quality in a production system; enable plants to adapt to adverse futuristic environmental conditions, and address the global food and nutritional security challenges. The chronological emergence, current global status, public perceptions, and key components of organic agriculture with their attached health benefits are inextricably synthesized herein. Fostering the ethos of organic agriculture under the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030) is highly imperative for agroecosystem restoration and its sustainable management. Moreover, the multidimensional paybacks of organic agriculture help in attaining important global goals and targets such as the Bonn Challenge and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) by the year 2030. Therefore, invigorating the escalation of organic farming as a concurrent strategy of soil, land, and ecosystem restoration is the need of the hour. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

"Carbon, forests and the REDD paradox","The institutional arrangements governing forests will be a critical factor in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) as part of the global effort to mitigate climate change. A growing body of empirical research demonstrates how local forest governance can be as, if not more, effective than centralized state-based regimes. Local forest governance can secure improvements in multiple forest outcomes such as biomass and carbon storage and livelihoods contributions for the poor, and it can do so at lower cost than is possible through centralized governance. Many national governments have implicitly recognized these findings in their pursuit of decentralized forest governance and in strengthening local rights and capacities to use and manage forests. However, such reforms are often politically resisted, particularly where the value of forest resources is high and central government bodies are able to capture the majority of benefits. Ongoing negotiations related to the design and delivery of REDD policy and practice must take into account both the importance of local forest governance arrangements and the political-economic barriers to devolving secure rights over forests to local communities. These political dimensions of forest tenure and policy create a paradox for REDD: increasing the value of forest resources through global carbon markets without attending to local governance and rights will create political incentives towards centralized governance, which could lead to greater forest loss and lower forest-related benefits for the poor. © 2010 Fauna & Flora International.",Not About Sufficiency

Intercropping system: A climate-smart approach for sustaining food security,"The present-day agriculture is facing a tremendous problem to achieve the global food security in the context of climate change scenario with ever-increasing human population. To combat with the situation, there is an urgent need to adopt proven improved technologies that can ensure food and nutritional security as well as agricultural sustainability. In this regard, adoption of appropriate cropping system can play a vital role. The age-old practice of intercropping system has multifaceted benefits for the enhancement of gross productivity and farm income under a given time. Most of the earlier studies focused to assess the benefits of an intercropping system in the light of yield enhancement and monetary advantages spatially and temporally. Moreover, recent studies highlighted other advantages such as greater ecosystem services, efficient utilization of solar radiation and CO2, enhancement of water, and nutrient use efficiency in the mixed stand, However, in the current consequence of climate change, it is the need of the hour to re-investigate the intercropping system as a mitigation and adaptation option to encounter the ill effects of climate change in agriculture.

Progress in Physical Geography 35(5), 575-594) is helpful in distinguishing between ecosystem structures, processes, services, benefits and values by making the sequence of links visible. Johnston and Russell's (2011. Ecological Economics 70(12), 2243-2249) operational mechanism for determining FEGSs proves also instrumental in separating intermediate (e. g. carbon sequestration) and final ecosystem services (e.g. reduction of atmospheric carbon). However, we find their definition of importance, which is based on willingness to pay, too narrow. Furthermore, we favour the ClCES approach, which defines ecosystem services as the direct contributions that ecosystems - whether natural or semi-natural - make to human well-being.

Case Studies in America on Carbon Management and Sequestration in Agriculture,"Agriculture, energy, and the environment are interdependent dimensions essential for agro-ecosystem sustainability. This chapter focuses on biomass carbon (C)-based practices as the primary pathway to develop resilient, regenerative, proftable, and environmentally friendly production systems. It includes case studies on C balance with biomass-C inputs across production systems in South and North America. The case studies include no-till production systems in Brazil, diverse cropping practices in the western United States, and long-term crop rotation systems experiments in Uruguay. Adopting, expanding, and consolidating C management practices will be the most prominent challenge farmers will face in the coming years worldwide. These case studies provide the consistent message that C management and soil health-oriented practices are central to implementing transitions of farming systems to become both sustainable and carbon-neutral. Cutting-edge technologies enhancing C capture and greenhouse gas sequestration, providing ecosystem services, and maximizing soil-water storage contribute to climate change mitigation and improved food security.",Not About Sufficiency
The contribution of tourism revenue to financing protected area management in Southern Africa,"Protected areas (PAs) are one way of conserving biodiversity, and ecosystem services and human well-being and are now recognized as an integral part of sustainable development strategies. Over the past four decades there has been a ten-fold increase in the number of protected areas globally. Increasingly however, park management agencies do not have sufficient funds to finance their conservation management activities, and most governments do not fund PA budgets fully. Furthermore, efforts to determine how much money is spent or required for PA financing has been hampered by significant data shortages, especially in the most underfunded countries as many are still unable to quantify the relative adequacy of their levels of conservation finance. This research assesses the extent to which tourism contributes towards biodiversity financing for PA management in southern African countries. It analyzes Fifth National Country Reports (produced in 2014/2015) submitted to the Convention for Biological Diversity produced for all southern African countries to determine the actual contribution of tourism to overall PA financing. It highlights that although tourism is a significant revenue source for PA authorities in southern Africa, how it is retained and reinvested back into conservation management remains ambiguous. The incompleteness and inconsistency of national level reporting presents a missed opportunity for justifying greater financing support. © 2017 Cognizant, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Application of untreated versus pyrolysed sewage sludge in agriculture: A life cycle assessment,"Recycling of phosphorus (P) from waste streams such as sewage sludge to agriculture is essential in order to ensure future food security. Land application of sewage sludge is controversial due to its content of pollutants, such as heavy metals and toxic organic compounds. Pyrolysis is a technology that can eliminate harmful contaminants while enabling the recycling of P in the sludge. Organic pollutants are degraded during pyrolysis, while most of the P remains and approximately 40 % of the carbon is retained in a stable form in the biochar. When performing pyrolysis at a temperature of around 800 degrees C or more, cadmium is evaporated and can be separated from the biochar. Electricity -driven pyrolysis facilitates this by means of easier temperature control. The aim of the present study was to undertake a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impacts of high -temperature electricity -driven pyrolysis of sewage sludge, including the separation of cadmium, and field application of sludge biochar as compared with sewage sludge storage and field application. The results showed that pyrolysis can offer a more climate -friendly solution due to avoided greenhouse gas emissions from the sludge and to carbon sequestration of the biochar. However, field application of untreated sludge resulted in a higher application of nitrogen (N) and more plant -available P. Agricultural modelling tools indicated that this produces higher crop yields than biochar application. In the LCA model, higher crop yields lead to savings in land use and water consumption as the higher yields can replace other crop production. The lower plant availability of biochar P implies a possible risk of lower yields when the P application is restricted based on total P, and a risk of greater P loss with soil erosion to the environment. Overall, the present study stresses the importance of including the long-term agronomic impacts of sludge and biochar field application in LCAs, and highlights the trade-offs that need to be considered in decision -making regarding the implementation of pyrolysis technology.",Not About Sufficiency
Prospects of Carbon Neutrality in Russian Agriculture According to SSP Scenarios: Analysis at the National Level and in а Region,"Sustainable development and reduction of the carbon footprint is an important issue on the development agenda of the Russian national economy and, in particular, the agricultural sector. The study of long-term trajectories of development of the agricultural economy and the conditions for achieving carbon neutrality should take into account the expected climatic and socio-economic changes in the world, which are enshrined in a number of widely used scenarios - 'Shared Socioeconomic Pathways' (SSPs) and, as a rule, are based on the use of integral multi-sector models land use dynamics. The study is focused on obtaining projections of climate change and scenarios SSP1, SSP2 and SSP3 on the dynamics of crop production in Russia until 2050, with an emphasis on the development of a large agricultural region of Siberia - Altai Krai, in the context of analyzing the timing and conditions for achieving carbon neutrality. The GLOBIOM model, adapted for modeling at the level of Russian regions, was used as a toolkit. The results of scenario modeling made it possible to assess changes in the scale of production and cropland structure, greenhouse gas emissions in carbon units and the overall dynamics of the carbon footprint as well as expected consequences for Russian economy and harnessing the export potential of crops. It has been revealed that achieving carbon neutrality on the regional level (Altai Krai) is a challenge that requires a significant change in the structure of sown areas, the introduction of environmentally-oriented technologies and a significant increase in the productivity of agricultural land. The results contribute to deepening the understanding of regional economic management processes using the example of the Altai Kray and ways to achieve sustainable development goals, in particular achieving carbon neutrality in crop production. The practice of such research can be transferred to other regions of Russia. © 2024 Economic Research Institute, Far Eastern Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences.

WIP: Integrating Green Computing Competencies Into Southern African Curricula,"This is work-in-progress research-to-practice. Computer-based solutions are viewed as key to many technological problems, especially in reducing the impact of technology on the environment. At the same time, these computing solutions have their negative impacts. Such negative impacts are not understood by many computing specialists, as computing graduates have not been made aware of these undesirable impacts of their solutions. Based on frameworks such as CC2020, most computing curricula in Southern Africa, do not incorporate sustainability concepts. This means computing graduates of these African institutions will continue to view the quality of their computing solutions as defined by curricula that lack emphasis on sustainability. However, Africa's contribution to engineering education with a green twist can address this predicament. By integrating sustainability principles into computing and engineering curricula, African higher education institutions (HEI) can pioneer a new generation of professionals equipped with knowledge and skills to develop sustainable green technological solutions. Such an approach will not only address local challenges but will also position Africa as a major contributor to green computing and sustainable engineering practices, which are increasingly crucial in the global effort to mitigate environmental degradation. Using Design Science Research (DSR), incorporating Action Research, this paper discusses the process of formulating a green-friendly computing curriculum for use by five African universities, participating in a European Union-funded project, Grow Green Africa (Gr2A). This hybrid approach to curriculum development ensures the viability of the resulting curriculum and its adaptability and sustainability over time. The designed curriculum incorporates sustainability principles aimed at fostering sustainable practices in the computing sector. The competency-based learning model encompasses knowledge, skills, and dispositions required to execute tasks in various fields of computing. Such an approach transcends the traditional 'knowing-what' paradigm and encompasses the 'know-how' and 'know-why' aspects of applied tasks. Developing competencies in areas such as green computing and sustainability is proposed as vital for meeting the demands and future trends in Southern Africa. By revamping curricula to include sustain ability aspects, higher educational institutions can equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills enabling them to integrate sustainable practices into their computing endeavors, thus reducing the negative impact of computing on the environment. This proactive approach not only promotes environmental stewardship but also aligns with the broader goals of human development and prosperity in the Southern Africa region. Furthermore, it positions Africa as a hub for innovative and sustainable green engineering solutions, contributing to the global effort to address environmental challenges while driving economic growth and social development. This research would also be important to curriculum developers as it gives a clear process to follow when incorporating sustainability concepts into engineering curricula in general and computing in particular. © 2024 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil Nutrient Dynamics and Farming Sustainability Under Different Plum Orchard Management Practices in the Pedoclimatical Conditions of Moldavian Plateau,"Soil health is essential for sustainable agriculture, influencing ecosystem health and orchard productivity of plum orchards. Global challenges such as climate change and soil contamination threaten to affect fertility and food security, requiring sustainable practices. The study assessed the effect of different orchard management practices on soil quality and nutrient distribution in Prunus domestica L. orchard located on the Moldavian Plateau in northeastern Romania under temperate humid subtropical climate conditions. Two systems were analyzed: conventional (herbicide-based) and conservative (cover crop-based). Soil samples (0-20 cm and 20-40 cm) were analyzed for soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (Nt), available phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Results showed that conservative management improved soil health by increasing SOC nutrient cycling, mainly through organic matter inputs. Compared to 2022, the effectiveness of phosphorus in the conservative management system significantly increased (by 6%) in 2023, while potassium content decreased (by 30%), suggesting potential nutrient competition or insufficient replenishment under organic practices. SOC levels remained stable, supporting long-term carbon inputs. Conventional management maintained phosphorus and potassium but showed lower SOC levels and higher risks of soil fertility depletion. Strong correlations between SOC and nutrient indicators emphasize the critical role of organic inputs in nutrient mobilization. The findings indicate that cover crops are essential for sustainable soil management by enhancing carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling, thereby supporting the long-term sustainability of agricultural systems.",Not About Sufficiency
"Beyond mean functional traits: Influence of functional trait profiles on forest structure, production, and mortality across the eastern US","Plant functional traits (PFTs) have increased in popularity in recent years to describe various ecosystems and biological phenomena while advancing general ecological principles. To date, few have investigated distributional attributes of individual PFTs and their relationship with key attributes and processes of forest ecosystems. The objective of this study was to quantify the distribution-and contribution of various PFTs in determining forest structure, live tree production (volume and biomass), and tree mortality across the eastern US. In total, 16 metrics representing species specific gravity and their shade, flood, and drought tolerance were used to develop a PFT profile for over 23,000 permanent sample plots in the region. Spatial relationships were observed when analyzing not only the mean value of these traits but also measures of PFT complexity: the standard deviation, Shannon's index (a measure of PFT diversity), and Gini coefficient (a measure of PFT inequality). Results from nonparametric random forests models indicated that variables which formed the PFT profile contributed to explaining broad-scale patterns in the variability in forest structure (volume and biomass of overstory live trees, maximum stand density index, and tree seedling abundance; R-2 ranged from 0.09 to 0.78), production (volume [R-2 = 0.16] and biomass accretion [R-2 = 0.11]), and to a lesser degree, tree mortality. Despite the variability in the data employed and the variety of forest management regimes in these stands, this work demonstrates the utility of applying PFT profiles for understanding and predicting patterns of forest structure and production and their role in critical ecosystem processes such as carbon sequestration.

ECONOMIC PROGRESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: A STATISTICAL EXPLORATION IN OECD COUNTRIES,"At the nexus of sustainable development and environmental stewardship lies a complex web of interactions between socio-economic developments and ecological impact. This article presents a statistical inquiry into the multifaceted relationship between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita and pivotal economic indicators, notably the Human Development Index (HDI) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. Through a robust analytical lens, we dissect the extent to which these socio-economic metrics influence, and are influenced by, the carbon footprint of nations. The analysis is performed on OECD* countries (*current members and accession candidates). In scrutinising the GHG emissions trajectories of investigated countries, a notable trend towards decarbonization is observed. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of GHG emissions per capita in most of these nations has shown marked improvement in the latter half of the last decade compared to the turn of the millennium. This positive shift is a testament to the potential efficacy of environmental policies and innovations in technology that have been increasingly embraced worldwide. © Vilnius University, 2002-2024 and Brno University of Technology, 2002-2024 and University of Latvia, 2002-2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Carbon storage and sequestration in subsoil horizons: Knowledge, gaps and potentials","Carbon (C) sequestered in subsoils generally contributes to more than half of the total stocks within a soil profile. In contrast to topsoil, organic matter (OM) stored in subsoil horizons is characterised by high mean residence times. While the mechanisms and controls of OM stabilisation in topsoils are fairly well understood, processes and dynamics of subsoil OM stabilisation appear to be controlled by other factors. We summarize the available data on C quantities, chemical composition as well as decomposition and stabilisation dynamics in subsoils and discuss the relevance of these processes for longterm carbon storage. Moreover, the importance of spatial dist ribution of SOM and its degraders is addressed. The objective of this chapter was to discuss the controls of carbon sequestration in subsoil horizons in order to explore the possibility to increase soil carbon stocks by carbonising subsoil horizons. Subsoil C is characterised by much higher solubility after destruction of the mineral phase compared to topsoil C suggesting that much of it consists of small molecules stabilised by interaction with the mineral phase. The chemical composition of OM stabilised by mineral interactions in subsoil horizons is different from those of topsoils. Precursors of this C may be root-derived and microbially processed organic matter as well as organic matter transported in dissolved form or by bioturbation. The reports about the environmental controls of subsoil OM degradation are conflicting, most likely due to site-specificity. The lower dynamics of temperature and soil moisture in subsoils may thus enhance or reduce OM mineralization, while low nutrient availability is a more common limiting factor. Spatial distribution of OM may determine the likelihood of its stabilisation at long time scales, which may be most related to absence of energy-rich material needed for decomposition. Therefore a suitable strategy for increasing C stocks in deep horizons may be the addition of highly stable OM such as biochar or highly aliphatic material. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.",Not About Sufficiency
Functional substitutability of native herbivores by livestock for soil carbon stock is mediated by microbial decomposers,"Grazing by large mammalian herbivores impacts climate as it can favor the size and stability of a large carbon (C) pool in the soils of grazing ecosystems. As native herbivores in the world's grasslands, steppes, and savannas are progressively being displaced by livestock, it is important to ask whether livestock can emulate the functional roles of their native counterparts. While livestock and native herbivores can have remarkable similarity in their traits, they can differ greatly in their impacts on vegetation composition which can affect soil-C. It is uncertain how these similarities and differences impact soil-C via their influence on microbial decomposers. We test competing alternative hypotheses with a replicated, long-term, landscape-level, grazing-exclusion experiment to ask whether livestock in the Trans-Himalayan ecosystem of northern India can match decadal-scale (2005-2016) soil-C stocks under native herbivores. We evaluate multiple lines of evidence from 17 variables that influence soil-C (quantity and quality of C-input from plants, microbial biomass and metabolism, microbial community composition, eDNA, veterinary antibiotics in soil), and assess their inter-relationships. Livestock and native herbivores differed in their effects on several soil microbial processes. Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) was 19% lower in soils under livestock. Compared to native herbivores, areas used by livestock contained 1.5 kg C m(-2) less soil-C. Structural equation models showed that alongside the effects arising from plants, livestock alter soil microbial communities which is detrimental for CUE, and ultimately also for soil-C. Supporting evidence pointed toward a link between veterinary antibiotics used on livestock, microbial communities, and soil-C. Overcoming the challenges of sequestering antibiotics to minimize their potential impacts on climate, alongside microbial rewilding under livestock, may reconcile the conflicting demands from food-security and ecosystem services. Conservation of native herbivores and alternative management of livestock is crucial for soil-C stewardship to envision and achieve natural climate solutions.",Not About Sufficiency
Socio-economic and eco-biological dimensions in resource use and conservation: Epilogue,"Use of natural resources largely determines the standard of living that human societies enjoy. Steady increase in worldwide use of biotic and abiotic resources (such as water, air, soil, biodiversity, land as habitat etc.) for a range of societal purposes (such as wind power, solar power, tidal flows etc.) have been linked with rapid population growth. Current as well as potential future flows of income are often associated with the economic significance of natural resources. In the poorest regions of the world, such resources form the basis for the wealth generation and hence are also considered as the basis of livelihoods. In such poor rural communities, a reduction in stocks of natural capital and flows of ecosystem services may disproportionately harm their wellbeing. Although a number of reports are available at regional, national and global levels that deal with climate smart livelihoods and socio-ecological development, for a mega-diverse country like India the studies which mostly cover the national status are not going to propose the sound approaches for the people and landscape of its varied agro-climatic regions. The purpose of this volume is to provide findings of different and differing studies done in diverse agro-climatic zones to the stakeholders in a compiled and comprehensive manner to enable them to inject the research findings in reframing or reorientating the policies (if necessary) that are required as strategies for sustainable socio-ecological development, natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
Bilateral matching institution: Issues in participatory biodiversity conservation and well - Being of the community,"The humans use biological resources for their survival andwell - being.

We fill this gap with three indices quantifying past and projected changes in ecosystems using data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems. Our indices quantify changes in risk of ecosystem collapse, ecosystem area and ecological processes, and capture variation in underlying patterns among ecosystems. We apply the indices to three case studies of regional and national assessments (American/Caribbean forests, terrestrial ecosystems of Colombia, and terrestrial ecosystems of South Africa) to illustrate the indices' complementarity and versatility in revealing patterns of interest for users across sectors. Our indices have the potential to fill the recognized need for ecosystem indicators to inform conservation targets, guide policy, and prioritize management actions.",Not About Sufficiency
Global prioritisation of renewable nitrogen for biodiversity conservation and food security,"The continuing use of petrochemicals in mineral nitrogen (N) production may be affected by supply or cost issues and climate agreements. Without mineral N, a larger area of cropland is required to produce the same amount of food, impacting biodiversity. Alternative N sources include solar and wind to power the Haber-Bosch process, and the organic options such as green manures, marine algae and aquatic azolla. Solar power was the most land-efficient renewable source of N, with using a tenth as much land as wind energy, and at least 100th as much land as organic sources of N. In this paper, we developed a decision tree to locate these different sources of N at a global scale, or the first time taking into account their spatial footprint and the impact on terrestrial biodiversity while avoiding impact on albedo and cropland, based on global resource and impact datasets. This produced relatively few areas suitable for solar power in the western Americas, central southern Africa, eastern Asia and southern Australia, with areas most suited to wind at more extreme latitudes. Only about 2% of existing solar power stations are in very suitable locations. In regions such as coastal north Africa and central Asia where solar power is less accessible due to lack of farm income, green manures could be used, however, due to their very large spatial footprint only a small area of low productivity and low biodiversity was suitable for this option. Europe in particular faces challenges because it has access to a relatively small area which is suitable for solar or wind power. If we are to make informed decisions about the sourcing of alternative N supplies in the future, and our energy supply more generally, a decision-making mechanism is needed to take global considerations into account in regional land-use planning. © 2018, Institute of Geographic Science and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
How Do People Experience the Alps? Attitudes and Perceptions in Two Protected Areas in Italy,"Protected areas play an important role due to their twofold capacity for biodiversity conservation and the provision of many benefits to human well-being. Tourism can be a tool for protecting nature, enhancing people’s sensitivity, and a threat to biodiversity management. This study investigates users’ attitudes and perceptions and managers’ concerns related to the frequentation of two protected areas in the Italian Alps: the Gran Paradiso National Park and the Adamello Regional Park. We carried out 32 semi-structured interviews with park managers and municipalities to identify their perception of tourism and possible threats related to the use of the parks. Thus, we administered questionnaires to 3399 users of the PAs to investigate their attitudes and perceptions. We made considerations on whether there were similarities in the attitudes identified by the park managers and results of the questionnaires. Questionnaires confirmed the managers’ perception of mass tourism regarding one-day stays and the purpose of the visits, but we could not exhaustively confirm the increase of new visitors. We performed a binary logistic regression to understand the relationship between short-term stays and attitudes of visitors (origin, frequency of visits, stakeholders’ category, and biographical data). Eventually, interviews stated an exacerbation of the growth of visitors due to the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, we investigated if the pandemic changed the assiduity of visits, and half of the users claimed a change in their assiduity of visits, but mostly declared a decreased frequentation of the area. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
SEAT: Measuring socio-economic benefits of marine protected areas,"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are used as tools to increase marine biodiversity and their concomitant ecosystem services that benefit human wellbeing. It is important to assess whether they are in fact delivering socio-economic benefits to the surrounding communities beyond increasing fish biomass. The Socio-Economic Assessment Tool (SEAT) was developed to measure these benefits. While there are existing tools, most of them are difficult to accomplish and require extensive data gathering, thus are not utilized enough by MPA managers in the country. SEAT is designed to complement the MPA Effectiveness Assessment Tool (MEAT), the primary framework being used to assess MPA governance effectiveness in the Philippines. The tool builds on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Framework of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, with a focus on whether MPAs increase financial, human and social capital of MPA management bodies and the surrounding communities. SEAT was pilot-tested in several MPAs across the country, and the results were used to develop incentive schemes, i.e. recognition awards, as a sustainability mechanism for MPA management. On an individual level, the results can provide guidelines on how MPAs can better be designed, managed or even expanded to increase socio-economic outcomes. At the national level, the SEAT results can further enrich the existing MPA database being maintained by the MPA Support Network of the Philippines, which will allow for a more comprehensive assessment on the effectiveness of MPAs in improving human wellbeing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Role of fertilization regime on soil carbon sequestration and crop yield in a maize-cowpea intercropping system on low fertility soils,"Achieving food security through intensive agricultural practices on low fertility soils is challenging as crop productivity is increasingly curtailed by the loss of soil structural stability and rapid depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC). As such, the conversion from traditional mono-cropping to legume-cereal intercropping, especially with integrated fertilization, may increase crop yields with the least ecological footprint. We set up a 2-year field experiment in a split-plot design with cowpea-maize monoculture and intercropping under different organic–inorganic fertilization regimes, including no fertilization (control), organic input only (compost), chemical input only (NPK), and multi-nutrient enriched compost (NPKEC). We observed that intercropped maize had a significantly higher biomass yield compared to the corresponding monoculture when fertilized with NPKEC fertilizer. However, cowpea biomass yield differences between monoculture and intercropped plots were comparable under all fertilization regimes. In contrast, the grain yield advantage of both maize and cowpea was significantly enhanced under the intercropping system compared to monoculture, with NPKEC showing the most significant effect among all fertilization regimes. When comparing the relative contribution of the fertilization regime to SOC, the NPKEC fertilizer provided the highest SOC-sequestration (0.30 Mg C/ha yr−1). At the same time, the effect of the cropping system on C-sequestration showed that intercropping provided the highest C-sequestration (0.17 Mg C/ha yr−1) compared to monocultures of both crops. Although compost application significantly increased mineral associated (MAOC) and particulate associated organic carbon (PAOC) concentrations compared to unfertilized control plots, NPKEC fertilization with intercropping system was the most effective combination causing the greatest increase of both soil C pools over time. Based on redundancy analysis (RDA), the positive association of MAOC and PAOC with C-sequestration suggests the importance of both organic fractions as primary C reservoirs conducting SOC storage. Importantly, although compost alone in association with intercropping had a lower C-sequestration, it was associated to a better soil structure as confirmed by its positive relationship with macro-and micro-aggregation, water stable aggregates (WSA), and mean weight diameter (MDA). Overall, our results indicate the importance of restoring soil structure in degraded soils through appropriate land management solutions, such as stoichiometrically balanced fertilization practices (NPKEC) and crop diversification (intercropping), in order to achieve significant gains in SOC storage and, ultimately, improve crop productivity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards an integrated approach of conducting fungal research in Costa Rica,"Costa Rica is a small country in Central America with a recent history of fungal research. However, comparative differences with other territories in the Mesoamerican Biodiversity Hotspot region have promoted the study of fungi and the integration of fungal information with natural resource management. Even though there is still a large number of multidisciplinary aspects to cover in Costa Rica for robust incorporation of fungal data in conservation and political and developmental agendas, regional advantages have allowed this country to move towards such goal more rapidly than other countries in this part of the world. Mycoliteracy-centered and citizen science initiatives seem to be the next step in order to normalize disparities in fungal perception across regions within the country and promote social interaction with fungi. However, in general terms, the Costa Rican society seems to be aware of the potential of fungi as a source of food and medicines and their remarkable contribution through ecosystem services. In this manner, fungal conservation and management seem easier to conduct in this territory than in other regions of the world where less information on fungi has reached the general population. © 2019 Universidad Nacional.

Coastal wetland rehabilitation first-pass prioritisation for blue carbon and associated co-benefits,"Context: The Australian Government has developed a methodology for payment for carbon services provided by blue carbon ecosystems that focuses on avoided emissions and carbon additionality resulting from tidal restoration of coastal wetlands. Aims: This study is a first-pass prioritisation for tidal restoration of coastal wetlands in New South Wales (NSW). Methods: A pixel-based approach was applied using readily available datasets, with particular focus on watersheds above in-stream tidal barriers. Key results: Many sites were identified, to investigate in detail, opportunities to restore tidal flows to coastal wetlands. More were associated with the broad coastal floodplains of northern NSW than narrower floodplains of southern NSW. Conclusions: Information is needed about the location, ownership, land tenure, structure, condition and height of in-stream and over-land flow barriers, particularly in the context of rising sea levels. Decisions about managing in-stream drainage and flood mitigation infrastructure should be made cognisant of opportunities to increase blue carbon, and provide associated co-benefits, including mitigating other deleterious impacts from coastal wetland drainage. Implications: Decision support tools for evaluating economic and environmental costs and benefits of tidal barriers will assist decision-makers assessing future proposals to repair or remove aging barriers, or create new tidal barriers. © 2023 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).",Not About Sufficiency
Are Non-Perennial Rivers Considered as Valuable and Worthy of Conservation as Perennial Rivers?,"Non-perennial rivers, watercourses that cease to flow at some point in time and space, are widespread globally but often lack effective protections. Although it is thought that these ecosystems are undervalued by society, empirical studies exploring people's perceptions of non-perennial rivers are uncommon. We carried out an image-based survey at three U.S. universities to measure students' perception of riverscapes according to seven characteristics: aesthetics, naturalness, habitat for biodiversity, habitat for fish, need of human intervention, importance for human well-being, and conservation value. Our results showed that non-perennial rivers are generally considered less valuable and worthy of conservation than their perennial counterparts. Furthermore, several factors influenced peoples' perception of non-perennial rivers, including where they live, their educational history, how often they visit rivers, their leisure activities, and whether they live close to a river. Our findings suggested the need to improve people's perceptions of non-perennial rivers as a step toward increased protection for these ecosystems.

Spatial congruence between biodiversity and ecosystem services in a forest landscape in southern Chile: basis for conservation planning,"There is a need for a better understanding on how biodiversity and ecosystem services are spatially related and assess to what extent the conservation of biodiversity will ensure the provision of services. In the Rio Cruces watershed (Chile) the spatial congruence between biodiversity and water supply, erosion control and soil accumulation services was assessed using spatially explicit models, geographically weighted regression and overlap analyses. Biodiversity registered a positive spatial relationship with the three ecosystem services. The local R-2 value explained up to 95 %, 68 % and 37 % of the variance for soil accumulation, water supply and erosion control, respectively. High spatial congruence (> 67 %) was registered between biodiversity and ecosystem services hotspots. Our study recommends that decision makers develop plans and share efforts for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in 43 subwatersheds, which are 16.4 % of the subwatersheds studied. We suggest that these efforts must be an integral part of environmental policies that need to be generated by the Chilean government.",Not About Sufficiency
China's conversion of cropland to forest program: a systematic review of the environmental and socioeconomic effects,"Background: Farming on sloping lands has historically led to forest loss and degradation in China, which coupled with unsustainable timber extraction activities, was deemed responsible for catastrophic flooding events in the late 1990s. These events led to the introduction of forest policies targeting ecological conservation and rural development in China, a process epitomized by the launch of the conversion of cropland to forest program (CCFP) in 1999. This systematic review responds to the question: What are the environmental and socioeconomic effects of China's Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program after the first 15 years of implementation? Methods: Based on the published protocol, we searched for English language studies published between 1999 and 2014, and screened them for relevance and eligibility in two stages (titles and abstracts followed by full texts), after which they were further assessed for potential sources of bias before data extraction and analyses. Following initial screening of 879 titles and abstracts, 169 studies underwent full text screening, followed by 61 studies being subjected to quality assessment. Eighteen papers did not meet minimum quality criteria, while the remaining 43 papers were eligible and underwent data extraction and subsequent analyses. Among the final set of 43 studies were four national-level studies, seven regional-level studies, and 32 county-level (or below) studies. The majority of studies were published after 2009 and evaluated impacts within the first 5 years of CCFP implementation, such that the long-term impacts of the program remain open for further investigation. Results: A skewed temporal and geographic distribution of the examined studies limits the generalizability of the results, though the evidence base confirms a substantial increase in forest cover and associated carbon stocks linked to reallocation of sloping agricultural land to forest. To some degree, soil erosion has been controlled and flood risk reduced at local scales. Meanwhile household incomes have increased and rural employment has readjusted towards off-farm sectors. However, some studies also indicate instances of diminished food security and increasing social inequality. Finally, several studies indicate suboptimal regional or localized trade-offs among specific ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration vs. water discharge rates, flood control vs. riparian soil replacement, and forest productivity vs. biodiversity. Conclusions: Additional research on long-term environmental impacts and program effects in under-studied regions, particularly southern and western provinces, is necessary. In terms of recommendations for future research on the CCFP, there is a significant need to examine confounding factors, ideally through the selection of matching control groups to CCFP participants, and to ensure that sampling methodologies are more representative of selected study sites and the overall targeted area. There remain many opportunities to assess specific socioecological effects, upon which to base future policy decisions and more broadly inform ecological restoration and eco-compensation in both theory and practice.",Not About Sufficiency
Regional sustainability contrasts in Brazil as indicated by the Compass of Sustainability - CompasSus,"The current need for assessing sustainable processes and states is a driving assumption for this article, having as objective to present preliminary results of a new assessment approach, the Compass of Sustainability (CompasSus), applied to administrative regions of Brazil. Its methodological approach is based on a combination of existing assessment methodologies, such as the Human Development Index and the Ecological Footprint. CompasSus is elaborated under the perspective of rather complementary operational concepts of sustainable development, namely weak and strong sustainability, which are often seen as competing ones. In spite of the advances on the perspective of sustainable development perceived in international agreements for conservation of nature, as well as in the implementation of national policies aiming at sustainability, there still exists an operational ambiguity of the concept of sustainability. Thus, its fuzzy theoretical consolidation for clear definition of objectives and lines of action still leads to different assumptions for diverse stakeholders and authors. Looking at the Brazilian case, conservation strategies are needed to protect the world's largest tropical rainforest against a predatory business - as-usual frontier expansion. As for addressing trade-offs between environmental conservation and regional development demands the CompasSus introduces a combined hemispheric assessment of sustainability. In 2006, the state in which the sustainability index had the best performance was DF (Distrito Federal). This, the seat of the capital city, presents an economy based on the public and the service sectors, both very little carbon and energy intensive. Furthermore, the high income per capita, and good social indicators associated with the small relevance of the agrarian sector grants it the best sustainability index, which is determined by performances in two components representing strong and weak sustainability. In the other extreme is São Paulo (SP) where a high population density and major impacts on waterways have implied a worse performance in weak sustainability index, whereas the high consumption of energy together with high carbon emissions have also determined a low performance in strong sustainability index. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
INNOVATIVE FINANCE FOR CONSERVATION: ROLES FOR ECOLOGISTS AND PRACTITIONERS,"Global efforts to conserve biodiversity and maintain ecosystem services have shifted from a traditional emphasis on the establishment of protected areas to one that includes the design of conservation projects that deliver positive social, ecological, and economic outcomes for people and the environment. This shift is a necessary recognition that protected areas alone will be insufficient to conserve a large proportion of species globally, especially given competing pressures for land development and marine resources. However, despite clear demonstrations of the potential benefits of managing terrestrial and marine resources to produce a sustainable mix of environmental and human co-benefits, many of the most promising models remain under-funded or largely aspirational. Consequently, only 12–17% of the estimated $300–$400 billion* of investment needed annually to maintain healthy ecosystems globally currently flows to conservation finance, with most originating from limited public and philanthropic sources. Those numbers contrast with the amount of capital available to invest globally. Institutional investors and other asset managers have more than $175 trillion in assets under management that are being invested in economic activity globally. Many of these investors are increasingly demanding that environmental sustainability be used, at least partly, to guide investment decisions. As a result of this growing demand, sustainable investment funds in the United States grew by over 33% from 2014 to 2016 and now comprise about one-fifth ($9 trillion) of professionally managed assets. Substantial opportunities may, therefore, exist to direct private capital towards conservation investments, despite the marketplace for such investments being slow to develop to date. The promise of conservation investing notwithstanding, there remain important barriers and concerns about unintended or negative outcomes for people and the planet due to bad actors, redirection of public resources, perverse incentives, misaligned objectives, or poorly designed projects. In this issue, we summarize specific challenges and opportunities related to the mobilization of private capital in conservation. There is a critically important role for the development of consistent and accountable frameworks to guide project design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation while also ensuring equitable and beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders. Scientists and practitioners in the social and ecological sciences, as well as law and finance fields, can shape these rapidly growing initiatives by helping to: 1. Design investable projects with meaningful conservation impacts. 2. Develop rigorous but flexible frameworks to standardize metrics and monitoring protocols, compare project and investment outcomes, and track progress towards global targets. 3. Establish safeguards, protocols, and ethics for engaging local stakeholders. 4. Create blueprints to facilitate the design of projects that allow investors to generate economic returns while ensuring positive, sustainable outcomes for the environment. 5. Reconsider existing financial vehicles and structures of investment projects to improve flexibility, performance, and salience for stakeholders. © The Ecological Society of America.",Not About Sufficiency
Nature for resilience reconfigured: global-to-local translation of frames in Africa,"Globally, various frames of urban nature circulate, each emphasising particular challenges and natural solutions in the climate context. Yet which actors and dynamics shape their translation to the African context remains unclear. This paper explores the global -tolocal translation process of frames through interventions funded by transnational actors, conceptualised as agents of policy transfer. Critical scholarship has observed that urban adaptation and resilience interventions in Africa are often characterised as technocratic and top -down approaches, hence it is vital to understand whether these are replicated through proliferating nature -based solutions (NBSs). The study of a resilience -building intervention in Lilongwe, Malawi, reveals that transnational actors play important roles by deploying frames of urban nature through funding projects. However, rather than involving a top -down imposition of particular solutions, this sets in motion dynamics: in the competition for resources that frames generate, various actor constellations of transnational actors, subnational governments and local NGOs reconfigure or relabel strategies and associated (nature -based) practices to suit global frames and the resources they generate. This shapes who is included or not, and what kinds of NBS are being developed, for and by whom. There is a risk that priorities of communities get lost in translation. POLICY RELEVANCE Frames of urban nature shape global agendas but also matter locally in the design of programmes and projects. This study provides key insights of relevance for policymakers. First, external funding for climate and resilience is unpredictable and insufficient to address manifold urgent local priorities. It is important that actors at all levels strive to align resources to holistic strategies of local governments and do not impose certain visions for urban nature. For this to happen, and second, it is key that local governments and communities are empowered to create forms of nature that are built around diverse forms of local knowledge and expertise, to cater to values and priorities of the communities. Third, proponents of NBSs highlight their potential to address interlinked climate-, biodiversity- and society -related challenges. However, unless funding allocation puts emphasis on the interlinkage of goals, the potential for NBSs to reach multiple goals can get lost. Fourth, there is a need to disrupt the persisting scepticism concerning the feasibility of NBSs in informal settlements and forge collaborations that realise interventions closely linked to the priorities of disadvantaged groups in African cities, to leverage the power of nature for more just societies.",Not About Sufficiency
Linking community and disease ecology: The impact of biodiversity on pathogen transmission,"The increasing number of zoonotic diseases spilling over from a range of wild animal species represents a particular concern for public health, especially in light of the current dramatic trend of biodiversity loss. To understand the ecology of these multi-host pathogens and their response to environmental degradation and species extinctions, it is necessary to develop a theoretical framework that takes into account realistic community assemblages. Here, we present a multi-host species epidemiological model that includes empirically determined patterns of diversity and composition derived from community ecology studies. We use this framework to study the interaction between wildlife diversity and directly transmitted pathogen dynamics. First, we demonstrate that variability in community composition does not affect significantly the intensity of pathogen transmission. We also show that the consequences of community diversity can differentially impact the prevalence of pathogens and the number of infectious individuals. Finally, we show that ecological interactions among host species have a weaker influence on pathogen circulation than inter-species transmission rates. We conclude that integration of a community perspective to study wildlife pathogens is crucial, especially in the context of understanding and predicting infectious disease emergence events. © 2012 The Royal Society.",Not About Sufficiency
Beyond Green Preferences: Demand-side and Supply-side Drivers in the Low-Carbon Transition,"Green preferences are often seen as crucial for mitigating climate change. Yet, it remains unclear whether they alone can drive the shift toward a low-carbon economy and what the distributional consequences might be. This paper studies the macroeconomic, environmental, and distributional effects of green preferences among consumers and producers using the agent-based integrated assessment MATRIX model. We compare scenarios with varying pro-environmental attitudes to conventional supply-side climate policies like carbon taxes and cap-and-trade mechanisms, with and without abatement investment subsidies and alternative redistribution strategies. Without an active policy, achieving a low-carbon transition requires unrealistically high values of green preferences among consumers and producers. Conversely, carbon taxes and cap-and-trade mechanisms can reach that objective, but at the cost of increased instability and inequality. Moderate abatement subsidies can balance those effects, reducing emissions while mitigating both economic and distributional challenges, especially when environmental revenues fund social transfers instead of tax cuts. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Plant domestication and utilization: The case of the pampa biome,"The domestication of plants, as a bio-cultural process, is a continuous phenomenon intrinsically associated with the use of plants. Traditional and scientific knowledge constitute the basis of the various uses of plants from in situ harvesting to complete domestication of crops. One of the most important challenges of our time is to achieve the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources of landraces, species in the process of domestication and species used in situ. The in situ conservation of agricultural biodiversity is a basic element for the development of more sustainable agroecosystems, the adaptation to climate change, the conservation of ecosystem services and to ensure local food security-a conception that is strongly linked to the local development and the protection of cultural and biological diversity. Through case studies from the Pampa Biome we will discuss the valorization of plant genetic resources through new domestication, the promotion of the use of scientifically developed best management practices for in situ conservation, the widening of the germplasm base for breeding programs, plant breeding for stress tolerance, the development of participatory plant breeding programs and the development of high quality products. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change projections of soil erosion in South America in the XXI century,"Global climate projections indicate that continental South America (SA) can experience significant changes in soil erosion caused by water in the coming years due to changes in the precipitation spatial and temporal patterns, threatening food security and biodiversity and impairing agroecosystems to provide services. This study aims to quantify future impacts on soil erosion in the SA provoked by changes in precipitation from climate change scenarios using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). A 20 km spatial resolution of annual precipitation projected from the ensemble of four global climate models (BESM, CanESM2, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC5 models) was used to assess impacts between 2010 and 2099, sliced every 30 years. The Eta/CPTEC model dynamically regionalized the datasets, and the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios were selected to quantify rainfall erosivity and soil erosion rates. The projected average soil erosion over the continent was 37% above the present estimation (3.8 Mg ha−1 year−1), reaching 5.2 Mg ha−1 year−1 at the end of the 21st century. The projections indicate an increase in soil losses across the Andes Cordillera with less severe impacts on lowlands commonly used for crops and livestock. Contrastingly, soil erosion rates tended to decrease by the end of the century in northern SA due to the reduced precipitation projected by most climate models. Overall, the most significant impacts on soil erosion caused by climate change were found for the last time slice (2071–2099) in the RCP 8.5 scenario, with mixed results, i.e., an increase in some regions and a decrease in others. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
The elephant in the room is really a cow: using consumption corridors to define sustainable meat consumption in the European Union,"Implementing the European Green Deal requires a consistent food systems' policy that involves not only targeting the supply side but also conducting extensive changes in diets at the consumer level. Reducing meat consumption is an obvious strategy to put the European food system on track to meet the Green Deal's goals. This cannot be achieved by focusing solely on consumer choice and individual responsibility. Stronger governance is required to reduce the scale of meat consumption to sustainable levels. Such governance needs to be informed by a holistic definition of ""sustainable meat consumption"", designed to ensure that important sustainability priorities are not neglected, and to account for all emissions associated with EU consumption, regardless of where production takes place. This article presents a conceptual framework to define ""sustainable meat consumption"" based on the concept of consumption corridors (CCs). A CC is the space between a minimum (the floor) and maximum (the ceiling) consumption level, which allows everybody to satisfy their needs without compromising others' ability to meet their own. Embedded in a powerful set of principles (recognizing universal needs; tackling both over and under-consumption; framing food as a common good; promoting public participation; and addressing environmental justice and planetary sustainability), CCs are attuned to the Green Deal's ambition to ""leave no one behind"", in the EU and beyond. CCs provide a demand-side solution encompassing a more equitable alternative to discuss what is actually a ""fair share"" of the world's limited resources when it comes to meat consumption.",Not About Sufficiency
"Harmonising conflicts between science, regulation, perception and environmental impact: The case of soil conditioners from bioenergy","As the global population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, humanity needs to balance an ever increasing demand for food, energy and natural resources, with sustainable management of ecosystems and the vital services that they provide. The intensification of agriculture, including the use of fertilisers from finite sources, has resulted in extensive soil degradation, which has increased food production costs and CO2 emissions, threatening food security. The Bioenergy sector has significant potential to contribute to the formation of a circular economy. This paper presents the scientific, regulatory and socioeconomic barriers to the use of the nutrient waste streams from biomass thermal conversion (ash) and anaerobic digestion (digestate) as sustainable soil amendments for use in place of traditional fertilisers. It is argued that whilst the ability of combined ash and digestate to remedy many threats to ecosystems and provide a market to incentivise the renewable bio-energy schemes is promising, a step-change is required to alter perceptions of 'waste', from an expensive problem, to a product with environmental and economic value. This can only be achieved by well-informed interactions between scientists, regulators and end users, to improve the spread and speed of innovation with this sector. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental ethics and medical reproduction,"Carbon emissions of global health care activities comprise 4-5% of total world emissions, placing the health care industry on par with the food sector. The United States health care industry in particular expends an estimated 479 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year - nearly 8% of the country's total emissions. Health care impacts the environment through the use of resources needed to cure, treat, and prevent diseases; by extending lifespans; and by facilitating new births. In this book, Dr. Cristina Richie evaluates ""medicalized reproduction"" (MR) from an environmental perspective. From pre-conception gamete retrieval to in-vitro fertilization (IVF), to birthing suites, MR has an enormous carbon footprint. But, unlike other areas of high-carbon health care, such as organ transplantation or chemotherapy, medicalized reproduction does not treat, cure, or prevent disease. It is supported by an economized medical industry, and as such, is open for ethical scrutiny. Richie first situates MR within environmental ethics. Part I analyzes the numerous resources used for medical reproduction, emphasizing that MR is a voluntary lifestyle choice. Part II offers policy suggestions for sustainable MR, remaining sensitive to some individuals' desires to be parents coupled with the global push for medical and climate justice. The conclusion recognizes the obligation for environmental sustainability in all areas of life, including health care and family life. © Oxford University Press 2024.

Small wetlands are critical for safeguarding rare and threatened plant species,"Question: Rare and threatened species are a common focus of natural area protection, but selecting sites to protect them must be balanced against other conservation objectives. Using a series of wetlands as a case study, we ask: (i) will protecting sites based on species rarity capture all critical community types; (ii) do rare plant species occur in rare environments; and (iii) will safeguarding large wetlands protect taxonomic and functional richness of rare and threatened species? Location: Southern New Zealand. Methods: We used lists of vascular plant species from 118 wetlands (66 fens, 35 bogs and 17 marshes). The resulting species lists included 29 rare and threatened species. Nine functional attributes of the rare and threatened species were compiled. Species assemblages were ordinated using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Permutational multivariate ANOVA tested for a difference in assemblages between wetlands with or without rare and threatened species. Wetlands were classified according to a rare environment scheme. SLOSS (single-large-or-several-small) accumulation curves determined whether species and functional richness of rare and threatened species were best captured by groups of small or large wetlands. Results: Wetlands with rare and threatened species supported species assemblages, which were different from those without rare or threatened plant species. Rare and threatened species were not associated with rare environments. The presence or richness of rare and threatened species was not associated with wetland size. SLOSS analyses revealed that small wetlands were critical for capturing rare and threatened species and their functional richness. Conclusions: Prioritizing wetlands with rare and threatened plant species will not meet other conservation objectives, such as the preservation of all critical community types, rare environments or large wetlands. Networks of small wetlands will be necessary to safeguard rare and threatened plant species. Complementary objectives targeted at wetlands of varying size will be necessary to protect the full range of biodiversity and ecosystem services that wetlands offer. Rare species are often used to prioritise sites for conservation management, yet it is unclear whether this approach yields co-benefits for all biodiversity and ecosystem properties. Using wetland plants from southern New Zealand, we found no evidence that preserving sites with rare species safeguarded community types, rare environments or large wetlands. Small wetlands were critical for safeguarding rare species. © 2014 International Association for Vegetation Science.",Not About Sufficiency

Managing grazing intensity to reduce the global warming potential in integrated crop–livestock systems under no-till agriculture,"Agricultural intensification has been associated with increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using integrated crop–livestock systems (ICLs) under no-till agriculture can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation, thereby helping mitigate such emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the net global warming potential (net GWP) of no-till ICLs at variable grazing intensities of winter black oat pasture in a subtropical ecosystem. A 3.5-year field experiment involving three different grazing intensities (i.e., intensive, moderate and light as defined by a pasture height of 10, 20 and 30 cm, respectively) and grazing exclusion in winter and no-till soybean cropping in summer was conducted on a Ferralsol in southern Brazil. Net GWP, in Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1, was assessed in terms of SOC sequestration relative to intensive grazing as a reference, including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and energy costs of farming operations and inputs. Moderate grazing reduced net GWP relative to intensive grazing (from 0.09 to 4.92 Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1), the latter leading to the highest GWP levels. The decrease in net GWP was mainly the result of SOC accumulation, which offset 34–98% of all GHG emissions. Light grazing and grazing exclusion proved to be less efficient than moderate grazing in decreasing net GWP (1.84 Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1 on average), mainly as a result of decreased SOC accumulation. Based on our findings, moderate grazing (20 cm high pasture) of winter black oat pasture is an effective strategy to reduce the C-footprint of ICLs in subtropical no-till agriculture. Highlights: On-farm assessment of net GWP in subtropical no-till ICLs Conversion from intensive to moderate grazing reduced net GWP SOC accumulation is the main driver of net GWP reduction under no-till ICLs. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science",Not About Sufficiency
"Governing new biotechnologies for biodiversity conservation: Gene drives, international law, and emerging politics","The outdoor use of organisms modified with gene drives—emerging biotechnologies of biased inheritance—could further human well-being and biodiversity conservation, yet also poses environmental risks and diverse social challenges.

The Convention on Biological Diversity is central, and its institutions and others have taken actions toward governing gene drive organisms. Gene drives’ governance and politics are contrasted with those of agricultural genetically modified organisms, with emphases on states, nonstate actors, the precautionary approach, and decision-making forums. Developing and implementing governance—especially in international forums—for gene drives may prove to be difficult.

"Ecosystem Services, Land-Cover Change, and Stakeholders: Finding a Sustainable Foothold for a Semiarid Biodiversity Hotspot","Land-cover change has been identified as one of the most important drivers of change in ecosystems and their services. However, information on the consequences of land cover change for ecosystem services and human well-being at local scales is largely absent. Where information does exist, the traditional methods used to collate and communicate this information represent a significant obstacle to sustainable ecosystem management. Embedding science in a social process and solving problems together with stakeholders are necessary elements in ensuring that new knowledge results in desired actions, behavior changes, and decisions. We have attempted to address this identified information gap, as well as the way information is gathered, by quantifying the local-scale consequences of land-cover change for ecosystem services in the Little Karoo region, a semiarid biodiversity hotspot in South Africa. Our work is part of a stakeholder-engaged process that aims to answer questions inspired by the beneficiaries and managers of ecosystem services. We mapped and quantified the potential supply of, and changes in, five ecosystem services: production of forage, carbon storage, erosion control, water flow regulation, and tourism. Our results demonstrated substantial (20%-50%) declines across ecosystem services as a result of land-cover change in the Little Karoo. We linked these changes in land-cover to the political and land-use history of the region. We found that the natural features that deliver the Little Karoo's ecosystem services, similar to other semiarid regions, are not being managed in a way that recognizes their constraints and vulnerabilities. There is a resulting decline in ecosystem services, leading to an increase in unemployment and vulnerability to shocks, and narrowing future options. We have proposed a way forward for the region that includes immediate action and restoration, mechanisms to fund this action, the development of future economic activity including tourism and carbon markets, and new ways that the science-stakeholder partnership can foster these changes. Although we acknowledge the radical shifts required, we have highlighted the opportunities provided by the resilience and adaptation potential of semiarid regions, their biodiversity, and their inhabitants.",Not About Sufficiency
Harmonizing erosion control and flood prevention with restoration of biodiversity through ecological engineering used for co-benefits nature-based solutions,"Reconciling erosion control and flood prevention with restoration of diversity is an im-portant challenge for our societies today. However, examples of applications remain rare because practitioners and engineers are searching for more integrated solutions for this kind of situation. New considerations should, therefore, refocus attention on developing innovative actions by raising the question of how best to accommodate the two components. Moreover, little attention has been paid to erosion processes and their control for decreasing floods, although this can largely contribute to this purpose. Merging security with ecology, turning to co-benefits nature-based solutions at the catchment scale, based on the use of local ecological engineering, especially soil and water bioengineering combined with civil engineering, can provide adapted practices for harmonizing flood prevention and erosion control with restoration of biodiversity at the water catchment scale. This kind of approach should be accompanied by proposals for coherent and adapted governance for application of co-benefits nature-based solutions at the catchment and territory scales. © 2021 by the author.

Even at the uttermost ends of the Earth: how seabirds telecouple the Beagle Channel with regional and global processes that affect environmental conservation and social-ecological sustainability,"Human-wildlife dynamics exhibit novel characteristics in the Anthropocene, given the unprecedented degree of globalization that has increased the linkages between habitats and people across space and time. This is largely caused by transnational mobility and migration, international labor, resource markets, and trade. Understanding the relationship between humans and wildlife, and their associated telecoupling processes, helps to promote better management practices and governance for reconciling socioeconomic and conservation interests. Even remote places on the globe exhibit these features. For example, in southern Patagonia's coastal and marine ecosystems, seabirds are not only very abundant and charismatic members of the wildlife community, nowadays, their colonies are a main tourism attraction of global significance, and in the past they were used for consumptive and scientific purposes that also linked the ""uttermost ends of the Earth"" with distant places. Thus, in this study, we review human-seabird interactions in the iconic Beagle Channel (BC) in the Argentine portion of the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago. We adapted and employed the coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) approach and telecoupling framework to integrate disparate social and biological information and obtain a more holistic understanding of current human-seabird dynamics and trends in the BC. Although our assessment includes the temporal scale of human-seabird relationships, we centered the CHANS and telecoupling analysis on the modern seabird-tourism interaction, focused on the channel's Argentine sector, in which tourism is most intensively developed. Our synthesis of the BC's telecoupled CHANS allowed us to recognize the strong historical local-to-global interactions between both human and natural subsystems and the sharp increase in distance telecoupling during the 20th century. Despite this globalizing trend in seabirds connecting the BC's local ecosystems to distant places, ironically we found few linkages between Argentina and Chile, despite both countries sharing political sovereignty over this single biogeographical unit. Recognizing and studying the telecouplings identified in this study would help multilateral efforts to incorporate the spillover systems (especially with Chile) and sending systems (i.e., transnational tourists' countries of origin) into extant regional policies (e.g., state protected areas) and global initiatives (e.g., the United Nations' sustainable development goals). It would also enable more informed decisions regarding specific proposals based on market-based incentives (e.g., payment for ecosystem services), certification schemes (e.g., Distintivo Onashaga) and participatory approaches (e.g., comanagement of natural resources with local communities). Integrating these scales into the management of the BC would help ensure that humans continue to enjoy meaningful relationships with this unique and charismatic wildlife and at the same time reinforce responsible tourism as a local-global strategy for sustainable development and global conservation.",Not About Sufficiency
The curse of wealth: Political ecologies of latin American neoliberalism,"The article reviews recent scholarship on the changing relationships between nature, society, capital, and the state in neoliberal Latin America. It employs political ecology as a macro-analytic framework to analyze scholarly literature published since 2007 on Latin American socio-ecological processes. The first section examines land and resource conflicts associated with accumulation by dispossession, or the penetration of capital into hitherto un-commodified realms of nature and biological life. Conflicts include popular struggles for land reform, and against new extraction-based oil and mining interests, and the privatization of public utilities. The second section reviews the resurgence and socio-ecological impacts of neoliberal mega-development, including large-scale hydroelectric, infrastructure, and agro-industrial projects. The third section reviews studies related to the extension of market forces and global governance regimes into the environmental and public commons, primarily through the creation of ecological protected areas and biodiversity conservation initiatives. In response to the complex reconfigurations of capitalism, nature, and governance in neoliberal Latin America, the article also highlights the emergence of organized resistance, and experimentation in post-neoliberal and post-development alternatives. © 2011 The Author.

Developing a set of regulatory analogs for carbon sequestration,"Carbon capture and sequestration will require the management and storage of carbon dioxide either in geological reservoirs or in the ocean over many centuries. While the possibility of exposure leading to damages to public health, workers or the environment may be small, if there is to be widespread adoption of sequestration, then a regulatory system will need to evolve to manage the reservoirs. To better understand the drivers of a future regulatory system, the historical evolution of comparable regulatory regimes provides a useful guide when viewed through the lens of public goods problems. Other long-term storage problems that have at least some of the characteristics of carbon storage are evaluated according to the nature of risk, the credibility of the solutions, the regulatory environment and the potential to either borrow from or influence other policy problems across geographic or issue boundaries. Though none are exact analogs, as a whole, the set offers variation in key variables critical for determining the success of carbon sequestration as a viable climate policy option. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Reducing Nutrient Loading from Agriculture to Lake Ecosystems - Contributions of Resilience Principles,"Nutrient loading from agriculture is a critical threat to aquatic ecosystems, affecting their ability to provide safe drinking water, and limiting the provision of ecosystem services such as water-based recreation. Efforts to manage the problem typically focus on encouraging, incentivising, or requiring use of best management practices to reduce nutrient inputs on farms and limit their transport to water systems. For example, protecting and restoring wetlands and riparian ecosystems, which filter nutrients from run off and offer co-benefits such as carbon sequestration, terrestrial and in-stream habitat, and recreational opportunities, are important strategies. However, in many agricultural catchments, nutrient concentrations in waterbodies remain high despite such interventions. Reasons for this are myriad and include low uptake of best management practices on farms, timelags in ecosystem response, legacy phosphorus stored in soil and lake sediments, and changing weather patterns associated with climate change. This chapter explores the potential contributions of resilience thinking to reducing nutrient loading to waterbodies and minimising its impacts by treating agricultural watersheds as social-ecological systems, recognising the pressures on freshwater ecosystems caused by human activities throughout the watershed as well as the reliance of such activities on functioning aquatic ecosystems and the services they provide. This involves more explicitly accounting for interactions within agricultural social-ecological systems, planning at the catchment scale, adaptive management, and new governance arrangements. We draw on some lessons learned from a range of innovations developed for technical management practices, policy and governance approaches. We translate these lessons into pathways for reduced nutrient loading for sustainable management of lakes in the face of changing climate, degrading aquatic ecosystems and increasing demand for land and food. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
A METHOD TO DESCRIBE THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN RENEWABLE POWER SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN ORDER TO DERIVE STORAGE NEEDS,"In times, when power generation exceeds demand or prices are low, excess energy can be stored for later use. The stored energy is used in the opposite case when power consumption exceeds generation. For an energy system where, renewable energy is targeted to be the main source of power generation on our way to carbon neutrality, it is important to understand how much energy needs to be stored to maximize the direct and domestic utilization of the generated energy and thus, to minimize the amount of imported and exported energy. The needed capacity of an energy storage device depends on how well the renewable power generation and consumption are aligned over time. Hence, a description of the alignment between the power generation of renewable energy sources and the power consumption is key to understand energy storage capacity needs. In this paper a simple method to describe power consumption / consumption alignment and how to derive storage capacity needs from this description is presented. The method can be applied to existing supply / demand data or to simulation results to reduce the simulation effort. The effects of capacity modifications to a power generation and storage system can be easily analyzed. The method can be widely applied to a single project or to an entire nation-wide energy-system, to analyze time periods from a day to a month or a year. The application of the method is shown by three examples: The first one is a photovoltaic system with a battery storage of different sizes and over different time periods. The second and third example is the renewable energy system of a whole country. The results of the method and the limits of the application of the method are discussed.

Fertilizer use and agricultural practices in the paradox of maize crop production and environmental sustainability,"The enduring existence of pollution presents a substantial danger to human health, natural systems, and social welfare. Human activities mostly generate greenhouse gas emissions, namely carbon dioxide, which negatively impacts the environment. This study used annual datasets to examine the association between maize crop production, maize yield, fertilizer consumption, agricultural land use, and environmental quality in China. In order to identify the positive and negative shocks with the assessment of short- and long-run dynamics, the study used an asymmetric Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) approach. A Robust Least Squares method was also used to locate the parameters nexus in order to assess the series' robustness. Results from the long-run interaction indicate that the maize crop production and agricultural land use has a positive impact on CO2 emissions with probability values of (0.000), (0.000), and (0.001), (0.780), respectively, via both positive and negative interruptions. Additionally, maize yield exposed a detrimental effect on environmental quality. Results of the robust least squares analysis showed that maize crop production, fertilizer consumption, and agricultural land use had a positive influence on environmental quality, with probability values of (0.000), (0.004), and (0.949), respectively. However, there is an unfavourable relationship between variable maize yields and CO2 emissions. China should play a significant role in seeking to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and adopt the beneficial policies necessary to ensure the environment's long-term sustainability, since these emissions are now a rising issue around the world. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Integrated landscape approaches to managing social and environmental issues in the tropics: learning from the past to guide the future,"Poverty, food insecurity, climate change and biodiversity loss continue to persist as the primary environmental and social challenges faced by the global community. As such, there is a growing acknowledgement that conventional sectorial approaches to addressing often inter-connected social, environmental, economic and political challenges are proving insufficient. An alternative is to focus on integrated solutions at landscape scales or 'landscape approaches'. The appeal of landscape approaches has resulted in the production of a significant body of literature in recent decades, yet confusion over terminology, application and utility persists. Focusing on the tropics, we systematically reviewed the literature to: (i) disentangle the historical development and theory behind the framework of the landscape approach and how it has progressed into its current iteration, (ii) establish lessons learned from previous land management strategies, (iii) determine the barriers that currently restrict implementation of the landscape approach and (iv) provide recommendations for how the landscape approach can contribute towards the fulfilment of the goals of international policy processes. This review suggests that, despite some barriers to implementation, a landscape approach has considerable potential to meet social and environmental objectives at local scales while aiding national commitments to addressing ongoing global challenges. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Sustainable landscape, soil and crop management practices enhance biodiversity and yield in conventional cereal systems","Input-driven, modern agriculture is commonly associated with large-scale threats to biodiversity, the disruption of ecosystem services and long-term risks to food security and human health. A switch to more sustainable yet highly productive farming practices seems unavoidable. However, an integrative evaluation of targeted management schemes at field and landscape scales is currently lacking. Furthermore, the often-disproportionate influence of soil conditions and agrochemicals on yields may mask the benefits of biodiversity-driven ecosystem services. Here, we used a real-world ecosystem approach to identify sustainable management practices for enhanced functional biodiversity and yield on 28 temperate wheat fields. Using path analysis, we assessed direct and indirect links between soil, crop and landscape management with natural enemies and pests, as well as follow-on effects on yield quantity and quality. A paired-field design with a crossed insecticide-fertilizer experiment allowed us to control for the relative influence of soil characteristics and agrochemical inputs. We demonstrate that biodiversity-enhancing management options such as reduced tillage, crop rotation diversity and small field size can enhance natural enemies without relying on agrochemical inputs. Similarly, we show that in this system controlling pests and weeds by agrochemical means is less relevant than expected for final crop productivity. Synthesis and applications. Our study highlights soil, crop and landscape management practices that can enhance beneficial biodiversity while reducing agrochemical usage and negative environmental impacts of conventional agriculture. The diversification of cropping systems and conservation tillage are practical measures most farmers can implement without productivity losses. Combining local measures with improved landscape management may also strengthen the sustainability and resilience of cropping systems in light of future global change. © 2020 The Authors.

Land use-induced spillover: Priority actions for protected and conserved area managers,"Earth systems are under ever greater pressure from human population expansion and intensifying natural resource use. Consequently, micro-organisms that cause disease are emerging and the dynamics of pathogens in wildlife are altered by land use change, bringing wildlife and people in closer contact. We provide a brief overview of the processes governing ‘land use-induced spillover’, emphasising ecological conditions that foster ‘landscape immunity’ and reduce the likelihood of wildlife that host pathogens coming into contact with people. If ecosystems remain healthy, wildlife and people are more likely to remain healthy too. We recommend ten practices to reduce the risk of future pandemics through protected and conserved area management. Our proposals reinforce existing conservation strategies while elevating biodiversity conservation as a priority health measure. Pandemic prevention underscores the need to regard human health as an ecosystem service. We call on multi-lateral conservation frameworks to recognise that protected and conserved area managers are in the frontline of public health safety. © 2021, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

Payments for Ecosystem Services in Sustainable Mangrove Forest Management in Bangladesh,"In the context of sustainable development, both developed and developing countries are implementing policies that encourage economic growth, environmental protection and social well-being in resource decisions. According to the 2012 Rio+20 Declaration, market-based instruments that complement regulations can offer an economically efficient push to sustainable growth. Market-based instruments, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES) and other market incentives, may play a crucial role in enhancing the livelihoods and wider well-being of poor people. However, for economic tools such as PES to prove valuable in managing natural resources, the decision-making and implementation processes must integrate adequate rights allocation and participatory mechanisms. This article examines forest ecosystem services in the context of the mangrove reserve forest of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the largest remaining areas of mangroves in the world with an exceptional level of biodiversity. The article argues for a more realistic and equitable approach to PES projects in Bangladesh. It underscores the need for effective participatory tools, third-party monitoring and multi-service PES schemes to improve multiple mangrove ecosystem services in the Sundarbans. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.",Not About Sufficiency
Biogeochemical consequences of marine fisheries and aquaculture,"Marine fisheries and aquaculture are important contributors to global food security but disturb biogeochemical cycles from local to global scales. In this Review, we summarize how marine fisheries and aquaculture affect biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, and discuss differences in the spatial scale, duration and magnitude of their biogeochemical consequences. Globally, marine capture fisheries and aquaculture remove approximately 21.0 Tg C year-1, 4.6 Tg N year-1 and 0.97 Tg P year-1 from the ocean, dominated by fish and shellfish removal. Point-of-harvest activities in marine capture fisheries result in biomass extraction, fishing gear impacts on the sea bed, fuel use and emissions, lost fishing gear and altered trophic structure. Aquaculture involves the addition and subsequent extraction of biomass, and habitat alteration during the introduction of farm structures. These disturbances affect the biogeochemistry of the water column and sediment, influencing the cycling and fate of nutrients over days to centuries and from local to global scales. For example, animals raised in aquaculture excrete 6.5 Tg N year-1 and 1.2 Tg P year-1, contributing to global-scale effects. Better incorporating these biogeochemical effects into environmental footprint assessments of products can guide more sustainable decision-making in the sector.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying surface soil organic carbon distribution globally during the COVID-19 pandemic using satellite data,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important soil parameter of agricultural soils, ensuring food security and agricultural sustainability. It plays a critical role in the global carbon budget and carbon sequestration. Spatial mapping of SOC can help develop sustainable management approaches to enhance soil carbon sequestration and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adverse environmental effects. However, quantifying Spatio-temporal distributions of SOC at the global level is complex because of high land heterogeneity and several climatic and hydrologic influential parameters. The main goal of this study was to quantify the annual global SOC change focusing on cropland using daily soil moisture active passive (SMAP) satellite SOC data. The specific objectives of this study were to assess annual SOC change globally, quantify the annual SOC distribution before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and evaluate change in SOC on cropland during the study period. Results showed an increase of annual SOC on cropland in several countries in 2020 compared to 2019, which can be attributed to the direct and indirect impact of partial and complete lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The change in SOC between 2015 and 2019 was considerably different from the SOC change between 2019 and 2020. For example, between 2019 and 2015, 45.6% of the global area showed a decrease in SOC 0 to 25 g C m−2 and 30.4% area showed an increase in SOC 0 to 25 g C m−2. However, between 2020 and 2019, 11.4% of the global area showed a decrease in SOC 0 to 25 g C m−2, and 55.4% area showed an increase in SOC 0 to 25 g C m−2. There is a good relationship between lockdown measures and improvement in SOC, as 48 out of 50 highly infected countries showed increased SOC in 2020 than in 2019. This study suggests better land use management practices can help enhance carbon sequestration and improve soil health. © 2022 The Author(s).

Viable land use options to achieve multiple ecosystem services in the Eastern Himalayas of India,"Avoiding forest conversion to other land uses provides the best ecosystem integrity and functioning; however, other important ecosystem services such as food production and other livelihood needs must be considered. The target is therefore to maintain adequate soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks to mitigate the effects of climate change. Sustainable soil management allows for achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, SOC sequestration targets are addressed by “Climate action” and “Life on Land.” Shifting cultivation, locally named jhum, is a major land use in the Eastern Himalayas region of India, based on crops or crop mixtures for household consumption, following forest clearing and burning. Thereafter, jhum fields are abandoned and naturally regenerate into a secondary forest. However, jhum cultivation decreases the forest area, while erosion increases as a consequence loss of soil and nutritive elements. A total of 204 sites were sampled in Nagaland state and categorized according to land use, vegetation type, and final use. SOC stocks were higher in primary and secondary forests (29.8MgCha−1), followed by plantations (28.7MgCha−1) and jhum (25.5MgCha−1) land use. Considering vegetation type, SOC stocks were greatest in alder forests (31.7MgCha−1), tea gardens (36.6MgCha−1) among plantations and rice+maize (30.6MgCha−1) among jhum. The lowest values were found in secondary forests (26.7MgCha−1), Melia dubia (23.6MgCha−1) and mixed jhum crops (15.1MgCha−1). Considering final use, SOC stocks were the highest in cash crops (33.1MgCha−1) and the lowest in food crops (25.0MgCha−1) in jhum. Increase in SOC compared to the mixed forest land use was 18.3% in tea plantations, 2.4% in alder forests, and 0.4%-0.6% in bamboo and mixed timber trees plantations. The highest decreases corresponded to the jhum land uses, ranging from 1.2% to 51.2% (rice+maize and mixed jhum, respectively). Compared with the jhum land use, SOC increase was the highest in tea plantations (43.8%), followed by alder forests (24.4%), mixed timber trees (22.2%), and bamboo (21.9%). The lowest increases were found in Duabanga grandiflora (3.0%) and Gmelina arborea (1.9%) plantations for timber production. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
A multilevel analysis on pollination-related policies,"The paper explores pollination from a multilevel policy perspective and analyses the institutional fit and interplay of multi-faceted pollination-related policies. First, it asks what the major policies are that frame pollination at the EU level. Second, it explores the relationship between the EU policies and localised ways of understanding pollination. Addressed third is how the concept of ecosystem services can aid in understanding the various ways of framing and governing the situation. The results show that the policy systems affecting pollination are abundant and that these systems create different kinds of pressure on stakeholders, at several levels of society. The local-level concerns are more about the loss of pollination services than about loss of pollinators. This points to the problem of fit between local activity driven by economic reasoning and biodiversity-driven EU policies. Here we see the concept of ecosystem services having some potential, since its operationalisation can combine economic and environmental considerations. Furthermore, the analysis shows how, instead of formal institutions, it seems that social norms, habits, and motivation are the key to understanding and developing effective and attractive governance measures. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
A critical review on phytoremediation of environmental contaminants in aquatic ecosystem,"The rapid urbanization and economic development have resulted in an unprecedented pollution of the entire biosphere. Aquatic ecosystems have become a sink for the discharge of numerous pollutants ranging from nutrients, heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, pesticides, medicines, pathogens, and explosives. The accumulation of these pollutants poses a serious threat to aquatic biodiversity, and drinking contaminated water poses severe health hazards in humans. Phytoremediation, an eco-accommodating process, aids in the maintenance of aquatic ecosystem functionality by detoxifying, decomposing, converting, or chelating contaminants, allowing for the proper treatment of wastewater-contaminated water bodies. The development of phytoremediation technology was facilitated by the economic aspects and side effects of conventional treatment technologies. Nevertheless, constructed wetlands have acquired popularity among the numerous accessible methods for treating and recycling diverse wastewaters because they fulfill the criteria of sustainability, public health maintenance, esthetic balance, design intricacy, and cost. The prolonged-release of untreated industrial waste, domestic sewage, accidental spills, rainfall run-off, and direct solid waste disposal all have a substantial influence on aquatic environments. Both live and dead macrophyte biomass may be utilized in phytoremediation; however, dead biomass is typically favored for treating industrial effluents due to lower cost, ease of disposal, and lack of active biochemical machinery that causes metal toxicity and plant death. Some of the barriers to translating phytoremediation technology from the lab to the field include the issue of disposing of biomass and the seasonal growth of aquatic macrophytes. Yet, via numerous works, an eco-sustainable model has been created that could mitigate some of the restrictions. Macrophyte waste biomass has a wide range of productive uses. Future potential for the utilization of macrophytes in phytoremediation investigations includes genetic engineering, biodiversity exploration, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. This emerging technology may advance environmental science and technology using a multidisciplinary and integrated approach. This review, thus focuses on the various contaminants found in aquatic ecosystems, their treatment by various phytoremediation processes, some successful phytoremediation studies conducted so far for remediation purposes, and myriad types of constructed wetlands utilized for attenuating pollution levels in various types of wastewaters to bring them down to permissible levels. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.",Not About Sufficiency
Cereal-Legume Mixed Residue Addition Increases Yield and Reduces Soil Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Fertilized Winter Wheat in the North China Plain,"Incorporating crop residues into the soil is an effective method for improving soil carbon sequestration, fertility, and crop productivity. Such potential benefits, however, may be offset if residue addition leads to a substantial increase in soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study aimed to quantify the effect of different crop residues with varying C/N ratios and different nitrogen (N) fertilizers on GHG emissions, yield, and yield-scaled emissions (GHGI) in winter wheat. The field experiment was conducted during the 2018–2019 winter wheat season, comprising of four residue treatments (no residue, maize residue, soybean residue, and maize-soybean mixed residue) and four fertilizer treatments (control, urea, manure, and manure + urea). The experiment followed a randomized split-plot design, with N treatments as the main plot factor and crop residue treatments as the sub-plot factor. Except for the control, all N treatments received 150 kg N ha−1 season−1. The results showed that soils from all treatments acted as a net source of N2O and CO2 fluxes but as a net sink of CH4 fluxes. Soybean residue significantly increased soil N2O emissions, while mixed residue had the lowest N2O emissions among the three residues. However, all residue amendments significantly increased soil CO2 emissions. Furthermore, soybean and mixed residues significantly increased grain yield by 24% and 21%, respectively, compared to no residue amendment. Both soybean and mixed residues reduced GHGI by 25% compared to maize residue. Additionally, the urea and manure + urea treatments exhibited higher N2O emissions among the N treatments, but they contributed to significantly higher grain yields and resulted in lower GHGI. Moreover, crop residue incorporation significantly altered soil N dynamics. In soybean residue-amended soil, both NH4+ and NO3− concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.05). Conversely, soil NO3− content was notably lower in the maize-soybean mixed residue amendment. Overall, our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how different residue additions from different cropping systems influence soil N dynamics and GHG emissions, offering valuable insights into effective agroecosystems management for long-term food security and soil sustainability while mitigating GHG emissions. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Innovate for Impact: Young Adults Education and Empowerment for Climate Action,"Anthropogenic climate change is a significant driver of disasters, such as tropical storms, floods, drought and loss of biodiversity, amplifying their frequency and severity worldwide. The annual incidence of extreme weather-related events increases with growing human exposure to risks. The Sendai Framework and its associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognise the interlinkages between disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and sustainable development. However, despite the best intentions of disaster planners, the current efforts are suboptimal in promoting implementation. Education is a critical goal to achieve sustainable development. Environmental Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) seeks to equip students with the knowledge, skills, values and agency necessary to address the complex challenges of climate change and global warming.

Research on the quantitative evaluation of the characteristics of China's express logistics green and low-carbon development policies based on the PMC index model,"Of late, digital transformation has greatly improved efficiency, tracking, coordination, and transparency within the express logistics environment. This research work aims to integrate data analytics with a logistic ecosystem that can significantly enhance policy implementation and monitoring. This will lead to more effective and targeted environmental strategies in the express logistics industry. To expedite the achievement of the ""dual carbon""objective and foster eco-friendly advancement within the express delivery sector, this paper examines national policies concerning green and low-carbon development in express logistics, uses the PMC index model to analyse prevailing policy features, and an assessment of their supportive measures. 64 national-level express delivery green and low-carbon development policy documents released after 2020 for research were studied, and it pointed out that the average PMC index of all 64 policies is 4.16. In the current formation period of the green and low-carbon strategic system of express logistics, the existing policy system is comprehensive and scientific, but there is an uneven distribution of policy tools. The PMC indicator score of mandatory policy measures is the lowest, only 0.11, indicating that the existing policies are not binding and mandatory enough. The policy demand side PMCs of government procurement, trade control, and multinational institutions are 0.20, 0.30, and 0.14 respectively; which are at low levels, indicating that my country's cross-sector coordination mechanism needs to be further improved; the policy environment side PMC indicators of finance and tax incentives are 0.36 and 0.13 respectively, the level of development is not high, reflecting that express logistics does not yet have a clear carbon emission measurement, reporting, and verification mechanism. Based on the above characteristics and problems, it is recommended to establish a strong communication and coordination mechanism, increase the proportion of mandatory policies, and increase the supply of demand-side policy tools. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Agroecological approaches to sustainable development,"Agroecology has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for developing innovative solutions to major global concerns such as food security, biodiversity loss, and climate change. The core subject of biodiversity conservation emphasizes agroecology's role in the preservation of native species, pollinators, and beneficial creatures through practices such as agroforestry, cover crops, and decreased chemical inputs. Agroecological principles such as polyculture, crop diversity, and integrated pest control help to improve food security by increasing stability and nutrition. Agroecology encourages carbon sequestration, soil health, and greenhouse gas reductions, resulting in climate-resilient farming systems. The literature review revealed that no article thoroughly discusses all of the critical hitting global challenges, such as food security, biodiversity loss, and climate change, in a single study that can be addressed using agroecological principles. This review article attempts to make a connection between numerous challenges that may be solved using agroecological techniques in order to facilitate sustainable growth while protecting the environment. The study examines the benefits of incorporating agroecological methodologies into sustainable agriculture, with an emphasis on increasing agroecosystem resilience, improving socioeconomic circumstances for smallholder farmers, rural livelihoods, and local communities, and contributing to climate change mitigation. It provides a complete review of agroecological concepts and their numerous advantages, making it an excellent guide for policymakers, academics, and practitioners who is working to build a sustainable and resilient global food system.

Incentivizing endemic biodiversity conservation under a warming climate through market-based instruments,"This study investigates the potential of utilising payment for ecosystem services (PES) led incentives to support the conservation of endemic biodiversity and the development of alternative livelihood opportunities, specifically through ecotourism, in regions facing water scarcity. It highlights the ability of PES programmes to not only generate additional income for communities but also encourage land use practices that safeguard biodiversity and enhance water recharge. Moreover, when social norms adapt and transform as water availability improves and PES incomes increase, it may promote the emergence of community-driven ecotourism ventures. Using the case of the lateritic plateaus in the Konkan region of Maharashtra, India, we design a dynamic optimisation model of the local community's utility maximisation problem under land use choices that could potentially provide them with water security and alternative livelihoods through ecotourism. The findings indicate that when PES income is substantial, community norms and social enterprises undergo a synergistic transformation, thereby offering livelihood resilience in the context of a warming climate. Moreover, as rising temperatures diminish the productivity of conventional land use choices like mango orchards, timely intervention through PES programmes can effectively avert an irreparable degradation of the lateritic plateaus while ensuring sustainable water resources in the long run. © 2023 Journal of Environmental Economics and Policy Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
What's at Stake? The empirical importance of government revenue and debt and renewable energy for environmental neutrality in the US economy,"Environmental taxes and pollution reduction have been the subject of several studies. By factoring the costs of pollution and other environmental costs into pricing, environmental taxes assist in correcting erroneous price mechanisms in the marketplace. It did, however, overlook the government's potential to facilitate the use of efficient energy sources, which is critical for environmental neutrality. The competence of a government is determined by its tax revenues, which allow the state to participate more in renewable energy technologies, offer an excellent opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and global warming by replacing traditional energy sources. To that aim, the impact of government revenues and debts, as well as renewable energy on environmental neutrality in the United States, is the only motive to conduct this research. A significant outcome of the renewable energy-environment nexus is revealed by tax revenue and debt. Since there seems to be no causation in the first moment, but higher-order interconnectedness emerges, as the quarterly data from 1990Q1 to 2020Q4 has been obtained to test for causality-in-mean and causality-in-variance employing novel non-parametric causality-in-quantiles algorithms. The findings reveal that renewable energy consumption and financial depth have significant predictive power for ecological footprint, uncovering asymmetric prediction across ecological transmission. Also, tax revenues and government debts found a significant connection and predictive potential in estimating the environmental footprint level. Thus, out of multiple suggestions, the study suggests that the government push tax reform policies to obtain investment in renewable energy sources. This shift toward renewable technology innovation allows the US to go green and retain environmental sustainability, which is also an utmost urgency of the UN's Sustainable development Goals (SDG-7). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Local community involvement in nature conservation under the auspices of Community-Based Natural Resource Management: A state of the art review,"Numerous initiatives and programmes were introduced to enable biodiversity conservation, and community involvement was among these propositions. In line with such initiatives, several frameworks were thus developed to ensure the sustainable implementation and realisation of such programmes. This saw the establishment of the Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM). As such, numerous calls were made to explore community involvement strategies and associated socio-economic impacts in nature conservation. Most studies and reports emanating from such calls demonstrate cases of failure of inter alia including poaching. This work, therefore, provides a detailed synthesis of the implications of involving local communities in conservation in protected areas (PAs) and further examines how spatial explicit methodologies can be adopted in enhancing nature conservation. Overall, the study has shown that community attitudes and perceptions towards nature conservation in PAs point towards the failure of the CBNRM approach. Weak, conflicted and sometimes corrupt governance and poor institutional arrangements seem to have contributed towards its failure. Overall, the review further indicates that most studies on community involvement in nature conservation have not fully considered the spatial dimension, and this has hampered holistic and effective monitoring and assessment of biodiversity in PAs to ensure sustainable management and the possible implications of such an approach towards conservation. This work, therefore, recommends a shift towards collaborative modelling, transdisciplinary monitoring and assessment approaches to improve biodiversity conservation as well as to determine the success and limitations of the CBNRM approach in Africa and the world over. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Soil organic carbon dynamics: Impact of land use changes and management practices: A review,"Global climate change has resulted in changes to the earth's geological, ecological, and biological ecosystems, which pose a severe threat to the existence of human civilization and sustenance of agricultural productivity vis-a-vis food security. In the last several decades, climate change has been linked to erratic rainfall distribution patterns and large variations in diurnal temperatures, because of a rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration. This, in turn, is thought to make world agricultural production systems more prone to failure. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important component for the functioning of agro-ecosystems, and its presence is central to the concept of sustainable maintenance of soil health. Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon sink and contains 2- and 3-times more carbon than the carbon in the atmosphere and vegetation, respectively. Therefore, a meager change in soil carbon sequestration will have a drastic impact on the global carbon cycle and climate change. The SOC has different pools and fractions including total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), permanganate oxidizable carbon (KMnO4-C), and mineral associated organic carbon (MOC). Each has a varying degree of decomposition rate and stability. Researchers have identified many ways to offset the effect of climate change through modification of carbon sequestration in the soil. Identification of location-specific, suitable land use and management practices is one of the options to mitigate the impact of the climate change. It can be done by re-balancing different carbon pools and emission fluxes. Labile organic carbon pools including MBC, POC, and KMnO4-C are the most sensitive indicators for assessing soil quality after the adoption of alternate land use and management practices. Information on soil aggregation and SOC stabilization helps for long-term sequestration of carbon in the soil. Here we review the progress of work on SOC dynamics in the major ecosystems of the world. The information should enrich understanding of carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation strategies.",Not About Sufficiency
Digital Tools for Climate Change and Environmental Restoration,"Climate change is among the most discussed environmental concerns in the twenty-first century owing to its challenges for human well-being, agriculture production, biodiversity, and ecosystem health. Mitigation and adaptation approaches for climate change urgently require the incorporation of digital tools and technologies along with suitable climate policies and plans. Digital tools and technologies have the potential to provide sustainable solutions to various societal challenges associated with climate change. They play a substantial role not only in early and emergency warnings but also in predicting the probability of different natural hazards. In recent years, digital tools have been receiving increasing attention for mitigation and adaptation of climate change, disaster risk management (DRM), and improving environmental sustainability. This book chapter introduces the various digital tools and technologies for climate change and environmental restoration. It gives an overview of different technologies supporting digital tools for climate action, like Remote Sensing (RS), Geographic Information System (GIS), Artificial intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), Drones and Robotics, Virtual and augmented realities (VR/AR), Space 2.0, and Big Data and AI. Furthermore, the chapter also gives insight into various climate change assessment tools; digital tools for providing technical advice; performance assessment tools; tools for climate change vulnerability, risk, and adaptation assessment; and a toolbox supporting climate-focused decision-making. Additionally, it highlights some case studies wherein digital tools were used for climate action.

Measuring agricultural sustainability in agroforestry systems,"Sustainability is an intuitively understandable but difficult-to-measure concept. Despite numerous efforts over the years to measure and integrate the ecological, economic, and social aspects of sustainability, a set of universally acceptable standards for measuring sustainability does not exist. The prevailing ecology-economy conflict, in which ecologists consider economics as a subset of environment, while economists view the environment and its benefits as part of the economy, adds to the difficulty. Agroforestry systems (AFSs), considered paradigms of sustainability, are faced with these difficulties when it comes to measuring and comparing various AFSs with one another or with other land-use systems. In ecological terms, the best criteria and indicators of AFS sustainability are ecosystem services, such as soil-fertility improvement, climate-change mitigation through carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation. As an example of the variability of one of these measures across studies, estimates of carbon (C) stored in AFSs range from 30 to 300 Mg C ha-1 up to 1 m soil depth; additionally, 0.29-15.21 Mg C ha-1 year-1 is estimated to be accumulated in aboveground biomass although most of it may not contribute to long-term C storage. In terms of economic sustainability, the principles and procedures of ecological economics and valuation of ecosystem services are useful approaches. Measurement of social sustainability, perhaps more challenging than measurement of the ecological and economic components, entails assessment of such social factors as policy, culture, and other socioeconomic indicators; a single measure of the combined manifestation of all these indicators is the adoption of improved practices by targeted land users. Standard procedures are available for measuring many of these indicators; however, most of them entail measurements taken over relatively long periods of time. Even if measurements and assessments are made rigorously, the ultimate benefit will depend on how sustainability is perceived and valued at all levels, from land users to national and international policy makers. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",Not About Sufficiency
Bangalore Lakes Information System (BLIS) for Sustainable Management of Lakes,"Wetlands (lakes, tanks, ponds, etc.), transitional lands linking hydrologically the terrestrial ecosystem with aquatic ecosystems with biophysical interactions, are the most productive and diverse ecosystems and provide numerous ecological, economic, and social benefits for human well-being. These vital ecosystems sustain ecological processes to provide services such as nutrient cycling, water purification, reducing pollution, carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge, provision of fish, fodder, fuel, and water, flood reduction, erosion control, aquatic biota habitats, education opportunities, aesthetics, and recreation. However, due to globalization, these fragile ecosystems are vulnerable to unplanned developmental activities and rapid urbanization, leading to large-scale land cover changes and hydrologic regimes. The sustained inflow of untreated wastewater (from the industrial and domestic sectors) into wetlands has altered the chemical integrity, which necessitates inventorying, mapping, and regular wetland monitoring to evolve conservation strategies. Integrating spatial and non-spatial data, analysis, and visualization with decision models through decision support systems enables informed decisions. In this context, the Bangalore Lake Information System (BLIS) is designed with information on water quality, biodiversity (microalgae, zooplankton, ichthyofauna, macrophytes, and birds), threats (encroachments, inflow of untreated sewage, etc.) and ecosystem services of lakes in Bangalore, Karnataka State, India. Rapid large-scale land use changes have resulted in an alteration in the hydrologic regime, the loss of habitats, and the disappearance of native species. BLIS empowers decision-making through knowledge of lake distribution in terms of the physical, chemical, and biological aspects and the value of ecosystem services, which is crucial for evolving strategies for prudent management of water bodies in Greater Bangalore.",Not About Sufficiency
"Isolation, enrichment and metagenomic characterizationof simultaneous DDT and lindane degrading microbial consortium","Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) such as Lindane and DDT (dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane) have been extensively used for agricultural purposes primarily for pest management and DDT is still the ""sought after"" for public health care programs to control vector-borne diseases like malaria in developing nations.

"The nexus between carbon emission, energy use, and health expenditure: empirical evidence from Bangladesh","Bangladesh is facing a conundrum in figuring out how to improve public health while simultaneously reducing the environmental pollution. To alleviate the pressure from the high healthcare expenditure in Bangladesh, environmental management efforts to improve the quality of the environment need to be developed with the help of understanding the nexus between carbon emission, energy use, and health expenditure. In a society that is experiencing quick and difficult environmental problems due to rising energy demand, the current study focused on evaluating the effects of carbon dioxide emissions, fossil fuel energy use, and renewable energy use on health expenditure in Bangladesh. Time series data were analyzed from the year 2000 to 2020 using the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares technique. The findings revealed that a 1% increase in carbon dioxide emissions and fossil fuel energy use will increase health expenditure by 0.95% and 2.67%, respectively. Furthermore, a 1% increase in renewable energy use may result in reduced health expenditure by 1.44% in the long run. This article provides policy recommendations to ensure environmental sustainability and healthcare facilities by lowering carbon emission in Bangladesh. This research would be helpful for designing a proactive health scheme to counteract the emerging health consequences of environmental pollution in Bangladesh.

Opportunity Costs of Forest Conservation in Nepal,"Forest biomass may vary by species composition, location, management regimes, and management interventions. To assess the variation in biomass production by management regimes, we conducted a study in three physiographic regions (mid-hills, Siwaliks and Terai) of Nepal with four different management regimes (community forest, collaborative forest, protected area, and protected forest). As community forest is the dominant forest management regime in Nepal, it was studied in all physiographic regions whereas the other two regimes were drawn only from the Terai. We interviewed a total of 1,115 forest user households, which was supplemented by high-resolution satellite image analysis and forest inventory to estimate the costs and benefits of forest management and calculate the opportunity cost of conserving forest. Our estimates suggest that the opportunity cost of conserving forest in Nepal ranged from USD 654/ha in collaborative forest to USD 3,663/ha in protected forest in 2015. The associated opportunity cost of carbon sequestration was between USD 1.11 and USD 3.56 per tCO2. Of the forest management practices adopted, the silviculture-based intensive forest management practice had a far lower cost of forest conservation compared to the other forest management regimes. We found that such a practice is more beneficial to the forest-dependent communities as it allows them to collect the non-timber forest products that are necessary for their daily needs.

Functional composition outweighs taxonomic and functional diversity in maintaining ecosystem properties and processes of mangrove forests,"Biodiversity loss can have significant consequences for human well-being, as it can affect multiple ecosystem properties and processes (MEPP) that drive ecosystem services. However, a comprehensive understanding of the link between environmental factors, biodiversity, and MEPP remains elusive, especially in mangrove ecosystems that millions of people along tropical coastlines worldwide depend upon. Here, we collated a comprehensive dataset on forest inventory, plant traits, and environmental factors across 93 plots in the Sundarbans Reserved Forests, Bangladesh. The functional composition (FC) of leaf area showed a stronger positive association with MEPP, being determined by total biomass and productivity of the mangroves, sediment organic carbon, and ammonium, phosphorus, and potassium contents of the sediment, than species richness (SR) or functional diversity (FD). Further, FC mediated a strong negative association of sediment salinity, and a positive association of SR, with MEPP. The similar but opposite total associations of SR and sediment salinity with MEPP suggest that species-rich mangroves could offset the negative impacts of rising salinity on MEPP. When focusing on a single aspect of MEPP, both FD and FC mattered, with the FD of leaf area showing a strong association with mangrove productivity and sediment potassium content, while the FC of leaf litter nitrogen showed the strongest associations with sediment ammonium and phosphorus contents. Therefore, to sustain mangrove ecosystems as a reliable nature-based solution for climate change mitigation, conservation and (re-)establishment projects should prioritize regionally dominant species with high leaf area and nitrogen content, plus functionally different species to support the ecosystem processes and services provided by mangroves. Our investigation, exploring the links between environmental factors, biodiversity, and multiple ecosystem properties and processes (MEPP) in the Sundarbans Reserved Forest using structural equation models, revealed that the functional trait composition of leaf area primarily drives MEPP. Notably, the similar but opposite total associations of species richness and sediment salinity with MEPP suggest that species-rich mangroves could offset the rising salinity impacts on MEPP, thereby sustaining the ecosystem services they provide in the changing climate.image",Not About Sufficiency
AirNet: predictive machine learning model for air quality forecasting using web interface,"Air is one of the most significant elements of the environment. The increasing global air pollution crisis poses an unavoidable threat to human health, environmental sustainability, ecosystems, and the earth's climate. Air pollution has been referred to as a silent killer due to its insidious nature. Its indirect impact on human health further underscores its dangerous effects. Early detection of air quality can potentially save millions of lives globally. A unique and transformative approach can harness the power of machine learning to combat air pollution. This research presents a manual and web-based automatic prediction system that provides real-time alerts on air quality status and can help prevent premature deaths, chronic diseases, and other health problems. Air pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (PM 2.5), are used in this study for feature analysis and extraction. The system utilizes publicly available data from 23,463 different cities worldwide. Data preprocessing was performed before feeding the data into the machine learning models for feature correlation and evaluation. The proposed research uses various machine learning models to predict air quality, including Random Forest (100%), Logistic Regression (79%), Decision Tree (100%), Support Vector Machine (93%), Linear SVC (98%), K-Nearest Neighbor (99%), and Multinomial Naïve Bayes (52%).

Revealing Regime Shifts and Their Impact on Social-Ecological Systems: a Case Study on Iran,"This study examines the impact of human activities during the Anthropocene era on social-ecological systems globally, with specific focus on Iran. The investigation identifies regime shifts and their effects on ecosystem services, aiming to understand the causes and mechanisms behind these shifts. The key regime shifts observed in the studied provinces are the reduction of groundwater levels and river flows. Various factors, such as decreasing rainfall, increasing temperatures, unauthorized wells, and overexploitation of groundwater, contribute to these modifications. Network analysis reveals several drivers in the network, including non-implementation of land use planning, urbanization, poverty, dam construction and water transfer projects, inappropriate water allocation and distribution policies, and population increase. These regime shifts significantly impact multiple ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, water production, biodiversity, air quality regulation, food production, aesthetic and recreational values, and animal husbandry. Recognizing the ecosystem services at risk and understanding how they deteriorate in social-ecological systems inform managers about the main consequences of regime shifts in Iran. Thus, knowledge of regime shifts and their operation in different scales of social-ecological systems is crucial for future management planning. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of recognizing regime shifts in social-ecological systems, understanding their drivers, and developing appropriate measures to adapt to the new state of the system. By doing so, effective management planning and adaptation to new social-ecological conditions can be achieved, ensuring the maintenance of ecosystem services for human well-being and environmental sustainability not only in Iran but also elsewhere.",Not About Sufficiency

Microbial remediation of pesticide polluted soils,"The increasingly rapid growth of both, population and food demands has driven a research race in food production efficiency through the last century, which has made the pesticide use seemingly unavoidable. However, many pesticides are very persistent and tend to accumulate in the ecosystem, often threatening biodiversity and public health. Although abiotic degradation of these compounds plays a role in many cases, the biodegradation of pesticides by microorganisms is usually the most important and dominant process. This natural degradation varies from site to site, depending on several factors, but it can be favourably improved by applying techniques such as bioaugmentation and biostimulation, which can lead to the cleaning-up of pesticide-contaminated soils. The present chapter introduces the most recent findings in the field of bioremediation of pesticides, critically discussing the main bottlenecks and how to overcome them. Factors affecting biodegradation of pesticide-polluted soils are presented, with a clear focus on the enrichment and selection strategies for relevant microbial strains. Case studies on bioaugmentation of contaminated soils and future trends are also described, including the microbial degradation of pesticide mixtures through mixed culture technology. © 2020 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Cover Crops for Sustainable Cropping Systems: A Review,"Cover cropping is a promising and sustainable agronomic practice to ameliorate soil health and crop performances in agro-ecosystems. Indeed, cover crops (CCs) may regulate several ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, soil fertility, moderation of extreme meteorological events, pollination, and climate and water regulation; in addition, CCs are also used as forage crops and have considerable effects on plant and soil biodiversity. However, to achieve the desired effects on agro-ecosystems, cover cropping should be carefully adopted by considering the specie choice, period of cultivation, and termination method based on site, farm, or purpose-specific. The main objective of this manuscript is to analyze the effects of modern agriculture on soil and environmental health and how cover crops can support sustainable cropping systems and global food security. In addition, it focuses on how the incorporation of cover crops into conventional cropping systems can help in the diversification of crops and assist in mitigating the environmental effects of cropping systems. Finally, this review thoroughly investigates the potential effects of CCs on environmental sustainability, which can be an important source of information for sustainable crop production and food security.",Not About Sufficiency
Judicial Innovation in Enhancing Forest Carbon Sinks: Evidence from China,"Sustainable forest management plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation and adaption, as well as the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Recognizing the significance of sustainable forest management, China has implemented a range of the legislative measures and policies for the conservation and restoration of key forest ecosystems and has launched the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program and other key forest programs, resulting in an increase in forest coverage and forest carbon sinks. In addition to forestry ecological restoration projects (FERPs) initiated by the administration and project developers, the Chinese courts have also actively engaged in exploring various strategies to enhance forest carbon sinks. In both criminal and civil cases, afforestation and reforestation activities, buying forest carbon credits, and participation in forest management and other restoration activities by offenders have been regarded as factors in determining legal responsibility. Moreover, the courts have also established forest restoration centers, either independently or in collaboration with local governments. These judicial innovations in China have provided positive incentives for the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of forests, thereby significantly contributing to the achievement of the Climate Action Goals (SDG 13). However, these developments also raise several concerns, particularly the fair application of forest carbon sink mechanisms, the comparability in ecosystem service between damaged natural resources and compensatory measures, and the interconnection of the various SDGs. It is imperative to establish clear guidance on buying forest carbon credits, to develop standards and procedures to assess forest carbon sinks, and to strengthen cooperation between the judiciary and governmental agencies. Additionally, it is essential to integrate the forest carbon sink with broad economic development goals and social justice frameworks to ensure sustainable and inclusive outcomes. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Belo Monte Dam impacts: Protagonism of local people in research and monitoring reveals ecosystem service decay in Amazonian flooded vegetation,"The Amazonian river-floodplain systems face unprecedented threats from the construction of hydroelectric power plants aimed at meeting Brazil's energy demands. However, evidence suggests that the long-term economic, social, and environmental damages outweigh the hydroelectricity advantages. The Volta Grande do Xingu was dammed and its water diverted to energy production, resulting in habitat loss due to the altered hydrological regimes. Flooded environments are vital for ecosystem services, including food production, biogeochemical cycles, and climate regulation. The construction and operation of hydropower plants disrupt these services, affecting Indigenous populations and ribeirinhos communities. Environmental Impact Assessments often underestimate these impacts, and the responsibility for monitoring falls on the companies themselves, leading to conflicts of interest and inadequate reporting. This triggered an Independent Territorial Environmental Monitoring (MATI-VGX) initiative, led by Indigenous and ribeirinhos researchers in partnership with academics. MATIVGX's observations reveal changes in flooded ecosystems, including increased seedling density and leaf-cutter ant colonies in the understory, changes in plant species composition, disruption of the phenological cycle, and vegetation mortality. Moreover, reduced fruit dispersion disrupts the aquatic food web and threatens Indigenous and ribeirinhos food sources. These changes indicate ecosystem decay and disruption of ecological processes. Importantly, these impacts are noticeable after a short period of water diversion, highlighting the urgency of mitigation efforts. A research agenda must quantify tree mortality, understand physiological mechanisms, and assess the cascade effects on wildlife and food security. Ultimately, restoring natural hydrological patterns is essential for preserving Amazonian biodiversity and the livelihoods of Indigenous and ribeirinhos communities.",Not About Sufficiency
Novel Chryseobacterium sp. PYR2 degrades various organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and achieves enhancing removal and complete degradation of DDT in highly contaminated soil,"Long term residues of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in soils are of great concerning because they seriously threaten food security and human health. This article focuses on isolation of OCP-degrading strains and their performance in bioremediation of contaminated soil under ex situ conditions. A bacterium, Chryseobacterium sp. PYR2, capable of degrading various OCPs and utilizing them as a sole carbon and energy source for growth, was isolated from OCP-contaminated soil. In culture experiments, PYR2 degraded 80-98% of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) or 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) isomers (50 mg L-1) in 30 days. A pilot-scale ex situ bioremediation study of highly OCP-contaminated soil augmented with PYR2 was performed. During the 45-day experimental period, DDT concentration was reduced by 80.3% in PYR2-augmented soils (35.37 mg kg-1 to 6.97 mg kg-1) but by only 57.6% in control soils. Seven DDT degradation intermediates (metabolites) were detected and identified in PYR2-augmented soils: five by GC/MS: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDD), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE), 1-chloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDMU), 1-chloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDMS), and dichlorobenzophenone (DBP); and two by LC/MS: 4-chlorobenzoic acid (PCBA) and 4-chlorophenylacetic acid (PCPA). Levels of metabolites were fairly stable in control soils but varied greatly with time in PYR2-augmented soils. Levels of DDD, DDMU, and DDE in PYR2-augmented soils increased from day 0 to day 30 and then decreased by day 45. A DDT biodegradation pathway is proposed based on our identification of DDT metabolites in PYR2-augmented systems. PYR2 will be useful in future studies of OCP biodegradation and in bioremediation of OCP-contaminated soils. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Nature's value and biodiversity ethics in a changing world: Insights from a special issue and questions for the future,"Motivated by philosophical quandaries arising from environmental ethics and the moral philosophy of biodiversity, we convened a special issue of Biological Conservation entitled “Ethics and practice of biodiversity science: how hidden moral assumptions impact conservation research and policy,” inviting a range of expert voices to examine these questions from a variety of perspectives, backgrounds, and traditions. We sought to discover how many of the founding value statements of conservation biology were still current, and if new any ones had supplemented or replaced them. Broad initial momentum from a wide range of contributors soon met with the headwinds of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we eventually emerged with 34 global contributors representing a diverse array of viewpoints. The contributed pieces range from philosophical investigations of value in Nature, applied conservation ethics for endangered species, the rights and roles of Indigenous peoples, macroevolutionary processes of mass extinction, human well-being and social justice, the history of colonialism in conservation, and subtle cultural differences between global powers with respect to Nature. All speak to often unstated values in conservation science.

"Climate resilience, yield and geographical suitability of sweet potato under the changing climate: A review","Sweet potato is one of the important tropical tuber crops across the world. This review analyzes the studies on the climate resilience of sweet potato to various environmental parameters, the impact of climate change on its yield, and geographical suitability to exploit more about this crop and find out the knowledge gap in its existing research. Drought tolerance studies indicate the suitability of sweet potato in drought-prone areas in terms of their survival rate, and their leaves can tolerate up to a wilting point of −1.3 MPa. The optimum night and daytime temperatures for sweet potato are 18°C and 28°C. There are 82 crop varieties available globally with heat-stress tolerance without compromising the yield. The elevated atmospheric CO2 enhanced the growth and yield of sweet potato and increased the water use efficiency. The salinity tolerance of sweet potato is observed as 11 dS m−1, and it is superior to other major food crops. Sweet potato's ozone tolerance is higher than other crops (59 ppb). The impact studies on crop yield and geographical suitability also recommend its superiority to other major food crops with similar crop duration. As an outcome of this study, further research is needed to explore this crop as sweet potato can substitute for major food grain crops in developing countries regarding food, feed, medicine, and fuel. Research on value-added products and their marketing is another area that needs immediate attention. Studies must exploit sweet potato leaves to ensure nutritional security in developing countries. The researchers also need to focus on developing climate-resilient varieties to ensure a continuous supply of planting materials to needy people to ensure food security. This review also demands more studies on the modeling of sweet potato worldwide to issue crop yield forecasts and monitor the spatial distribution of its major pests worldwide. © 2023 United Nations.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the sustainability of bioenergy pathways through a land-water-energy nexus approach,"Bioenergy can significantly contribute to facilitating the transition to a self-sufficient low-carbon energy sector in Europe. The establishment of sustainable bioenergy systems needs ex-ante analysis that considers specific contexts and potential trade-offs, including competing uses of natural resources such as land, water and energy. The use of marginal and underutilized lands has been emphasized as a valuable strategy to overcome the food vs fuel paradigm and the direct and indirect land use change that can derive from the cultivation of bioenergy crops. Nevertheless, the fragmentation of these lands can significantly affect the energy efficiency of the systems, due to increased energy needs for inputs and transport, with trade-offs on the carbon footprint of the pathway. This study performs an ex-ante assessment of the sustainability of a short bioenergy pathway through the Land-Water-Energy nexus approach, by the iterative use of a web geographic information systems platform, developed on the methodology of the Global Bioenergy Partnership. The simulations show that the production of bioenergy from oilseed crops is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 73% compared to the reference emission value for fossil fuels in transport. The platform proofs to be effective and user-friendly for assessing and optimizing the intricate interlinkages among the various nexus domains that coexist within the bioenergy system based on the cultivation of underutilized land. Its use can facilitate the nexus operationalization serving as a timesaving decision-support tool for the development of sustainable bioenergy systems that contribute to the transition towards a low-carbon energy sector in Europe. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying uncertainties in absolute environmental sustainability assessment: A general framework applied to French electricity production,"Assessing the environmental performance of products and systems from an absolute perspective, in relation to the Earth's carrying capacities, is highly uncertain. This is mainly due to value-based choices that must be made to downscale carrying capacities to the assessed activity, often making assessment results highly dependent on one's interpretation of distributive justice. We present a framework for evaluating uncertainties in the downscaling of carrying capacities in absolute environmental sustainability assessment (AESA) of products and systems. The framework considers 19 possible approaches to share carrying capacities, grounded in four theories of distributive justice (like egalitarianism and utilitarianism) and seven enacting metrics, such as final consumption expenditure or prior emissions. Application to French power using the PB-LCIA impact assessment method showed that impact scores were statistically significantly higher than the downscaled carrying capacity (i.e., frequency of no-transgression ≤0.95) in seven out of ten planetary boundaries. For example, the median biosphere integrity impact score with a 90 % uncertainty interval was 0.0081 (0.0047–0.012) % of biodiversity intactness index (BII) loss, as opposed to the median downscaled planetary boundary equal to 0.0032 (0.00032–0.017) % BII loss, corresponding to a frequency of no-transgression equal to 0.21. This highlights the need to consider uncertainty in AESA of products and systems for more robust quantification of their performance, and setting better-grounded reduction targets. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
The Role of Boreal Seagrass Meadows in the Coastal Filter,"By removing nutrients from the water, coastal ecosystems serve as a filter between land and the open sea. Seagrasses contribute to the coastal filter by trapping and absorbing nutrients. Understanding the processes and environmental conditions underpinning the variability in nutrient retention among and within seagrass meadows is important to evaluate their role in the coastal filter across geographic regions, especially in less studied regions. This study evaluates the role of eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows in the coastal filter in boreal Newfoundland, Canada, and identifies environmental traits driving variability in nutrient fluxes. We measured carbon (Corg) and nitrogen (N) proportions and stable isotopic composition in the surface sediment (top 5 cm) of three eelgrass meadows. Sediment cores were collected from different locations (i.e., inside, edge, outside) relative to each meadow. Sediment %N (0.22%), %Corg (2.82%), Corg stock (11.1 Mg Corg ha-1), and N stock (0.91 Mg N ha-1) were elevated in our study sites; however, nutrient content was not consistently higher inside the meadow than at the edge or outside. Variability in nutrient retention was best explained by a negative relationship with sediment bulk density. Additionally, differences in carbon isotopic (delta 13Corg) enrichment between eelgrass tissue (-11.6 parts per thousand) and sediment (-22.1 parts per thousand) within sites indicated that sediment nutrients were predominantly derived from allochthonous marine sources, where variability was best explained by salinity. This study improves the understanding of the role of eelgrass to nutrient cycles in boreal coastal systems and the potential of eelgrass as a blue carbon ecosystem. Seagrasses trap incoming nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen in the coastal zone, serving as a coastal filter. This function increases habitat productivity and results in further benefits to human well-being (e.g., carbon storage). However, morphometric traits and the surrounding hydrographic environment differ among meadows, resulting in variable coastal filter efficiencies. Understanding the habitat traits driving variability in coastal filter function is important to understand the role of seagrass in nutrient retention across different regions. We present estimates of carbon and nitrogen retention in the surface sediment across three eelgrass meadows in boreal Newfoundland, Canada; a system where the role of eelgrass as a coastal filter has never been assessed. Variability in nutrient retention at both the meadow and bay scales was best explained by a negative relationship with sediment bulk density. Additionally, carbon retained in the surface sediment of the eelgrass meadows was predominantly derived from marine, non-eelgrass sources, where variability in nutrient sources was best explained by salinity. By quantifying carbon and nitrogen cycles in a new region and describing habitat mechanisms underlying the variability in nutrient retention, our findings will benefit future nitrogen burial and blue carbon estimation in the coastal zone. Understanding eelgrass traits that enhance coastal filter function across spatial scales exposes the potential of eelgrass to support ecosystem servicesEelgrass meadow sediments in boreal Canada are rich in carbon and nitrogen, where carbon is predominantly derived from marine allochthonous sourcesIn systems where terrestrial carbon inputs are low, coastal filter functioning is enhanced in eelgrass meadows with low sediment bulk density",Not About Sufficiency

"Ecosystem Changes, Biodiversity Loss and Human Well-Being","Biodiversity is the diversity of life on earth at various organizational levels, from genes to species and ecosystems. Biodiversity comprises the dynamic web of organisms and the interactions between them and the environment. Biodiversity is fundamental for the maintenance of ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services. Ecosystem services are direct benefits that humans obtain from ecosystem, such as food and clean water, or indirect benefits, such as climate regulation and pollination. Human well-being is dependent on ecosystem services and thus on the condition of ecosystems. However, humans are placing increasing pressure on ecosystems, due to the exponential growth of world population over the past decades and increasing consumption patterns. As a result ecosystems are being degraded and destroyed, resources are collapsing, and the loss of biodiversity has reached unprecedented levels. Ecosystem conditions are seriously threatened along with the maintenance of the benefits provided by ecosystems. The effects on human well-being are felt at several scales from local communities to the global population. Human well-being is being affected worldwide by the consequences of ecosystem changes and biodiversity loss, which include natural disasters, health problems, and poverty. Environmental sustainability is a key concept for the future, being fundamental to find solutions that preserve biodiversity and ecosystems, without disregarding people's needs for ecosystem services and economical development. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

How forests may support psychological restoration: Modelling forest characteristics based on perceptions of forestry experts and the general public,"Spending time in forests benefits human well-being, but the importance of forest characteristics on well-being is unclear. This knowledge could help guide forest management decisions to improve outcomes for both people and nature. The overall aim of this study was to investigate how psychological restoration, defined as psychological recovery processes in nature, may be supported by forest characteristics. We (1) investigated how perceptions of restoration (perceived restorativeness) were linked to specific forest characteristics. More specifically, we selected attributes included in nature protection legislation in Germany (beauty, diversity and uniqueness) as the basis to evaluate how forest characteristics were related to perceived restorativeness. Additionally, we (2) tested differences in the assessments of these attributes between forestry experts and people from the general public. Based on the results of the first two objectives (1, 2), we (3) predicted how forest management that affects forest characteristics may impact psychological restoration today and in the future. We developed a perceived restorativeness model based on attributes stated in the German Nature Conservation Act and specific forest structure variables. Drawing from the literature, we included perceived naturalness as an additional key predictor for restoration. Forestry experts and participants from the general public were then asked to rate computer-generated forest stand pictures on these attributes and restorativeness. We found that all attributes were positively associated with perceived restorativeness, but perceived beauty was most important. Perceived uniqueness was statistically significant, but the strength of the relationship was weak. Mixed forests were rated as most beautiful, while coniferous forest stands were rated as least beautiful. The general public gave higher ratings than forestry experts on all attributes, but the pattern was similar. Based on participant ratings, forests left without management (Set-aside), followed by forests with management aiming for resilience to climate change (Adaptation forestry), both supporting biodiversity conservation, showed the highest perceived restorativeness over the course of 100 years. Based on our results, it could be recommendable to increase forest diversity, especially in areas with many visitors. However, more nuanced knowledge involving diverse stakeholders is needed to inform forest management decisions on landscape level.

Data justice and biodiversity conservation,"Increases in data availability coupled with enhanced computational capacities are revolutionizing conservation. But in the excitement over the opportunities afforded by new data, there has been less discussion of the justice implications of data used in conservation, that is, how people and environments are represented through data, the conservation choices made based on data, and the distribution of benefits and harms arising from these choices. We propose a framework for understanding the justice dimensions of conservation data composed of five elements: data composition, data control, data access, data processing and use, and data consequences. For each element, we suggest a set of guiding questions that conservationists could use to think through their collection and use of data and to identify potential data injustices. The need for such a framework is illustrated by a synthesis of recent critiques of global conservation prioritization analyses. These critiques demonstrate the range of ways data could serve to produce social and ecological harms due to the choice of underlying data sets, assumptions made in the analysis, oversimplification of real-world conservation practice, and crowding out of other forms of knowledge. We conclude by arguing that there are ways to mitigate risks of conservation data injustices, through formal ethical and legal frameworks and by promoting a more inclusive and more reflexive conservation research ethos. These will help ensure that data contribute to conservation strategies that are both socially just and ecologically effective. © 2022 The Authors.

Land degradation reduces agricultural productivity, impacts the provision of vital ecosystem services, and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, through Sustainable Development Goal 15.3, sets out to achieve land degradation neutrality (LDN) by improving the livelihoods of those most affected and building resilience in areas affected by or at risk from degradation. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) leads the charge in creating a spatially explicit framework for monitoring and reporting on LDN goals that countries can integrate into their land planning policies. However, it remains difficult to operationalize the integration of biophysical indicators of land degradation with climatic and socio-economic indicators to assess the impact of land degradation on vulnerable populations. We present an integrative framework that demonstrates how freely available global geospatial data sets can be leveraged through an open-source platform () to simplify and operationalize monitoring and reporting on progress towards achieving LDN. Then, we summarize a suite of data sets and approaches that can be used to understand and quantify the socio-ecological interactions between drought, land degradation and population exposed to desertification, land degradation and drought. We discuss how improvements in Earth observation data sets and algorithms will allow UNCCD land-based progress sub-indicators (changes in primary productivity, land cover, soil organic carbon, drought, and population exposure) to be computed at enhanced spatial resolutions.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Consumption of a Finite Planet: Well-Being, Convergence, Divergence and the Nascent Green Economy","A variety of global metrics indicate the Earth has overshot its capacity to supply source and sink resources without substantial negative feedback. Here the relationship between consumption indicators (oil, freshwater, vehicle and meat consumption, GDP, CO2 emissions) and well-being is analysed latitudinally across 189 countries and longitudinally over 60 years within three affluent countries. All latitudinal analyses show the characteristic ""consumption cliff and affluent uplands"" shape: e.g. at low per capita GDP, life satisfaction increases sharply up the cliff with rising GDP; after a threshold, well-being is independent of GDP across the affluent uplands. Longitudinal analyses of Japan, UK and USA since the 1950s show per capita GDP has grown between 3- and 8-fold, but mean levels of well-being remained unchanged. Consumption patterns are now converging on those typical in affluent countries. Indicators for seven baskets of countries: Affluent North America-Europe-Oceania, Affluent Asia, fast developing BRICs and CIVETS, high income Resource Extractors, Poor with Green Peaks, and the Poorest show the factors of consumption between the poorest and affluent (5- to 100-fold) and the fast developing and affluent (2- to 10-fold). A finite planet cannot resource such convergence. One indicator, climate change, grows more of a concern as evidence emerges, yet denial remains strong. A priority is to create opportunities for divergent ways of living. Although material culture has been sought as the means to meet personal well-being, it has failed both the affluent and poorest. A green economy will require human attachments to both place and possessions, thus reducing disposal and damage. Such entanglement produces high affiliation that improves life satisfaction, as does much non-material consumption. As yet, most political and economic systems are far from recognising these imperatives, though there have been notable policy innovations. A shift to a green economy is inevitable. It is simply whether it occurs before or after the world becomes locked into severe climate change and other consequences of harm to natural capital. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Not About Sufficiency
The human environment interface: Applying ecosystem concepts to health,"One Health approaches have tended to focus on closer collaboration among veterinarians and medical professionals, but remain unclear about how ecological approaches could be applied or how they might benefit public health and disease control. In this chapter, we review ecological concepts, and discuss their relevance to health, with an emphasis on emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Despite the fact that most EIDs originate in wildlife, few studies account for the population, community, or ecosystem ecology of the host, reservoir, or vector. The dimensions of ecological approaches to public health that we propose in this chapter are, in essence, networks of population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem matrices incorporating concepts of complexity, resilience, and biogeochemical processes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",Not About Sufficiency
"Nanotechnology in sustainable agriculture: Recent developments, challenges, and perspectives","Nanotechnology monitors a leading agricultural controlling process, especially by its miniature dimension. Additionally, many potential benefits such as enhancement of food quality and safety, reduction of agricultural inputs, enrichment of absorbing nanoscale nutrients from the soil, etc. allow the application of nanotechnology to be resonant encumbrance. Agriculture, food, and natural resources are a part of those challenges like sustainability, susceptibility, human health, and healthy life. The ambition of nanomaterials in agriculture is to reduce the amount of spread chemicals, minimize nutrient losses in fertilization and increased yield through pest and nutrient management. Nanotechnology has the prospective to improve the agriculture and food industry with novel nanotools for the controlling of rapid disease diagnostic, enhancing the capacity of plants to absorb nutrients among others. The significant interests of using nanotechnology in agriculture includes specific applications like nanofertilizers and nanopesticides to trail products and nutrients levels to increase the productivity without decontamination of soils, waters, and protection against several insect pest and microbial diseases. Nanotechnology may act as sensors for monitoring soil quality of agricultural field and thus it maintain the health of agricultural plants. This review covers the current challenges of sustainability, food security and climate change that are exploring by the researchers in the area of nanotechnology in the improvement of agriculture. © 2017 Prasad, Bhattacharyya and Nguyen.",Not About Sufficiency
Appraising the Acoustic Performance and Related Factors of Natural Fiber: A Review,"Over the last couple of decades, there is an increasing demand to control interior noise occurring in aircraft, automobiles, railways, and construction works. Interior noise could impair people’s health, affecting passenger comfort and active safety performance. One of the contemporary noise control technologies is the use of sound-absorbing materials. Traditionally, mineral fibers, foams, and composites are used as sound-absorbing materials. However, they are expensive and energy consumptive as they add to the structure’s weight and affect structural integrity. Natural fibers could contribute to the replacement of conventional mineral fibers with decreased environmental impact, carbon neutrality, and improved sound-absorbing qualities. Also, previous research proved that sound-absorbing materials having natural fiber possess better acoustic properties comparable to those of synthetic fibers. However, high water absorption, termite attack, low fire resistance, and low strength are some of the issues restricting natural fibers usage. Here, an attempt is made to present the potential of natural fibers for acoustic absorbers by understanding the benefits of their inherent porous and tortuous structure. This paper involves a review study of experimental methods and parameters used to regulate the acoustic performance of natural fibers. Natural fibers seem a proven alternative as an acoustic absorber, thereby reducing sustainability concerns related to synthetic materials in acoustics applications. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency

"Major limitations to achieving ""4 per 1000"" increases in soil organic carbon stock in temperate regions: Evidence from long-term experiments at Rothamsted Research, United Kingdom","We evaluated the ""4 per 1000"" initiative for increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) by analysing rates of SOC increase in treatments in 16 long-term experiments in southeast United Kingdom. The initiative sets a goal for SOC stock to increase by 4 parts per thousand per year in the 0-40 cm soil depth, continued over 20 years. Our experiments, on three soil types, provided 114 treatment comparisons over 7-157 years. Treatments included organic additions (incorporated by inversion ploughing), N fertilizers, introducing pasture leys into continuous arable systems, and converting arable land to woodland. In 65% of cases, SOC increases occurred at > 7 parts per thousand per year in the 0-23 cm depth, approximately equivalent to 4 parts per thousand per year in the 0-40 cm depth. In the two longest running experiments (>150 years), annual farmyard manure (FYM) applications at 35 t fresh material per hectare (equivalent to approx. 3.2 t organic C/ha/year) gave SOC increases of 18 parts per thousand and 43 parts per thousand per year in the 23 cm depth during the first 20 years. Increases exceeding 7 parts per thousand per year continued for 40-60 years. In other experiments, with FYM applied at lower rates or not every year, there were increases of 3 parts per thousand-8 parts per thousand per year over several decades. Other treatments gave increases between zero and 19 parts per thousand per year over various periods. We conclude that there are severe limitations to achieving the ""4 per 1000"" goal in practical agriculture over large areas. The reasons include (1) farmers not having the necessary resources (e.g. insufficient manure); (2) some, though not all, practices favouring SOC already widely adopted; (3) practices uneconomic for farmers-potentially overcome by changes in regulations or subsidies; (4) practices undesirable for global food security. We suggest it is more realistic to promote practices for increasing SOC based on improving soil quality and functioning as small increases can have disproportionately large beneficial impacts, though not necessarily translating into increased crop yield.",Not About Sufficiency
"Ecoregion-wide, multi-sensor biomass mapping highlights a major underestimation of dry forests carbon stocks","Tropical dry forests harbor major carbon stocks but are disappearing rapidly across the globe as agriculture expands into them. Unfortunately, carbon emissions from deforestation in dry forests remain poorly understood as high spatial-temporal and vertical heterogeneity complicate biomass mapping. Here, we use a novel Gradient Boosted Regression framework to test the relative gains of combining optical (MODIS) and radar (Sentinel 1) time series, as well as lidar-based (GEDI) canopy-height information, to map biomass in tropical dry forests. We apply our approach across the entire Dry Chaco ecoregion (about 800,000 km2), using an extensive ground dataset of forest inventory plots for training and validation, to map above-ground biomass (AGB) for the year 2019. Our best AGB model had an r2 of 0.89 (RMSE = 15.1 t/ha) with an estimated AGB in remaining natural vegetation of 4.65 Gt (+/− 0.9 Gt). Seasonal metrics from EVI time-series, combined with seasonal Sentinel 1 metrics, had the highest predictive power, while adding GEDI-based canopy height did not improve models. Our resulting AGB maps had a much higher level of agreement with independent ground-data than global AGB products (agreements between r2 = 0.07–0.41), which all suffer from a huge, up to 14-fold, underestimation of AGB in the Chaco. Most of the remaining AGB stored in Chaco woodlands is found in Argentina (2.4 Gt AGB), followed by Paraguay (1.13 Gt AGB) and Bolivia (1.11 Gt AGB). Our results also highlight that 71% of the remaining AGB is located outside protected areas, and around half of the remaining AGB occurs on land utilized by traditional communities. Together, our analyses reveal substantial risk of continued high carbon emissions should agricultural expansion progress. Considerable co-benefits appear to exist between protecting traditional livelihoods and carbon stocks. Our map, the most accurate and fine-scale AGB map for this global deforestation hotspot, can serve as a basis for land-use and conservation planning aimed at leveraging such co-benefits. More broadly, our analyses reveal the considerable potential of combining time series of optical and radar data for a more reliable mapping of above-ground biomass in tropical dry forests and savannas. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Maximizing biodiversity co-benefits under REDD+: A decoupled approach,"Current debates on biodiversity co-benefits under REDD+ are marked by considerable ambiguity and contention. Nevertheless, REDD+ continues to represent one of the most important opportunities for global biodiversity conservation, and the question of how best to achieve biodiversity co-benefits remains an important one. Thus far, most biodiversity conservation in the context of REDD+ is predicated on the notion that services are co-located on a landscape. In contrast, this letter argues that decoupling biodiversity and carbon services on a landscape through national-level planning is a better approach to biodiversity conservation under REDD+. We discuss the fundamental ecological differences between the two services and use principles of resource economics to demonstrate that a decoupled approach will be more efficient, more flexible, and better able to mobilize sufficient finance for biodiversity conservation than a coupled approach. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
A framework for the assessment of ecosystem goods and services; a case study on lowland floodplains in England,"The rural space is increasingly valued for the multiple ecosystem services that it can deliver. For example, priorities in many lowland floodplains in England have changed in recent years from a focus on agricultural production towards environmental quality and the management of flood risk, in part linked to climate change. Recent concerns about food security, however, may reinstate the importance of agricultural production in these fertile areas. This paper explores changes in rural land use in floodplains by measuring the range of ecosystem services provided under different management scenarios. Generic land use scenarios consider management options that focus on single objectives, such as maximising agricultural production, maximising biodiversity and maximising flood storage capacity. Indicators are developed to value the ecosystem services provided by floodplains under each scenario, identifying potential synergy and conflict. This integrated ecosystems approach can help to inform future policy and practice for floodplain management, hopefully in ways that appeal to key stakeholders. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Are investments to promote biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services aligned?,"The conservation community is divided over the proper objective for conservation, with one faction focused on ecosystem services that contribute to human well-being and another faction focused on the intrinsic value of biodiversity. Despite the underlying difference in philosophy, it is not clear that this divide matters in a practical sense of guiding what a conservation organization should do in terms of investing in conservation. In this paper we address the degree of alignment between ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation strategies, using data from the state of Minnesota, USA. Minnesota voters recently passed an initiative that provides approximately $171m annually in dedicated funding for conservation. We find a high degree of alignment between investing conservation funds to target the value of ecosystem services and investing them to target biodiversity conservation. Targeting one of these two objectives generates 47-70 per cent of the maximum score of the other objective. We also find that benefits of conservation far exceed the costs, with a return on investment of between 2 to 1 and 3 to 1 in our base-case analysis. In general, investing in conservation to increase the value of ecosystem services is also beneficial for biodiversity conservation, and vice-versa.. © The Authors 2012.

Integrating Remote Sensing and Community Perceptions for Sustainable Climate Adaptation Strategies in Mountain Ecosystems,"Mountain ecosystems, such as Nepal's Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA), are highly vulnerable to climate change, which threatens biodiversity, water resources, and livelihoods. This study examines Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), climate variability, and community perception and adaptations over a 35-year period (1988-2023) using remote sensing, meteorological data, and community surveys. Vegetation expanded by 19,800 hectares, while barren land declined, reflecting afforestation and land reclamation efforts. NDVI showed improved vegetation health, while NDSI revealed significant snow cover losses, particularly after 1996. Meteorological analysis highlighted intensifying monsoonal rainfall and rising extreme precipitation events at lower elevations. Communities reported increased flooding, unpredictable rainfall, and reduced snowfall, driving adaptive responses such as water conservation, crop diversification, and rainwater harvesting. These findings demonstrate the value of integrating scientific data with local knowledge to inform sustainable adaptation strategies. Contributing to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6 and 13, the findings emphasize the importance of adaptive water management, resilient agriculture, and participatory conservation to enhance climate resilience in mountain ecosystems.",Not About Sufficiency
Interstate power interconnection along with carbon dioxide emission constraint collaboration: Effective tool for low-carbon electric power expansion in Northeast Asia,"Interstate electric power integration with the formation of interstate electric ties and power interconnection in Northeast Asia has been studied for several years. Research has examined the directions, indicators, costs, and systemic (integration) benefits (technical, economic, environmental, etc.) of forming such ties and grids. Studies conducted in different Northeast Asia countries have shown that despite the significant investments required to create an interstate electric ties infrastructure, which serves as the basis for interstate power grids and electricity markets development, participants of these interstate power grids and markets gain substantial benefits. These include reduced needs for installed and reserve generation capacity, lower electricity prices, increased overall flexibility of power resources, and accordingly, greater capability to integrate renewable energy sources. This results in reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel power plants. The latter undoubtedly contributes to achieving the sustainable development goals set by the United Nations and reducing anthropogenic climate impact, which many countries globally (including Northeast Asia) have targeted via announced carbon neutrality by 2050-2060. The main target of the article is to conduct and present new multi-scenario study on forming a potential Northeast Asia's interstate power grid under national and grid-wide (for the entire power system interconnection) carbon emission constraints. The mathematical model of electric power system expansion and dispatching was modified to account for carbon dioxide emission constraints and used for the study. The results of the study showed that the creation of interstate power grid in Northeast Asia accompanied by climate change collaboration among countries to control carbon dioxide emission would lead to effectively constraining of carbon dioxide emission in the subregion, which is the novelty of the study. The results of the study are useful and applicable for choosing particular ways, options, stages of formation and expansion of lowcarbon power system interconnection in Northeast Asia.",Not About Sufficiency
Examining the role of ruminants in sustainable food systems,"Sustainable food systems provide food security while stewarding economic, social, and environmental bases in ways to meet future generations' needs. Sustainable food systems encompass the health of animals, people, and ecosystems. Healthy and productive ruminants can produce meat and milk products with fewer resources, and consequently, often fewer greenhouse gas emissions are produced. Ruminant livestock faces the dual challenge of being impacted by and contributing to climate change, while also experiencing increased demand for ruminant meat and milk products due to growing global population and increased incomes. This challenge presents different ways forward depending upon solutions and how one values certain aspects of sustainability, ranging from simply building upon past improvements in ruminant agriculture to dramatic reductions in ruminant livestock populations. Better understanding the concerns with ruminant's role in sustainable food systems is important, as is understanding the different viewpoints and interpretation of evidence both for and against ruminant agriculture. This review provides a brief overview of some of the key issues related to the role ruminant animals play in sustainable food systems, including greenhouse gas emissions, feed-food competition and land use, and human nutrition. The review also highlights how improved animal health outcomes can enhance ruminants' role in sustainable food systems. Ultimately, ruminants make unique contributions to human flourishing via providing nutrition, livelihoods, and ecosystem services from forage resources and grassland landscapes. However, the status quo is unlikely to meet the challenges of the coming decades, thus investing in research and development into sustainable ruminant systems is required.",Not About Sufficiency

"Australian Climate, Energy and Water Policies: Conflicts and synergies","Responding to the threat of climate change, conserving freshwater ecosystems and securing adequate energy and water supplies are among the greatest challenges facing modern societies. Yet recognition of the interdependencies between climate, energy and water policy-with resulting synergies and trade-offs-remains limited, leaving societies and governments alike vulnerable to the dangers of conflicted or unintended policy outcomes from sectoral decisions. In this paper, we analyse current Australian climate, energy and water policies to identify the risks of perverse outcomes between the three policy sectors. In doing so we categorise the conflicts and synergies between particular energy generation, carbon sequestration and water supply policies to improve understandings of the challenges facing decision makers in Australia and internationally. Four types of interventions are identified that would enable integration and optimisation of policies, namely: better cross-sectoral knowledge to inform decisions; the identification of technologies with co-benefits; markets with broader cross-sectoral participation (including linking water and carbon markets); and better-integrated governance institutions. © 2013 Copyright Geographical Society of New South Wales Inc.",Not About Sufficiency

We found that biodiversity research in Brazil remains focused predominantly on biological processes and that research on the links with ES and HWB is in its early phases, exhibiting scarce connections with provisioning and cultural services. This pattern reveals the nature of existing funding policies and scientific gaps in the country.

"The use of bio-waste to revegetate eroded land areas in Ylläs, Northern Finland: Toward a zero waste perspective of tourism in the Finnish Lapland","Lapland is one of the most attractive nature-tourism areas in Europe, and tourism is vital for local economy. However, recreational tourist activities such as skiing, hiking and horse riding deteriorate the unique and vulnerable nature of Northern Finland. Erosion and wearing of tourist areas negatively affects biodiversity and ecosystem services and reduce the attractiveness of the region. Tourism is also the source of other environmental disturbances such as wastes. Currently, in Lapland, the prevalent waste treatment method is disposal, and wastes are transported over long distances due to lack of recipient facilities for waste management. The suggestion for sustainable waste management Scenario presented in this paper is to find a synergistic solution to both of these problems, by local treatment of bio-waste in an anaerobic digestor and utilization of digestate to revegetate eroded land. It is proposed that bio-waste is co-digested with sewage sludge and offal from slaughterhouses in Ylläs in the municipality of Kolari. An estimated 500-1000 t of digestate could be produced and used in tourist areas annually. Experiences from existing seasonal bio-waste collection schemes and interviews of local tourist enterprises and tourists indicate that there is willingness to extend the source separation of wastes. Assessment of the digestion Scenario suggests that economic costs of investment could be offset by avoided costs and by additional environmental and social benefits. It is concluded that this zero waste approach could lead to an improved image of Lapland as a sustainable tourist destination. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Rural–Urban Metabolism: A Methodological Approach for Carbon-Positive and Circular Territories,"Cities are responsible for about 75% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. Various materials and energy sources, which are mostly produced by the rural areas rather than the cities, are consumed by the cities, and their waste is released back into the rural areas, thereby causing evident environmental damages. The Rural–Urban Metabolism approach can offer a comprehensive tool to understand the flux of resources that cross the urban environments and plan for more sustainable cities. Considering the strength of the relationship between the urban and rural areas, this paper offers a new perspective regarding the Rural–Urban Metabolism and its application in the Autonomous Province of Trento is discussed. The methodological approach consists of four main steps: data collection and management to support strategic territorial/urban plans; data assessment to critically evaluate the existing context; data mapping to visualize the data and territorial dynamics; and finally, the definition of the strategic and integrated development plan and actions.

India's Agriculture Sector's Journey towards Sustainable Development Goals: Assessing Governmental Interventions and Sectoral Outcomes,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) comprise a set of 17 global objectives established by the United Nations to tackle urgent worldwide challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, and environmental degradation. Numerous SDGs are directly linked to the realms of food and agriculture. SDG 2, named Zero Hunger, focuses on ending hunger, achieving food security, enhancing nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. SDG 12, Responsible Consumption and Production, addresses the need for sustainable food systems and the reduction of food waste. SDG 13, Climate Action, underscores the connection between agriculture and efforts for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Additionally, SDG 15, Life on Land, emphasizes the significance of safeguarding terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity, often impacted by agricultural practices. These goals collectively highlight the pivotal role of food and agriculture in realizing broader sustainable development objectives. India, with its significant agrarian base, stands at the forefront of addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the agriculture sector. This paper delves into the multifaceted challenges encountered by the Indian economy concerning SDGs in agriculture and examines the diverse array of initiatives introduced by the government to attain these goals. Through a comprehensive review of literature and policy analysis, this paper identifies key areas such as poverty alleviation, food security, sustainable land use, water management, and rural livelihoods, among others, where concerted efforts are required to achieve the SDGs. Furthermore, it explores the intricate interplay between socio-economic factors, environmental sustainability, and technological advancements in shaping the trajectory of Indian agriculture. By critically evaluating government interventions, including policies, programs, and schemes, the paper elucidates their effectiveness, gaps, and potential areas for improvement. Insights from this research aim to inform policymakers, stakeholders, and practitioners in designing holistic strategies to navigate the complexities of sustainable development in Indian agriculture. © 2024 Horizon Research Publishing.

Status and assets of permanent grassland in France and in Europe,"This text specifies the current status and recent evolution of permanent grassland in Europe and in France, and reviews the main services provided by grassland. Grassland covers over 40 % of European agricultural land. Permanent grassland covers 57 million ha and temporary grassland, 10 million ha. Total grassland acreage dropped significantly between 1960 and 2003. Total loss is estimated at 30 %, which is to say over 7 million ha lost in Europe and 4 million ha lost in France. Grassland in Europe is characterized by a rich biodiversity, sown grassland and indigenous vegetation; its level of production is highly variable, as is its distribution in different countries. This agricultural cover is all the more important because it is multifunctional and has a considerable environmental and social impact.

Making rewilding fit for policy,"Rewilding, here defined as “the reorganisation of biota and ecosystem processes to set an identified social–ecological system on a preferred trajectory, leading to the self-sustaining provision of ecosystem services with minimal ongoing management,” is increasingly considered as an environmental management option, with potential for enhancing both biodiversity and ecosystem services. Despite burgeoning interest in the concept, there are uncertainties and difficulties associated with the practical implementation of rewilding projects, while the evidence available for facilitating sound decision-making for rewilding initiatives remains elusive. We identify five key research areas to inform the implementation of future rewilding initiatives: increased understanding of the links between actions and impacts; improved risk assessment processes, through, for example, better definition and quantification of ecological risks; improved predictions of spatio-temporal variation in potential economic costs and associated benefits; better identification and characterisation of the likely social impacts of a given rewilding project; and facilitated emergence of a comprehensive and practical framework for the monitoring and evaluation of rewilding projects. Policy implications. Environmental legislation is commonly based on a “compositionalist” paradigm itself predicated on the preservation of historical conditions characterised by the presence of particular species assemblages and habitat types. However, global environmental change is driving some ecosystems beyond their limits so that restoration to historical benchmarks or modern likely equivalents may no longer be an option. This means that the current environmental policy context could present barriers to the broad implementation of rewilding projects. To progress the global rewilding agenda, a better appreciation of current policy opportunities and constraints is required. This, together with a clear definition of rewilding and a scientifically robust rationale for its local implementation, is a prerequisite to engage governments in revising legislation where required to facilitate the operationalisation of rewilding. © 2018 The Authors.

Climate change as a main driver of ecological research,"1. Climate change is a major threat to biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. Mitigating its effects on living organisms and societies will be at the heart of most environmental management strategies, which will need to be informed by integrative scientific approaches. This Issues Special Profile provides examples of such approaches. 2. Responses of species to change in climatic conditions will range from thriving (i.e. species capable of living under the new set of conditions) to adapting (i.e. species capable of surviving a change in global conditions by changing their ecology and/or distribution) and going extinct. Yet there is a need to identify which species will fall into which categories, as well as a need to understand how to facilitate species ability to adapt to change. 3. Landscape management will be key to ensuring that functional, resilient ecosystems are maintained. Preserving the complexity and function of ecosystems can help mitigate the impact of extreme climatic conditions on the delivery of vital services such as climate regulation, primary production and water retention. 4. To mitigate further biodiversity loss, healthy habitats will also need to be better connected. In many situations, developing ecological networks will require costly habitat restoration at large spatial scales: to maximise opportunities for these networks to be created and be successful, landscape-scale assessments of the provision and value of multiple ecosystem services under alternative management regimes will need to inform decisions as to where and how to implement their creation. 5. Synthesis and applications. Climate change is only starting to shape the ecological research agenda, as the complexity of the impact of this phenomenon on biodiversity and ecosystem services slowly unveils. Because changes in climatic conditions are expected to hit everyone everywhere, effective solutions for climate change mitigation will require science to truly engage with society and support decision-making processes at local, national and international scales.",Not About Sufficiency
Landscape-scale expansion of agroecology to enhance natural pest control: A systematic review,"Ecological intensification of agriculture (EIA) aims to assure food security by harnessing ecosystem services while minimizing external inputs and environmental harms. One manifestation of EIA proposed worldwide is agroecological farming, which will affect future landscapes, biodiversity and make assurance of crop yields more reliant on management of natural pest control. Using a systematic review we examined available knowledge to forecast the consequences for natural pest control of a landscape-scale transition to agroecological farming. A large body of information showed that prevailing agroecological practices can enhance natural pest control at the field level. This was, however, highly context specific (organisms, crop types or regions) and often modulated by landscape complexity, albeit in an inconsistent way. Consequently, our generic understanding of the functional responses of natural pest control to agroecological management remains limited. Furthermore, the consequences of a landscape-scale expansion of agroecological farming for natural pest control was hardly documented, with results suggesting limited effects. Available modelling tools and approaches to forecast natural pest control were diverse and promising, but the integration of accurate descriptions of farming practices at the landscape scale remains a challenge. Few studies integrated socio-economic aspects and we present some approaches to guide and co-design the transition to future agroecological landscapes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Main conclusions and perspectives from the collective scientific assessment of the effects of plant protection products on biodiversity and ecosystem services along the land-sea continuum in France and French overseas territories,"Preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services is critical for sustainable development and human well-being. However, an unprecedented erosion of biodiversity is observed and the use of plant protection products (PPP) has been identified as one of its main causes. In this context, at the request of the French Ministries responsible for the Environment, for Agriculture and for Research, a panel of 46 scientific experts ran a nearly 2-year-long (2020-2022) collective scientific assessment (CSA) of international scientific knowledge relating to the impacts of PPP on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The scope of this CSA covered the terrestrial, atmospheric, freshwater, and marine environments (with the exception of groundwater) in their continuity from the site of PPP application to the ocean, in France and French overseas territories, based on international knowledge produced on or transposable to this type of context (climate, PPP used, biodiversity present, etc.). Here, we provide a brief summary of the CSA's main conclusions, which were drawn from about 4500 international publications. Our analysis finds that PPP contaminate all environmental matrices, including biota, and cause direct and indirect ecotoxicological effects that unequivocally contribute to the decline of certain biological groups and alter certain ecosystem functions and services. Levers for action to limit PPP-driven pollution and effects on environmental compartments include local measures from plot to landscape scales and regulatory improvements. However, there are still significant gaps in knowledge regarding environmental contamination by PPPs and its effect on biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services.

Soil Erosion Rates and Nutrient Loss in Rangelands of Southern Patagonia,"Soil erosion in rangelands is the main driver of desertification as a result of severe drought events and overgrazing reducing potential land productivity. The objectives of this chapter are to provide an overview of soil erosion as it relates to ecosystem services and to determine soil erosion rates from exposed roots of four shrub and dwarf-shrub species in nine sites of Southern Patagonia rangelands (Santa Cruz province, Argentina) as a case study. We highlight that soil protection is critical to sustain the capacity of rangeland ecosystems to supply provisioning (lamb and cattle meat, sheep wool) supporting (nutrient cycling, biodiversity, habitat) and regulating (carbon fixation, water flow regulation) ecosystem services for human well-being. We used a dendrogeomorphological method to determine soil erosion rates against datable exposed roots. Also, in each site soil samples were collected from nine randomly selected points in nondegraded patches to provide reference points from which to calculate loss of soil organic carbon and nutrients from erosion. The soil erosion rate in the degraded areas characterized by dwarf shrubs and shrubs with exposed roots was significantly different between sites and ranged from 1.6 to 4.1mmyear−1. Soil mass loss rate ranged from 12.7 to 32.0Mgha−1 year−1 and soil carbon loss fluctuated from 85.3 to 250.1kg C ha−1 year−1. The main soil nutrient depleted during erosion processes was nitrogen (mean sites value of 17.9kgNha−1 year−1) followed by potassium (mean of 9.2kgKha−1 year−1) followed by phosphorus (mean of 0.6kg P ha−1 year−1). These results highlight the need for an early warning system by a soil erosion monitoring entity to prevent soil loss and prescribe sustainable management practices to maintain rangelands in an ecologically healthy state to conserve ecological functions and ecosystem service provision. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Biodiversity and ecological long-term plots in Southern Patagonia to support sustainable land management: The case of PEBANPA network,"Historically, interactions and trends between biodiversity, ecosystem function (EF) and land use practices in southern Patagonia (Argentina) have been largely undocumented and poorly understood. Since 2002, 1214 permanent and semi-permanent plots within the PEBANPA Network have enabled researchers to monitor and assess functions and trends among vegetation parameters, biodiversity, forest dynamics, soil physicochemical characteristics, and land use management. The objectives of this manuscript are to communicate the role and rationale of the PEBANPA Network, summarize examples of the main results found within the network and provide guidance to decision makers with respect to advancing sustainable land management in southern Patagonia. As examples, rangeland health indices, seedling and sapling regeneration under different timber managed forests, litterfall and seeds production under silvopastoral use, and soil carbon content impacted by livestock grazing have all been assessed. Vegetation and environmental variables including soil respiration, soil water infiltration, soil water retention capacity, soil erosion, and litter cover were measured under different grazing intensities. Livestock and forestry production have caused changes in the original floristic patterns, with several areas experiencing desertification. Heavy stocking rates have caused the greatest impacts on grassland soil carbon (C) loss as a consequence of soil erosion. We were able to conclude that low medium grazing intensities yield the most positive impacts for biodiversity and soil physicochemical characteristics. Studies regarding levels of seedling and sapling regeneration post-harvest of timber further supported the importance of long-term monitoring due to the strongest evidence of interactions occurring 20 to 30 years after harvest. Distribution patterns of vascular plants and epigaeic coleopterons diversity revealed statistically significant differences among geographical zones and dominant vegetation types. The PEBANPA Network helps southern Patagonia address the challenges of unsustainable land management and climate change through monitoring ecosystem function and services. Long-term monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem function help decision makers better understand the impacts of land use practices, develop well-informed policies and secure present and future human well-being.

Russian-Ukrainian war impacts the total environment,"The Russian-Ukrainian war triggered a tsunami that dramatically impacted the world economy, geopolitics, and food security. Due to the extreme humanitarian situation, the effects on the environment have been overlooked. However, due to the intense fighting, the impacts will be dramatic and produce an environmental disaster. The war is already affecting areas beyond Ukraine (explosions in Russia and Moldova territory). This discussion paper aims to shed light on the potential effect of this vast conflict on the ecosystems and their services. Although the war is still ongoing, there is evidence of severe air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the intense fights. Also, warfare activities were conducted in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (the biggest in Europe) and Chernobyl, increasing the fear of radiation leaks. The biodiversity is being drastically affected due to intense deforestation and habitat destruction with potential implications for wildlife. Bombing, trench and tunnel excavations will likely negatively impact soil degradation and landscape morphology. This assumes particular importance since Ukraine has some of the most fertile soils globally (Chernozem), affecting food production. Water availability and quality are likely to be affected due to infrastructure destruction and the transport of pollutants to water reserves. The ecosystem services supplied will likely be strongly damaged since deforestation will decrease the capacity of the ecosystems to regulate air pollution or climate. Soil degradation will hamper food production, and landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage and social cohesion destruction drastically affects cultural services. Finally, the impacts on human health are already tremendous. However, it can be even higher due to exposure to high levels of contamination and sanitary conditions degradation. The war is still ongoing, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the impacts. However, we may expect a dramatic effect on the total environment.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability practices in hospitality: Case study of a luxury hotel in Arrábida Natural Park,"The agenda of researchers and practitioners in the tourism industry has focused on the demand for sustainable practices. Luxury hotels have also followed this trend, although studies are still limited. The aim of this study is to understand what environmental and social sustainability practices luxury hotels are adopting and how their management perceive the benefits and results from their adoption. This empirical research is based on a case study that triangulates data from semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and observation. The results show that luxury hotels have implemented environmental practices that address energy efficiency measures that reduce water consumption, waste, and carbon emissions and that control, protect, and maintain fauna and flora to promote of unique natural landscapes. They have focused on social practices that address the relations with charitable institutions, provide consumers high-quality services, and create a safe and healthy work environment. Luxury hotels have successfully implemented these practices to reduce operational costs. The study’s findings provide practical guidance for hotel managers who seek to implement sustainability practices. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
Artificial Light at Night as a New Threat for Nature Conservation in Ukraine,"Human society benefits a lot from artificial light at night (ALAN), but in the same time it has led to a significant increase in light pollution of the night sky during the past decades. It has serious consequences on reproduction, navigation, foraging, habitat selection, communication, trophic and social interactions of the biota. Also widespread incursion of ALAN within protected areas has been evidenced for some countries, including the National Nature Parks (NNPs), Biosphere and Nature Reserves in the Steppe Zone and Crimea Mountains of Ukraine. However, the common situation with ALAN impact on protected areas within Ukraine is unclear yet. This research attempted to estimate the level of light pollution on the NNPs, Biosphere and Nature Reserves in the Forest, Forest-Steppe zones and Carpathian Mountains within Ukraine. Kmz layers of these protected areas and the New World Atlas of Artificial Sky Brightness, through Google Earth Pro, were used to calculate the level of artificial sky brightness for 33 NNPs, 2 Biosphere Reserves and 9 Nature Reserves. The results show that majority of studied protected areas are impacted by ALAN, but some of them stay almost under the dark sky still. The situation is unique for Europe, therefore these areas have the special value for biodiversity conservation and can be recognized as refugia where natural habitats are not influenced by ALAN. Based on obtained results, recommendations for improving of nature conservation management are given in the context of ALAN problem. © 2019 M.

"Climate Change Interactions with Agriculture, Forestry Sequestration, and Food Security","Climate change can negatively affect crop productivity decreasing food production in many regions across the world. Literature suggests forest carbon sequestration (FCS) is a good alternative to mitigate climate change due to its ability to sequester carbon at low cost. Nevertheless, FCS subsidies have not been addressed together with impacts on food security and climate change reduced crop yields. In our multidisciplinary work, we collected the crop yield shocks from global circulation—crop modeling. We also developed a new version of a computable general equilibrium model for the economic analysis. Thus, we evaluate the global economic impacts of using carbon taxes and FCS to achieve 50% emission reductions. We find that implementing an aggressive FCS incentive can cause substantial increases in food prices because of land competition between forest and crop production. Without climate induced yield reductions, FCS is attractive, but not with the yield reductions. With the climate induced yield shocks, food price increases are huge—so large that it is clear this approach could not be adopted in the real world. The results cry out for investment in agricultural research on climate adaptation. Our findings suggest economic well-being falls more without mitigation than with 50% emission reductions. © 2019, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"The nexus between connectivity, climate, and land use: A scenario assessment of bio-energy landscape connectivity in central Italy","The complex interplay between landscape connectivity, climate fluctuations, and land use transformations profoundly affects ecosystem health, functionality, and human well-being on a global scale. However, these interconnected issues are often not addressed collectively in studies, conservation strategies, or land use plans, particularly at the landscape scale. This paper introduces, for the first time the CCL Nexus - an integrated approach to studying the Connectivity, Climate, and Land use/cover change relationship - to better understand and resolve these complex dynamics. Additionally, a PANDORA model implementation is presented for the first time to simulate coupled climate change and land use scenarios across different time intervals. The aim is to assess their combined effects on bio-energy landscape connectivity from 2001 to 2020 with projections into the future (2041–2060 and 2081–2100) based on different scenarios. Results show that while climate change scenarios (i.e., the increased aridity leading to a decline in vegetation metabolism and yield due to water stress) have a modest impact, land use changes, particularly urbanization, significantly affect landscape connectivity. Conversely, the naturalization scenario appears insufficient to counterbalance the simulated urban growth. These findings highlight the need for localized approaches in land use planning to address connectivity challenges effectively. Furthermore, they shed light on both the potential and limitations of the PANDORA model in unraveling the complexities of the CCL nexus in Mediterranean landscapes. Overall, the study advocates for integrating the CCL nexus concept into comprehensive multilevel planning frameworks to promote biodiversity conservation and enhance socio-ecological system sustainability and resilience. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Cultural ecosystem services in European grasslands: A systematic review of threats,"The degradation of ecosystems threatens the provision of ecosystem services and limits human well-being. This systematic literature review evaluates the threats surrounding cultural ecosystem services (CES), namely recreation and landscape aesthetics in European permanent grasslands. We identified underlying causes, direct threats, consequences and suggested solutions for threat mitigation. The most common threats were land-use and management change processes, followed by social attitude, industrial developments and natural threats. However, recreational activities also created negative feedback, affecting the ecosystem, biodiversity and CES, most frequently in the form of various touristic activities. Suggested solutions were most commonly socio-economic and institutional measures to enhance rural communities, as well as improving communication with relevant stakeholders. CES play a crucial role in reconnecting people with nature, and their consequent acknowledgement and incorporation into future ecosystem service frameworks and agri-environmental policy developments are key elements in supporting future sustainable grassland management. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Regional inequalities in air quality and health co-benefits due to climate change mitigation in the European electricity sector,"Electricity supply transition to reach carbon neutrality in Europe is expected to bring air quality and health co-benefits, but their regional distribution has not been investigated in detail. This study quantifies these co-benefits for 250 European electricity scenarios in 2035 across 296 sub-national regions. The study links a spatially-explicit electricity sector model with an air quality and health impact model and then accounts for susceptibility and vulnerability of populations to adverse health effects. In case of low-carbon transition, direct PM2.5 concentrations attributable to European electricity generation in 2035 could be reduced by 45–99% compared to a system with the generation capacities of 2018. Depending on the system’s make-up, health co-benefits can vary significantly, as does their regional distribution. Focus on the minimum system costs leads to 15 times higher continent-wide excess deaths and to higher regional inequality than the scenario with minimum air pollutant emissions, which would almost entirely eliminate PM2.5-related mortality attributable to electricity generation. The most vulnerable regions (Balkans, Northern Germany, Southeast France, and the West Midlands in England) would benefit from higher air quality co-benefits than the continental average. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Introduction: Improved aquatic animal health management is vital to aquaculture's role in global food security,"Global food security and nutrition depend heavily on aquaculture, the continued growth of which is crucial as the world heads towards a human population of at least 9 billion by 2050, while harvests from wild capture will, at best, stabilise at current levels. Thus, a fundamental question is: how can we sustainably increase aquatic food production? It is clear that aquatic animal diseases present a substantial threat and, consequently, aquatic animal health management has a critical role in food security. An ecosystem approach to aquaculture will mitigate impacts on ecosystem services and biodiversity, and provide the necessary resilience to future disease threats, including those exacerbated by climate change. Due to the nature of aquatic production systems, this approach must encompass fisheries and other sectors that share the same resources. Improved aquatic animal health management must be a key component of aquaculture's future. At the national level, public-private partnerships are vital in achieving objectives of common benefit. Improved disease reporting and response is critical in the control of listed and emerging diseases and can only be achieved through government, industry and stakeholder collaboration. Great potential exists to improve biosecurity from the farm to national level, but this will only be achieved through collaboration. Industry cannot develop effective biosecurity without a clear government strategy and support, specifically legislation which provides an effective framework for safe trade. Governments have a key role in creating a regulatory environment that supports effective biosecurity and is attractive to investment; such as one that supports the development and regulatory approval of therapeutics. The improved control of transboundary diseases requires the wider and more consistent implementation of OIE standards, particularly on disease notification. This can only be achieved through improved collaboration between trading partners and by supporting low- and middle-income countries to strengthen their aquatic animal health services. There is incredible potential for aquaculture to continue its rapid growth and increase its contribution to global food security. However, sustainable growth of aquaculture is threatened by both known diseases, which we cannot effectively control, and new diseases, which may become pandemic. Recent pandemics have shown that global production systems are epidemiologically connected and, consequently, aquatic animal diseases present a shared global threat that demands global solidarity. The world now depends on a sustainable future for aquaculture and improved aquatic animal health management is critical to its continued and growing contribution to global food security.; La sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle mondiale dépend fortement de l’aquaculture, dont l’impératif de croissance continue est d’autant plus vital que la population mondiale devrait dépasser les 9 milliards d’habitants d’ici 2050, tandis que le produit des captures en mer se maintiendra, dans le meilleur des cas, aux niveaux actuels. Par conséquent, la question fondamentale est celle de savoir comment accroître les capacités de production durable de denrées alimentaires d’origine aquatique. Il est évident que les maladies des animaux aquatiques présentent une menace importante et que la gestion de la santé des animaux aquatiques joue un rôle déterminant pour la sécurité alimentaire. Une approche de l’aquaculture basée sur les écosystèmes permettra d’atténuer l’impact des maladies sur les services écosystémiques et sur la biodiversité et d’assurer la résilience nécessaire vis-à-vis des futures menaces sanitaires, y compris celles que le changement climatique risque d’amplifier. Compte tenu de la nature des systèmes de production aquatique, cette approche doit couvrir la pêche mais aussi d’autres secteurs partageant les mêmes ressources. L’amélioration de la gestion de la santé des animaux aquatiques est donc une composante essentielle de l’avenir de l’aquaculture. À l’échelle nationale, les partenariats public–privé sont déterminants pour la réussite d’objectifs d’intérêt commun. L’amélioration de la notification des maladies et de la réponse qui leur est apportée est essentielle pour lutter contre les maladies listées et émergentes et ne peut se faire qu’avec la collaboration des gouvernements, du secteur lui-même et des parties prenantes. Il y a une grande marge potentielle d’amélioration de la biosécurité en aquaculture, depuis la ferme jusqu’au niveau national, mais elle ne pourra se réaliser qu’en mettant en place une collaboration effective. La filière aquacole ne peut assurer une biosécurité efficace si elle ne dispose pas du soutien stratégique des gouvernements, en particulier sous forme d’une législation apportant un cadre effectif à la sécurité sanitaire des échanges. Le rôle des gouvernements est déterminant en ce qu’ils instaurent un contexte réglementaire propice à la biosécurité et attractif pour les investisseurs, par exemple en soutenant le développement et l’autorisation réglementée de nouveaux agents thérapeutiques. Fondamentalement, l’amélioration de la lutte contre les maladies transfrontalières passe par une mise en œuvre plus large et cohérente des normes de l’OIE, en particulier celles relatives à la notification des maladies. Cela ne peut se faire qu’à travers une meilleure collaboration entre partenaires commerciaux et le soutien apporté aux pays à revenu faible et intermédiaire afin qu’ils puissent renforcer leurs services chargés de la santé des animaux aquatiques. L’aquaculture a un potentiel de croissance énorme et devrait pouvoir contribuer encore plus à la sécurité alimentaire mondiale. Néanmoins, la croissance durable de l’aquaculture est menacée par des maladies connues mais que nous ne savons pas encore maîtriser efficacement, ainsi que par des maladies nouvelles qui risquent de prendre une dimension pandémique. Les pandémies récentes ont montré l’interconnexion des systèmes de production mondiaux au plan épidémiologique et la menace mondiale que représentent les maladies des animaux aquatiques, menace qui nous concerne tous et exige une solidarité planétaire. Le monde dépend désormais de la possibilité pour l’aquaculture d’avoir un avenir durable, de sorte qu’il est vital d’améliorer la gestion des maladies des animaux aquatiques afin que le secteur puisse continuer à renforcer sa participation à la sécurité alimentaire mondiale.; La nutrición y la seguridad alimentaria del mundo dependen en buena medida de la acuicultura, cuyo continuo crecimiento es esencial cuando el planeta se encamina hacia una población de al menos 9 000 millones de seres humanos para 2050 y cuando la producción resultante de la pesca de captura quedará estancada, en el mejor de los casos, en los niveles actuales. Ello abre un interrogante fundamental: el de cómo incrementar de modo sostenible la producción de alimentos de origen acuático. Está claro que las enfermedades de los animales acuáticos representan una importante amenaza y que, por consiguiente, la gestión de su estado de salud cumple una función básica para la seguridad alimentaria. El hecho de considerar la acuicultura en clave ecosistémica atenuará el impacto de esta actividad sobre los servicios y la diversidad biológica de los ecosistemas y aportará la necesaria resiliencia ante futuras amenazas infecciosas, en particular aquellas que el cambio climático va a exacerbar. Por la propia naturaleza de los sistemas de producción acuícola, esta lógica ecosistémica debe abarcar tanto la pesca como otros sectores que comparten los mismos recursos. Un aspecto clave del porvenir de la acuicultura debe ser una mejor gestión de la sanidad de los animales acuáticos. A escala nacional, las alianzas publicoprivadas son vitales para cumplir una serie de objetivos de interés general. Para combatir las patologías inscritas en las listas, así como las enfermedades emergentes, es fundamental contar con mecanismos más eficaces para notificarlas y responder a ellas, lo que pasa necesariamente por la colaboración entre los poderes públicos, la industria y otras partes interesadas. Hay mucho margen para reforzar la seguridad biológica a todos los niveles, desde el de la explotación hasta el nacional, pero el ingrediente insoslayable para ello es la colaboración. El sector no puede instaurar una seguridad biológica eficaz sin contar con el apoyo y con una estrategia clara de los poderes públicos, y más concretamente sin una legislación que encuadre eficazmente la seguridad del comercio. Los gobiernos tienen una función básica que cumplir estableciendo condiciones reglamentarias que, además de propiciar medidas eficaces de seguridad biológica, atraigan las inversiones, por ejemplo, apoyando los procesos de desarrollo y aprobación reglamentaria de productos terapéuticos. Un factor clave para combatir más eficazmente las enfermedades transfronterizas es una aplicación más extendida y coherente de las normas de la OIE, sobre todo en materia de notificación de enfermedades, lo que pasa necesariamente por una colaboración más estrecha entre socios comerciales y por el apoyo a los países de renta baja y mediana para ayudarlos a fortalecer sus servicios de sanidad de los animales acuáticos. La acuicultura encierra un potencial increíble para seguir creciendo con rapidez y contribuyendo cada vez más a la seguridad alimentaria mundial. Su crecimiento sostenible, empero, está amenazado por las enfermedades, ya se trate de patologías conocidas que no sabemos combatir eficazmente o de nuevas enfermedades que pueden llegar a ser pandémicas. Las últimas pandemias han puesto de relieve que los sistemas productivos mundiales están epidemiológicamente conectados y que por lo tanto las enfermedades de los animales acuáticos constituyen un peligro planetario que a todos amenaza y que exige una respuesta mundial solidaria. El mundo depende ahora de que la acuicultura pueda crecer sosteniblemente en el futuro. En este sentido, una gestión más eficaz de la sanidad acuícola es crucial para que el sector siga contribuyendo, y lo haga cada vez más, a la seguridad alimentaria mundial.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable urban agriculture: Stocktake and opportunities,"This paper reviews research on urban agriculture which relates to the three dimensions of sustainability: social, economic and environmental. We propose that urban agriculture has three elements: urban agriculture in isolation; its interface with the people and environment within which it is situated; and its contribution to the design of built form. Additionally, we consider its scale: micro, meso and macro. The analysis draws attention to legal, social and economic constraints and opportunities. It suggests that future priorities for research should be directed towards (i) strategically identifying principles of sustainable urban agriculture that help policy makers to design resilient cities, e.g. using flood-prone areas for food and employment, and (ii) operationally trialling innovative institutional mechanisms, e.g. differential land taxes to support sustainable urban agriculture or payments for environmental services provided by urban agriculture such as carbon sequestration. © 2010 Earthscan.",Not About Sufficiency
Landscape Drivers Influence the Efficiency of Management of Aquatic Invasive Alien Rodents in Western France,"Managing invasive alien species (IAS) is a critical issue for many countries to preserve native biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being. In western France, we analyzed data of captures of aquatic invasive alien rodents (AIARs), the coypu and muskrat, by the local permanent control program from 2007 to 2022 across 26 municipalities encompassing 631 km2. We found that control activities removed up to 10.3 AIARs per km2 annually. The number of coypus removed per trapper per year increased by 220%, whereas it decreased by 85% for muskrats. The number of trappers increased from 2007 to 2014, peaking at 70, and then decreased by 50% in 2022. The number of AIARs captured per trapper per year increased with the density of ponds. The number of coypus captured per year decreased with an increasing amount of woodland per municipality, whereas it increased with road density. Finally, other tested landscape variables did not affect the number of AIARs removed per trapper per year. Our results are discussed in the context of control activities implemented against IAS in other countries. We advocate for stakeholders to assess whether control activities against AIARs effectively mitigate the impacts on social-ecological systems in France.",Not About Sufficiency
Adoption and Diversity of Agroforestry Systems in the Amazon Biome: A Bibliometric Overview,"Agroforestry systems (AFSs) exhibit varied composition and dynamics as intrinsic characteristics of their specificities. In this context, a review of the adoption, composition, and dynamics of AFSs in the Amazon biome was conducted to identify the origin, institutions, and researchers of published studies with results on this scientific topic, focused on trends and characteristics of AFSs diversity in the Amazon. The methodology adopted was a scoping review, based on searches in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, using specific keywords to ensure that the articles addressed topics related to the adoption, composition, and dynamics of AFSs in the Amazon. Following the selection of subtopics, 66 articles were selected and analyzed. The analysis revealed that research on AFSs in the Amazon highlights interactions among traditional knowledge, innovations, and sustainability. The analysis of research published between 1996 and 2023 indicated growth in studies with an interdisciplinary focus, primarily from Brazil. However, internationalization, collaborative networks, and funding factors contribute to the prominence of foreign institutions. Research studies often address topics such as species diversity, agrobiodiversity, and tree growth in agroforestry intercrops. In this context, homegarden agroforestry (HAF) emerges as one of the main subjects of study, encompassing multifunctional environments, richness diversity, and ongoing experimentation with plant species. The choice of species for AFSs is influenced by factors such as labor, personal preferences, and market demands, although loggers and commercial forestry systems tend to have lower diversity, contrasting with HAF. AFSs implementation methods vary according to financing, management, and the farmer's education and gender. Environmental conservation, food security, ecosystem services, and production flexibility are highlighted as benefits of AFSs, while challenges include technical and economic limitations. This research highlights the strengthening and consolidation of AFSs by addressing scientific gaps and demonstrating the need for studies on the adoption, consolidation, and management of these systems, as well as the relationship between diversity and yield. Future research should be concentrated on deepening studies on the relationship between diversity and yield in AFSs, as well as on management strategies that support the consolidation of these systems in the Amazon biome, integrating innovation, public policy support, and traditional knowledge of farmers.",Not About Sufficiency
Biodegradation of hazardous naphthalene and cleaner production of rhamnolipids — Green approaches of pollution mitigation,"Toxic and hazardous waste poses a serious threat to human health and the environment. Green remediation technologies are required to manage such waste materials, which is a demanding and difficult task. Here, effort was made to explore the role of Pseudomonas aeruginosa SR17 in alleviating naphthalene via catabolism and simultaneously producing biosurfactant. The results showed up to 89.2% naphthalene degradation at 35 °C and pH 7. The GC/MS analysis revealed the generation of naphthalene degradation intermediates. Biosurfactant production led to the reduction of surface tension of the culture medium to 34.5 mN/m. The biosurfactant was further characterized as rhamnolipids. LC-MS of the column purified biosurfactant revealed the presence of both mono and di rhamnolipid congeners. Rhamnolipid find tremendous application in medical field and as well as in detergent industry and since they are of biological origin, they can be used as favorable alternative against their chemical counterparts. The study demonstrated that catabolism of naphthalene and concurrent formation of rhamnolipid can result in a dual activity process, namely environmental cleanup and production of a valuable microbial metabolite. Additionally, the present-day application of rhamnolipids is highlighted. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Food-Carbon Trade-offs between Agriculture and Reforestation Land Uses under Alternate Market-based Policies,"Understanding the effects of payments on the adoption of reforestation in agricultural areas and the associated food-carbon trade-offs is necessary to inform climate change policy. Economic viability of reforestation under payment per hectare and payment per tonne schemes for carbon sequestration was assessed in a region in southern Australia supporting 6.1 Mha of rain-fed agriculture.

Sustainable bamboo: Technological innovations and patent insights for a greener future,"Bamboo has emerged as a significant resource across various industries due to its rapid growth rate, strength and sustainability. Despite the many challenges for bamboo and its products, innovative technologies are trying to find a solution and to prepare a greener future. This paper provides a comprehensive patent-based review in four major sectors. A patent landscape analysis on bamboo was conducted using Patentscope (World Intellectual Property Organization database), Scopus Patents, Google Patents, and Lens (a public patent knowledge database). 818 patent records were retrieved from 1898 to 2024 and are discussed sector-wise. Notable patents that exemplify the latest technological strides are highlighted in each area. In the food sector, innovations such as vacuum packaging, natural preservatives and advanced processing methods have improved the shelf life and nutritional integrity of bamboo shoots. In the commercial sector, advances in bamboo fibre extraction and processing have led to higher quality and more sustainable textile products, while innovations in pulping and bleaching processes have reduced the environmental impact of bamboo paper production. In the construction sector, technologies such as laminated bamboo and bamboo composite materials have significantly improved the structural integrity of bamboo, allowing it to be used in load-bearing applications. In the environmental sector, large-scale planting techniques and optimized bamboo plantations have enhanced bamboo's role in erosion control, land rehabilitation and carbon sequestration.

Although irrigation builds climate resilience and supports the stability of the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus, irrigation access and reliability are constrained by energy access, whereas increasing energy demand exacerbates carbon emissions. This feedback demonstrates the need to include carbon in the nexus, leading to a WEF-carbon (WEFC) nexus.

Feeding the growing population and sustaining the quality of the environment are the two major challenges of Indian agriculture system. Traditional agricultural practices have been an integral part of food production in India since ages. These practices have the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change with spatial and sequential diversity. This review covers three aspects of traditional farming of India: cultivation, biological method of pest management and locally available sustainable practices of crop protection. Double cropping, mixed cropping, crop rotation, agroforestry, use of local varieties and resources with host–pathogen interaction are some of the prominent traditional agricultural practices in India which have to be strengthened in view of the environment and food security. Such practices have a significant role in achieving the sustainability of agriculture by improving nutrition quality.

Carbon sequestration by bamboo farming on marginal land and sustainable use of wood waste for bioenergy: Case studies from Abellon clean energy,"World needs a new paradigm to solve deep and perilous problems of climate change, energy access and food security through radical innovation and business opportunities along with social good and financial inclusion by following Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of sustainability. Processed wood waste is a promising renewable energy source which can reduce India's dependency on fossil fuels by tapping through efficient technology and thereby assuring energy security and employment opportunities along with waste utilization. Such system can further be linked and supported by exploiting marginal arable lands through bamboo plantation that sequesters CO2 and fix carbon in form of biomass. On this concept, case studies on 120 tons/day capacity wood waste pelleting plant and 120 acres Bamboo plantation in Gujarat, India, have been presented. The pellet plant is the only ENPlus European standards certified facility in India and Southern Asia that utilizes wood wastes like chips and saw dust from wood processing industries. Pelletized wood waste replaces 1.17 times Indian coal along with reduction in GHG emission by 1.78 kg of CO2-eq/kg of pellets. In order to capitalize on marginal lands, high-biomass bamboo, yielding 20-25 tones/acre, have been developed and planted in 120 acre as captive farming and agroforestry model at Aravali district of North Gujarat, India. The Bamboo, from otherwise unused land, can support handicraft and incense stick industry, opening additional occupational avenues and women empowerment in rural areas. Bamboo waste from handicraft industries can further be utilized for bioenergy projects, sequestering additional 20-25 tons of CO2/acre-year. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

The economics of agrobiodiversity conservation for food security under climate change,"Subsistence-based and natural resource-dependent societies are especially vulnerable to climate change. In such contexts, food security needs to be strengthened by investing in the adaptability of food systems. This paper looks into the role of agrobiodiversity conservation for food security in the face of climate change. It identifies agrobiodiversity as a key public good that delivers necessary services for human wellbeing. We argue that the public values provided by agrobiodiversity conservation need to be demonstrated and captured. We offer an economic perspective of this challenge and highlight ways of capturing at least a subset of the public values of agrobiodiversity to help adapt to and reduce the vulnerability of subsistence based economies to climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
Leveraging Google Earth Engine for a More Effective Grassland Management: A Decision Support Application Perspective,"Grasslands cover a substantial portion of the earth's surface and agricultural land and is crucial for human well-being and livestock farming. Ranchers and grassland management authorities face challenges in effectively controlling herders' grazing behavior and grassland utilization due to underdeveloped infrastructure and poor communication in pastoral areas. Cloud-based grazing management and decision support systems (DSS) are needed to address this issue, promote sustainable grassland use, and preserve their ecosystem services. These systems should enable rapid and large-scale grassland growth and utilization monitoring, providing a basis for decision-making in managing grazing and grassland areas. In this context, this study contributes to the objectives of the EU LIFE IMAGINE project, aiming to develop a Web-GIS app for conserving and monitoring Umbria's grasslands and promoting more informed decisions for more sustainable livestock management. The app, called ""Praterie"" and developed in Google Earth Engine, utilizes historical Sentinel-2 satellite data and harmonic modeling of the EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) to estimate vegetation growth curves and maturity periods for the forthcoming vegetation cycle. The app is updated in quasi-real time and enables users to visualize estimates for the upcoming vegetation cycle, including the maximum greenness, the days remaining to the subsequent maturity period, the accuracy of the harmonic models, and the grassland greenness status in the previous 10 days. Even though future additional developments can improve the informative value of the Praterie app, this platform can contribute to optimizing livestock management and biodiversity conservation by providing timely and accurate data about grassland status and growth curves.",Not About Sufficiency
Hedge and Alder-Based Agroforestry Systems: Potential Interventions to Carbon Sequestration and Better Crop Productivity in Indian Sub-Himalayas,"Agroforestry systems (AFSs) have potential to combat climate change and to ensure food security. AFSs can sequester carbon and amend the organic matter, thereby enhancing the crop productivity. Carbon sequestration depends on the type of AFSs, climate, cropping pattern, and management practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate different AFSs for their potential to sequester carbon and impact on soil organic matter (SOM) in the eastern sub-Himalayas, India. Hedge-, alder-, and guava-based AFSs were established along with control (without any tree), and the maize-mustard-potato cropping pattern was followed in each AFS. Soil samples were collected after the fifth crop cycle and further analyzed. The results showed that crop productivity was significantly higher in all the AFSs than control. On average, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly higher by 62 and 64% in hedge-based AFSs as compared to guava-based AFSs and control, respectively, and at par with alder-based AFSs. Particulate organic carbon (POC) was higher in all the three AFSs than in the control. For microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) contents, the trend of AFSs was expressed as alder-based AFS > hedge-based AFS > guava-based AFS > control. Hedge- and alder-based AFSs had higher SOC stocks than guava-based AFSs and control. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq.) emissions were greater in control than hedge-based AFSs (35.2 Mg ha(-1)), followed by alder-based AFSs (28.6 Mg ha(-1)), and the lowest was observed in guava-based AFSs. On an average, hedge species accumulated more nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), which were 60, 12, and 28 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. This conclusively proved that AFSs were significantly affecting SOM pools and crop productivity and had a significant role in carbon retention in the soil. Overall, hedge- and alder-based AFSs retained higher soil carbon, and hence, hedge- and alder-based AFSs may be promoted to achieve climate-smart agriculture practices in the acid soils of the Indian sub-Himalayan region.",Not About Sufficiency
Electrochemical Dechlorination of Gaseous Trichloroethylene to Nonchlorinated Value-Added Products Using a Cu/Ni Alloy Electrode with a Gel Membrane Interface,"Trichloroethylene (TCE) is widely used in various industrial applications, leading to significant environmental and public health concerns due to its toxicity and persistence. Current nonthermal liquid-phase TCE treatment methods, including electrochemical processes, typically produce liquid byproducts that require additional separation steps, limiting their efficiency. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces an innovative electrochemical approach for the direct conversion of TCE gas into less harmful gaseous products, utilizing a Cu/Ni alloy 3D foam electrode integrated with a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-sodium polyphosphate (SPP) gel membrane system. Our system demonstrated a conductivity of 0.05 S cm-1 in liquid phases at both half-cells, comparable to existing polymeric membranes. Importantly, when no liquid electrolyte was present, the conductivity increased to 0.09 S cm-1, making this setup highly suitable for the direct treatment of gaseous TCE. The removal efficiency was evaluated by varying electrodeposition time and modifying the electrode surface with potassium hydroxide (KOH) and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), resulting in a high TCE removal rate of 0.69 h-1. This enhanced performance is attributed to the Cu/Ni alloy’s ability to adsorb and solubilize TCE effectively under these modified conditions. The gas chromatography analysis definitively shows that the TCE was completely dechlorinated, with a removal efficiency of about 75%. This resulted in the conversion of TCE to ethene and ethane with 100% carbon recovery. This gas-to-gas phase conversion strategy eliminates the need for additional separation steps, offering a promising solution for the effective management of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) and reducing environmental hazards. © 2025 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DRIVERS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION: AN ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS,"Renewable energy aspires to boost decarbonisation and power the circular economy in accordance with the Green Deal objectives. The transition, however, faces many challenges and understanding the drivers behind it is essential. This paper analyses 27 European Union countries for the period 2008 – 2020 to identify economic and social determinants influencing renewable energy consumption. The results indicate that the population density, education, economic growth, digitalisation and research and development have a considerable positive impact. Urbanisation, on the other hand, appears to exert a negative influence. In addition, the empirical findings reveal a unidirectional causal relationship running from education, economic growth and energy poverty towards renewable energy consumption. This research provides useful insights into important drivers of renewable energy adoption which can facilitate or hinder the energy transition and achievement of carbon neutrality goals. © 2024, Bulgarska Akademiya na Naukite.

Factors Influencing Aboveground Biomass in the Secondary Forest of Quercus aliena var. acutiserrata in Taibai Mountain,"【Objective】The impacts of species diversity (species richness, species Shannon-Wiener index and species evenness), structure diversity (DBH Shannon-Wiener index, DBH evenness, coefficient of DBH variation, and DBH gini index) and environmental factors on aboveground biomass of the forests of Quercus aliena var. acutiserrata in the north slope of Taibai Mountain of Qinling Mountains were investigated to provide a theoretical basis for biodiversity conservation and harmonization of forest ecosystem functions. 【Method】Q.aliena var. acutiserrata forests in the north slope of Taibai mountain of Qinling Mountains were studied. The effects of species diversity and structural diversity on the aboveground biomass were analyzed based on inventory data (diameter at breast height ≥1 cm) and environmental factors in the permanent observation plots (100 m×150 m). The correlation between species diversity and aboveground biomass was determined by multivariate regression. Coupling with environmental factors, the structural equation modeling was conducted to compare the effects of species diversity and structural diversity on aboveground biomass. 【Result】The linear regression and structural equation modeling showed no significant correlation between the 3 indices of species diversity with the aboveground biomass. Among the structure diversity indices, a significant negative correlation was obtained between DBH pielou and aboveground biomass. However, a low percentage of aboveground biomass variation can be explained by the diameter pielou. Environmental factors had direct and indirect effects on aboveground biomass, while direct effects were more prominent. 【Conclusion】Community structure was an important factor for the aboveground biomass of Q. aliena var. acutiserrata forests. However, structural diversity was an inhibiting factor rather than promoting factor on aboveground biomass, indicating that the increased complexity of community structure did not benefit the accumulation of aboveground biomass. Environmental factors directly affected aboveground biomass; however, no significant effect was found on the correlations of aboveground biomass with species diversity or structure diversity. Although the importance of community structure to the aboveground biomass was proved in this study, community structure may not be the dominant factor for aboveground biomass of Q. aliena var. acutiserrata forests. © 2021, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

Disease suppressiveness of agricultural greenwaste composts as related to chemical and bio-based properties shaped by different on-farm composting methods,"On-farm composting is suitable to recycle agricultural biomasses in mature and stable organic matter that can be applied to improve the general soil conditions, such as physical, chemical, hydro-physical, texture, and refresh the provided ecosystem services for human well-being. Quality compost have a high potential in sustaining plant health through disease suppressiveness mechanisms against soil-borne pathologies; however, this property needs to be standardized. In this work, leafy vegetable/chipped energy cardoon residues have used as common starting feedstock in three comparative composting piles differentiated for the aeration method (passive, active and manual turning). Compost from both passively and actively aerated static piles showed higher suppressive properties against Lepidium sativum damping-off caused by Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia minor. The enhanced suppressiveness was found associated to increased population levels of fungi and bacteria, combined with larger microbial activity and catabolic diversity. Compost community levels of physiological profiles were distributed within PCA biplots according to the gradient of suppressiveness and, putatively, their C-food bioavailability degree. The observed differences in stimulation and selection of microbiota may be related to specific molecular compost features. The two suppressive compost revealed either a distinct lipid composition, assessed by thermochemolysis and to the preservation of readily biodegradable molecules by lignocellulosic components, as detected in NMR analyses. Findings indicate the relevance of on-farm composting methods in shaping compost suppressive functions and give new information about the provisioning of bio-based products for sustainable plant disease management. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
"Cyanobacterial green chemistry: a blue-green approach for a sustainable environment, energy, and chemical production","Increased human activity due to the ever-increasing global population has necessitated the urgent need for a sustainable environment, food, and energy. Cyanobacteria, classically known as blue-green algae, are oxygen-producing photosynthetic organisms that are emerging as an option to achieve sustainable development goals. These Gram-negative prokaryotes can efficiently sequester atmospheric CO2 due to an efficient carbon concentrating mechanism and divert it to the production of energy-rich compounds, i.e., biofuel, and other valuable chemicals, using their flexible metabolic chassis. Additionally, cyanobacteria also minimize the emission of methane, which is another greenhouse gas, by providing oxygen to methane-oxidizing bacteria. In recent years, several genetically engineered strains of cyanobacteria have been developed that can produce biofuels and several other valuable chemicals. Strains have also been engineered for bioplastic production and bioremediation purposes. These organisms have gained attention as biofertilizers and can increase the quality and fertility of soil. Thus, cyanobacteria are promising CO2 sinks that can contribute to global efforts in carbon capture and storage initiatives while producing bioenergy, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and several other valuable chemicals. Therefore, these blue-green cells can be used for green chemistry while minimizing the atmospheric CO2 concentration. In this review, we present various applications of cyanobacterial biomass to achieve sustainable development goals. We also discuss challenges associated with the wide application of cyanobacteria and the future direction to make full use of these robust organisms to fulfill our future demands in an environment-friendly manner. © 2025 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Economic gain apropos socio-ecological pain: expansion of plantation crops in biocultural jhumscape of North East India,"North East India is a biodiversity-rich zone and a part of both the Himalaya and Indo-Burma biodiversity hot-spots. It is a large-scale multipurpose landscape consisting of a mosaic of crops, livestock and forest. The landscape also ensures almost all the ecosystem services that con-tribute to the well-being of more than 100 diverse ethnic groups (indigenous people) in the region. However, in recent years, rapid transition in the form of promotion and expansion of oil palm and rubber plantations as mooted and supported by the state has posed threats to the ecosystem and biodiversity especially the biocultural landscapes. Supported by empirical evidence (primary and secondary data), this study argues that as we increase the intensity of production or harvest of such crops, the environmental cost becomes unprecedented and immense to be offset by economic gain. The use of renewable bio-logical resources as the foundation for a bioeconomy must be regulated in terms of environmental impact ra-ther than short-term financial dividends. Therefore, we need to develop optimization models for the biocultural landscape(s) that determine land use based on what is both economically and environmentally optimal. © 2022,Current Science.

"Is rubber monoculture banishing agrobiodiversity and happiness? evidences from shifting cultivation landscape of Tripura, northeast India","Natural environmental settings, in general, are considered by humans as the ideal ambience which makes them happy and reinvigorated especially within their mental realm. If this is the case, can we assume that all green spaces are synonymous to augmenting happiness? Biodiversity is expressed in terms of a system having number and abundance of different species. For resilience of various ecosystem services like food production, climate regulation, and pest management to take place, prevalence of such biodiversity is essential which can substantially contribute to sustained human well-being. In this study, we assessed the status of agrobiodiversity and subjective well-being of an indigenous community amidst the transition from shifting cultivation (SC) to monoculture of natural rubber (NR). Sampling the respondents from 18 villages of Dhalai, Tripura, a remotely located district in northeast India and bordered by Bangladesh, we used mixed methods research for in depth investigation. Findings revealed that in the SC landscape of study area, the cultivated crop species and livestock breeds were being largely replaced by encroachment from rubber plantation. We documented only 19 crop species on such a landscape which is otherwise known for its vast agrobiodiversity in the tropics. This kind of transition from SC to NR which is usually supported by the government development interventions, has severely affected the ecosystem services of such landscapes and banishing happiness from the indigenous communities, as perceived by them. Hence stabilization of rich agrobiodiversity and simultaneously ensuring the peoples' well-being is the only potential alternative for development in the region.",Not About Sufficiency
Do China's pilot emissions trading schemes lead to domestic carbon leakage? Perspective from the firm relocation,"The limited geographical coverage of pilot emissions trading schemes (ETS) raises domestic carbon leakage risks. Since relocation represents a primary channel that causes carbon leakage, this paper investigates the impact of China's pilot ETSs on firms' cross-provincial relocation with a method combining propensity score matching and staggered difference-in-differences. The empirical results, based on the data of Chinese listed industrial firms from 2009 to 2020, show that the ETS has accelerated firm relocation by increasing negative attention and social capital investments. According to the threshold analysis, firms with sufficient abatement efforts do not undertake relocation strategies. The theoretical analysis can also be confirmed by further investigations on the price signal distortions and the negative impact of relocation on carbon prices. Moreover, the study also demonstrates the heterogeneous effects across firm characteristics, industry types, and policy design features. Overall, these findings provide a reference for China's government to prioritize the establishment of domestic leakage prevention mechanisms for ETS. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Organic carbon sequestration potential and the co-benefits in china’s cropland,"Soil organic matter (SOM) is a key natural pool of energy and capital in a holistic assessment of global terrestrial ecosystem services (Brown and Ulgiati 1999).

"Modeling trade-offs across carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and equity in the distribution of global REDD+ funds","The program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) is one of the major attempts to tackle climate change mitigation in developing countries. REDD+ seeks to provide result-based incentives to promote emission reductions and increase carbon sinks in forest land while promoting other cobenefits, such as the conservation of biodiversity. We model different scenarios of international REDD+ funds distribution toward potential recipient countries using 2 carbon emission reduction targets (20% and 50% compared to the baseline scenario, i.e., deforestation and forest degradation without REDD+) by 2030. The model combines the prioritization of environmental outcomes in terms of carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation and social equity, accounting for the equitable distribution of international REDD+ funds. Results highlight the synergy between carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation under alternative fund allocation criteria, especially for scenarios of low carbon emission reduction. Trade-offs increase when distributional equity is considered as an additional criterion, especially under higher equity requirements. The analysis helps to better understand the inherent trade-offs between enhancing distributional equity and meeting environmental targets under alternative REDD+ fund allocation options. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Antimicrobial Activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BS4 against Gram-Negative Pathogenic Bacteria,"Worldwide, bacterial resistance is one of the most severe public health problems. Currently, the failure of antibiotics to counteract superbugs highlights the need to search for new molecules with antimicrobial potential to combat them. The objective of this research was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BS4 against Gram-negative bacteria. Thirty yeasts and thirty-two Bacillus isolates were tested following the agar well-diffusion method. Four Bacillus sp. strains (BS3, BS4, BS17, and BS21) showed antagonistic activity against E. coli ATCC 25922 using bacterial culture (BC) and the cell-free supernatant (CFS), where the BS4 strain stood out, showing inhibitory values of 20.50 ± 0.70 mm and 19.67 ± 0.58 mm for BC and CFS, respectively. The Bacillus sp. BS4 strain can produce antioxidant, non-hemolytic, and antimicrobial metabolites that exhibit activity against several microorganisms such as Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis. According to the characterization of the supernatant, the metabolites could be proteinaceous. The production of these metabolites is influenced by carbon and nitrogen sources. The most suitable medium to produce antimicrobial metabolites was TSB broth. The one-factor-at-a-time method was used to standardize parameters such as pH, agitation, temperature, carbon source, nitrogen source, and salts, resulting in the best conditions of pH 7, 150 rpm, 28 °C, starch (2.5 g/L), tryptone (20 g/L), and magnesium sulfate (0.2 g/L), respectively. Moreover, the co-culture was an excellent strategy to improve antimicrobial activity, achieving maximum antimicrobial activity with an inhibition zone of 21.85 ± 1.03 mm. These findings position the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BS4 strain as a promising candidate for producing bioactive molecules with potential applications in human health. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Marine carbonate mining in the Southwestern Atlantic: current status, potential impacts, and conservation actions","Marine carbonate sediments have economic value because of their high concentration of calcium minerals and important trace elements. However, increasing mining interest in these stocks is threatening unique ecosystems, such as rhodolith beds, which provide many ecosystem goods and services. We review the potential of the un-explored Brazilian deposits and the rising conflicts with other blue economic sectors and biodiversity hotspots. The tropical Southwestern Atlantic Ocean, particularly the Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone, has the largest deposit of marine limestone worldwide, which is very attractive to the global industry, with reserves measured at more than 1355,157,240 tons of CaCO3 and it is especially useful as a supply for agriculture and animal nutrition. This large mining potential raises concerns regarding licenses and potential impacts, especially considering the biological and socio-economic importance of extensive rhodolith beds, which may conflict with mining. Addi-tionally, future dredging activities will take place in vulnerable ecosystems without adequate marine spatial planning (MSP). Currently, there is no long-term scientific information on the available carbonate stocks, stock recoverability, risks to connectivity with other ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs), and the reduced provision of ecosystem services which may affect activities such as artisanal fisheries. In this context, encouraging carbonate mining without science-based information and MSP accelerates the unsustainable exploitation of this important ecosystem. This activity will contribute to the degradation of tropical marine biodiversity and threaten the food security of traditional and vulnerable human communities, which is in opposition to the Sustainable Develop-ment Goals and reaching the 2030 United Nations Agenda.",Not About Sufficiency

Role of agricultural extension in building climate resilience of food security in Ethiopia,"Climate change, related disasters and extreme events are currently a leading cause of food insecurity, affecting all its dimensions. Globally, these factors increase the food insecurity risk at unprecedented levels, thus undermining current efforts to eradicate hunger and undernutrition. Regionally, despite the fact that agriculture is the backbone of many sub-Saharan African countries' economy, food production has failed to keep up with fast rising food demands. Challenges are expected to intensify given the extreme climate vulnerability of agriculture. Reduced rainfall, more frequent extreme weather events, and hotter and shorter growing seasons are affecting the productivity of crops, livestock, fishing, and forestry across the region, resulting in serious implications for food and nutrition security. In this context, Ethiopia has been identified as one of the most vulnerable countries since the variability of rainfall and increasing temperature cause frequent droughts and famines, with disastrous impacts on peoples' livelihood. To counter such trends, there is a need to build climate resilience in a way ensuring that a growing population can be fed sustainably without further depletion of natural resources. This requires helping people cope with current changes, adapt their livelihoods, and improve governance systems so they are better able to manage risks in the future. It also requires long-term strategies and interventions that build on agro-ecological knowledge to enable smallholder farmers to counter the impacts of environmental degradation and climate change. Consequently, for development to be climate-resilient, farmers will require greater access to technologies, markets, information, and credit for investment to adapt their production systems and practices. In this case, agricultural extension services may provide an opportunity for strengthening the resilience of rural and farming households. In such a perspective, this chapter assesses how agricultural extension services may play a critical role in promoting agricultural and rural development and improving the resilience of the sector as a whole in Ethiopia. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

"Promoting Sustainable Agriculture, Boosting Productivity, and Enhancing Climate Mitigation and Adaptation Through the RIO RURAL Program, Brazil","The Brazilian agricultural sector is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, but climate-smart practices combined with degraded land restoration can result in a more resilient landscape contributing to integrated climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. The Sustainable Rural Development Program of Rio de Janeiro (RIO RURAL) has been supporting the transition of degraded rural areas to sustainable productive systems by providing technical assistance and incentives to small-scale family farmers. RIO RURAL promotes reforestation and sustainable agriculture practices, which can boost productivity as well as carbon stocks in the agricultural landscape. Using estimates of carbon mitigation potential for such practices, we identified methodologies eligible for certification in the voluntary markets. We estimated transaction, implementation, and certification costs and calculated potential revenues associated with RIO RURAL's activities. This did not only allow us to discuss the constraints and identify opportunities and co-benefits from RIO RURAL's contribution to climate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental integrity but also to food security as it targets family farms. We propose a bundling approach to carbon, where multiple benefits are measured and certified including water, food systems, as well as social and cultural benefits. This would allow accessing resources from both mitigation and adaptation programs in addition to markets that value ecosystem integrity as well as water and food security.",Not About Sufficiency
"Ecotoxicological effects, human and animal health risks of pollution and exposure to waste engine oils: a review","Waste engine oils are hazardous waste oils originating from the transportation sector and industrial heavy-duty machinery operations. Improper handling, disposal, and miscellaneous misuses cause significant air, soil, sediments, surface water, and groundwater pollution. Occupational exposure by prolonged and repeated contact poses direct or indirect health risks, resulting in short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) toxicities. Soil pollution causes geotoxicity by disrupting the biocenosis and physicochemical properties of the soil, and phytotoxicity by impairing plant growth, physiology and metabolism. Surface water pollution impacts aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity. Air pollution from incineration causes the release of greenhouse gases creating global warming, noxious gases and particulate matter eliciting pulmonary disorders. The toxicity of waste engine oil is due to the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) composition, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) congeners, organometallic compounds, and toxic chemical additives. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the ecotoxicological effects, human and animal health toxicology and exposure to waste engine oils. It highlights the properties and functions of engine oil and describes waste engine oil generation, disposal and recycling. It provides intensive evaluations and descriptions of the toxicokinetics, metabolism, routes of exposure and toxicosis in human and animal studies based on toxicological, epidemiological and experimental studies. It emphasises the preventive measures in occupational exposure and recommends risk-based remediation techniques to mitigate environmental pollution. The review will assist in understanding the potential risks of waste engine oil with significant consideration of the public health benefits and importance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Overlap relationship between the priority of land consolidation and the floodplain wetland potential in paddy field,"Ecosystems that offer several ecosystem services can be used as green infrastructure for human well-being. In recent years, human activities have substantially engineered ecosystems to produce the desired ecosystem services. However, such efforts could lead to losses of other ecosystem services. Paddy fields are a seminatural ecosystem that can provide several ecosystem services other than rice production. Land consolidation in paddy fields aim to increase the efficiency of food production as a provisioning service, but it could depress the quality of wetland habitat as a supporting service. Recently, the Japanese government aimed to agricultural production with biodiversity conservation. Therefore, prioritizing a control strategy for future land consolidation is needed. Land consolidation work is effective for large areas and may incorporate the paddy field, previously a floodplain wetland that played a crucial role in regional biodiversity. However, land consolidation could result in the loss of this function. In this study, I investigated the spatial overlapping between land consolidation and paddy fields, which were previously natural floodplain wetlands in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Here, terrain parameters and flow accumulation value (FAV), that can reflect wetland potential, along with the latest land use map, were used. The consolidation records in 1-km cell for the whole of Kanagawa prefecture were used to test the hypothesis. Results showed that high FAV area with high wetland potential has large paddy fields and was heavily consolidated. Thus, there is need for drastic policy changes to align both food production and biodiversity in paddy fields in Japan. Land consolidation is effective for food production but negative for biodiversity.This study tested the positional relationship between land consolidation and natural wetland potential in paddy fields.Results showed that paddy fields which heavily consolidated and previously floodplain wetland were overlapping.To coincide both food production and biodiversity in paddy field, priority control strategy of consolidation is needed.image",Not About Sufficiency
Do both habitat and species diversity provide cultural ecosystem services? A trial using geo-tagged photos,"Conservation for both biodiversity and ecosystem services are an important issue worldwide. However, knowledge of their relationship remains limited. As habitat structure is strongly related to regional biodiversity, we studied cultural ecosystem services by using habitat structure as a proxy for biodiversity. Specifically, we used human preference, assessed by using photos with location information (i.e. geo-tagged digital pictures) as an index of a cultural ecosystem service. We conducted nature walks in semi-natural environments for cognitively-impaired students from a local special school and studied the photos they took during the walks. We analysed the habitat preferences inferred from the photo locations and the composition of the photos-whether they were close-up, scenic or landscape views. The results showed that levels of human preference and biodiversity, indicated by habitat structure, had a positive relationship. During spring to autumn, when levels of biological activity are higher, people tended to show more preference in close-up views (i.e. the subject of the photo was the species itself). In winter, they tended to be interested in scenic views that were not strongly influenced by species diversity. Additionally, photos taken in areas with threatened species almost always included close-up views, although not of the threatened species themselves. Areas with high species diversity therefore appeared to be more appealing to the participants. These results suggest that habitat diversity could not only contribute to biodiversity, but also provide cultural ecosystem services. Habitat conservation for sem inatural environments could be synergised for both biodiversity conservation and general human well-being.",Not About Sufficiency
Comparative Study between Silvopastoral and Agroforest Systems on Soil Quality in a Disturbed Native Forest of South-Central Chile,"Agroforestry systems (AFSs) have gained recognition as a land use strategy to address food security and climate change. They involve intentionally cultivating trees alongside crops and/or animals. AFSs cover approximately 5% of the global forest area and promote sustainable soil conservation, including soil organic carbon (C) sequestration (C-SEQ). In some areas of Chile, AFSs are used to preserve the ecological value of native forests. This study evaluates the effects of two AFSs, namely, an agroforest for fodder production (A(GRO)F(RST)) and Silvopastoral (SPS), within a degraded native forest (Nothofagus obliqua sp.). The evaluation focuses on their impact on CSEQ capacity and soil quality (SQ), using soil quality indexes (SQIs) derived from 30 soil quality indicators (SINDs) related to physical, chemical, and microbiological properties at two depths (0-5 and 5-20 cm). The results for the total depth analyzed (0-20 cm) indicate an average C-SEQ of 6.88 and 4.83 Mg C yr(-1) and a global SQI of 37.8% and 31.0% for A(GRO)F(RST) and SPS, respectively. Among the thirteen SINDs that demonstrated significant differences (p < 0.05), five were associated with the considered depths (P+, Ca2+, S, ECEC, and Al-SAT), three differed between A(GRO)F(RST )and SPS (BD, NH4+, NO3-), while SOC, K+, and Mg2+ varied across all conditions (e.g., combinations of systems and depths), and beta-(GLU) and N-MIN differed in a single condition. However, almost all 30 S-INDs analyzed showed higher values at the 0-5 cm depth, indicating the positive effects of soil organic matter (SOM)/SOC additions. Significant interactions (Pearson's correlation) revealed that SOC correlated with most S-INDs (e.g., N, NH4+, P+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, S, ECEC, N-MIN). These findings suggest that both A(GRO)F(RST) and SPS systems have similar capabilities in restoring the ecological value of native Nothofagus forests while providing conditions for productive and complementary use. This sustainable option offers opportunities for cattle production alongside ecological restoration efforts and provides a possible strategy to generate public policies related to the ecosystem services of agroforestry systems.",Not About Sufficiency
Pastoral and Environmental Security in East Africa,"The most vulnerable people in Third World countries are often accused of destroying forests and fragile ecosystems and of practising destructive forms of agriculture and animal husbandry. The key to environmental sustainability, however, lies in more reliable production and food security at the local level. This article focuses on individual and household security amongst dryland herders in East Africa. The most crucial aspect of pastoral viability is the maintenance of a balance between family herd and size of household. Risk‐spreading, through dependence on relatives, the borrowing of animals, redistribution through marriage etc. is a general principle of social behaviour amongst these peoples. Consideration of local‐level security, furthermore, reveals the connection between ecological stress and political conflict. Only by establishing secure access to food for individuals and families can sustainable development and political security, not only at the local but also at the national and international levels, be achieved.

"Practicing Critical Zone Observation in Agricultural Landscapes: Communities, Technology, Environment and Archaeology","The aims of agricultural land management change continuously, reflecting shifts in wider societal priorities. Currently, these include addressing the climate crisis, promoting environmental sustainability, and supporting the livelihoods of rural communities while ensuring food security. Working toward these aims requires information on the character of agricultural land and how dynamic processes influence it. Remote and near-surface sensing data are important sources of information on the characteristics of soils, plants, water, topography, and related processes. Sensing data are collected, analysed, and used in decision-making by specialists in multiple domains connected to land management. While progress has been made to connect the use of sensing data across agricultural and environmental applications under the umbrella of integrated sustainable land management, archaeological and heritage uses of these data remain largely disconnected. This creates barriers to accounting for the impacts of past human activities on contemporary agricultural landscapes through the alteration of soils, topography, and plant communities. In parallel, it hinders the creation of knowledge about the archaeological features which form an essential part of the heritage of agricultural landscapes. The ipaast-czo project explores the potential of a coordinated approach across all these domains, which would reduce these barriers and provide benefits by better integrating information generated using sensing. To do so, both conceptual and practical barriers to developing shared practices and how these might be overcome were considered. In this study, a conceptual framework designed to create a shared understanding of how agricultural landscapes work and enable collaboration around their management was proposed. This framework treats present-day rural agricultural landscapes as Critical Zones: complex entities shaped by long-term human-environment interactions including contemporary farming. Practitioners in precision agriculture and archaeological remote and near-surface sensing, as well as users of these data, were engaged using workshops and interviews. The relationships between practitioners' objectives, data requirements for their applications, and their perceptions of the benefits and disadvantages of changing working practices were interrogated. The conceptual framework and assessment of practical benefits and challenges emerging from this work provide a foundation for leveraging shared sensing data and methods for long-term integrated sustainable land management.",Not About Sufficiency
Ensuring Sustainable Development of the Agricultural Sector through Financial Instruments in the Context of Climate Change,"Climate change significantly impacts the agricultural sector, causing reduced yields and deteriorating growing conditions. There is an urgent need to make agriculture more climate-resilient conditions to ensure food security and sustainable development. The research assesses the effectiveness of financial instruments in adapting agriculture to climate change. We performed an in-depth literature review, economic and environmental analysis, and comparative analysis of various financial instruments. The results show that green bonds and investment funds demonstrate the highest economic efficiency and significant investment volume in sustainable technologies. Crop insurance and credit programmes reduce farmers' financial risks, contributing to their income stability. Subsidies and grants facilitate the introduction of new technologies and adaptive measures, increasing farmers' productivity and incomes. Environmental sustainability is achieved through green bonds and subsidies, which help reduce carbon emissions and improve the state of the environment. However, insufficient awareness, difficulties accessing finance, and the lack of effective climate risk assessment models remain significant obstacles. Solving these problems requires a comprehensive approach and cooperation between the public and private sectors. The practical significance of the results lies in developing recommendations for improving the use of financial instruments to enhance the resilience of agriculture to climate change. © 2024 by author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Governing Open Ocean and Fish Carbon: Perspectives and Opportunities,"Marine life plays a vital role in the ocean’s biological pump by sequestering and mediating fluxes of carbon to the deep sea and sea floor. The roles that fish and other marine vertebrates play in the biological pump are increasingly attracting scientific and policy attention. In this paper, we investigated the interest in and possibilities for the international governance of open ocean and fish carbon ecosystem services. We used semi-structured interviews with representatives from environmental non-governmental organisations (ENGOs), policy makers, and policy experts, along with an exploratory review of grey and peer-reviewed literature to: 1) trace the pathway of important milestones, key actors, and their strategies to influence governance of ocean carbon, and, 2) investigate which frameworks might be used to govern open ocean and fish carbon. Strategies of key actors to direct attention to open ocean and fish carbon included collaborating with scientists, organising side events at climate and biodiversity negotiations and seminars to engage policy makers, as well as educational campaigns directed to the public and policy makers about the co-benefits of open ocean and fish carbon. While we found a strong focus of ENGO activities related to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, we also found strong opposition against active governance of open ocean and fish carbon by key Intergovernmental actors in this forum. Opposition stems from a lack of scientific information on how long open ocean and fish carbon is stored, difficulties in attributing carbon flows with individual countries mitigation actions, and fewer perceived co-benefits (e.g. coastal protection in the case of coastal blue carbon) for coastal communities. More viable routes for the future governance of open ocean and fish carbon may lie in international fisheries management and in current negotiations of a treaty for biodiversity conservation in the high seas.

Potential disruptive effects of zoosporic parasites on peatland-based organic freshwater aquaculture: Case study from the Republic of Ireland,"Irish freshwater aquaculture holds great potential for aiding food security. However, its necessary expansion has been hampered by the adoption of important environmental EU directives. A novel peatland-based recirculating aquaculture multi-trophic pond system (RAMPS) was developed to assess its potential to assist in the sustainable development of industry whilst remaining aligned with environmental protection by adhering to organic aquaculture practices. Microalgae play a pivotal role in the farms' wastewater bioremediation. However, a collapse of the algal population within the system towards the end of the pilot study was observed. No relationship between physicochemical fluctuations and the collapse were indicated. Further investigations into the potential presence of biological agents were then conducted and fourteen species of zoosporic parasites from five different genera (Labyrinthula, Vampyrella, Amoeboaphelidium, Paraphelidium and Aphelidium) were identified after conducting next-generation sequencing (MinION). The presence of these species indicated the potential cause of algal collapse. Additionally, changes in weather conditions may have also contributed to the issue. Given the lack of data available on zoosporic parasites and their potential impact on organic aquaculture practices, additional research needs to be conducted. Developing a means to monitor and mitigate against these complex zoosporic parasites will inform food security, it will particularly help safeguard “organic” freshwater aquaculture where there is a reliance on using natural-based approaches to address disease mitigation. This information will in turn inform the replication of this RAMPs system in peatlands internationally creating local employment in green technologies, as communities' transition away from burning peat as fossil fuel. Also, zoosporic parasites may reduce important microalgae in peatland-based culture ponds that serve as exceptional sequesters of carbon. Findings of this study will inform related research that focus on the emergence of microbial pathogens in local aquatic ecosystems brought on by variances in climate. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Land use efficiency through analysis of agrological capacity and ecosystem services in an industrialized region (Biscay, Spain)","New solutions are necessary for the reconciliation of food production and environmental conservation. This study focuses on determining the synergies and trade-offs between agrological capacity and ecosystem services (ES) in an industrialized region in northern Iberian Peninsula in order to improve an efficient use of soils. The methodology provided here allows the mapping of the best areas for equilibrating both agrological capacity and provision of ES. We specifically determine the most suitable areas to develop new agricultural activities with the greatest efficacy. Results highlight the synergies between agrological capacity, habitat maintenance, pollination, and aesthetic values. Moreover, the creation of new grasslands and croplands in productive soils occupied by forest plantations would enhance agriculture, some ES, and landscape multi-functionality. However, decreasing the area of forest plantations in favour of agricultural lands would create trade-offs with carbon storage. These trade-offs could be relativized if actual environmental and economical situations are taken into account. Based on the results obtained applying the proposed methodology, policy-makers have the opportunity to manage a transition towards more sustainable land use through specific actions while increasing local food security. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"A club model of nature-smart agriculture for biodiversity, climate, and productivity enhancements","This article considers horizontal and vertical intensification interactions between environmental conservation and agricultural production to investigate a top-down partnership in agriculture. It addresses the issues underlying the challenge of food security. It explores a nature-based landscape approach to agriculture management that simultaneously ensures food security and safeguards the natural environment. The economic theory of clubs is applied to extend farm-level sustainable agricultural intensification and conservation practices to encompass interconnected activities within the entire landscape. A theoretical ecological-economic club model is used to explore how biodiversity and climate-related environmental goods and agricultural products are coproduced by private producers in agroecosystems of any spatial scale. The model considers any given agroecosystem as a club producing two goods: private economic output and public ecological output. It also proposes a dual environmental incentive approach to promote participants' individual and collaborative efforts. The model derives (a) the social conditions for the optimal application and allocation of resources for producing sustainable agricultural and ecological outputs and (b) the producer's incentive conditions for adequate levels of individual and collaborative conservation activities. Thus, the study identifies conditions that optimize horizontal and vertical agri-environmental farming intensification while preventing crowding out voluntary conservation activities. The model presented here can set a theoretical ""benchmark"" model to address real-life deviations comparatively. A practical proposition derived from the analysis points to the possibility that farm-scale conservation (of biodiversity and climate-related attributes), when extended to the landscape level, can optimally enhance the interconnected goals of agri-environmental farming. Thus, a data-driving methodology is described to outline a practical approach to the agricultural transition toward landscape conservation, a practical guide for policymakers and regulators who need to develop and provide tailor-made support to agricultural producer members of the club.

Energy and sustainable development in Sudan,"Growing concerns about social and environmental sustainability have led to increased interest in planning for the energy utility sector because of its large resource requirements and production of emissions. A number of conflicting trends combine to make the energy sector a major concern, even though a clear definition of how to measure progress toward sustainability is lacking. These trends include imminent competition in the electricity industry, global climate changes, expected long-term growth in population and pressure to balance living standards (including per capital energy consumption). Designing and implementing a sustainable energy sector will be a key element of defining and creating a sustainable society. In the electricity industry, the question of strategic planning for sustainability seems to conflict with the shorter time horizons associated with market forces as deregulation replaces vertical integration. Sudan is an agricultural country with fertile land, plenty of water resources, livestock, forestry resources, and agricultural residues. Energy is one of the key factors for the development of national economies in Sudan. An overview of the energy situation in Sudan is introduced with reference to the end uses and regional distribution. Energy sources are divided into two main types; conventional energy (woody biomass, petroleum products, and electricity); and non-conventional energy (solar, wind, hydro, etc.). Sudan enjoys a relatively high abundance of sunshine, solar radiation, moderate wind speeds, hydro, and biomass energy resources. Application of new and renewable sources of energy available in Sudan is now a major issue in the future energy strategic planning for the alternative to the fossil conventional energy to provide part of the local energy demand. Sudan is an important case study in the context of renewable energy. It has a long history of meeting its energy needs through renewables. Sudan’s renewables portfolio is broad and diverse, due in part to the country’s wide range of climates and landscapes. Like many of the African leaders in renewable energy utilisation, Sudan has a well-defined commitment to continue research, development, and implementation of new technologies. Sustainable low-carbon energy scenarios for the new century emphasise the untapped potential of renewable energy resources are required. Rural areas of Sudan can benefit from this transition. The increased availability of reliable and efficient energy services stimulates new development alternatives. It is concluded that renewable environmentally friendly energy must be encouraged, promoted, implemented, and demonstrated by full-scale plan especially for use in remote rural areas. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency

The most rapidphase of extinction appears to berelated to changes in agricultural policy and practice beginning in the 1920s, before the agricultural intensification prompted by the Second World War, often cited as the most important driver of biodiversity loss in Britain. Slowing of the extincti on rate from the 1960s onward may be due to prior loss of the most sensitive species and/or effective conservati on programs.",Not About Sufficiency

Role of microalgae in achieving sustainable development goals and circular economy,"In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) set out 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. These goals highlight key objectives that must be addressed. Each target focuses on a unique perspective crucial to meeting these goals. Social, political, and economic issues are addressed to comprehensively review the main issues combating climate change and creating sustainable and environmentally friendly industries, jobs, and communities. Several mechanisms that involve judicious use of biological entities are among instruments that are being explored to achieve the targets of SDGs. Microalgae have an increasing interest in various sectors, including; renewable energy, food, environmental management, water purification, and the production of chemicals such as biofertilizers, cosmetics, and healthcare products. The significance of microalgae also arises from their tendency to consume CO2, which is the main greenhouse gas and the major contributor to the climate change. This work discusses the roles of microalgae in achieving the various SDGs. Moreover, this work elaborates on the contribution of microalgae to the circular economy. It was found that the microalgae contribute to all the 17th SDGs, where they directly contribute to 9th of the SDGs and indirectly contribute to the rest. The major contribution of the Microalgae is clear in SDG-6 “Clean water and sanitation”, SDG-7 “Affordable and clean energy”, and SDG-13 “Climate action”.

Additive Manufacturing Electrochemistry: Development of Bismuth Oxide Microparticle Filament for Lead (II) Detection,"Accurate, rapid, and cost-effective validation of water quality is essential to ensure that the World Health Organization's (WHO) standards are met and that the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6—Clean Water and Sanitation is achieved. To this end, the development of additive-manufactured electrodes using recycled polylactic acid, nanocarbon black, and micro-sized bismuth oxide is reported. These electrodes, that are fabricated using a thermal mixing approach, can be customized to incorporate varying amounts of bismuth oxide (1, 2.5, and 5 wt%) maintaining the integrity of the base polymer. The electrodes developed in this work demonstrate significant potential for the electrochemical detection of lead (II) within water, achieving limits of detection of 0.79, 0.93, and 4.29 μg L−1 (3σ), for the 1, 2.5, and 5 wt% bismuth oxide sensors, respectively. These detection limits are notably below the WHO recommended threshold of 10 μg L−1 for lead in domestic water and even achieve the 2036 European Union targets of 5 μg L−1. The 2.5 wt% bismuth oxide electrodes exhibit excellent reproducibility and specificity, achieving average recovery rates of 98.28% and 100.15% in the analysis of spiked lead (II) samples in deionized and condensed atmospheric water, respectively. This approach is further validated against inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy measurements. © 2025 The Author(s). Electroanalysis published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.",Not About Sufficiency
"Livelihood, carbon and spatiotemporal land-use land-cover change in the Yenku forest reserve of Ghana, 2000–2020","Tropical forests are important sources of securing basic human needs (livelihoods) for both the deprived and well-endowed but are also critical for reducing metric tonnes of carbon (tC) emitted from deforestation and land degradation. However, inequalities of human population and land-use land-cover change (LULCC) are existential threats to sustainable tropical forest reserve management and their aboveground biomass carbon stock (AGBCS) in Africa. This study examines the extent of LULCC, AGBCS and perception of livelihood effects on the Yenku Forest Reserve (YFR) in the Central Region of Ghana. Google Earth Engine remotely sensed Landsat data analysis using supervised classification, change detection, mixed with qualitative data from individual in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with inhabitants were used. The overall classification accuracy was 89.1%, 90.8% and 89.8% for the LULC in 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively. Farming, charcoal production, hunting and harvesting non-timber forest products were the main livelihood activities impacting LULCC and AGBCS in the reserve. Open degraded forest was estimated at 1627ha, 1764ha, 1784ha out of 2293ha, corresponding to 36,349.6tC, 39,395.70tC, 39,840.0tC respectively in 2000, 2010 and 2020. Dense degraded forest cover yielded the least carbon stock of 938.6tC compared to 39,840.0tC from less dense degraded forest cover. These findings would aid policy decisions toward achieving United Nations land degradation neutrality and sustainable development goals (SDGs) one, ten and fifteen while ensuring YFR sustainability. Deprived forest-fringe communities, traditional authorities and other relevant stakeholders need to actively adopt gendered livelihood objectives to achieve SDGs, carbon and land degradation neutralities within YFR. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Phenological patterns of Fraxinus ornus L. flowering in the context of ecosystem services preservation in urban forests: a case study of Košutnjak, Belgrade, Serbia","In light of the rapid and unpredictable urban expansion posing significant challenges for humanity, urban forests are increasingly recognised for their role in climate change adaptation in the coming decades. This study focuses on Fraxinus ornus (manna ash) within the urban forest of Ko & scaron;utnjak in Belgrade, summarising the results of an 18-year phenological study (2007-2024). The study evaluates flowering patterns of manna ash across various soil types, exposures, altitudes, and slopes, alongside an analysis of soil characteristics in observed populations. Observations were conducted at three distinct sites within native populations of downy oak and large-leaved downy oak and Turkey oak, large-leaved downy oak and manna ash. Phenological changes were documented by recording key events every other day and converting these dates into days of the year across the three populations. For the first time for manna ash in a temperate continental climate, the accumulated chilling hours necessary for bud break were determined by summing chilling hours from 1 November 2006 until the first bud break in 2007, with this procedure repeated annually for each of the 17 subsequent research years. Additionally, the accumulated heat sums required for key phenological events were calculated using daily maximum and mini- mum air temperatures and temperature threshold for each of the 18 years of research. Results revealed an earlier beginning of flowering by more than two weeks in the Ko & scaron;utnjak urban forest, with notable variability in key phenological events influenced by climatic parameters. Despite this variability, flowering and fruiting occurred regularly, with abundant yields every second or third year. Sexual dimorphism was observed consistently across all analysed populations, with a male- to-hermaphrodite ratio of 49:51% in the study area. The study confirms the vigour and high reproductive capacity of indigenous Fraxinus ornus populations, as well as their tolerance to high temperatures and moisture deficiency. Projections suggest an expanding range of distribution for manna ash in the coming decades, highlighting its value as an adaptive and ornamental species. The findings underscore its importance for maintaining ecosystem services, supporting nature-based solutions, and promoting sustainable management and restoration of urban forests, with significant benefits for biodiversity and human well-being.",Not About Sufficiency
"POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF URBAN SPRAWL AND CHANGING LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE ON OUTDOOR THERMAL COMFORT IN LAGOS STATE, NIGERIA","The continuous monitoring of the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and land cover change is imperative for an inquiry into the potential impact of LST on human well-being, including urban outdoor thermal comfort in Lagos State, Nigeria. Using Landsat imagery, this study assessed land cover and LST changes from 1984 to 2019. Land cover was extracted, LST was determined from Landsat imageries and the land cover changes were linked to LST using the contribution index (CI). Afterwards, the universal thermal climate index (UTCI) was calculated to determine the heat stress levels. Findings confirm the presence of urban sprawl and new growth areas in previously rural Local Government Areas (LGAs) eastward, northward and westward of Lagos metropolis and in regions which lie on the fringe of the state's border with Ogun State. Also, a very strong link between high LST intensities and increasing concentration of urban areas in rapidly growing LGAs has been observed. This link further confirms the increased warming of the state, with an increase in mean LST of 2.16 degrees C during 1984-2019. The UTCI which was used to gauge the influence of LST on outdoor thermal comfort ranged from moderate to strong heat stress levels.

Smallholder perceptions and communication gaps shape East African riparian ecosystems,"Human livelihood needs and nature conservation often contradict. Yet, healthy ecosystems are crucial for human livelihood quality. The semi-arid regions of East Africa suffer under demographic pressure and soil depletion. Ecosystem degradation becomes particularly visible along rivers in semiarid regions of south-east Kenya, where former pristine riparian forests have been transformed into agricultural fields and settlements with negative effects on ecosystem services. In this study, we aim to understand how local smallholders perceive the challenges for the riparian ecosystems and what factors affect their engagement in environmental conservation. We surveyed about 200 farmers and performed expert interviews with representatives from governmental institutions from the field of land- and resource management along Nzeeu River in south-east Kenya. We assessed the level of education, land use practices, environmental knowledge, attitudes and the willingness to contribute to nature conservation. We tested for spatial bias to understand smallholders’ perceptions on environmental challenges. Our data show that land division due to inheritance is not perceived as a problem by the farmers. However, owners holding < 1 ha of land property are less willing to spare some of their land for conservation, as opposed to those holding land plots above this size. Despite a high level of general willingness to conserve ecosystems, our data underline that local people hardly actively engage in conservation action. Furthermore, our data indicate a communication gap between local smallholders and regional governmental officers as well as overconfidence in mass media through the radio which can contradict successful adoption of pro-environment behavior. Sustainable land management in our study area is not a matter of education, but depends from the size of land property. There is an urgent need to bridge this communication gap, as a prerequisite to improve sustainable land management. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Greening agriculture as a response to climate change: a case study from China over 2000–2021,"Green agriculture is critical for tackling climate change by ensuring carbon neutrality and food security. This article assesses green agriculture as a response to climate change through green efficiency and the underlying mechanisms of green agricultural development in China’s Qinghai Province from 2000 to 2021. It employs a non-radial and non-oriented DEA model, super Slacks-Based Measure, to gage green efficiency. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index decomposition model and the Tapio decoupling model are utilized to further analyze the influencing factors and trends in greening the agriculture. Field research has been conducted to gain a holistic understanding of the intricate factors steering sustainable agriculture. The study reveals that Qinghai’s journey in greening agriculture is marked by distinct stages: stabilization (2000–2008), deterioration (2009–2016), recovery (2017–2019), and efficient stage (2020–2021). Notably, shifts in policies and input structures have influenced the green efficiency in agricultural production. The province has largely retained strong decoupling since 2012, indicating the effectiveness of sustainable practices in mitigating the detrimental impacts of intensive farming. The study also identifies economic growth as the primary factor negatively impacting green efficiency, followed by energy intensity, carbon intensity, and population scale. Finally, the study outlines policy insights for greening agriculture. Copyright © 2024 Nyangchak and Yang.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil organic carbon stocks as driven by land use in Mato Grosso State: the Brazilian Cerrado agricultural frontier,"To address national and global demand for agro-based products, agricultural expansion has rapidly become a norm in Brazil since 1950s to date. In recent decades, agricultural expansion and technological advancement have placed the country among the top producers and exporters of agricultural products. The paradigm shifts in farming system from conventional to integrated approach has brought significant changes in land use, which consequently influenced carbon sequestration and soil organic carbon (SOC). This is more prevalent in the State of Mato Grosso, one of the most producers of food in Brazil. On this background, we hypothesized that though forests have potential for SOC stock, which decreases due to conversion to cropland but in longer-term with sustainable management, carbon might accrual significantly in cropland. Therefore, this paper aimed to unveil the nexus between long term land use and carbon stock changes and estimate future SOC stocks in Mato Grosso State of Brazil. To achieve this aim, a hybridization of machine learning and the InVEST prediction models was applied to estimate the land use changes and the SOC stocks between 1990 and 2020 and estimate for 2050. The study revealed that between 1990, 2020, and 2050, croplands increased significantly by at least 78%, pastures decreased by 32%, while forests decreased marginally by about 4% due to agricultural expansions. However, in 1990 and 2020, the SOC stock was slightly up to 147.34 Mg ha-1, it recorded an increase after a longer-time (i.e., in 2050). This increase was substantially under the forests, and marginally in the croplands. Climate-smart agricultural systems such as crop-livestock forest, integrated crop-livestock, and other conservation agricultural practices have great potential to contribute to sustainable development by increasing the levels of carbon in agricultural soils especially, after a longer period. Therefore, agricultural policies geared towards low carbon agriculture should be fully integrated into the various government decision making processes as this will guarantee food security and maximize soil carbon sequestration and stocks in the long term.

"Below ground carbon stock and carbon sequestration potentials of mangrove sediments in Eastern Niger Delta, Nigeria: Implication for climate change","The carbon sequestration capacity and climate change mitigation potentials of mangrove sediments in eastern Niger Delta were investigated. The aim was to determine the carbon stock in the sediments as a measure of carbon sequestration. A total of 312 sediment samples were obtained from 24 sampling 100 cm deep borings at seven locations using an open-cylindrical gouge auger of 100-cm length and 5-cm diameter. The procedures for field sampling, laboratory analysis and result presentation followed protocols for forest carbon measurement, monitoring and reporting. The lithology at the site, which is a major control on the distribution of organic carbon, included peat, peaty clay, and clayey peat with pockets of sands. Sediment bulk density (SBD), organic carbon concentration (%C), were used to estimate the organic carbon stock, carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), and to calculate carbon sequestration rate (CSR) and sequestration potential (CSP). Mean values of SBD were 1.30 g/cm3) and 12.48 %) respectively. Similarly, carbon averaged 39.80 Mg ha–1. The total carbon stock of the study area was estimated at 199,617.36 ± 55.64 Mg C, equivalent to 732,595.71 ± 55.64 Mg CO2. CSR was estimated at 4.54 g C cm–2 yr–1 while CSP of mangrove sediments was estimated at 21.56 Mg C yr–1. The result showed that 732,595.71 ± 55.64 Mg of carbon dioxide could either be removed or released to the atmosphere by the mangrove forest of Niger Delta through forest management practices and/or degradation. The study reinforces the need for the protection of mangroves against all anthropogenic-related degradation to improve carbon sequestration potential and achieve target in line with Sustainable Development Goal 13. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
Reverse osmosis integrated with renewable energy as sustainable technology: A review,"As stated in Sustainable Development Goals number 6 and 13, clean water and sanitation and energy-related carbon emissions as climate action issues have emerged as serious issues within the United Nations. Around 150 countries rely on seawater desalination plants as their water resource. Reverse osmosis membrane technology is the most widely used seawater desalination technology for water supply. Taking water resources, developing renewable energy, and recycling resources have become the United Nations' core sustainable development goal. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an overview of renewable energy in reverse osmosis, especially newly developed renewable energy such as wave power. This paper includes technical issues, environment, and economic impact. In addition, compared with other energy sources, photovoltaic and hydropower energy utilization leads to a lower carbon footprint. Both energy produce a carbon footprint of around 0.08 kg CO2 eq/m3. Control systems and energy storage management are the challenges in developing integrated renewable energy with reverse osmosis. Suitable pretreatment and the effect of direct use of renewable energy on the reverse osmosis process, especially on membrane and pump lifetime, should also be considered in future studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Estimation and economic valuation of stands carbon in Tubokarto Community Forest, Pracimantoro District, Wonogiri Regency","Climate change mitigation efforts can be carried out by reducing CO2 gas emissions through the use of the forestry sector, which is expected to increase carbon sequestration.Community forests are composed of stands that have the potential to store carbon stocks so that they can play a role in achieving FOLU (Forest and Other Land Use) Net Sink 2030.This study aims to estimate biomass, carbon storage, and carbon economic value in Tubokarto community forest stands, Pracimantoro, Wonogiri.The method in this study used systematic sampling with random start to measure the DBH and tree height with a sampling intensity of 2% and made 50 sample plots measuring 0.04 ha.The carbon storage value is calculated based on the conversion of 47% of biomass estimated by allometric equations.The results showed that the community forest area of Tubokarto has a total biomass potential of 79.69 tons/ha, total carbon storage of 37.45 tons/ha, and a carbon economic value of Rp 14,605,787.19/ha or if multiplied by the total area of the community forest is Rp 1,329,126,634.The potential and economic valuation of carbon storage in community forests provides an opportunity to achieve sustainable development goals and reduction in carbon emissions. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

"Biodiversity conservation, food security, and carbon storage potential of local agroforestry practices in the Bird’s Head Region of Papua, Indonesia","Local Agroforestry Practices (LAPs) in the Papua Region, Indonesia, which are still under-researched, play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation through sustainable crop rotation systems, intensification, and technological adaptability. This research aims to develop an improved intensification model that integrates these LAPs with sustainable agroforestry practices, biodiversity conservation, food security measures, and adaptive responses to climate change and extreme conditions. The study utilized the Focus Group Discussion (FGD) method, demonstration plot, Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) type selection of LAPs, and economic and allometric equations. The findings revealed a meticulous species selection process that considered biodiversity, resulting in 24 species classified as Least Concern (LC), 2 species classified as Near Threatened (NT), 1 species classified as Vulnerable (VU), and 2 species classified as Endangered (EN). The LAPs implementation achieved a Food Security (FS) score of 45,23% and 38.47% for Only Used (OU). Importantly, the total revenue generated by the LAPs design in Moswaren, Aimas, and Manokwari Village is nearly the same, with an average of Rp 16,327,231.00, Rp 16,640,731.00 and Rp 15,848,675.00 per year, respectively. This represents a significant economic impact, with the increase being 2.93-5.04 times greater than typical LAPs; this significant contribution to biodiversity conservation is a testament to their value.

Sustainable vineyard floor management: An equilibrium between water consumption and soil conservation,"Sustainable vineyards soil management can help to mitigate the negative effect of intensive agriculture on soil ecosystem for the achievement of the sustainable development goals. Cover crops use as cover management in vineyard could be considered as nature based solution for soil restoration and proper water management. Cover crops (CC) provide many ecosystem services through carbon sequestration and climate change regulation, water purification and soil protection. However, a holistic approach is needed to understand the maximum potential ecosystem service that can be provided in different soil and climatic condition also considering vineyard needs. The current knowledge of CC management on soil erosion, water content and soil C sequestration in flat and slope field is reviewed. Results of this analysis suggest that the sustainable intensification, due to alternative vineyard soil management, could represent a strategic option for nature based solution but, contemporary, tactical choices must be taken into account to obtain a real environmental, social and economic benefit. Further studies are necessary to correlate the environmental factor (climatic characteristic), hydraulic properties and management (CC species, type of CC) with the global ecosystem service of CC management in economic and environmental terms, in order to provide for each environment clear guidelines. This step could be important to favour the spreading of CC in vineyard as a proper strategic management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Metals and sustainable development,"Growing concerns with regard to escalating resource extraction and disposal have contributed to the now widely accepted concept of sustainable development, which recognises that economic growth must incorporate social and environmental objectives. Two critical issues in achieving environmental sustainability are recycling and dematerialisation. Of the materials currently used by society, metals have the greatest potential for unlimited recycling. Once a metal is produced it is, in principle, infinitely recyclable so the stock of “metals-in-use”, which is already large, will continue to increase. While dematerialisation will continue to gather momentum and reduce the amount of metals required in most products, the growing demand for products as developing countries strive to improve their standard of living will more than compensate for this. Thus well into the future, metals will be supplied from a combination of primary metal produced from newly mined ores and recycled metals, though the amount of metal recycled will continue to increase. However, there are a range of environmental impacts associated with primary metal production, and it is essential that a life cycle approach be taken in assessing the likely contributions of metals to sustainable development. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a useful tool for assessing the environmental impacts of supply chains involving metals and other materials. In this chapter LCA methodolgy is used to evaluate the environmental impacts of the production processes for copper, nickel, lead, zinc, aluminium, steel, stainless steel and titanium. The environmental impacts considered are greenhouse and acid rain gaseous emissions, as well as energy and water consumption and solid waste burden. The LCA results for the various metal production processes are used to discuss the following important issues concerning the role that metals will play in achieving sustainable development goals: • current metal reserves and how these may change in the future; • metal toxicity and its impact on future metal use; • the effect of declining ore grades on some of the environmental impacts associated with primary metal production; • new processing technologies with lower energy consumptions that have the potential to reduce environmental impacts, with particular reference to aluminium; • increasing the utilization of “metals in use” by recycling, also with particular reference to aluminium; • the use of light metals (magnesium, aluminium and titanium) to lightweight motor vehicles and reduce environmental impacts over the life of the vehicle; • the potential impact of a carbon tax on metal prices and how this may influence the ways in which metals are used in the future. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency

Assessment of a terrestrial protected area for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity,"Freshwater ecosystems are essential to human well-being and most have high biodiversity. However, this biodiversity has been suffering severe declines owing to the expansion of human activities. Protected areas (PAs) are essential for biodiversity conservation and have proved to be successful in stopping species extirpation if managed properly. Unfortunately, they are usually focused on terrestrial biodiversity, leaving freshwater ecosystems aside. The main goal of this study was to determine the influence of a PA (Montesinho Natural Park (MNP), Portugal) on freshwater biodiversity. Aquatic macroinvertebrates and fishes were surveyed, and biodiversity (richness, abundance, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and Pielou's evenness) and water quality (IASPT) indices were calculated inside, at the periphery and outside the MNP. Results showed that the PA does not affect positively either water quality or the two faunal groups monitored. Macroinvertebrate communities were not influenced by the PA; however, the abundance of pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera was significantly higher and size was significantly lower inside the MNP. The richness and abundance of fish communities were significantly higher outside the MNP, except for trout Salmo trutta abundance which was higher inside the MNP. Given these results, the MNP does not guarantee the safeguard of overall aquatic biodiversity and habitats and we propose an extension of MNP to downstream areas in order to increase the number of species (mostly cyprinids) under legal protection. This work demonstrates that terrestrial PA planning and management should also consider aquatic biodiversity to achieve successful conservation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Are biodiversity losses valued differently when they are caused by human activities? A meta-analysis of the non-use valuation literature,"Many countries committed to climate action by adopting the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals in 2015. This study synthesizes 40 years of scientific evidence of what may be an important benefit of these commitments: the non-use value of biodiversity conservation. The synthesis investigates whether biodiversity values can be integrated into climate change damage estimates based on non-use valuation studies of different threats to biodiversity. In the absence of estimates of public willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid the adverse impacts of anthropogenic climate change on biodiversity, we synthesize non-use values for biodiversity conservation from stated preference studies that account for a heterogeneous set of biodiversity threats. We test whether biodiversity non-use values are affected by the threats that policies aim to address, be it human activities or other threats. We estimate meta-regression models in which we explain the variation in these non-use values by accounting for the observed heterogeneity in good, methodology, sample, and context characteristics. We estimate meta-regression models using 159 observations from 62 publications. The models suggest that non-use values for biodiversity conservation addressing human impacts may be larger than those addressing other threats. We also find that non-use values are generally not sensitive to which biodiversity indicators, habitat types, or taxonomic groups are valued. We predict that the mean annual WTP for avoiding human-caused biodiversity losses ranges from 0.2 to 0.4% of GDP per capita. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art climate change damage functions in integrated assessment models may underestimate actual damage costs because they do not incorporate the premium that the public is willing to pay to avoid human-caused biodiversity losses. © 2020 The Author(s).

Sustainable woodfuel systems: a theory of change for sub-Saharan Africa,"Charcoal and firewood, together comprising woodfuel, are key in the cooking energy mix in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Charcoal is made by burning wood under controlled oxygen to arrive at a product high in carbon. Firewood is wood burned directly to provide energy. Wood energy, which is gaining in popularity as a sustainable fuel in developed countries, is characterized as a driver of land degradation on the African continent. Instead of wishing for the demise of woodfuel due to its associated negative health and environmental impacts, a systems thinking approach argues that improving technologies and efficiency in wood production, charcoal and firewood processing, transport and trade, and utilization in a circular bioenergy economy meets a range of needs while conserving the environment. This article outlines a sustainable woodfuel theory of change (ToC) that describes how woodfuel can be made sustainable rather than being dismissed as a transitional fuel on its way out. The ToC is based on the knowledge that no energy system is without flaws and that technologies exist for real quantifiable improvements in woodfuel systems while filling the energy-poverty gap. A bold rational decision must be made in rethinking woodfuel in SSA, as failure to advance woodfuel technologies undermines global efforts directed towards land restoration and climate change mitigation. We recommend that an improved and sustainable woodfuel system should be considered as an acceptable modern energy source under SDG 7.",Not About Sufficiency
Steering towards carbon neutral transportation practices: A comprehensive analysis of the challenges confronting the shipping industry in Sri Lanka,"The shipping industry remains a vital cog in the global trade but contributes approximately 3 % of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making it a key target for decarbonization. This study examines the challenges and opportunities in transitioning Sri Lanka's shipping sector toward carbon-neutral practices, leveraging its position as a strategic maritime hub in South Asia. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research explores the feasibility of alternative fuels such as H2, nuclear energy, NH3, CH3OH, liquid Natural Gas (LNG), and biofuels, alongside renewable energy integration and emission monitoring systems in port operations. Findings highlight significant barriers, including technological limitations, policy gaps, financial constraints, and insufficient stakeholder collaboration. Despite these challenges, the study proposes actionable solutions, including policy reforms, investments in low-emission technologies, and enhanced international partnerships. A 15-year roadmap aligns Sri Lanka's maritime operations with global climate goals, offering practical strategies like financial incentives and regulatory alignment. The study supports United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

"Evaluation of forest structure, biomass and carbon sequestration in subtropical pristine forests of SW China","Very old natural forests comprising the species of Fagaceae (Lithocarpus xylocarpus, Castanopsis wattii, Lithocarpushancei) have been prevailing since years in the Ailaoshan Mountain Nature Reserve (AMNR) SW China. Within these forest trees, density is quite variable. We studied the forest structure, stand dynamics and carbon density at two different sites to know the main factors which drives carbon sequestration process in old forests by considering the following questions: How much is the carbon density in these forest trees of different DBH (diameter at breast height)? How much carbon potential possessed by dominant species of these forests? How vegetation carbon is distributed in these forests? Which species shows high carbon sequestration? What are the physiochemical properties of soil in these forests? Five-year (2005–2010) tree growth data from permanently established plots in the AMNR was analysed for species composition, density, stem diameter (DBH), height and carbon (C) density both in aboveground and belowground vegetation biomass. Our study indicated that among two comparative sites, overall 54 species of 16 different families were present. The stem density, height, C density and soil properties varied significantly with time among the sites showing uneven distribution across the forests. Among the dominant species, L. xylocarpus represents 30% of the total carbon on site 1 while C. wattii represents 50% of the total carbon on site 2. The average C density ranged from 176.35 to 243.97 t C ha−1.

Valuing forest ecosystem services: Case study of a forest reserve in Japan,"Forests provide several intangible benefits such as regulating local and global climate, protecting watersheds, arresting soil erosion, nutrient cycling, etc., which policymakers ignore since these values do not register in conventional markets or are difficult to measure. While in the past the use, non-use and intrinsic values were cited to justify conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) added another dimension – viz. its role in providing ecosystem services which impact on human well-being and sustainable development (MEA, 2005; Ninan, 2007, 2011). In a seminal article, Costanza et al. (1997) estimated the total annual value of the world’s ecosystem services at an average of US$33 trillion, and of global forests at US$969 per hectare. Despite Japan having the largest proportion of land area under forests among high income countries in the world (about 69 per cent as per the Global Forest Resources Assessment Report for 2010), surprisingly there are very few studies which have assessed the economic value of the ecosystem services of Japan’s forests, and these being in Japanese are not easily accessible to the international scientific community. One such study cited recently estimated the total economic value of the ecosystem services of Japan’s forests at about US$620 billion (2001 US$) per annum (MRC, 2001; White et al., 2011).

Assessing the EU Climate and Energy Policy Priorities for Transport and Mobility through the Analysis of User-Generated Social Media Content Based on Text-Mining Techniques,"For over three decades, the European Union’s (EU) transport policy has aimed at fostering environmental sustainability and energy efficiency. Since 2015, European policymakers have focused more on three key sustainable development goals: decarbonizing the transport system, promoting low-emission mobility solutions, and transitioning to renewable and alternative fuels. To effectively communicate priorities and engage stakeholders, EU policymakers regularly use social media platforms like Twitter (now known as X). This active discourse involves policymakers, industrial stakeholders, the media, and the public, offering insights into the role of transport policy in addressing climate change and energy transition challenges.

Rationale for a new generation of indicators for coastal waters,"More than half the world's human population lives within 100 km of the coast, and that number is expected to increase by 25% over the next two decades. Consequently, coastal ecosystems are at serious risk. Larger coastal populations and increasing development have led to increased loading of toxic substances, nutrients and pathogens with subsequent algal blooms, hypoxia, beach closures, and damage to coastal fisheries. Recent climate change has led to the rise in sea level with loss of coastal wetlands and saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers. Coastal resources have traditionally been monitored on a stressor-by-stressor basis such as for nutrient loading or dissolved oxygen. To fully measure the complexities of coastal systems, we must develop a new set of ecologic indicators that span the realm of biological organization from genetic markers to entire ecosystems and are broadly applicable across geographic regions while integrating stressor types. We briefly review recent developments in ecologic indicators and emphasize the need for improvements in understanding of stress-response relationships, contributions of multiple stressors, assessments over different spatial and temporal scales, and reference conditions. We provide two examples of ecologic indicators that can improve our understanding of these inherent problems: a) the use of photopigments as indicators of the interactive effects of nutrients and hydrology, and b) biological community approaches that use multiple taxa to detect effects on ecosystem structure and function. These indicators are essential to measure the condition of coastal resources, to diagnose stressors, to communicate change to the public, and ultimately to protect human health and the quality of the coastal environment.",Not About Sufficiency
"A new method to classify cultural ecosystem services and visualize their economic value: A case study of Guilin, a famous tourist destination in China","Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are one of the most important benefits that humans obtain from nature. However, due to inconsistent understanding of CES and challenges in assessment methods, incorporating CES into policy frameworks is difficult. Based on field survey data from Guilin, this paper uses principal component analysis (PCA) to reclassify CES. Then, choice experiments (CE) are combined with the public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) to measure the value of CES in Guilin and realize the spatial visualization of the CES’ economic value. The results are as follows: CES in Guilin can be reclassified into four types: natural and cultural heritage, health and hedonic well-being, aesthetic information, and existence and bequest value of biodiversity. In addition, the preference order of respondents for these types is as follows: aesthetic information, health and hedonic well-being, existence and bequest value of biodiversity, and natural and cultural heritage. The value of CES in Guilin is 0.998 billion yuan/year, and the per capita willingness to pay (WTP) for CES is 219.67 yuan/year. Through the visualization of economic value, this study finds that there is a gradient in CES value in space. The CES assessment method developed in this study is replicable and practically applicable, which is of great significance for promoting the inclusion of CES in policy considerations and improving human well-being. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Intensification of no-till agricultural systems: An opportunity for carbon sequestration,"The ""4 per 1,000"" initiative was launched at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) stimulating a long-standing debate on the potential of no-till (NT) to promote soil C sequestration. Previous reviews found little or no soil organic C (SOC) accrual in NT soils as compared with full inversion tillage when soils are sampled deeper than 30 cm. Here, we present the results of a global meta-analysis of studies assessing SOC and total N (TN) storage and dynamics in NT and tilled soils from the most important agricultural regions of the world. Overall, our results show that NT soils stored 6.7 +/- 1.9 Mg C ha(-1) and 1.1 +/- 0.4 Mg N ha(-1) more than tilled soils (0-to-100-cm depth) with an average of 16 yr of NT, in contrast with previous findings. However, C sequestration (+4.7 +/- 1.9 Mg C ha(-1) in the 0-to-60-cm depth with an average of 11 yr of NT) depended on the association of NT with increased crop frequency and the inclusion of legumes cover crops. Single-cropping systems lack the necessary C inputs to offset SOC losses in the soil profile (below 30-cm depth). However, double-cropping systems decreased soil TN that may constrain future C sequestration. The use of legumes alleviated TN loss and supported soil C sequestration. Briefly, our findings indicate that NT can avoid SOC losses from tilled soils, partially offsetting CO2 emissions from agriculture. Moreover, NT with agricultural intensification can promote soil C sequestration, thus contributing to soil quality, food security, and adaptation to climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change adaptation and mitigation and historic centers preservation.

Climate action planning allows cities to organize their approach. It is critical to ensure that investments in infrastructure and services have a low-carbon impact and consider likely climate change perspectives. The output of this process is the climate action plan (CAP): one or more documents where a city sets out its roadmap to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen climate resilience throughout the community. Many cities have already developed and published a Paris Agreement-compatible CAP. The quality and compliance of these plans will also influence the achievement of the goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 2015). Thus, cities are crucial players in global climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, and how they engage in climate policy is currently under debate. The paper is intended to support technological design, selecting good practices from the latest and most complete ones for climate mitigation and adaptation in urban settings. In particular, the paper focuses on public space and built environment regeneration actions that can tangibly contribute to the global climate resilience movement. Considering the operational difficulty that could arise in planning climate adaptation measures in historical urban contexts, the study critically analyzes current strategies in sedimented landscape realities of high culturalhistorical value. The goal is to draw from them a cognitive and expeditious method of intervention that can be reiterated for similar contexts and is compatible with the consistency and value of urban and built heritage.

Resourcing Future Generations Requires a New Approach to Material Stewardship,"The paper aims to examine sector policies for securing mineral resources for future generations in ways that are economically, environmentally and socially responsible, guided by the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050. This study proposes a roadmap for responsible mineral production, looking at drivers and goals, trends in resource demand and supply, technological and responsibility issues as well as current solutions. We conclude that while adopting the principles of a circular economy by minimizing waste, improving design for recovery, recycling alone will not be sufficient to meet the demand for an increasingly complex range of metals, and consequently primary mining will be needed for the foreseeable future. Various authors have proposed top-down approaches for sustainable mineral sourcing and co-ordination of global supply, but there is no evidence of these being taken up.

Optimal forest rotation for carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation by farm income levels,"This study aimed to estimate the optimal forest rotation age for tropical plantations of a native tree species, Canarium album (Lour.) under the management of high, medium, and low income groups of farm households of Vietnam. The results suggest that: (i) the optimal rotation age for the low income group is longer than that for the high income group; (ii) low income farmers are more sensitive in terms of the land expectation value to changes in discount rate; (iii) low income farmers gain less if the carbon price increases; and (iv) the carbon payment scheme at the start of a rotation is more financially attractive to forest farmers, but the carbon payment scheme at the end of a rotation is more advantageous in terms of forest biodiversity. These findings lead to potential policy implications for forest management for the provision of multiple ecosystem services in the context of a developing country, demonstrating a tradeoff between forest income and biodiversity conservation. While an increase in carbon prices would benefit forest farmers, we also suggest that these farmers could be compensated for their income losses or rewarded to maintain or increase forest biodiversity. However, relatively greater attention could be paid to compensating low income farmers as they potentially lose more with an increase in discount rate and gain less with an increase in carbon price. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Forest Landscape Restoration in the Drylands of Latin America,"Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) involves the ecological restoration of degraded forest landscapes, with the aim of benefiting both biodiversity and human well-being. We first identify four fundamental principles of FLR, based on previous definitions. We then critically evaluate the application of these principles in practice, based on the experience gained during an international, collaborative research project conducted in six dry forest landscapes of Latin America. Research highlighted the potential for FLR; tree species of high socioeconomic value were identified in all study areas, and strong dependence of local communities on forest resources was widely encountered, particularly for fuelwood. We demonstrated that FLR can be achieved through both passive and active restoration approaches, and can be cost-effective if the increased provision of ecosystem services is taken into account. These results therefore highlight the potential for FLR, and the positive contribution that it could make to sustainable development. However, we also encountered a number of challenges to FLR implementation, including the difficulty of achieving strong engagement in FLR activities among local stakeholders, lack of capacity for community-led initiatives, and the lack of an appropriate institutional and regulatory environment to support restoration activities. Successful implementation of FLR will require new collaborative alliances among stakeholders, empowerment and capacity building of local communities to enable them to fully engage with restoration activities, and an enabling public policy context to enable local people to be active participants in the decision making process.",Not About Sufficiency
News. World. IEA: Future energy needs require massive infusion of capital,"The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated in its presentation ""World Energy Investment Outlook 2003 (WEIO)"" at the Oil and Money Conference in London the global need for capital for investments to cover world energy needs up to 2030. The amount is $16,000 billion. According to C. Mandil (IEA), these investments are needed to expand the capacities of energy supply and replace now and in the future energy production and supply facilities. The largest capital expense, about $10,000 billion, devolves on electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. The large part, $4000 billion, is in investment in the upstream area of the oil and gas sectors. This is needed to maintain the production at present levels. Against this is the $400 billion for the coal industry which is almost insignificant. Almost half of the global energy investments to 2030 will occur in the developing countries. Probably the greatest challenge in financing the required investments will be in the developing and reformed states. The total investments in the global oil industry and natural gas supply chain, according to WEIO 2003 is about $3100 billion. The accelerated use of as yet not widely available or not in price new technologies capable of competition remains a large unknown. These include for example carbon sequestration, hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen economy, carbon separation, and progress in nuclear energy.",Not About Sufficiency
Understanding the market for eco self-build community housing,"This paper evaluates the potential of eco self-build community (ESBC) housing to act as a socially and environmentally sustainable housing solution that can address the demand for self-build and community housing whilst supporting the UK’s 2050 net-zero-carbon commitment. This model of housing is being piloted through schemes such as the Water Lilies project, an upcoming ESBC scheme providing self-finish houses and custom-build flats. The research aims to gain a broad understanding of the market for ESBC housing by analysing the data from people who registered interest in a plot or home and comparing this with data from a similar survey targeted at the market for conventional self-build and custom-build housing. The key findings are that: (1) the ESBC housing market is largely open to more than one build method, but with a greater preference for purchasing a completed home and self-finish than self-build, compared to the conventional market for self-build and custom-build that is primarily interested in self-build; (2) the ESBC housing market is looking for a variety of home sizes, though predominantly 2 and 3 bedrooms, that could be provided through houses and flats, compared to the conventional market for self-build and custom-build that is mostly seeking larger houses on single plots; (3) the most important housing aspects to the ESBC housing market are ‘green lifestyle’, ‘style and construction quality’, and ‘community spirit’, which differ to the conventional self-build and custom-build market, where they are ‘construction quality’, ‘internal appearance/layout’ and ‘location’; (4) living in a sustainable home is important to the market for conventional self-build and custom-build housing and on average, they would be willing to pay 27% more for a highly sustainable home than the average UK new build. The main drivers are that people want to reduce their environmental impact and reduce their home running costs. A key overall conclusion of the study is that a distinct market exists for ESBC schemes, where the priorities of prospective homeowners differ to those from the more general self-build market. For ESBC schemes, the provision of eco-housing and a sense of community are key priorities, whereas for the more general self-build market, location and the need to tailor the house design to the owner’s unique aesthetic and lifestyle preferences tend to be the most important factors. This paper discusses the implications of these findings and identifies opportunities for scaling up the delivery of ESBC housing. © 2021 by the authors.

"Analysis of Landscape Character Assessment and Cultural Ecosystem Services Evaluation Frameworks for Peri-Urban Landscape Planning: A Case Study of Harku Municipality, Estonia","This study combined landscape character assessment (LCA) and cultural ecosystem services (CES) frameworks to evaluate human well-being in the peri-urban area of Harku Municipality, Estonia. Using geospatial data combined with expert opinions, the study investigated the interplay between landscape character types and environmental/contact types through the LCA method. In total, 21 distinct landscape types comprising 47 separate areas were identified, with CES values determined for each. Restorative, social, and cognitive values were associated with each landscape character type. The findings demonstrated the higher restorative potential of blue and green elements (water bodies, forests) with low settlement density and minimal agriculture. High-density settlements with good road access demonstrated significant social values, while mixed forests and wetlands tended to be associated with higher cognitive values. Coastal zones with semi-dense settlements and mixed forests earned favourable ratings, whereas industrial/agricultural landscapes were rated lowest for all values. These findings offer valuable insights into the complex dynamics of urban-rural interactions, resilience, and the impact of urbanisation on CES. They may inform future landscape management strategies, urban planning decisions, and policy considerations. Additionally, this study highlights the need for further research to explore the long-term trends and potential changes in CES in evolving peri-urban environments.",Not About Sufficiency
A carbon-focus parametric study on building insulation materials and thicknesses for different heating systems: A Swiss case study,"To tackle the problem of climate change, Swiss energy strategies aim to reach the carbon neutrality by 2050. However, this challenge cannot simply be solved by focusing on the operational energy performance and instead, on a lifecycle evaluation. Thus, in order to reduce the sector's carbon footprint, building stakeholders need to consider embodied GHG emissions of construction materials. In this study, a parametric method was developed to balance operational and embodied impacts of insulation strategies on GHG emissions according to the material and heating system choices. The methodology is split into two for the computation of the overall carbon emissions of the heating plus insulation system. Firstly, the calculation of the embodied emissions, which relies on Environmental Product Declarations of different construction materials. Secondly, the calculation of the operational emissions, which is the product between the thermal energy needs and the energy carbon content of the respective heating system. Thereafter, the methodology was applied to two case studies: an existing building and a brand-new building. The first main finding was that, for high-carbon insulation materials, there was clearly an optimal thickness after which, adding insulation would only increase the lifecycle impact of the system. For instance, in the heat-pump equipped case study, installing 35 cm of extruded polystyrene insulation (XPS) is more harmful towards global warming than installing 17 cm of XPS. This trend was not present for low-carbon materials whatsoever. The building's carbon emissions benefitted from their addition of insulation up to the maximum thicknesses studied. To conclude, it is also important to highlight that aimlessly targeting energy efficiency can be a step back towards the goal of carbon neutrality. Indeed, it is possible to claim that for energy efficient buildings, fossil fuel-based insulation should be carefully used. This study allowed the development and application of a method that identifies optimal insulation thickness and material for a given heating system and hopefully, highlight the importance of considering both embodied and operational emissions of construction materials and systems. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

"Reviewing research priorities in weed ecology, evolution and management: a horizon scan","Weedy plants pose a major threat to food security, biodiversity, ecosystem services and consequently to human health and wellbeing. However, many currently used weed management approaches are increasingly unsustainable. To address this knowledge and practice gap, in June 2014, 35 weed and invasion ecologists, weed scientists, evolutionary biologists and social scientists convened a workshop to explore current and future perspectives and approaches in weed ecology and management. A horizon scanning exercise ranked a list of 124 pre-submitted questions to identify a priority list of 30 questions. These questions are discussed under seven themed headings that represent areas for renewed and emerging focus for the disciplines of weed research and practice. The themed areas considered the need for transdisciplinarity, increased adoption of integrated weed management and agroecological approaches, better understanding of weed evolution, climate change, weed invasiveness and finally, disciplinary challenges for weed science. Almost all the challenges identified rested on the need for continued efforts to diversify and integrate agroecological, socio-economic and technological approaches in weed management. These challenges are not newly conceived, though their continued prominence as research priorities highlights an ongoing intransigence that must be addressed through a more system-oriented and transdisciplinary research agenda that seeks an embedded integration of public and private research approaches. This horizon scanning exercise thus set out the building blocks needed for future weed management research and practice; however, the challenge ahead is to identify effective ways in which sufficient research and implementation efforts can be directed towards these needs. © 2018 The Authors.

"Potato yield empowerment by photosynthesis, carbon assimilation and evapotranspiration","By the end of the twenty-first century, atmospheric CO2 is expected to have increased from its current level of approximately 400 μmol CO2 mol-1 to approximately 700 μmol CO2 mol-1. A significant rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration could have a global impact on crop output, photosynthetic efficiency, and plant development. The majority of C3 plant species will be benefited by the predicted rise of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, especially through increased rates of photosynthesis and water use efficiency (WUE), which could ultimately improve plant biomass and yield. Potatoes are considered the world's most popular non-cereal food in terms of global food security. Water stress has a significant impact on photosynthesis. Water deficit can prevent CO2 absorbance from leaves and/or interfere with mesophyll cells' capacity to carboxylate CO2, negatively affecting photosynthesis. Water shortage can lead to partial or whole leave stomata closure reducing the transpiration rates leading to low photosynthetic rate. Since potatoes are cultivated in a variety of climates, it's critical to comprehend how photosynthetic rate, gross primary productivity as a proxy of soil organic carbon, and actual evapotranspiration are correlated with yield productivity. In this study, satellite products of NASA's MODIS are derived to gather the needed observations and a regression analysis is performed to identify the relations between yield and natural processes. © 2024 SPIE.",Not About Sufficiency

"Contributions of financial, social and natural capital to food security around Kanha National Park in central India","The well-being of people living around protected areas is critical in its own right as well as for effective conservation, particularly in human-dominated landscapes. We examine the contributions of financial, social, and natural capital to household food access of 883 households around Kanha National Park (KNP) in central India over three seasons. We use regression trees and mixed effects models to identify associations between natural, social, and financial capital indicators and household food access (an indicator of well-being). We find that food access is low in the KNP landscape with over 80% of households indicating lower than acceptable food consumption scores, with a further worsening in monsoon season. Financial capital (e.g., salaried jobs and proximity to towns for all seasons) is most prominently associated with higher food consumption scores. Moreover, households supplement incomes by converting social capital (e.g., 28% of surveyed households access ""food in lieu of work or credit"" in monsoon) and natural capital (e.g., 14% of surveyed households sold forest products in summer) to financial capital seasonally. Financial capital dwarfs contributions of social and natural capital around KNP, in contrast to other studies, which suggest that gains from natural capital are essential for well-being of people around protected areas. Management interventions, such as kitchen gardens (borne from human capital) to supplement market-bought produce, could contribute to food security without high financial inputs. However, food insecurity in the KNP landscape primarily relates to the lack of financial capital. Food security of people around protected areas in other human-dominated landscapes is likely to be context-specific and counter to frequent assumptions particularly as livelihood strategies change with increasing economic opportunities.",Not About Sufficiency
"Short Communication: Flora and aves diversity in the Kasunanan Palace, Surakarta, Indonesia","The development of Surakarta City, Central Java, Indonesia, as a MICE (Meeting, Incentive, Convention, and Exhibition) center poses challenges to the availability of land, which threatens green open spaces and their ecological functions. The Palace (Keraton), a cultural symbol of Surakarta, has the potential to provide green open space as the manifestation of its local wisdom. This research aimed to identify the diversity of flora and avian fauna that occurred in the Kasunanan Palace, Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia. The study indicates that the Palace complex was still covered with medium to high vegetation cover, especially in the public open spaces of the Palace. Overall, the diversity index (H') of the flora reached 3.249, indicating a high level with an evenness index (E) of 0.624, indicating moderately even distribution. The most commonly found tree species were Hibiscus tiliaceus, Terminalia catappa, Mimusops elengi and Ficus benjamina. Fig tree (Ficus spp.) is a species with high symbolic and cultural value for the Palace. The avian diversity index (H') reached 2.084, indicating moderate diversity with an evenness index (E) of 0.328, indicating uneven distribution. The most commonly found avian species were Collocalia linchi, Passer montanus and Lonchura punctulata. These species are generalists, indicating high environmental pressure due to anthropogenic activities. The study results imply that green spaces in Keraton provide patches and stepping stones, which is an ideal habitat for developing urban biodiversity. This encourages greenspace restoration efforts based on the function of providing biodiversity through the conservation of special resources (large trees) and improving the quality of patches. © 2025, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Factoring Climate Change Risks in the Wetland Ecosystems Governance: A Policy Look Ahead,"Wetland ecosystems, freshwater, coastal and coral reefs, are important ecosystems as they provide many ecological services and ensure livelihood of people. The increase in carbon dioxide and global temperatures change in precipitation patterns, and acidification of oceans can adversely affect these ecosystems. It is expected that increase in temperature in lakes, reservoirs and coastal seas will affect flora, fauna and fisheries. The increase in sea level can erode shorelines and coastal habitats. Coral reefs can degrade due to increase in temperature, sea level rise and acidification. The ecological services provided by these ecosystems have economic value and thus any loss of these habitats can affect livelihood of communities. The global watershed and coastal management approaches such as the 1971 Ramsar Convention and 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide key tools to protect these ecosystems. A robust global wetland information repository system needs to be developed for providing necessary data to effectively model climate change impacts at local and regional levels. The knowledge about climate risks to wetlands, integrated with effective governance at national, regional and global levels along with informed people, are key elements for protection and sustainable future of wetlands. It is in this global context and decisions of the successive Ramsar Conference of Parties (COP), within the limits of time and space, this study has sought to examine the climatic risks to the wetland's ecosystems. The data and the situation in the Indian sub-continent have been used as an example for the purpose.

Long-term effect of different integrated nutrient management on soil organic carbon and its fractions and sustainability of rice-wheat system in Indo Gangetic Plains of India,"Rice-wheat rotation is the most important cropping system of the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and is responsible for the food security of the region. The effect of different integrated nutrient management practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and its fractions, SOC sequestration potential as well as the sustainability of the rice-wheat system were evaluated in long term experiments at different agro-climatic zones of IGP. Application of NPK either through inorganic fertilizers or through combination of inorganic fertilizer and organics such as farm yard manure (FYM) or crop residue or green manure improved the SOC, particulate organic carbon (POC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) concentration and their sequestration rate. Application of 50% NPK + 50% N through FYM in rice and 100% NPK in wheat, sequestered 0.39, 0.50, 0.51 and 0.62 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) over control (no N-P-K fertilizers or organics), respectively at Ludhiana, Kanpur, Sabour and Kalyani using the mass of SOC in the control treatment as reference point. Soil carbon sequestration with response to application of fertilizer partially substituted (50% on N basis) with organics were higher in Kalyani and Sabour lying in humid climate than Ludhiana and Kanpur lying in semiarid climate. The rice yield recorded a significant declining trend in Ludhiana and Kanpur where as the yield trend was stable at Sabour and Kalyani under unfertilized control. The system productivity in N-P-K fertilized plots and NPK along with organics showed either an increasing trend or remained stable at all locations during last two and half decades of the experiment.

Rewilding Abandoned Landscapes in Europe,"For millennia, mankind has shaped landscapes, particularly through agriculture. In Europe, the age-old interaction between humans and ecosystems strongly influenced the cultural heritage. Yet European farmland is now being abandoned, especially in remote areas. The loss of the traditional agricultural landscapes and its consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services is generating concerns in both the scientific community and the public. Here we ask to what extent farmland abandonment can be considered as an opportunity for rewilding ecosystems. We analyze the perceptions of traditional agriculture in Europe and their influence in land management policies. We argue that, contrary to the common perception, traditional agriculture practices were not environmentally friendly and that the standards of living of rural populations were low. We suggest that current policies to maintain extensive farming landscapes underestimate the human labor needed to sustain these landscapes and the recent and future dynamics of the socio-economic drivers behind abandonment. We examine the potential benefits for ecosystems and people from rewilding. We identify species that could benefit from land abandonment and forest regeneration and the ecosystem services that could be provided such as carbon sequestration and recreation. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with rewilding, including the need to maintain open areas, the fire risks, and the conflicts between people and wildlife. Despite these challenges, we argue that rewilding should be recognized by policy-makers as one of the possible land management options in Europe, particularly on marginal areas. © 2012 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

Can Conservation Agriculture Deliver Its Benefits in Arid Soils?: An Overview,"To feed around 9.8 billion people by 2050, it is equally important to increase food production while maintaining the sustainability of the environment. Conservation agriculture (CA) is one of the approaches to manage agro-ecosystems in order to improve productivity, increase the profitability and food security and enhance the resource base and environment. Although many researchers have pointed out the prospects and concerns of adopting CA in different climatic conditions, CA in arid regions raises uncertainties due to its extreme climates, most of the soils with low water holding capacity, high potential evapotranspiration, low and non-uniform distribution of rainfall and greater wind erosion. However, CA practices could benefit the arid agriculture through moderation/reducing of evaporation, regulating water and nutrient in soil and reducing wind erosion. Arid soils, largely characterised by low soil organic carbon (SOC), have the greater potential for higher C sequestration with the use of CA practices. Among the key components of CA, no-tillage (NT) coupled with mulching might be effective in distribution of the soil moisture at proper stage of the crop growth. The emission of CO2 flux from soil and soil salinity are reduced with the adoption of CA in arid soils with the use of cover crops. Due to better aeration and nutrient movement in CA land, beneficial bacterial community and diversity are promoted. However, for CA to work effectively in arid regions, the three components of CA such as minimum disturbances of soil through no-and reduced-tillage, permanent soil cover and crop rotation must be critically followed together or simultaneously for improving soil health, crop productivity through high nutrient and water efficiency, carbon sequestration, mitigation of climate change and sustainability. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",Not About Sufficiency

Social acceptance of forest-based bioeconomy—swedish consumers’ perspectives on a low carbon transition,"The concept of the bioeconomy is associated with sustainable development changes and involves transitions in both production and consumption within systems. Many of these transitions relate to using renewable resources, like forest biomass, to meet basic needs, such as food, energy and housing. However, consumers must become aware of the forest-based bioeconomy so that they can contribute to the transition. This study aims to contribute to an understanding of this matter that may lead to social acceptance of the forest-based bioeconomy and, in particular, to Swedish consumer awareness of the concept and of a particular product (wooden multi-story buildings) representing the forest-based bioeconomy. The results show consumer awareness of forest sequestration capacity but less awareness of the connection to the forest-based bioeconomy and the role of wooden multi-story buildings. The results indicate a slow transition that is hindered by path dependence and limited comprehension among consumers of the effects of their choices for a forest-based bioeconomy. This study provides valuable insights for future studies of how consumer awareness and social acceptance of the forest-based bioeconomy are interconnected. © 2021 by the authors.

"Exploring agro-ecological significance, knowledge gaps, and research priorities in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi","This systematic review examines the global agricultural relevance and practical environmental implications of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) within the phylum Glomeromycota. Following PRISMA guidelines, ensuring a comprehensive and unbiased literature review, a literature search was conducted, focusing on the functional roles of AMF in enhancing crop productivity, nutrient uptake, and soil health. Key findings reveal that AMF contribute significantly to sustainable agriculture by reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and increasing plant resilience to environmental stressors like drought, salinity, or pest resistance. The review highlights the importance of AMF in forming symbiotic relationships with plants, which enhance nutrient absorption and improve soil structure, showcasing long-term benefits such as reduced erosion or improved water retention. However, the current literature lacks in-depth exploration of the taxonomy and evolutionary aspects of AMF, as well as the specific functional roles they play in different agricultural contexts, e.g., understanding evolution could enhance strain selection for specific crops. This review identifies several urgent research gaps, including a need for a more refined understanding of AMF community dynamics under varying land management practices. For example, there are gaps in and a critical evaluation of advanced molecular techniques. Such techniques are essential for studying these interactions. Addressing these gaps will enhance the integration of AMF into sustainable agricultural systems and improve ecosystem management practices across different geographical regions. Future research should prioritize developing precise molecular imaging techniques and optimizing AMF applications for different crops and soil types to maximize their ecological and agricultural benefits. This could be practical through interdisciplinary collaboration (e.g., involving molecular biologists, agronomists, etc.). In conclusion, this review advances the practical application of AMF in agriculture and its contribution to biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems. Integrating these findings into policy frameworks could encourage sustainable farming practices, promote the adoption of AMF inoculants, and foster incentives for environmentally friendly land management strategies.

Reinvigorating the role of clean energy transition for achieving a low-carbon economy: evidence from Bangladesh,"Achieving carbon-neutrality has become a global agenda following the ratification of the Paris Agreement. For the developing countries, in particular, attaining a low-carbon economy is particularly important since these economies are predominantly fossil-fuel dependent, to which Bangladesh is no exception. Therefore, this study specifically aimed at evaluating the environmental impacts associated with energy consumption and other key macroeconomic variables in the context of Bangladesh over the 1975-2016 period. As opposed to the conventional practice of using carbon dioxide emissions to proxy environmental quality, this study makes a novel attempt to use the carbon footprints to measure environmental welfare in Bangldesh. The outcomes from this study are expected to facilitate the carbon-neutrality objective of Bangladesh and, therefore, enable the nation to comply with its commitments concerning the attainment of the targets enlisted under the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals declarations. The econometric analysis involved the application of methods that are suitable for handling the structural break issues in the data. The overall findings from empirical exercises reveal that aggregate energy consumption, fossil fuel consumption, and natural gas consumption boost the carbon footprint figures of Bangladesh. In contrast, nonfossil fuel consumption and hydroelectricity consumption are witnessed to abate the carbon footprint levels. Besides, economic growth and international trade are also evidenced to further increase the carbon footprints. Hence, these findings suggest that a clean energy transition within the Bangladesh economy can be the panacea to the nation's persitently aggravating environmental hardships. Furthermore, the causality analysis confirmed the presence of unidirectional causalities stemming from total energy consumption, fossil fuel consumption, natural gas consumption, hydroelectricity consumption, economic growth, and international trade to the carbon footprints. On the other hand, nonfossil fuel consumption is found to be bidirectionally associated with carbon footprints.

Elucidating Traditional Rice Varieties for Consilient Biotic and Abiotic Stress Management under Changing Climate with Landscape-Level Rice Biodiversity,"Rice is grown under diverse agro-climatic conditions and crop management regimes across the globe. Emerging climatic-vulnerabilities and the mismatched farm practices are becoming major challenges for poor or declining rice productivity in potential rice growing regions, especially South Asia. In the biodiversity-rich landscapes of South Asia, many traditional rice varieties (TRVs) are known to exhibit resilience to climate change and climate adaptation besides their therapeutic benefits. Hence, a random sample survey of farmers (n = 320), alongwith secondary data collection from non-governmental organizations/farmers' organizations/farmers, led to documentation of the information on TRVs' biodiversity in South Asia. The current study (2015-2019) explored and documented ~164 TRVs which may enhance the resilience to climatic-risks with improved yields besides their unique therapeutic benefits. A large number of TRVs have still not been registered by scientific organizations due to poor awareness by the farmers and community organizations. Hence, it is urgently needed to document, evaluate and harness the desired traits of these TRVs for ecological, economic, nutritional and health benefits. This study suggests taking greater cognizance of TRVs for their conservation, need-based crop improvement, and cultivation in the niche-areas owing to their importance in climate-resilient agriculture for overall sustainable rice farming in South Asia so as to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.</p>",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing multiple values of nature in National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans,"Around the world, people express a variety of values of nature based on how they relate and interact with it. These values of nature, broadly classified as instrumental, intrinsic, and relational values, underlie environmental policy and decision-making processes. In this paper, our aim was to assess the values of nature that are expressed in national environmental policy documents. We assessed the National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs), the key national policy framework for biodiversity conservation, from 11 countries, representing the five regional United Nations groups. We used qualitative content analysis to identify the value orientation of the statements in the NBSAPs and the main themes under each. Across the 11 NBSAPs, unspecified value orientation statements were the most common (40%), followed by instrumental (38%), intrinsic (14%) and relational (9%) value orientation statements. We identified the main themes in the instrumental value orientation statements as follows: (1) sustainability, (2) natural resources and (3) ecosystem services. The main themes present in the intrinsic value orientation statements were as follows: (1) recognizing intrinsic value, (2) endangered species and habitats, (3) conservation programmes and (4) threats to nature. Relational value orientation statements referenced as follows: (1) duty and responsibility to protect nature, (2) values expressed for nature, (3) national pride and heritage, (4) Indigenous peoples and local community's (IP&LCs) relationships with nature, (5) protecting nature for future generations and (6) equity in the use and access of nature. Our findings indicate that NBSAPs respond to the directive of the Convention on Biological Diversity. They are primarily based on the instrumental values of nature, only rarely considering other ways in which nature is valuable to people. This can reinforce unjust outcomes for human well-being since environmental policies may not reflect the diverse ways in which nature and biodiversity matter to the population. In an increasingly interconnected world, environmental policies are called on to incorporate multiple values to achieve positive outcomes for both human well-being and biodiversity conservation.

Capacity sharing to protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity,"Challenge 2 of the UN Ocean Decade focuses on protecting and restoring marine ecosystems and biodiversity as a fundamental requirement to achieve sustainable development. Addressing this challenge requires reliable and timely information on biodiversity and ecosystems. To achieve this, academic, government, and private groups should engage in a process of co-design that aims to facilitate decision-making at the local and national level, and agree on common and interoperable practices for the collection and curation of biology and ecosystem information. Implementing the flow of data to enable the management of human activities and sustainable development will require the sharing of capacity. An all-hands-on-deck effort will help us ensure a better future for ourselves. A positive step would be to identify the minimum essential ocean variables that can serve multiple relevant regional and international frameworks and to link and harmonize the required data and information flow (i.e., for frameworks including the Convention on Biological Diversity Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement, the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction Agreement, the International Seabed Authority, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, and deep and national ocean fisheries policies). A key strategy is to support and build on existing local and national networks for biodiversity observation. With this information, local communities and nations can better understand and manage how they use marine life and also report on progress toward Sustainable Development Goals.",Not About Sufficiency
A Comprehensive Insight on Ecosystem Services and Climate Resilience,"Ecosystem services play a vital role in improving climate resilience by providing essential functions that support the stability and adaptation of ecosystems in the face of changing climate. This interwoven relationship emphasizes the crucial importance of natural systems in improving resilience and maintaining human well-being in a shifting climate environment. Ecosystem services include many advantages, such as soil fertility maintenance, pollination, water purification, and natural hazard mitigation. These services are essential to climate resilience strategies as they enhance ecosystem health and performance. Ecosystem services improve ecosystems’ ability to tolerate environmental stressors, providing vital resources for human societies like food security, clean water, and protection from natural disasters. It is crucial to focus on conserving and sustainably managing ecosystem services to promote climate resilience, enhance adaptive capacity, and decrease vulnerability to climate-related issues. Acknowledging the inherent worth of ecosystem services and incorporating them into climate adaptation strategies can improve the resilience and sustainability of communities, making them more capable of dealing with the challenges of a changing climate. By embracing and protecting ecosystem services, more efficient climate resilience solutions can be developed to benefit ecosystems and human well-being in the long run. By responsibly preserving and managing ecosystem services, we can promote a more resilient and sustainable future for everyone. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Temporal dynamics of shoot and xylem growth in Chinese fir: Implications for carbon allocation,"Understanding the coupling relationship between shoot and xylem growth is critical for understanding tree growth strategies and further assessing the carbon sequestration potential of forest ecosystems. In this study, we monitored the intra-annual growth dynamics of the xylem and shoot of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.)) in subtropical China from 2022 to 2023. The results showed that the onset of bud and shoot growth was significantly later than that of the xylem formation in 2022 and 2023. Compared with 2022, the increased shoot growth in 2023 corresponded to a higher xylem production. Also, the end date of shoot growth was negatively correlated with the number of earlywood cells and xylem cells, indicating that earlier termination of shoot growth might promote xylem growth by increasing earlywood growth. These results provide a basis for predicting the growth of xylem and shoots of Chinese fir under future climate change and useful guidance for achieving ecological protection and sustainable development goals. © 2025",Not About Sufficiency

Climate change mitigation and productivity gains in livestock supply chains: insights from regional case studies,"Livestock can contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and by increasing soil carbon sequestration. Packages of mitigation techniques can bring large environmental benefits as illustrated in six case studies modeled in the Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model developed by FAO. With feasible technical interventions in livestock production systems, the mitigation potential of each of the selected species, systems and regions ranges from 14 to 41 %. While comparably high mitigation potentials were estimated for ruminant and pig production systems in Asia, Latin America and Africa, large emission reductions can also be attained in dairy systems with already high levels of productivity, in OECD countries. Mitigation interventions can lead to a concomitant reduction in emissions and increase in production, contributing to food security. This is particularly the case for improved feeding practices and better health and herd management practices. Livestock systems also have a significant potential for sequestrating carbon in pasturelands and rangelands through improved management, as illustrated in two of the six case studies in this paper.",Not About Sufficiency
Predicting future distribution patterns of Jatropha gossypiifolia L. in South Africa in response to climate change,"Invasive alien species such as Bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypiifolia L.) pose immense threats to global food security, biodiversity, ecosystem integrity and provision of ecosystem services. The Bellyache bush has generally been naturalised in Africa but poses vast management challenges in the African Savannah, yet there is little knowledge of its spatial distribution and future potential invasion risk. In this study, we modelled the spatial distribution of Bellyache bush in South Africa as a function of key biophysical factors using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and estimated its potential invasion risk into native environments because of climate change. Results show that temperature seasonality, mean annual temperature range and mean temperature of the coldest month are the key factors explaining Bellyache bush distribution in South Africa. The response of the occurrence of Bellyache bush to the temperature variables demonstrated that the suitable habitat for Bellyache bush ranged between 10° and 30 °C while the tolerance to precipitation range is very wide (400 mm – > 2500 mm/year−1). The total area suitable for Bellyache bush propagation in South Africa is ∼129 034 km2 (10% of the total land area of South Africa) in the current and will increase because of climate change to ∼510 914 km2 (40% of the total land area of South Africa). Our results suggest that we can estimate the spatial distribution and Bellyache bush invasion risk areas in South Africa. This implies that policies and management strategies for further Bellyache bush invasions in South Africa can now informatively be targeted to high priority areas. © 2021 SAAB",Not About Sufficiency

Grazing intensity for enhanced resource use efficiency in integrated crop-livestock systems: Balancing soil carbon storage and food security,"Preserving natural resources while addressing global food demand is a critical responsibility of the agricultural sector. In light of this, strategically integrating domestic herbivores into crop monocultures is seen as a promising opportunity to generate additional income and improve the efficiency of food production. Our study presents long-term results from experimentation on Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems (ICLS), revealing its productive and environmental benefits. We assessed carbon and nitrogen stocks and their temporal trend over 22 years, linking them to resource use efficiency and food provision in soybean systems with winter cover crops grazed at high, moderate, and low intensities, as well as ungrazed cover crops. Our results indicate an initial increase in carbon and nitrogen stocks across all treatments, stabilizing over time without significant differences among grazing intensities. High grazing intensity reduced the efficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and water use, as well as soybean and pasture production. In contrast, energy production increased by 32% under moderate and low grazing intensities, and protein production by 24% under moderate grazing intensity, without compromising soil carbon and nitrogen stocks. The ICLS proved to be a key strategy for increasing food production while preserving soil carbon stock, with correct pasture management being paramount for gathering these outcomes.",Not About Sufficiency
Retention forestry as a major paradigm for safeguarding forest biodiversity in productive landscapes: A global meta-analysis,"Currently, there is an increasing need for sustainable forest management to meet multiple beneficial social and ecological goals. This has spurred the emergence of retention forestry, which aims to maintain key elements of the stand during harvesting to ameliorate the post-logging structure over forest generations. Despite the global expansion of this approach as a conservation tool in production forests, quantitative evaluations of its effectiveness are still lacking, particularly for comparisons across different biomes, different levels of economic development, and different taxa. We conducted a meta-analysis to identify the general responses of forest species to the set-aside actions (i.e., retaining the important biotic and abiotic features during logging to conserve biodiversity). We found that retention forestry can preserve a degree of species richness equivalent to that of primary forests, at least at the stand level. This potential does not differ among regions or economic development levels, supporting the ecological meaning of retaining ""biological legacies"" over forest generations irrespective of forest biomes. Despite their common focus on biodiversity conservation, retention forestry is different from the reduced-impact forestry that is implemented with selective logging. The reason for this difference is that the former and the latter approach focus on what is retained and what is logged during harvesting operations, respectively. Thus, our meta-analysis also focused on comparisons between these two logging methods based on different viewpoints, i.e., from the species perspective vs. the perspective of human needs. We found that although selective logging was not detrimental to forest taxa, retention forestry was more effective in conserving biodiversity. We thus argue that the principles underpinned by retention approach, such as the consideration of natural disturbance regimes, and the provision of important habitats for species, will be essential overall for biodiversity-oriented forestry. Retention forestry will continue to play a fundamental role in encouraging further development of management schemes that have multiple goals. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Mitigating agricultural greenhouse gas emissions: A review of scientific information for food system planning,"Agriculture contributes significantly to anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), with estimates of agriculture's contribution ranging from 10% to 25% of total global GHG emissions per year. The science regarding mitigating (reducing and removing) GHGs through agriculture is conflicting and inconclusive. However, the severity and urgency of climate change and its potential effects on food security demonstrate that we must include mitigation within food system planning frameworks. In British Columbia, Canada, the provincial government has established significant GHG reduction targets for its agencies, and has called on local governments to reduce their carbon footprints through a charter and incentive, as well as through growth management legislation. At the same time, local governments, are giving increased attention to development of local/regional agri-food systems. However, GHG mitigation efforts do not yet seem to factor into local agri-food system discussions. Although frameworks for reporting agriculture GHGs exist, local government measurement of agriculture mitigation is hampered by a lack of agriculture GHG inventories, limited data availability, and the inherent variability in agriculture emissions and removals due to the dynamic nature of farm ecosystems. With the goal of informing local governments and food system planners on the importance of agriculture GHG mitigation, this paper (1) reviews the science of GHGs, (2) describes sources of agriculture GHG emissions and illustrates potential mitigation practices, (3) discusses the variability of agriculture mitigation science, (4) highlights the importance of agriculture GHG inventories, and (5) emphasizes the necessity for local agriculture mitigation strategies.",Not About Sufficiency
"TREE STRUCTURE, SPECIES COMPOSITION, AND CARBON STORAGE IN TROPICAL SILVOPASTORAL SYSTEMS †","Background: Silvopastoral systems, agroforestry with grazing livestock, have a high capacity for carbon sequestration in tree biomass and enhance biological diversity in grasslands, contributing to counteract the negative effects of deforestation led by the expansion of open pasturelands. Objective: To assess tree structure, species diversity, and carbon storage in biomass components in three different silvopastoral systems (SPS): 1) scattered trees in pasture (STP), 2) live fences (LF), 3) forest plantations (FP), and compare them with pasture monoculture (PM). Methodology: Carbon stock in biomass, relative importance value of tree species, Shannon´s biodiversity, Pileou´s evenness, and Sorenson´s similarity indices were calculated in forty sampling plots, ten for each system in Tabasco, Mexico. Results: Biomass stock varied significantly (P<0.05) between SPS and PM. FP had the highest carbon stock in the biomass pool with an average of 73.5 MgCha-1, followed by STP (45.8), LF (20.8), and PM (9.1). STP system tended to be more diverse with a relatively even distribution of tree species, while tree density per hectare was greater in FP. Species composition and their relative value indices varied between SPS but there was a medium level of similarity between them. Furthermore, we determined an optimum basal area of 14.5 m2ha-1 to harmonize the trade-offs between carbon sequestration in woody biomass and forage production in grass (herbaceous) biomass in these SPS. Implications: These results are useful to farmers and policymakers in developing and incentivizing climate-smart livestock production systems in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Conclusion: SPS are biodiverse and accumulate more carbon in biomass than pasture monoculture. The STP was the most biodiverse, followed by LF and FP, while carbon storage was higher in FP followed by STP and LF. An optimal tree cover with 14.5 m2ha-1 basal area can balance the trade-off between carbon sequestration and forage productivity in SPS. Copyright © the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable heating alternatives for 1960's and 1970's renovated apartment buildings,"The Finnish Government target of carbon neutrality by 2035 is challenging for the district heat (DH) systems of Finnish cities, as nearly 50% of the DH fuels are still fossil or peat. The DH price in Finnish cities is rising intensively. To avoid energy poverty, it is imperative to develop low-carbon DH solutions affordable for all customers. The feasibility of various low-carbon scenarios supplying a DH network is investigated with three different energy renovation levels. Biomass combustion technologies (combined heat and power (CHP) and heat only boiler (HOB)) and waste heat recovery technologies (Heat Pump and Electric Boiler) are analyzed. The economic and sensitivity analyses of the DH network are carried out from utility and end-user viewpoints. The operation cost and break-even price of heat are calculated in different renovation levels. Biomass HOB has the lowest operation cost at all renovation levels followed by waste heat-heat pump. Waste heat-heat pump + electric boiler has the lowest total cost, 53–58 €/MWh, at all renovation levels. Waste heat recovery scenarios were found sensitive to changes in electricity price. Waste heat-heat pump has the lowest overall emissions, whereas biomass combustion causes high emissions of biogenic CO2, NOx and particulate matter. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Finding food in the hunger season: A mixed methods approach to understanding wild plant foods in relation to food security and dietary diversity in southeastern Madagascar,"In many rural farming societies, wild plant foods (WPFs) continue to play an important role in everyday diets as well as in coping with hunger during food shortages. However, WPF collection and consumption may pose challenges to biodiversity conservation efforts (e.g., in protected areas), and some “famine foods,” foods not typically eaten under normal conditions, may have deleterious health impacts. Using data from a cross-sectional survey of 328 smallholder farmers and fisherfolk living in 15 villages surrounding Manombo Special Reserve on the southeastern coast of Madagascar, we examine the relationship between food security, dietary diversity, and consumption of WPFs, specifically giant aquatic arrowhead or via (Typhonodorum lindleyanum) and Polynesian arrowroot or tavolo (Tacca leontopetaloides), during the region's main lean season. We complement survey findings with focus group interviews to document traditional ecological knowledge and perceptions of these WPFs, including how tavolo and via are rendered edible, as well as human health effects from collecting, preparing, and eating them. Using multilevel logistic regression modeling, we found that consumption of these WPFs were significantly associated with inadequate nutrition among farmers. Wealthier households were less likely to consume these WPFs as a coping strategy during food insecure periods, while larger and more food insecure households were more likely to consume them. These findings reaffirm the importance of access to natural areas and support the design of protected area conservation strategies that honor local foodways and consider WPFs that serve as food safety nets for more vulnerable populations.

"Understanding public support for carbon capture and storage policy: The roles of social capital, stakeholder perceptions, and perceived risk/benefit of technology","As climate change mitigation technologies emerge, there is an increased need to understand public support for the technology and the policies that will shape or thwart its evolution. Of particular importance are the communities most directly impacted. The current study focuses on a random sample of 970 adults in eight counties within the oil and gas industry-reliant region of southeast Texas in order to explore support for carbon capture and storage (CCS), which is a climate change mitigation technology that has seen a great deal of investment in that area. Results of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis and general linear modeling (GLM) suggest that policy support –individual support and perceived community support – is dependent on perceived risks and benefits of CCS, community-focused perceptions (including Bourdieu's social capital), and perceptions about stakeholders (trustworthiness and expected role in CCS policy making). One key takeaway is that social capital was both a predictor and moderator in community-level CCS support and helped explain the hidden effects of risk perception of CCS and CCS knowledge on community-level CCS support.

Micro-stories and the lived experience of transport poverty: Lessons from Iceland for just mobility transitions,"Iceland features a high share of renewable energy supply but remains largely dependent on fossil fuels for transport and is relatively car dependent for mobility. In the context of a public transport system perceived by users and non-users as inadequate, we document individuals' corresponding micro-stories and show how these constrain their 'functionings' within a mobility capabilities perspective. We then show how this relates to a set of mobility justice principles, informing inferences for a more just and inclusive transition to decarbonised mobility. While acknowledging that the country has a pattern of urbanisation and challenging terrain that help to explain the limitations of its public transport system, we nonetheless argue that additional investment and policy measures will be required to address transport poverty. For data, we draw on analysis of Icelandic bus routes, focus groups with representative public, and interviews with vulnerable individuals. We find that transport decarbonisation policy needs to account for existing material poverty and be far more equitable if a just transition to low-carbon mobility is achieved. We also reveal how mobility justice issues interact with other dimensions of justice such as distributive, procedural, cosmopolitan, restorative, and recognition.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil security and global food security,"Over the course of the postglacial period has managed to add degrade a substantial portion of the world's potential agricultural land. The soil loss and degradation that has repeatedly impacted regional societies around the world resulted from agricultural practices that increased the physical loss of soil (erosion), reduced soil organic matter, changed pH (acidification) or salinity, and disrupted or altered communities of soil life. In the coming century, as continued soil degradation threatens global food security while the global population keeps rising it is imperative that farmers develop and adopt soil health building (regenerative) practices to solve a problem that has plagued societies throughout history. Growing evidence suggests that agricultural systems that combine cover crops, reduced tillage, and diverse crop rotations can reduce erosion, enhance soil health and rebuild soil organic matter to cultivate beneficial soil life and harvest both economic and environmental benefits. In the coming post-oil world, global food security would benefit from a global effort to promote soil restoration to help addresses the challenge of sustainably feeding the world, increase soil-based carbon sequestration, protect on-farm biodiversity and reduce off-farm water pollution. Because soil security sets a solid foundation for global food security, agricultural policies and subsidies should be reformed to encourage farmers to adopt regenerative, soil-building practices.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability across the Medical Device Lifecycle: A Scoping Review,"Medical devices are instrumental in servicing the healthcare sector and promoting well-being in modern societies. However, their production and use contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, thus causing indirect harm to global health. With a share of approximately 4.4% of global emissions, the healthcare sector exhales CO2 throughout its value chain; sources of this range from direct electricity consumption and water heating in healthcare facilities to the supply chains delivering healthcare services and products. Within this context, the environmental impact of medical devices is present across their production, distribution, usage, and eventual disposal. Each step in the lifecycle of medical devices consumes energy and natural resources, and the end product, after its often single use, is discarded, generating plastic or electronic waste. This study aims to present the key findings from a scoping review of academic research on the topic, which focuses on reducing the environmental impact of medical devices and equipment. The review, conducted according to the PRISMA checklist for scoping reviews, examined 41 studies and categorised them based on the lifecycle stages of medical devices (design and development, manufacturing, usage, and end of life) and the sustainability aspects (economic, environmental, and social) discussed by the authors. The findings suggest that while efforts have been made to enhance economic and environmental sustainability throughout the design, development, and usage of medical devices, there is still room for improvement in mitigating their ecological impact at the end of their lifecycle and maximising their social impact by design. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Spanish Protected Areas: the Case of Picos de Europa National Park,"Protected areas are complex social-ecological systems; thus, they were unavoidably impacted by COVID-19. Spain is one of the most diverse countries in terms of biodiversity in the European Union and the second most visited country in 2019 and third touristic destination worldwide. Understanding the effects of the pandemic in Spanish protected areas is very important to discuss new possibilities on how to drive sustainable development on these conserved spaces and how to manage them in the event of external shocks and uncertain scenarios. Therefore, the aim of this study is to have a better understanding of the effects and opportunities of the pandemic on Spanish protected areas. To address this concern, a qualitative analysis is conducted based on an assessment of secondary literature and relevant interviews. Picos de Europa national park was chosen as case study because of its unique features. This study shows the drawbacks of the pandemic in Picos de Europa in terms of management operations, drastic fluctuation of visitors, loss of tourism revenues, vulnerability of neighboring communities, missed opportunities in conservation and education and pressure on nature. On the other hand, it poses opportunities in terms of technology, innovation, fundings, lessons learned, rise in educational and conservation activities and more awareness on the environment and rural surroundings. This study suggests that is difficult to find a win-win solution that includes the targets of nature conservation, viability of local economies and tourism activities in Picos de Europa.

Global projections of future cropland expansion to 2050 and direct impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage,"Cropland expansion threatens biodiversity by driving habitat loss and impacts carbon storage through loss of biomass and soil carbon (C). There is a growing concern land-use change (LUC) to cropland will result in a loss of ecosystem function and various ecosystem services essential for human health and well-being. This paper examines projections of future cropland expansion from an integrated assessment model IMAGE 3.0 under a ""business as usual"" scenario and the direct impact on both biodiversity and C storage. By focusing on biodiversity hotspots and Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites, loss of habitat as well as potential impacts on endangered and critically endangered species are explored. With regards to C storage, the impact on both soil and vegetation standing C stocks are examined. We show that if projected trends are realized, there are likely to be severe consequences for these resources. Substantial loss of habitat in biodiversity hotspots such as Indo-Burma, and the Philippians is expected as well as 50% of species in AZE sites losing part of their last remaining habitat. An estimated 13.7% of vegetation standing C stocks and 4.6% of soil C stocks are also projected to be lost in areas affected with Brazil and Mexico being identified as priorities in terms of both biodiversity and C losses from cropland expansion. Changes in policy to regulate projected cropland expansion, and increased measures to protect natural resources, are highly likely to be required to prevent these biodiversity and C losses in the future.",Not About Sufficiency
Empirical assessments of small-scale ecosystem service flows in rural mosaic landscapes in the Ethiopian highlands,"Human activities have rapidly altered natural ecosystems worldwide, resulting in fragmented ecosystems that are either culturally or formally protected. These ecosystem patches can be critical for ecosystem services (ES) that support human well-being. In the Ethiopian highlands, the remaining church forests and wetlands have a unique conservation status and are part of the global priority areas for biodiversity conservation. ES flows from these ecosystems to surrounding benefiting areas lack local-scale field evidence data and are not well-understood. Here, we empirically quantify the distance-dependent flows for four ES: grass biomass, microclimate regulation, crop pollination, and soil erosion retention since they exhibit considerable variation in spatial scales and processes of ES flows. The effect of spatial distance on each ES benefit flow was analysed using spatially explicit empirical models. The key findings are as follows: (1) The benefit of ES varies significantly with distance to the source ecosystems. (2) ES supply is determined by the extent (fragmentation) and condition of ecosystems, together with ecosystem type. (3) The quantity and number of ES provided decreases with distance from the source, and beneficiaries up to 3 km of the source only receive one type of ES (grass biomass). Approximately 80 % of the benefiting areas are within a radius of 200 m from forests and wetlands. Bundles of multiple ES types are received at the frontiers of service-providing ecosystems, where number of benefits are compared at particular locations from the source point. The investigated ecosystems (440 km2) provided benefits to 8,770 km2 for the four types of ES. Our findings imply that non-linear effects of key ecosystem variables need to be considered when mapping the distance-dependent ES flows. This study helps to understand the spatial connectivity between ecosystems and beneficiaries in the human-nature interdependency, which is useful for developing different strategies for ES conservation. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"Carbon for soils, not soils for carbon","The role of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration as a 'win-win' solution to both climate change and food insecurity receives an increasing promotion. The opportunity may be too good to be missed! Yet the tremendous complexity of the two issues at stake calls for a detailed and nuanced examination of any potential solution, no matter how appealing. Here, we critically re-examine the benefits of global SOC sequestration strategies on both climate change mitigation and food production. While estimated contributions of SOC sequestration to climate change vary, almost none take SOC saturation into account. Here, we show that including saturation in estimations decreases any potential contribution of SOC sequestration to climate change mitigation by 53%-81% towards 2100. In addition, reviewing more than 21 meta-analyses, we found that observed yield effects of increasing SOC are inconsistent, ranging from negative to neutral to positive. We find that the promise of a win-win outcome is confirmed only when specific land management practices are applied under specific conditions. Therefore, we argue that the existing knowledge base does not justify the current trend to set global agendas focusing first and foremost on SOC sequestration. Away from climate-smart soils, we need a shift towards soil-smart agriculture, adaptative and adapted to each local context, and where multiple soil functions are quantified concurrently. Only such comprehensive assessments will allow synergies for land sustainability to be maximised and agronomic requirements for food security to be fulfilled. This implies moving away from global targets for SOC in agricultural soils. SOC sequestration may occur along this pathway and contribute to climate change mitigation and should be regarded as a co-benefit.",Not About Sufficiency
Potential Application of Carbon-based Electrical Sensor for the Highly Sensitive Diltiazem HCl Quantification in its Pharmaceutical Products and Biological Samples,"Diltiazem (DTZ) hydrochloride, a calcium channel blocker compound, is a very well-known drug used by many clinicians to treat important diseases playing a role in increased morbidity and mortality among adults worldwide, namely hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, and ischemic heart disease (angina pectoris). These diseases are a common public health concern, implying that the construction of a specific, accurate, and simple sensor for DTZ determination is needed. Herein, an innovative, portable, and sensitive modified carbon paste electrode (MCPE) was seamlessly developed based on the affordable green compound N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as a sensing material and tricresyl phosphate as a solvent mediator for the voltammetric determination of DTZ. The proposed NBS-MCPE exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of DTZ molecules in a phosphate buffer solution of pH 5.0 in presence of 20 μM sodium dodecyl sulfate to improve the developed sensor performance. The sensor was found to respond linearly to the DTZ drug over a wide concentration ranging from 1 μM to 300 μM with a low limit of detection. LSV and EIS measurements were also used to scrutinize our sensor, in addition to using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis techniques for its surface morphology inspection before and after soaking in the drug-containing solution. The applicability of the proposed sensor for the rapid, sensitive, and selective determination of DTZ in pharmaceutical preparation and human urine samples was assessed and the obtained results were compared with that of the reported HPLC analytical method. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",Not About Sufficiency
Temperature changes in the Maloti-Drakensberg region: An analysis of trends for the 1960-2016 period,"Nature has been adversely affected by increasing industrialization, especially during the latter part of the last century, as a result of accelerating technological development, unplanned urbanization, incorrect agricultural policies and deforestation, which have contributed to the elevated concentration of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the environment. GHG accumulation has an adverse impact on meteorological and hydro-meteorological parameters, particularly temperature. Temperature plays a prominent and well-known role in evaporation, transpiration and changes in water demand, and thus significantly affects both water availability and food security. Therefore, a systematic understanding of temperature is important for fighting food insecurity and household poverty. Variations in temperature are often assessed and characterized through trend analysis. Hence, the objective of this paper is to determine long-term trends in mean monthly maximum and minimum air temperatures for the Maloti-Drakensberg region. The Mann-Kendall test, a non-parametric test, was applied on mean air temperature for the 1960-2016 period. A significant rising trend (p < 0.001) was detected with a yearly change in the long term annual mean maximum and mean minimum temperature by 0.03 °C/annum and 0.01 °C/annum, respectively. This knowledge has important implications for both the state of the environment and livelihoods in the region, since its use can be useful in planning and policymaking in water resource management, biodiversity conservation, agriculture, tourism and other sectors of the economy within the region. © 2019 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
South Africa’s transition to sustainability: An overview,"Globally, the concept of a green economy is relatively young in public policy research. There are several, often competing, concepts such as green growth, circular economy, low carbon development and recently sustainable economies, which have been put forward as alternative development paradigms amid growing discontent with the failures of existing economic systems to respond to social and environmental challenges. Rooted in the multiple global crises - climate change and the social and environmental challenges of rising unemployment and resource scarcity, these alternative development paradigms seek, in essence, to mainstream environmental sustainability in economic policies. They commit, to varying degrees, to social justice and inclusivity. This is evident in the vision espoused by the South African Government, which has committed itself towards a just transition to a resource-efficient, climate-resilient and pro-employment development path. Pro-poor and socially inclusive policies, which respond to the developmental challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment, are central in crafting an inclusive green economy transition in South Africa. This introductory chapter will provide an overview of South Africa’s sustainability transition and illustrate how this pathway has to be inextricably tied to socio-economic redress. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Najma Mohamed.",Not About Sufficiency
Six critical questions for teaching justice-based environmental sustainability (JBES) in higher education,"In this short article, we pose six key questions that we argue as essential to critically problem-pose in achieving teaching for justice-based environmental sustainability (JBES) in higher education (HE). We will be critically posing these questions to all the authors of an upcoming Teaching in Higher Education special issue ‘Higher Education Teaching of Environmentally Just Sustainability’ so they can further unpack these questions, coincide or counter our arguments presented here, provide rich contextualization in their responses, and possibly expand upon these six. The questions problematize the following in HE teaching: (1) the (de)legitimized, (de)prioritized framings of ‘sustainability;’ (2) the same question for the terms of ‘development’ and ‘sustainable development’; (3) the politics of (un)sustainability affecting HE pedagogies and curricula; (4) HE’s roles and responsibilities in leading to students’ praxis of sustainability; (5) the incorporation, or not, of Southern, Indigenous, and/or Northern epistemologies grounding (un)sustainability taught; and (6) the (non-)anthropocentric groundings in HE learning. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Lack of ecological data hinders management of ecologically important saltmarsh ecosystems: A case study of saltmarsh plant Porterasia coarctata (Roxb.),"Saltmarsh ecosystems though ecologically important are one of the least studied ecosystems in Asia. This study reviewed the published literature from 1988 to 2021 of India to assess the current status of the data deficient saltmarsh species Porterasia coarctata (Roxb.) within its distribution limits. This saltmarsh species inhabits the lower intertidal silty-sandy habitats of India's west coast and silty-clay habitats of the east coast. In the lower intertidal zone, P. coarctata is mostly associated with Myrostachia wightiana, whereas in the upper intertidal zone the highest chance of presence was for Suaeda maritima (18%) and the lowest for Cressa cretica (1%), S. fruticosa (1%) and Scirpus littoralis (1%). The deep root system of P. coarctata helps in sediment accretion and facilitates the formation of mangrove ecosystems. From this study it was evident that most of the research on P. coarctata in India was part of survey of mangrove ecosystems. In India, significant knowledge gap exists on the reproductive ecology and population trends of this species. Most importantly, the genes responsible for salinity and submergence tolerance of P. coarctata are well documented, that can provide solutions for salt and submergence tolerant rice plants in coastal areas prone to sea level rise. The blue carbon storage potential of P. coarctata is higher than other saltmarsh plants, that can be leveraged as a nature-based solution for CO2 emission reductions. The ecosystem services of P. coarctata can also contribute towards achieving various sustainable development goals (SDG-1,2,6,13 and14). Coastal development, mangrove restoration and marine food provisioning are the most important drivers causing the decline of P. coarctata ecosystems across India. This study proposes a long-term coastal monitoring plan for essential conservation and management of existing P. coarctata beds and preventing further degradation and loss of these ecosystems. This study also showcases species-specific valuation of individual saltmarsh plants at regional scale are essential to catalogue the most efficient saltmarsh plants that can play an important role in future climate change scenarios and serve as a global model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Use of Wild Edible Plants: Can They Meet the Dietary and Nutritional Needs of Indigenous Communities in Central India,"Despite significant evidence base on quantifying ecosystem services, the role of biodiversity in supporting such services in diversified landscapes, and how indigenous communities exploit, utilize and manage plant resources in a biocultural regime, remains understudied. This study examines the role of wild edible plants (WEPs) in meeting the food, nutrition and household income of indigenous communities under the biodiversity rich landscape of the Achanakmaar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR-22 degrees 15 ' to 22 degrees 58 ' N latitudes and 81 degrees 25 ' to 82 degrees 5 ' East longitudes) of Central India. Results revealed remarkable differences among Baiga, Gond, Kol, and Oraon ethnic communities and also location (core, buffer and transition) effect on utilization pattern of wild edibles. A sum total of 172 WEPs comprising 60 vegetables, 70 fruits, seeds and nuts, 23 underground tubers and 19 mushrooms were collected, consumed, and surplus were marketed by the communities. On average, the number of wild edibles collected annually by households were in the following quantities: 40-240 kg leafy vegetables, 125-386 kg flowers, 120-250 kg fruits, 12-125 kg legumes, 24-120 kg tubers, 5-35 kg mushrooms. Among ethnic groups, the Baiga primitive community utilized 70-90% followed by Gonds (58-81%), Kols (52-78%), Oraons (43-79%), and other communities (38-68%) in different zones. WEPs have contributed to 5-24% (Rs 3559- 12,710) of household income, which was highest in the core zone and lowest in the transition zone. It was observed that WEPs were complemented the diets rather than being a substitute for staple foods. They supplied only 3.7-8.3% of energy and 1.1-4.9% protein requirements; however, they significantly supplemented ascorbic acid, thiamine, calcium, and iron by 38.1-73%, 13.7-35.4%, 17.2-29.1%, 2.6-13.5%, respectively. Significantly higher quantities of nutrients were supplemented in the core zone compared to other zones. WEPs were currently underutilized (less intake) especially in buffer and transition zones, complementing the staple foods and partially supplementing the essential macro- and micro-nutrients. However, these have the potential to fulfill the dietary needs and ensure balanced nutrition, if consumed in recommended portions and sizes. The paper discusses policy implications that ensure coherence and coordination of local indigenous communities for conservation and sustainable utilization of WEPs of AABR, Central India.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatial analysis on relationship between wildlife-human conflicts in senai-desaru expressway (SDE) in 2009-2015,"Malaysia has one of the richest biodiversity and extensive road networks throughout the country. One of the consequences emerges from this condition is wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC), representing a remarkable non-natural death in wildlife species. Hence, the knowledge and deliberation of gap analysis on Human-Wildlife Conflict (HWC) is indispensable to convalesce and recuperate the safe co-existence between animal populations and human needs including transportation of people or goods along the expressway. This study is to (a) evaluate the landuse patterns on the distribution of HWC, (b) assess whether HWCs are clustered forming mortality hotspots along 70km of Senai-Desaru Expressway (SDE). Annual recorded data of HWC s from 2009-2015 was collected, involving mammal at various size while Landsat satellite images used to detect land-use changes at both sides of SDE. Several environmental variables including human-wildlife conflict trend, signifying suitability of wildlife habitat and landscape connectivity, while accounting for spatial effects. More than 30 trapping camera were set-up at both sides of SDE to identify hotspots of HWC and to support the result such as species of animal killed, land-use type, sloppiness of terrain relief and logistic facilities which could stimulate the WVCs. Based on the result, WVC and landuse type demonstrated a strong relationship for all existing species that could explained the annual trend. Tree cover, distance to riparian areas, terrain ruggedness and poor unmaintained fencing system along SDE were important stimulator of WVCs. Seven main hotspots of mortality was detected along SDE in 2015, yet only one road section (20th -30th km) was classified as hotspot for more than 35 number of WVC. From 2009, the number of WVCs at some sections are decreased indicates the adaptability of wildlife to new invented habitats and effectiveness of mitigating action but fluctuating trend is shown in remaining section. To conclude, WVC mainly occur in road sections with more abundant and diverse wildlife communities. Mortality hotspots definitely provide significant information for mitigation in selected prioritized road sections. The results support focusing on hotspots, habitat quality and landscape connectivity for a better assessment of road mortality. At the local scale, road passages with regular maintenance of exclusionary fencing and appropriate mesh size in riparian areas may provide safe crossings for many species and constitute a promising mitigation measure. © 2017 ACRS.

Traditional farming in the mountainous region of Bangladesh and its modifications,"Shifting cultivation is a traditional farming system practiced in the tropical mountainous areas. Although it has been widely perceived as an economically inefficient and environmentally harmful agricultural production system, recent science reviews, however, indicate that the deleterious impacts of shifting cultivation on environment may have been overestimated. Despite the pressures of agricultural intensification in areas where shifting cultivation occurs, farmers across the tropics still maintain this traditional farming system. The objective of this study was to explore existing traditional shifting cultivation practices and their various modifications including the innovative farming techniques developed by farmers in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs), the mountainous region of Bangladesh, and examine their importance with respect to recent socio-economic and environmental changes. The study revealed that shifting cultivation still exists as the most dominant farming method which supports livelihoods and culture of the hill ethnic people. However, demand for more food and household income to meet livelihood needs of an increasing population combined with a rapid deterioration of soil and water quality over decades contributed to development of innovative farming practices through fallow land farming, crop substitution, agroforestry and homestead gardening in the CHTs. Through these farming techniques farmers maintain a strong relationship with traditional knowledge system embedded in the age-old shifting cultivation practices. Today state policies and market forces act in favor of replacement of traditional farming with intensive cash crop agriculture. It seems that disappearance of traditional farming practices from the hills may threaten local biodiversity and food security. It may be recommended that shifting cultivation should be encouraged in areas where they have potential for contributing to preservation of native biodiversity and ecosystem services, and protection of local peoples’ food security and cultural identity. © 2016, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Not About Sufficiency

What's the Buzz About? Progress and Potential of Acoustic Monitoring Technologies for Investigating Bumble Bees,"Pollination is a vital ecosystem service for both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Most flowering plants-including many staples in the human diet such as fruits, vegetables and nuts- require animals for pollination. The majority is done by over 20,000 species of bees, some of which are managed commercially to provide these services. The global industry of pollination is valued at US $153 billion annually and is increasing in demand to meet the needs of a growing human population [1]. However, both managed and wild bees, especially the ecologically and economically important bumble bees (Bombus spp.), are suffering alarming declines worldwide, presenting serious implications for food security and biodiversity.

IFC performance standards,"The International Finance Corporation (IFC) Safeguard Policies have been the basis for IFC's leadership and approach to environmental and social sustainability. Based largely on the World Bank's operational policies, IFC adopted its current set of Safeguard Policies in 1998 in order to manage environmental and social issues in the private sector business environment in emerging markets. IFC embarked on an ambitious two-year process in FY04 to update all of the Safeguard Policies through a single initiative to develop the next generation of a policy framework based on a clear, concise and comprehensive policy on social and environmental sustainability. Following an intensive review and analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in coverage of the current Safeguard Policies, IFC has recast the Safeguards as a Policy and Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability. The Performance Standards are often considered the defacto standards even in the absence of IFC participation in the project. They could potentially apply to all projects in developing countries. The Performance Standards contain clear and concise requirements geared toward project outcomes and promote performance improvement through monitoring, reporting and feedback. They place new emphasis on implementation through management systems, deal with social and environmental issues in a more integrated manner, and strengthen policy coverage of issues such as pollution, climate change, and biodiversity. In addition, the Performance Standards address a number of additional subjects of direct concern to the private sector such as labor and working conditions and community health and safety. IFC's social and environmental standards are the building blocks for our approach to sustainability and are embodied in IFC's Safeguard policies, Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines, and Disclosure Policy. Together these provide a framework to help our clients manage project risks and improve their performance, and help IFC improve development outcomes and maximize the development impact of our investments.

Unravelling plant-pollinator interactions through pollen DNA analysis,"Pollination, an essential ecosystem service that supports food security and maintenance of biodiversity, is highly threatened by global change. Understanding and monitoring of the plant-pollinator networks that underpin this service is crucial to preserving ecosystem function. However, traditional methods used to identify the interactions between plants and insect pollinators tend to be very laborious and time-consuming. Genomic techniques to infer species interactions have created new opportunities for researchers and land managers to study plant-pollinator networks in a cost-effective manner. DNA metabarcoding of pollen is a novel genomic approach that has been successfully used to quantify plant-pollinator interactions and the movement of pollen across space and time. In this chapter, we explain the benefits and limitations of pollen DNA metabarcoding and its usefulness for managers and practitioners to address questions regarding conservation of plant-pollinator communities and ecosystem management. Furthermore, we explore the potential of this approach for future applications in environmental monitoring, biosecurity and investigating the effects of climate change on plant-pollinator communities.",Not About Sufficiency
Looking at past domestication to secure ecosystem services of future croplands,"1. Food security faces challenges that must be addressed from multiple perspectives. Ecology and agronomy contribute to that endeavour, allowing improvement in management practices. However, not only management affects food provision but also crop traits modulate key ecosystem services (ESs), including sustained yields. 2. Here we highlight that understanding how crop traits evolved under domestication, affecting ESs delivery, should help to breed future crops. We address the effects of crop evolution (from initial domestication to current times) on crop traits and key ESs: crop yield and its stability over time, soil carbon sequestration, soil nitrogen retention and water provision. 3. Synthesis. There is evidence that crop domestication affects the delivery of ESs. However, most of these evolutionary effects are understudied. Accordingly, we identify research gaps and necessary actions, including (i) assessing whether performance in polyculture is lower for modern crop mixtures than for mixtures of wild progenitors, and breeding for more efficient crop polycultures; and (ii) investigating how crop evolution impacted on plant effects on soil carbon sequestration and nitrogen retention, and how such effects contribute to yield stability. The provision of cropland ESs, and thus food security, will benefit from exploring those avenues from an ecological perspective.",Not About Sufficiency
Biofuels and ecoagriculture: can bioenergy production enhance landscape-scale ecosystem conservation and rural livelihoods?,"Global development of the biofuel sector is proceeding rapidly, driven by national policy mandates, government subsidies, and profit opportunities for farmers, agribusiness and energy companies. To date, most investment in - and dialogue on - biofuels has focused on large-scale production of liquid transport fuels. A smaller set of efforts has explored the potential of biofuels to promote rural development by reducing energy poverty among the world's two billion poorest people. Here, we consider the potential of these diverse approaches to promote the goals of ecoagriculture: namely, sustainable agricultural production (including biofuel feedstocks), conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services and viable rural livelihoods. Using a landscape planning framework, we review empirical evidence and identify criteria for designing biofuel production systems that promote this trio of goals. Biofuel development has the greatest potential when biomass production is an 'interstitial' activity and when processing and use occurs at the local level. Larger scale production for regional or global liquid fuel markets may be beneficial under some circumstances, but a stronger policy framework is needed to guide this approach. To advance biofuels for sustainable development, while avoiding serious risks, investment must shift to include a variety of ecoagriculture-compatible pathways. Supportive public policies and market incentives must be developed before the biofuel sector develops strong path-dependence toward unsustainable outcomes.",Not About Sufficiency
CLIMATE CHANGE AND SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE LIGHT OF THE SOCIAL TEACHING OF THE CHURCH THE CONTRIBUTION OF POPE FRANCIS TO INTEGRAL ECOLOGY AND GLOBAL SOLIDARITY,"The 21st century is marked by a convergence of complex social and ecological crises, including fundamentalism, democratic instability, social injustice, climate change, water scarcity, biodiversity loss, and soil degradation. This paper explores the Catholic Church’s response to these pressing challenges, with a particular focus on Pope Francis’s contribution through his teachings on integral ecology. Drawing on the social doctrine of the Church, principles such as solidarity, the common good, and ecological responsibility are examined in the context of global crises. In his encyclicals Laudato si’ and Laudate Deum, Pope Francis emphasizes the need for a holistic ecological and societal transformation that integrates justice for the poor and environmental sustainability. His call for a »cultural revolution« challenges dominant paradigms of consumption and economic exploitation, urging for systemic changes in politics, economics, and human behaviour. Furthermore, the paper highlights the role of the Church as a global actor, capable of fostering cross-border solidarity, advocating for the marginalized, and promoting sustainable development. The analysis also considers Pope Francis’s vision of global fraternity, as articulated in Fratelli tutti, which interconnects human dignity, justice, and environmental ethics. The Church’s socio-ecological mission addresses not only immediate challenges but also seeks to inspire long-term structural and spiritual transformations. This includes leveraging the Church’s rich traditions of social justice and ascetic practices to model sustainable lifestyles. Ultimately, the Church’s engagement aims to align human progress with the preservation of creation, advocating for policies and practices rooted in global solidarity and intergenerational responsibility. © 2024, University of Zagreb.

Incorporating ecosystem services into stem education,"The framework of ecosystem services (ES) and disservices (ED) has increasingly been used in various science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, including soil science. The objectives of this study were to use ES/ED concepts to extend and test an existing lecture and laboratory exercise on soil organic carbon (SOC) in an online introductory soil science course (FNR 2040: Soil Information Systems) taught to Clemson University students from various STEM disciplines (forestry, wildlife biology, and environmental and natural resources) in Fall 2020. The laboratory exercise was extended with a series of reusable learning objects (RLOs), which are self-contained digital modules commonly utilized in e-learning. The laboratory exercise consisted of identifying ES and calculating the avoided social cost of carbon (SC-CO2) from soil organic carbon stocks in the assigned soil’s topsoil horizon. The laboratory exercise effectively increased student familiarity with ES/ED as indicated by the post-assessment survey with a +24.4% increase in the moderately familiar category and a +36.1% increase in the extremely familiar category. The graded online quiz consisted of ten questions and was taken by 51 students with an average score of 8.7 (out of 10). A post-assessment survey indicated that most of the students found that the laboratory was an effective way to learn about ES/ED with examples from soil science. Detailed students’ comments indicated enjoyment of learning (e.g., calculations, applying new knowledge), the value of multimedia (e.g., PowerPoint, video), the flexibility of learning (e.g., different parts in the laboratory), the applicability of content (e.g., real-world examples), and criticism (e.g., tedious calculations). A word cloud based on students’ comments about their experience with the laboratory exercise on soil ES indicated the most common words used by students to describe their experience, such as “soil services”, “learning”, “enjoyed”, and “ecosystems”, among others. Incorporating ES/ED into an undergraduate STEM course enabled students to connect ES/ED provided by soil with the societal systems reliant on the soil resources. © 2021 by the authors.

Assessing Ecosystem Services of Atmospheric Calcium and Magnesium Deposition for Potential Soil Inorganic Carbon Sequestration,"Many soil regulating ecosystem services (ES) are linked to Earth's atmosphere, but associated monetary values often are unknown or difficult to quantify. Atmospheric deposition of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) are abiotic flows (wet, dry, and total) from the atmosphere to land surfaces, which potentially can become available to sequester carbon (C) as soil inorganic carbon (SIC). However, these processes typically have not been included in economic valuations of ecosystem services. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate an approach for valuing non-constrained potential SIC sequestration from atmospheric Ca2+ and Mg2+ deposition based on the concept of the avoided social cost of carbon dioxide emissions (SC-CO2). Maximum monetary values associated with the non-constrained potential SIC sequestration were compiled for the contiguous United States (U.S.) by soil order, land resource region (LRR), state, and region using available deposition data from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NRSP-3). For the entire contiguous U.S., an average annual monetary value for the non-constrained potential SIC sequestration due to atmospheric Ca2+ and Mg2+ deposition was $135M (i.e., $135 million U.S. dollars, where M = million = 10(6)). Mollisols, Alfisols, and Entisols were soil orders with the highest average annual monetary values for non-constrained potential SIC sequestration. When normalized by land area, however, Vertisols had the highest average annual monetary values followed by Alfisols and Mollisols for non-constrained potential SIC sequestration. From a more agricultural perspective, the LRRs with the highest average annual monetary values for non-constrained potential SIC sequestration were the Western Range and Irrigated Region (D), the Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region (M), and the Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region (H). When normalized by area, the LRRS with the highest average annual monetary values were the Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region (I) and the Florida Subtropical Fruit, Truck Crop and Range Region (U). Among the U.S. states, the highest average annual monetary values for non-constrained potential SIC sequestration were Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico, but when normalized by area the highest values by state were Kansas, Iowa, and Texas. Geographical regions in the contiguous U.S. with the highest average annual monetary values for non-constrained potential SIC sequestration were the South Central, Midwest, and West; when normalized by area, the highest values by region were South Central, Midwest, and Northern Plains. Constraints on maximum monetary values, based on physical, chemical, biological, economic, social, and political limitations, need to be considered and quantified to obtain more precise and accurate accounting of the ES associated with SIC sequestration due to atmospheric Ca2+ and Mg2+ deposition.",Not About Sufficiency
"Impacts of shaded agroforestry management on carbon sequestration, biodiversity and farmers income in cocoa production landscapes","PurposeConversion of shaded agroforests to unshaded monocultures endangers the resilience of tropical landscapes. Landscape-scale impacts of alternative shade managements have rarely been assessed. This study explored plantation- and landscape-level impacts of different shade management strategies on aboveground biomass, functional group diversity, and economic potential of cocoa production in northern Ecuador.MethodsWe simulated several cocoa shade management scenarios, using the dynamic forest model LANDIS-II: (i) baseline' projections representing the current mosaic of traditional agroforests, planted agroforests, and unshaded monoculture plantations; (ii) traditional' agroforestry shaded by native fruit and timber trees; (iii) planted' agroforests shaded by planted fruit trees; and (iv) monoculture' unshaded plantations. The impacts of setting aside 20, 30, and 40% of cocoa plantations for natural regeneration was tested for the monoculture scenario.ResultsTraditional agroforests shaded by native trees stored up to 7% more aboveground biomass and had higher abundances of rare functional groups compared to monocultures after 50years of simulation. Smaller effects were found for planted agroforests. Shaded plantations and land set aside for natural regeneration reduced forest fragmentation at the landscape level. The estimated yield gap for monoculture and shaded plantations could not be compensated by additional revenues for carbon storage at current carbon market price.ConclusionsImproving payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes are needed to incentivize smallholders to maintain substantial non-cocoa tree cover that may provide an environmental-friendly way to improve economic potential and food security for smallholders, while supporting biomass and functional group diversity at the landscape level.",Not About Sufficiency
Conservation agriculture and climate resilience,"Agricultural productivity growth is vital for economic and food security outcomes which are threatened by climate change. In response, governments and development agencies are encouraging the adoption of 'climate-smart' agricultural technologies, such as conservation agriculture (CA). However, there is little rigorous evidence that demonstrates the effect of CA on production or climate resilience, and what evidence exists is hampered by selection bias. Using panel data from Zimbabwe, we test how CA performs during extreme rainfall events - both shortfalls and surpluses. We control for the endogenous adoption decision and find that use of CA in years of average rainfall results in no yield gains, and in some cases yield loses. However, CA is effective in mitigating the negative impacts of deviations in rainfall. We conclude that the lower yields during normal rainfall seasons may be a proximate factor in low uptake of CA. Policy should focus promotion of CA on these climate resilience benefits. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Blockchain Technology and Sustainable Supply Chain Finance: A Pathway to Environmental Responsibility and Profitability,"This chapter explores the revolutionary impact of blockchain technology on enhancing sustainable supply chain finance (SSCF), presenting a novel pathway that balances environmental responsibility with profitability. In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, blockchain emerges as a key driver for transparency, efficiency, and trust in supply chain management, particularly in sectors critical to Sub-Saharan Africa’s development. This chapter begins by introducing the concept of SSCF and its significance in promoting sustainable development goals (SDGs) through responsible sourcing, production, and distribution practices. It then delves into the fundamentals of blockchain technology, elucidating how its characteristics – decentralization, immutability, and transparency – can address traditional challenges in supply chain management such as traceability, compliance, and fraud prevention. A significant portion of this chapter is dedicated to case studies and real-world applications of blockchain in SSCF, illustrating how businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa and beyond are leveraging this technology to achieve greater environmental stewardship and economic gains. These examples highlight the reduction of carbon footprints, enhancement of green practices, and improvement of labour conditions, all while maintaining or increasing profitability. Furthermore, this chapter discusses the integration of blockchain with other digital innovations like Internet of Things and artificial intelligence to create more robust, autonomous supply chains that can better respond to environmental challenges and market demands. It examines the potential barriers to adopting blockchain in SSCF, including technological infrastructure, regulatory environments, and the need for stakeholder collaboration. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, David Mhlanga and Mufaro Dzingirai.",Not About Sufficiency
Ten facts about land systems for sustainability,"Land use is central to addressing sustainability issues, including biodiversity conservation, climate change, food security, poverty alleviation, and sustainable energy. In this paper, we synthesize knowledge accumulated in land system science, the integrated study of terrestrial social-ecological systems, into 10 hard truths that have strong, general, empirical support. These facts help to explain the challenges of achieving sustainability in land use and thus also point toward solutions. The 10 facts are as follows: 1) Meanings and values of land are socially constructed and contested; 2) land systems exhibit complex behaviors with abrupt, hard-to-predict changes; 3) irreversible changes and path dependence are common features of land systems; 4) some land uses have a small footprint but very large impacts; 5) drivers and impacts of land-use change are globally interconnected and spill over to distant locations; 6) humanity lives on a used planet where all land provides benefits to societies; 7) land-use change usually entails trade-offs between different benefits—""win–wins"" are thus rare; 8) land tenure and land-use claims are often unclear, overlapping, and contested; 9) the benefits and burdens from land are unequally distributed; and 10) land users have multiple, sometimes conflicting, ideas of what social and environmental justice entails. The facts have implications for governance, but do not provide fixed answers. Instead they constitute a set of core principles which can guide scientists, policy makers, and practitioners toward meeting sustainability challenges in land use. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

Non-material contributions of wildlife to human well-being: a systematic review,"Wildlife has important effects on human well-being, ranging from beneficial contributions to life threatening interactions. Here, we systematically reviewed publications of both positive and negative non-material contributions of wildlife to people (WCP) for different taxonomic groups (birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians) and dimensions of human well-being such as health, social well-being, identity and spirituality. Overall, the majority of studies reported negative WCP, such as feelings of insecurity or injuries. However, over the last decade the number of publications on positive WCP such as good mental health, positive emotions or learning increased, mainly in the Global North. These spatial and temporal patterns may hint towards normative influences that drive the relative proportion of reported WCP. However, these normative influences are not yet well understood and future research should examine potential biases by conducting policy assessments or surveys among researchers to understand drivers and motivations behind their research questions. We found almost no joint assessments of positive and negative WCP for any wildlife species. Studies also showed taxon-specific differences in WCP outcomes, with predominantly positive WCP reported for birds and predominantly negative WCP published for mammals or reptiles. Physical health was the most dominant aspect of well-being studied and affected by WCP while other well-being dimensions such as social well-being, learning or identity were less frequently covered in the literature. Future studies should jointly evaluate positive and negative effects of wildlife on human well-being and implement multi-taxon approaches to obtain a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of WCP. These assessments of WCP will provide actionable science outcomes that will shape human-wildlife coexistence and promote human health and well-being.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating conservation and fisheries management strategies by linking spatial prioritization software and ecosystem and fisheries modelling tools,"Well-designed marine protected area (MPA) networks can deliver a range of ecological, economic and social benefits, and so a great deal of research has focused on developing spatial conservation prioritization tools to help identify important areas. However, whilst these software tools are designed to identify MPA networks that both represent biodiversity and minimize impacts on stakeholders, they do not consider complex ecological processes. Thus, it is difficult to determine the impacts that proposed MPAs could have on marine ecosystem health, fisheries and fisheries sustainability. Using the eastern English Channel as a case study, this paper explores an approach to address these issues by identifying a series of MPA networks using the Marxan and Marxan with Zones conservation planning software and linking them with a spatially explicit ecosystem model developed in Ecopath with Ecosim. We then use these to investigate potential trade-offs associated with adopting different MPA management strategies. Limited-take MPAs, which restrict the use of some fishing gears, could have positive benefits for conservation and fisheries in the eastern English Channel, even though they generally receive far less attention in research on MPA network design. Our findings, however, also clearly indicate that no-take MPAs should form an integral component of proposed MPA networks in the eastern English Channel, as they not only result in substantial increases in ecosystem biomass, fisheries catches and the biomass of commercially valuable target species, but are fundamental to maintaining the sustainability of the fisheries. Synthesis and applications. Using the existing software tools Marxan with Zones and Ecopath with Ecosim in combination provides a powerful policy-screening approach. This could help inform marine spatial planning by identifying potential conflicts and by designing new regulations that better balance conservation objectives and stakeholder interests. In addition, it highlights that appropriate combinations of no-take and limited-take marine protected areas might be the most effective when making trade-offs between long-term ecological benefits and short-term political acceptability. © 2015 British Ecological Society.",Not About Sufficiency
"PROMOTING INNOVATION EXCELLENCE IN TRANSFORMATION OF COAL REGIONS TO CLIMATE NEUTRAL, THRIVING ECONOMIES","Energy efficiency, Renewable Energy Sources, Energy Storage/Batteries, Hydrogen, Efficient Buildings, climate neutrality, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonization of industries & coal regions are in the heart of European Policies for the new programming period (ie. Green Deal, EU Strategic Energy Technology Plan, Twin Industrial Transition etc.). Many financial instruments have been setup to support these objectives that have a common denominator in sustainability and energy or better yet, sustainable energy. Many EU alliances across the value chains (ie. EBA), IPCEIs (ie. Hydrogen, Batteries) and Research & Policy Platforms (ie. Coal Regions in Transition), are dedicated to facilitating the advancement of R&I in the field, through the collective effort of EU members, and enable the transformation of EU regions to climate neutral, thriving economies. This context finds a lot of countries striving to comply, especially challenging those that traditionally have economies heavily dependent on fossil fuel mining and exploitation; a major shift has to be done in a short amount of time, putting at risk the balances in the local economies and making years-long expertise and well-established skills become obsolete. While currently coal power plants are drastically put in action again across Europe in order to battle the on-going energy crisis which has flaunted EU’s dependence on fossil fuels and the need to speed up the coal phase-out, in the long term this will not be an option. However, coal regions present also a major opportunity. As studies have shown between 106,681 and 314,416 jobs can be created in the coal regions by 2030 by deploying clean energy technologies. Those jobs created by clean energy technologies in the coal regions would be comparable to the nearly 200,000 direct jobs relevant to coal related activities.

"Modeling on comparison of ecosystem services concepts, tools, methods and their ecological-economic implications: a review","The paper aims to identify the gaps in the assessment and modeling of ecosystem services to help researchers, resource managers, and decision-makers develop a holistic understanding of the ecosystem service assessments' foundations. This review proposes that to efficiently assess the ecosystem services, methodologies that are region-specific and standardized in the terminologies are useful in determining the valuation component in the ecosystem services assessments' goal to explain trade-offs between development and conservation priorities for implementation of conservation policies. Ecosystem service assessments are critical for the sustainable future of Earth. Numerous scholarly studies have been conducted in the field of ecosystem services (ES) that have laid down the foundation of their valuation, mapping, and quantification. We reviewed 103 peer-reviewed publications using the SCOPUS database, perhaps the most extensive database of peer-reviewed research literature as well WoS, PUBMED, and Google Scholar databases based on certain criteria. Our review revealed that different definitions of the ES concept and the non-standardization of the economic concepts for assigning market values to the ecosystem services had shown conflicting results. Further, we also found that ES assessment methodologies depend upon the evaluation purpose and vary from qualitative approaches to modeling and integrated ones. ES assessment has considerable implications in understanding the earth's surface processes and the pursuing benefits in the form of balanced trade-offs between sustainability and development. To attain sustainable development goals, we propose shifting towards a green economy to balance the trade-off between conservation and development.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards effectively restoring agricultural landscapes in East African drylands: Linking plant functional traits with soil hydrology,"Land degradation is a major threat to food security in Sub Saharan Africa. Low infiltration rates in degraded soils increase the risk of surface runoff and decrease soil and groundwater recharge, resulting in further loss of soil fertility, water scarcity and crop failure. Increasing woody vegetation typically enhances soil infiltrability but little is known about how species may have differential effects on the soil hydrological properties. The aim of this study is to understand how woody vegetation and its functional properties affect soil fertility and infiltrability. We measured field-saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) and soil organic carbon (SOC) in 38 plots across agricultural landscapes in Muminji, Kenya. Woody vegetation and land use inventories took place and species functional traits were measured on the 63 most abundant species. We systematically tested the effects of vegetation quantity (aboveground woody biomass and vegetation cover) and quality (functional properties and diversity) on soil health (Kfs as a proxy for soil infiltrability and SOC for soil fertility). We found that both vegetation quantity and quality affected soil health. Aboveground woody biomass increased the Kfs and we found a nearly significant positive effect of vegetation cover on SOC. Woody plants with a low leaf thickness positively affected Kfs and a nearly significant negative effect of wood moisture content on SOC was found. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that the systematic assessment of vegetation can lead to evidence-based recommendations to guide land restoration. We found that avoiding bare soil and promoting woody plants, while favouring species with thin leaves and avoiding species with a very low wood density and water storage strategy, is beneficial for soil health across agricultural landscapes in East African drylands. © 2022 The Authors.

An integrated full cost model based on extended exergy accounting toward sustainability assessment of industrial production processes,"Abstract: Existing methods for the sustainability assessment of industrial production processes have considered the values of natural resource use and ecosystem services. However, these methods mainly focus on monetary measures of natural capital cost and ignore some other costs, including human health effects, biodiversity loss and indirect exergy consumption in labor employment. The integrated ecological cumulative exergy consumption accounting method was proposed to improve the existing extended exergy model and provide a comprehensive perspective of the full cost of production including natural resources, human resources and environmental cost. The improved model is illustrated by its application for the steel-making process in China. Of the total cost of the steel-making process, the human resources cost (investment) accounts for only 9.7%. Contrary to the traditional cost evaluation, the result of this case study shows that classical economic assessment cannot reflect an overall ecological sustainable level of the steel-making process. The integrated method framework can be used to assess sustainability in a different spatial scale.

"Assessment of successful experiments and limitations of phytotechnologies: Contaminant uptake, detoxification and sequestration, and consequences for food safety","Purpose The term ""phytotechnologies"" refers to the application of science and engineering to provide solutions involving plants, including phytoremediation options using plants and associated microbes to remediate environmental compartments contaminated by trace elements (TE) and organic xenobiotics (OX). An extended knowledge of the uptake, translocation, storage, and detoxification mechanisms in plants, of the interactions with microorganisms, and of the use of ""omic"" technologies (functional genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics), combined with genetic analysis and plant improvement, is essential to understand the fate of contaminants in plants and food, nonfood and technical crops. The integration of physicochemical and biological understanding allows the optimization of these properties of plants, making phytotechnologies more economically and socially attractive, decreasing the level and transfer of contaminants along the food chain and augmenting the content of essential minerals in food crops. This review will disseminate experience gained between 2004 and 2009 by three working groups of COST Action 859 on the uptake, detoxification, and sequestration of pollutants by plants and consequences for food safety. Gaps between scientific approaches and lack of understanding are examined to suggest further research and to clarify the current state-of-the-art for potential end-users of such green options. Conclusion and perspectives Phytotechnologies potentially offer efficient and environmentally friendly solutions for cleanup of contaminated soil and water, improvement of food safety, carbon sequestration, and development of renewable energy sources, all of which contribute to sustainable land use management. Information has been gained at more realistic exposure levels mainly on Cd, Zn, Ni, As, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and herbicides with less on other contaminants. A main goal is a better understanding, at the physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels, of mechanisms and their regulation related to uptake-exclusion, apoplastic barriers, xylem loading, efflux-influx of contaminants, root-to-shoot transfer, concentration and chemical speciation in xylem/phloem, storage, detoxification, and stress tolerance for plants and associated microbes exposed to contaminants (TE and OX). All remain insufficiently understood especially in the case of multiple-element and mixed-mode pollution. Research must extend from model species to plants of economic importance and include interactions between plants and microorganisms. It remains a major challenge to create, develop, and scale up phytotechnologies to market level and to successfully deploy these to ameliorate the environment and human health. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Not About Sufficiency
Incorporating network topology and ecosystem services into the optimization of ecological network: A case study of the Yellow River Basin,"Human activity-induced landscape fragmentation seriously affects regional connectivity and biodiversity and hinders human well-being and sustainable development. These effects can be mitigated by the construction of ecological networks (ENs), but building extensive ENs requires cross-regional planning and coordination. Since ecosystems in different regions provide varying benefits to humans, optimizing ENs based on the quality of ecosystem services (ESs) is an effective way to rapidly improve regional landscape connectivity. In this study, we constructed an EN in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) according to landscape ecology and complex network theory, examined the network topology, measured three ESs using the InVEST model, and optimized the EN based on the coupling of EN topology and ES quality. In the YRB, the biodiversity index and carbon storage capacity were relatively higher and invariable. However, the wind-breaking and sand-fixing index was poorer, but it increased by 146 % during the study period. The number of ecological patches was roughly 48, accounting for about 40 % of the YRB region. From 1995 to 2020, the average ecological resistance decreased by 29 %, and the average number of corridors was 99, but the average corridor length first increased and then decreased. The number and area of ecological pinch points and barriers changed significantly. The EN topology strongly correlated with biodiversity and wind-breaking and sand-fixing, but not with carbon storage. In the face of random attacks, the optimized EN demonstrated significantly greater connectivity robustness. Under deliberate attacks, it exhibited better resilience and buffering power when the percentage of attacking nodes is in the 30 %–80 % range. For the ecological patches within a certain range of the attacking node, appropriate development and planning can be carried out in the future, while for the patches outside the range, strict ecological protection measures need to be implemented. This study provides theoretical references for improving EN planning efficiency and promoting synergistic cooperation in the YRB. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Valuation Of public goods and ecosystem services provided by agriculture,"The public good ecosystem services, particularly ecosystem services provided by agriculture, are defined as goods and services often delivered as side-effects of farmers' production contribute to human well-being.

The principal materials used for the studies are as follows: different sources of literature, e.g. scholars' articles, research papers and the reports of institutions, inter alia, European Union; the data from Eurostat database, Central Statistical Bureau database and unpublished data from database of Latvian Rural Support Service. For investigation of impact of agricultural landscape sustainability aspects the following data were used: payment agri-environment measures'; and commitment area of agricultural land or area, as well as the structure of crop areas. The data that have been used reflect implementation of agri-environment measures under RDP 2007-2013. The suitable qualitative and quantitative research methods for certain tasks have been used in the process of study. The findings show that the expected positive effect of implementation of agri-environmental measures of RDP 2007-2013 in Latvia on the sustainability and resilience of agricultural landscapes, as a provider of main ecosystem services, as well as conservation of agricultural biodiversity has not been received. Besides, in order to investigate the further effectiveness of state support for ecosystem services, the assessment of planned agri-environmental measures of new RDP 2014-2020 is performed. © 2018 Latvia University of Agriculture.

Livestock Technologies and Grazing Land Management Options for Climate Change Adaption and Mitigation as a Contribution for Food Security in Ethiopia: A Brief Overview,"African countries, like Ethiopia, are particularly vulnerable to climate change because their economies largely depend on climate-sensitive agricultural production. Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) of Ethiopia recognized climate change as a huge threat and focusing on mitigation issues. The GTP stipulates the country's ambition to build a climate resilient green economy by 2030. This paper looks at the potential of livestock technologies and grazing land management for mitigation and adaption to a changing climate. Research findings in Ethiopia showed that livestock technologies and management of grazing lands such as improving the quality of forage, feeding highly digestible forages, processing and preservation of feeds, use of controlled grazing instead of continuous grazing and inclusion of legumes in forage mixes, have a great response to climate change. The choices for application of the technologies and potential mitigation strategies primarily depend on the adoption and cost associated with it. Grazing land management not only mitigates climate change but also reduces soil erosion, increases carbon sequestration and contributes to the resilience of crop-livestock farming systems in Ethiopia. In conclusion, management of grazing lands and implementation of livestock technologies have good implications in mitigating climate change on top of income generation and thereby improving the livelihood of farmers in Ethiopia.",Not About Sufficiency

Nature-based solutions in Hindu Kush Himalayas: IUCN global standard based synthesis,"Himalayan countries face many ecological challenges, including biodiversity loss and the many threats of climate change. In response, these countries are implementing Nature-based Solution to minimize these challenges and promote sustainable development. In this article we analyze the NbS programs implemented across the Himalayan region and assess the limitations of these NbS using the IUCN standard criteria of adherence to NbS for selected articles. We perform a systematic review of articles using the PRISMA methodology, through the Scopus, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate databases and followed by screening through the Rayyan web interface. Articles were screened out based on the location and lack of biodiversity and human well-being outcomes of NbS intervention. Nature-based Solutions in the Himalayas primarily use a sustainable management approach (35.29%), followed by restoration (23.53%), conservation (11.76%), holistic management (11.76%), eco-DRR (11.76%) and green infrastructure (5.88%) to address societal and climatic challenges. Institutional execution of NbS was 29.41% more common compared to the implementation of NbS by community or farmer groups. Pineapple based agroforestry (83.04%), forest restoration (78.57%), spring water storage (83.04%), spring restoration (86.61%), groundwater recharge (82.14%), bio-fertilizer and pesticides (77.68%), watershed restoration (78.57%), community-based watershed management (77.68%), community-based DRR (81.25%), community-based forest management (81.25%), sustainable harvest of medicinal plants (77.68%) and wetland restoration (82.14%), adhere to the IUCN criteria. In addition, some interventions adequately meet IUCN criteria, such as ice stupas (72.32%), forest restoration through plantation (73.21%), eco-safe roads (65.18), blue-green infrastructure (68.75%), and traditional ecological knowledge (72.32%). Our evaluation noted that NbS interventions can be improved by precise planning and design before implementation, engaging multiple stakeholders, comparing alternative solutions, and periodic monitoring of the impacts on the environment and society. This study shows that NbS in the Himalayas are contributing to biodiversity conservation and climate risk management. Tackling the limitation of this present review, mainly the exclusion of research not addressing biodiversity and human well-being, will yield more precise outcomes for climate actions and sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency
Effect of legumes on nitrogen economy and budgeting in South Asia,"Increase agricultural productivity and mitigate the demand of food security of the rapidly flourishing population the primary nutrient element nitrogen (N) has been playing a paramount role in the crop production system. The denitrification losses N in the form of nitrous oxide (N2O) are very much harmful to the environment because it causes global warming, detrimental effects on a human being, animal and the ecosystem. The losses of N into the environment affect ecosystem services, environmental sustainability, soil health, decline factor productivity and affects aquatic life. Intensive and improper application of inorganic nitrogenous fertilizer in the cropping system incurred higher investment of capital, more energy budgeting and carbon (C) footprint, which causes environmentally and economically unacceptable crop production system. To, tackle such consequences the inclusion or incorporation of grain legumes in the cropping system reduces atmospheric pollution, increases the N budgeting in the soil ecosystem, improve environmental sustainability, soil health, soil sustainability and agricultural productivity. Further, the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) can be increased by adopting some tools like leaf colour chart (LCC), green seeker, site-specific nutrient management, SPAD (soil plant analysis development) meter along with the application of slow-release nitrogen fertilizer such as neem coated urea, sulphur coated urea, polymer-coated urea etc. This chapter is focused on the N budgeting of South Asia, the consequences of N on the environment, soil, water and its management strategies. Therefore, public consciousness, an adaptation of modern technology and practising legume-based crop rotation is necessary for improving environmental quality and a cleaner production system. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

"Soil mites as bioindicators of disturbance in the boreal forest in northern Alberta, Canada: Testing taxonomic sufficiency at multiple taxonomic levels","Soil systems provide numerous ecosystem services but are often degraded due to anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Invertebrates can be used as biological indicators to provide information on soil health. Mites (Arachnida: Acariformes, Parasitiformes) constitute the majority of invertebrates in soil; however, their small size and diversity make them a challenging group to identify. Identification to levels coarser than species (e.g., genus, family) can alleviate some of the taxonomic difficulties. Here we test whether two groups of soil mites, Mesostigmata and Oribatida, can indicate three disturbance types (fire, forest harvest and linear features such as seismic lines and roads) in the boreal forest in northern Alberta. We assessed this at three taxonomic levels: species, genus and family. Samples were collected by the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute from 2010 to 2015 from across Alberta. We paired disturbed sites with nearby undisturbed sites while minimizing habitat and temporal differences (N pairs: fire = 13, harvest = 11, linear = 7). Mesostigmata were separated into two size categories, large only (>300 μm) and with small included (all mites > 50 μm), while oribatid were analyzed only with individuals > 300 μm. We used ANOVAs and PERMANOVAs to determine whether species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity and assemblage structure differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Compared to undisturbed habitats, we found that richness and diversity of Mesostigmata > 50 μm were lower with fire disturbance at all three taxonomic levels; similarly, richness and diversity of Oribatida were lower with fire and harvest at all three taxonomic levels and richness was lower for linear disturbance at family-level. Assemblage structure of Mesostigmata > 50 μm indicated fire and linear disturbance at all three taxonomic levels, while that of Mesostigmata > 300 μm indicated all three-disturbance types at species-level, and harvest disturbance at genus and family. Assemblage structure of Oribatida indicated fire disturbance at all three taxonomic levels, and linear disturbance at genus and family. Our analyses showed that mesostigmatid and oribatid mites can indicate disturbance when identified to ranks coarser than species suggests that labour-intensive species-level identifications may not always be required for bioindicator studies using soil mites. The generality of these findings should be assessed in different regions and with different disturbances. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Supporting Cooperative Forest Management among Small-Acreage Lifestyle Landowners in Southeast Queensland, Australia","Effective landscape-level biodiversity conservation requires cooperative forest management across public and private-tenure boundaries. This study explores the potential for cooperative cross-boundary forest management among small-acreage lifestyle landholders in southeast Queensland using 17 in-depth qualitative case-study analyses. Landholders typically possessed mutual objectives concerning forest management, a sense of neighborly stewardship, and positive predispositions toward cooperative cross-boundary forest management. However, capacity, institutional, and neighbor-related barriers were limiting landholder interest and involvement. We find that peer-mentoring networks have a critical role to play in promoting and delivering programs that support cross-boundary forest management. Government should ideally play a background ""out-of-sight"" facilitator role. We also find the capacity for urbanizing rural landscapes to retain their natural values can be greatly enhanced by facilitating small-acreage landholder cooperation to maintain and restore their contiguous forests, mitigate wildfire hazards, and revegetate paddocks to buffer existing forests or create new fire-retardant forests. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Conceptual Basis for a Sustainable and Fire Resilient Built Environment,"Fire has the potential to create significant impacts on the built environment. Managing this impact is sometimes pursued without consideration of the interface between the natural and technological worlds. However, as society has recognized the impacts of technological development on environmental sustainability, the need for sustainable and resilient development has emerged. To facilitate sustainable and resilient development, technological choices should embrace a sociotechnical systems approach that considers the interactions of society, technology and institutions, and their interactions with the environment. Failure to do so can result in unintended consequences. Society’s technological choices aimed at increasing sustainability of buildings, such as the desire to reduce building carbon footprints or improve the use of renewable energy systems, can have significant impacts on fire resilience if not considered holistically. To better understand and comprehensively address and mitigate intolerable fire risk associated with choices driven by sustainability objectives, a balanced and holistic systems approach is needed. To this end, a framework to foster a systems-oriented approach to improving both sustainability and fire resilience, in tandem, to create a Sustainable and Fire Resilient Built Environment (SAFR-BE) is presented. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Can Bivalve Habitat Restoration Improve Degraded Estuaries?,"Bivalve habitats were once a dominant ecosystem in temperate and subtropical estuaries worldwide. While bivalve habitats are greatly reduced from their former abundance, remnant, and restored populations have been shown to provide a suite of important ecosystems services including improving water quality, coastal protection, and providing fisheries nursery habitat, in addition to providing a direct food value. Although it is unlikely that bivalve habitats can be brought back to their former abundance in most locations, bivalve restoration has been shown to be possible at large scale if the drivers of decline have been addressed. Restoring bivalve habitats can improve the health of estuaries, but restoration activities need to be supplemented with improved management practices, including in the surrounding catchments. Taking an estuary-wide approach to restoration, with bivalve habitat restoration complementing the restoration of other habitat types such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves is likely to yield both greater ecosystem benefits and may result in positive feedbacks resulting in greater restoration success of complimentary habitats. Motivation for bivalve and other coastal habitat restoration has moved beyond simply restoring an imperiled ecosystem and its biodiversity, to restoring food security, local employment, green engineering, shoreline protection, and nutrient trading. In the future it is likely that innovative engineering solutions will improve the success and value of bivalve habitat restoration. In addition to restoring natural bivalve habitats and the benefits that they bring to estuaries and the people who depend on them, novel solutions to improving estuary health and food security should be considered. There are likely to be benefits from using bivalve aquaculture as a tool for ecosystem modification (e.g., harnessing the filtering power of bivalves at high densities to improve local water quality) and creating green engineering solutions that include living elements such as bivalves to protect shorelines. © 2019 Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Assessing the ecological dimension of One Health,"This chapter provides a conceptual framework describing the main ecological components of the global ecosystem, which need to be considered when using a One Health approach, including incorporating examples of metrics which both reflect the connectedness of different environments and quantify the complex interactions between humans, domesticated and non-domesticated animals and the environment in which they live, and the direct and indirect drivers which impact them. The set of ecological components described should be used to inform the audience on how to quantify the sustainability and thus the 'One Health-ness' of any environment. It is the quantification of an array of these components which demonstrate the 'added value' of One Health, through the savings of lives, improvements in life-lived (quality of life), qualitative gains and financial savings. One Medicine recognises that there is virtually no difference in the paradigm between human and veterinary medicine and both disciplines can contribute to the development of each other; animals should thus be positioned in the social and not the environmental realm, taking a 'less speciecist' stance. It should be understood that when quantifying the health of anything, be it an organism or an ecosystem, the variables measured are all context-dependent, particularly for ecosystem and environmental health. The interpretation of resulting measurements will differ dependent upon a human, an animal and ecosystem perspective, and each of these perspectives has its own value, when thinking about 'One Health'. The environment is a major determinant of health with an estimated 25-33% of the global burden of disease attributed to environmental risk factors. Accordingly, when measuring the ecological dimension of One Health, account needs to be taken of the fitness and sustainability (including integrity) of the ecosystem and environment. This is not easy to quantify, as it results in the creation of indexes of heterogeneous variables, which do not provide an easily interpretable output of resilience. Various indices have been developed which aim to quantify environmental health, including: the long-term sustainability of different ecosystems; the state of the world's biological diversity; describing the status of ecosystem services. Metrics to measure the health status of the world include the `One Health-ness' of water, air, soil, biodiversity, and ecosystems. They require ecosystem approaches to health to factor in ecosystem interactions in health research. Methods to quantify the health status of populations under closer management of humans also need to be mentioned including those of humans, domestic animals, plants, and aquaculture. Finally, antimicrobial resistance issues across the ecological dimension should be considered. Many of these metrics are very 'human-centric' and should therefore be interpreted with caution. A major challenge for mankind to achieving a One Health in the future is to examine the trade-off from producing food and look for synergies with food quality for both animals and humans but also related to zoonoses emergence. Contaminants, including biological such as pathogens, chemical elements or compounds need to be identified and acted upon. Balancing all ecological components (water, air, soil, biodiversity) is critically important for food security, and both food safety and food security should be interlinked for a One Health approach to sustained global food security. It is critical that a focus on food quality is not just on outcomes such as food nutrients or food safety (e.g. maximum residue levels) but also on how one-health-ness interacts with the food system at different stages of the value chain (production, processing, transport and consumption of food) to affect food quality. Given the growing human population, a set of One Health indicators which capture the link between human health, animal health and ecological health is to inform future global developments, particularly as we enter a period of unprecedented anthropogenic influence on global ecosystems.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental sustainability in anaesthesia and critical care,"The detrimental health effects of climate change continue to increase. Although health systems respond to this disease burden, healthcare itself pollutes the atmosphere, land, and waterways. We surveyed the ‘state of the art’ environmental sustainability research in anaesthesia and critical care, addressing why it matters, what is known, and ideas for future work. Focus is placed upon the atmospheric chemistry of the anaesthetic gases, recent work clarifying their relative global warming potentials, and progress in waste anaesthetic gas treatment. Life cycle assessment (LCA; i.e. ‘cradle to grave’ analysis) is introduced as the definitive method used to compare and contrast ecological footprints of products, processes, and systems. The number of LCAs within medicine has gone from rare to an established body of knowledge in the past decade that can inform doctors of the relative ecological merits of different techniques. LCAs with practical outcomes are explored, such as the carbon footprint of reusable vs single-use anaesthetic devices (e.g. drug trays, laryngoscope blades, and handles), and the carbon footprint of treating an ICU patient with septic shock. Avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle, and reprocess are then explored. Moving beyond routine clinical care, the vital influences that the source of energy (renewables vs fossil fuels) and energy efficiency have in healthcare's ecological footprint are highlighted.

The impact of interventions in the global land and agri-food sectors on Nature’s Contributions to People and the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"Interlocked challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation require transformative interventions in the land management and food production sectors to reduce carbon emissions, strengthen adaptive capacity, and increase food security. However, deciding which interventions to pursue and understanding their relative co-benefits with and trade-offs against different social and environmental goals have been difficult without comparisons across a range of possible actions. This study examined 40 different options, implemented through land management, value chains, or risk management, for their relative impacts across 18 Nature's Contributions to People (NCPs) and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We find that a relatively small number of interventions show positive synergies with both SDGs and NCPs with no significant adverse trade-offs; these include improved cropland management, improved grazing land management, improved livestock management, agroforestry, integrated water management, increased soil organic carbon content, reduced soil erosion, salinization, and compaction, fire management, reduced landslides and hazards, reduced pollution, reduced post-harvest losses, improved energy use in food systems, and disaster risk management. Several interventions show potentially significant negative impacts on both SDGs and NCPs; these include bioenergy and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, afforestation, and some risk sharing measures, like commercial crop insurance. Our results demonstrate that a better understanding of co-benefits and trade-offs of different policy approaches can help decision-makers choose the more effective, or at the very minimum, more benign interventions for implementation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Balancing Water Resources Development and Environmental Sustainability in Africa: A Review of Recent Research Findings and Applications,"Sustainable development in Africa is dependent on increasing use of the continent's water resources without significantly degrading ecosystem services that are also fundamental to human wellbeing. This is particularly challenging in Africa because of high spatial and temporal variability in the availability of water resources and limited amounts of total water availability across expansive semi-arid portions of the continent. The challenge is compounded by ambitious targets for increased water use and a rush of international funding to finance development activities. Balancing development with environmental sustainability requires (i) understanding the boundary conditions imposed by the continent's climate and hydrology today and into the future, (ii) estimating the magnitude and spatial distribution of water use needed to meet development goals, and (iii) understanding the environmental water requirements of affected ecosystems, their current status and potential consequences of increased water use. This article reviews recent advancements in each of these topics and highlights innovative approaches and tools available to support sustainable development. While much remains to be learned, scientific understanding and technology should not be viewed as impediments to sustainable development on the continent.",Not About Sufficiency
The dimensions of soil security,"Soil security, an overarching concept of soil motivated by sustainable development, is concerned with the maintenance and improvement of the global soil resource to produce food, fibre and fresh water, contribute to energy and climate sustainability, and to maintain the biodiversity and the overall protection of the ecosystem. Security is used here for soil in the same sense that it is used widely for food and water. It is argued that soil has an integral part to play in the global environmental sustainability challenges of food security, water security, energy sustainability, climate stability, biodiversity, and ecosystem service delivery. Indeed, soil has the same existential status as these issues and should be recognized and highlighted similarly. The concept of soil security is multidimensional. It acknowledges the five dimensions of (1) capability, (2) condition, (3) capital, (4) connectivity and (5) codification, of soil entities which encompass the social, economic and biophysical sciences and recognize policy and legal frameworks. The soil security concept is compared with the cognate, but more limited, notions of soil quality, health and protection. 2013 The Authors. (C) Published by Elsevier B.V.

"The effects of tourism development on rural livelihoods in the Okavango Delta, Botswana","The Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) program in Botswana aims to achieve biodiversity conservation and rural development in rich biodiversity areas like the Okavango Delta. CBNRM assumes that if rural communities derive benefits from natural resources, they will be obliged to use such resources sustainably. Using the sustainable livelihoods framework, this study analyzes the effects of tourism development through CBNRM on rural livelihoods at Khwai, Sankoyo and Mababe in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, using primary and secondary data sources. Results of long-term surveys and in-depth interviews indicate that the three communities have forgone traditional livelihood activities such as hunting and gathering, livestock and crop farming to participate in tourism through CBNRM. Livelihoods in these villages have been improved as a result. Basic needs such as shelter, employment and income and social services like water supply systems, transportation, scholarships and payment of funeral expenses are now provided to community members and funded with income from CBNRM. Social capital has been built up in order to agree, manage and develop the CBNRM process. These results show that tourism development in these villages is achieving its goal of improved livelihoods, contradicting claims that community development projects are failing to achieve rural development. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of conservation farming practices on agro-ecosystem services for sustainable food security in Bangladesh,"In South Asia, the long-term provision of agro-ecosystem services is threatened by accelerating climate change and undesirable farming practices. Conservation farming could help ensure sustainable ecosystem services and food security. This study was conducted in nine purposively selected districts in west and northwest Bangladesh. Data on conservation farming practices were collected from 540 farmers and 63 professionals, directly or indirectly involved with conservation farming, using two interview schedules and face-to-face interviews between July and November 2019. Multiple regression modeling (OLS) and path analyses were performed to identify the contribution of selected predictors of the direct and indirect effects of using conservation farming practices. Each conservation farming practice, including the system of rice intensification under permanent raised-beds, crop residue incorporation, and cover crops, affected components of farmers' food security. These conservation practices had moderately positive effects on agro-ecosystem services and food security for 82.2% of farmers studied. The effects of using conservation farming practices were significantly impacted by farmers' educational qualifications, training experience, and their knowledge about the conservation farming practices. The food security status of farmers was significantly impacted by their annual family income and knowledge about conservation farming practices. Regulation of soil fertility and water, soil structure, soil retention, nutrient cycling, and zero-tillage were important components of agro-ecosystems that improved food security by increasing crop yield. This study showed that conservation practices have a positive influence on agro-ecosystem services and food security in Bangladesh, individually and in combination. We suggest that further support to conservation farming is an important policy option for decision-makers given the vulnerability of ecosystem services and a need to ensure food security in South Asia.",Not About Sufficiency

Effect of nanomaterials on remediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons-contaminated soils: A review,"The remediation of toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the soil is always an important topic since exposure to contaminated soil with carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic potential can result in serious health effects. With respect to the remediation of PAHs contaminated soil, nanomaterials (NMs) have recently received a great deal of attention due to the special characteristics arising from their nanoscale sizes. However, the usefulness and potency of these NMs depend on their adaption to specific site conditions and soil properties. Since there is no comprehensive review of the applications of NMs, it is of great importance to analyze, discuss, and interpret the latest progress in the application of NMs for the remediation of contaminated soils containing PAHs. This overview essentially captures the novel advances made in nano zero valent-iron (nZVI), metal oxides, carbon-based NMs, and polymer-based materials. Each characteristic of NMs that contributes to the enhancement of the process is highlighted. Moreover, operational conditions in which the best-obtained results are achieved qualitatively summarize. This review is also given special attention to the type of soil and pollutant, which are major influential factors to affect the performance of the process. Furthermore, the potential implication of NMs and PAHs on soil properties is reviewed in terms of the changes in migration behavior of pollutants, plant phytotoxicity, and soil microbial community composition. Discussion on future perspectives is presented on the use and prospects for the application of NMs in contaminated soils. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Tradeoffs and synergies among ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and food production in coffee agroforestry","Concerns over the capacity of the world’s existing agricultural land to provide food for the global population under climate change and continued biodiversity loss have set the stage for a prevailing narrative of inherent tradeoffs with agricultural production. Coffee, a major export of tropical countries, offers a unique opportunity to examine how different management practices can lead to a variety of outcomes in food security, ecosystem services, and biodiversity conservation. Our study examined this intersection to identify tradeoffs and synergies using compiled data from Puerto Rico. At the island level, we analyzed data on coffee yield and planted area under shade or sun management. At the farm level, we analyzed management variables (percent shade cover, maximum canopy height, ground cover, and food crop richness), non-provisioning ecosystem services variables (total farm carbon storage, soil organic carbon storage, coffee plant carbon biomass, and hurricane resistance and resilience), and biodiversity variables (ant, bird, and lizard richness and abundance). At the island level, we found that planted area was the most significant predictor of total production, suggesting no obvious tradeoff between production and shade management in coffee farms. At the farm level, canopy cover of shade trees was negatively correlated with ground cover and positively correlated with food crop richness, suggesting a synergy between agroforestry and subsistence food production. We detected mostly synergies associated with ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and agroforestry management and no tradeoffs among ecosystem service and biodiversity parameters. Shade canopy cover significantly increased total carbon storage, coffee plant biomass, hurricane resistance, and bird species richness. Shade canopy height had a similar positive effect on total farm carbon storage while food crop richness had a positive effect on farm resilience following Hurricane Maria. Ground cover was positively associated with soil carbon storage and pest-controlling lizard abundance. Tradeoffs related to agroforestry management included an inverse relationship between ground cover and hurricane resistance and more dominance of an invasive ant species in farms with higher shade canopies. We discuss the implications of practicing agroforestry principles in this smallholder coffee system and highlight opportunities to contribute to more diversified food production systems that support biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Including diverse knowledges and worldviews in environmental assessment and planning: the Brazilian Amazon Kaxinawá Nova Olinda Indigenous Land case,"The concepts of ‘ecosystem services’ (ES) and ‘nature’s contributions to people’ (NCP) inform environmental frameworks that set out to include Indigenous and Local Knowledge systems (ILK) and worldviews in policy and planning processes. These frameworks aim to enhance biodiversity conservation and human well-being in a legitimate and effective way. In this article, we explore how the concept of People’s Contributions to Nature (PCN) is complementary to NCP. We use it to investigate challenges that planners and locals face in realizing the legitimate inclusion of diverse knowledges and worldviwes that account for people and ecosystems in a relational way. We introduce a case study where planners drew on ES and NCP and used participatory methods to implement a REDD+ policy in the Kaxinawá Nova Olinda Indigenous Land (Acre-Brazil). We find that both Kaxinawás and planners emphasize both NCP and PCN in their discourses. Nevertheless, differences between knowledge systems and disciplines, uneven power relations between Kaxinawás and planners, and an under-consideration of PCN by global frameworks challenge the legitimate inclusion of the Kaxinawá knowlege and worldviews to craft assessment and planning. We conclude that by explicitly addressing these challenges, science-policy interfaces can further advance knowledge legitimacy and policy effectiveness.

Homegardens as a Multi-functional Land-Use Strategy in Sri Lanka with Focus on Carbon Sequestration,"This paper explores the concept of homegardens and their potential functions as strategic elements in land-use planning, and adaptation and mitigation to climate change in Sri Lanka. The ancient and locally adapted agroforestry system of homegardens is presently estimated to occupy nearly 15 % of the land area in Sri Lanka and is described in the scientific literature to offer several ecosystem services to its users; such as climate regulation, protection against natural hazards, enhanced land productivity and biological diversity, increased crop diversity and food security for rural poor and hence reduced vulnerability to climate change. Our results, based on a limited sample size, indicate that the homegardens also store significant amount of carbon, with above ground biomass carbon stocks in dry zone homegardens (n = 8) ranging from 10 to 55 megagrams of carbon per hectare (Mg C ha(-1)) with a mean value of 35 Mg C ha(-1), whereas carbon stocks in wet zone homegardens (n = 4) range from 48 to 145 Mg C ha(-1) with a mean value of 87 Mg C ha(-1). This implies that homegardens may contain a significant fraction of the total above ground biomass carbon stock in the terrestrial system in Sri Lanka, and from our estimates its share has increased from almost one-sixth in 1992 to nearly one-fifth in 2010. In the light of current discussions on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), the concept of homegardens in Sri Lanka provides interesting aspects to the debate and future research in terms of forest definitions, setting reference levels, and general sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Circular Economy Challenges within the Road Freight Transport: Case Study of Portuguese Companies,"Nowadays, environmental concerns have significantly influenced business management and societal practices, leading to a strong focus on minimizing environmental damage and embracing sustainable development. This has prompted the adoption of greener supply chain practices and the transition towards a circular economy (CE). Companies are under pressure to incorporate green innovation practices, aiming for environmentally friendly and low-carbon development. This research aligns with the principles of the CE, an emerging economic model that emphasizes resource preservation and energy efficiency. CE is also recognized as a key driver for achieving sustainable development goals. However, the road freight transport sector, which is vital for goods transportation, faces challenges in becoming more sustainable due to its significant greenhouse gas emissions. This study analyzes the feasibility of achieving both environmental and financial sustainability in the road freight transport sector in Portugal. This piece of research aims to determine if combining these two concepts is practically viable and explores how transitioning to a circular economy can generate value and enhance environmental sustainability in the sector. Drawing upon the interview results, existing literature, and principles of the circular economy, an analysis was conducted to understand the current obstacles faced by companies in the sector and explore potential solutions. The main findings indicate that implementing the circular economy in the sector requires better technological advancements to ensure the use of fully renewable energy sources and facilitate the reuse of materials in vehicles. Additionally, it is crucial for all stakeholders to participate actively, as the transition to a circular economy is a structural change that necessitates collective efforts from everyone involved. © 2024 The Authors.

Changes in Croplands as a Result of Large Scale Mining and the Associated Impact on Food Security Studied Using Time-Series Landsat Images,"Geographic information systems and satellite remote sensing information are emerging technologies in land-cover change assessment. They now provide an opportunity to gain insights into land-cover change properties through the spatio-temporal data capture over several decades. The time series of Landsat images covering the 1985-2009 period is used here to explore the impacts of surface mining and reclamation, which constitute a dominant force in land-cover changes in the northwestern regions of the Czech Republic. Advanced quantification of the extent of mining activities is important for assessing how these land-cover changes affect ecosystem services such as croplands. The images employed from 1985, 1988, 1990, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 assist in mapping the extent of surface mines and mine reclamation for large surface mines in a few selected areas of interest. The image processing techniques are based on pixel-by-pixel calculation of the vegetation index, such as NDVI. The NDVI values are classified into the defined classes based on CORINE Land Cover 2000 data in a 3280 km(2) strip of Landsat images. This distribution of NDVI values is used to estimate the land-cover classes in the local areas of interest (184 km(2), 368 km(2), 737 km(2), and 1,474 km(2)). Thus, the approximate land-cover stability of the 3,280 km2 strip during the whole 1985-2009 period is used to explore land-cover disturbances in the local areas of surface mines. In the case of NDVI, it also includes variations, presumably caused by seasonal vegetation effects, and local meteorological conditions. However, the main trends related to mining activities during the long-term period can be clearly understood. As a result, other objectives can be explored in the 1985-2009 period, such as cropland changes to other land use classes, changes of cropland patterns, and their impacts on food security. The presented spatio-temporal modeling based on long time series from 12 satellite images provides considerable experience for processing NDVI in the framework of identification of land-cover classes and also, to a certain degree, cropland variability with its impact on food security.",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of sustainability goals on productivity growth: The moderating role of global warming,"The objective of this paper was to gain novel insights into the complex relationships among Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in shaping productivity (GDP/capita) growth. Using dynamic panel regressions on data collected in 138 countries between 2000 and 2017, we found that rising temperatures negatively affect growth and mitigate the impact of other SDGs on growth. We also found that CO2 emissions have a U-shaped relationship with growth; life expectancy negatively influences growth (positively moderated by rising temperatures), and food security positively impacts growth (negatively moderated by rising temperatures). This study highlights the difficulty of simultaneously implementing SDGs and elucidates novel research perspectives and policies to de-crease the negative impacts of climate change on socio-economic and environmental well-being. © 2021 by the authors.

Human management of ongoing evolutionary processes in agroecosystems,"Societal Impact Statement: Agricultural sustainability depends on the adaptation of crops to their local environment. Smallholder farmers who save seed provide an essential “evosystem” service by growing locally adapted seed varieties that can recruit biodiversity to enhance their growth and defense. While professional plant breeding has diverted evolutionary processes away from local adaptation, smallholder farmers, particularly those in centers of origin for crops, benefit society by selecting and propagating diverse crop varieties that allow local adaptation processes to perpetuate. Given that smallholders support society through the generation of evosystem services, changes in policy and practice are needed to support the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in ways that mitigate risk and recognize their important contributions to agricultural sustainability. To enhance the reach of this work, a Spanish language version of the paper is available in the Supporting Information (see Translation_ES). [Correction added on 18 June 2024, after first online publication: The preceding sentence has been added in this version.]. Summary: Long-term food security and agricultural sustainability depend on protecting the eco-evolutionary processes that select for local adaptation in crops. Since seed systems structure how people acquire seed, institutional and social changes influence evolutionary processes within agroecosystems. Since World War II, the rise of professional breeding has bifurcated seed systems into traditional and formal systems, which has negatively affected agrobiodiversity, crop evolution, and agricultural sustainability. In traditional seed systems, farmers often save seed from plants that best provide desired qualities, selecting landrace crop varieties to adapt to local environmental conditions. In formal or centralized seed systems, farmers buy seeds bred primarily for maximizing yield under ideal conditions. When farmers source seeds externally, evolutionary processes underlying local adaptation are disrupted. Here, we argue that traditional seed systems provide important evosystem services, or the evolutionary processes resulting from the maintenance and use of genetic diversity that benefit society. We present a framework on how seed systems influence the evolutionary processes that enable local adaptation, which is necessary for sustainable agriculture. We discuss how changes in human values underlying traditional and formal seed systems can alter evolutionary processes that underlie local adaptation. We conclude that developing policies that support people in managing ecological and evolutionary processes within seed systems is needed to address current and future challenges of global food security and agricultural sustainability. © 2024 The Author(s).

Predicting land use changes and ecosystem service impacts with CA-Markov and machine learning techniques,"Urban ecosystem services play a vital role in increasing resilience against environmental challenges, providing human well-being benefits, and conserving biodiversity within rapidly urbanizing areas. This study investigates land use and land cover (LULC) changes across three districts in Telangana -Medchal-Malkajgiri, Warangal, and Ranga Reddy-over the past several decades, specifically their effects on ecosystem service values (ESV). Utilizing the Benefit Transfer Methodology, we assessed the effects of urban expansion on ESV by measuring significant increases in built-up areas that have replaced natural landscapes. This transformation has resulted in decreased capacity to provide essential ecosystem services such as climate regulation, water quality regulation and biodiversit & Aring;y conservation. Water bodies emerged as key contributors to ecosystem services provision-emphasizing their significance for urban resilience. Medchal-Malkajgiri, Warangal and Ranga Reddy districts in Telangana are experiencing rapid urbanization as a result of Hyderabad's expansion and rapid infrastructure development. This transformation of agricultural lands into urbanized spaces threatens ecosystem services such as water resources and biodiversity while jeopardizing long-term environmental sustainability-this study evaluates these effects and offers essential insight for planning sustainable urban environments. Our results reveal a responsive relationship between ecosystem services (ESV) and land use change (LULC), such that changes to land use directly impact ecosystem service availability and quality. Our findings offer actionable insights to policymakers by emphasizing the necessity for urban planning strategies which prioritize ecosystem preservation alongside development to foster sustainable urban growth.",Not About Sufficiency
What defines ecosystem services-based approaches?,"2.1 INTRODUCTION It has long been held that human life depends on the existence of a finite natural resource base, and that nature contributes to the fulfilment of human needs (Malthus 1888; Meadows et al. 1972). This knowledge has led to different and evolving ways of understanding the relationship between humans and nature (Raymond et al. 2013). The notion of ecosystem services is one of these, which began to be developed in the late 1960s (King 1966; Helliwell 1969; Study of Critical Environmental Problems 1970; Odum and Odum 1972). How human needs and well-being interact with quantities and qualities of the finite natural resource base, and how changes to the natural environment impact on human activities and vice versa, are key questions underlying the conceptual development of ecosystem services and related concepts. In 2000, the Secretary-General of the United Nations called for a worldwide initiative, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, ‘to assess the consequences of ecosystem change for human wellbeing and the scientific basis for action needed to enhance the conservation and sustainable use of those systems’ (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2003). Ecosystem services were defined as ‘the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems’ and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment emphasised the need to incorporate the value of ecosystem services into decision-making to reverse increasing degradation of ecosystems. Since the publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in 2005, economic approaches to the understanding and management of natural resources based on the notion of ecosystem services have been increasingly discussed in the scientific literature (Fisher et al. 2009; Norgaard 2010; Ojea et al. 2012). The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment was followed by a number of other initiatives to assess ecosystem services, the most significant global assessment being The Economics of Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity (Kumar 2010). Other national-level assessments, for example, the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (2011; see Schaafsma et al., this book) and the Spanish Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (EME 2011) have also been published. © UNESCO 2015.

Introducing a typology of energy regions: A systematic literature review,"Low-carbon energy transitions are being increasingly developed at sub-national or regional levels, forming, thus, energy regions. More energy regions have been formed as energy systems become more decentralized, and national governments devolve decision-making power to local authorities. Energy regions have been studied in several countries, but no study has yet overviewed these regions' variety, transition process, and governance approach. It is important to draw lessons for other cases worldwide, like coal and carbon-intensive regions, to understand what type of regions and how they have stimulated their energy transition. Thus, this study investigated i) the concepts of energy regions that have been published and ii) the way energy regions have transitioned in terms of governance arrangements and innovation processes. A systematic literature review was conducted covering forty-seven academic publications and three grey literature reports of energy regions in ten countries. This review covered three academic (sub-)disciplines: i.e. sustainability transitions, regional studies, and innovation studies. Results show five concepts of energy regions: city-regions, peripheralized regions, coal and carbon-intensive regions, learning regions, and renewable energy regions. The formed typology shows the possible transition pathways that regions can follow. Interestingly, only those energy regions that adopted social innovations had the potential to empower their region, its organizations, and its citizens. Finally, recommendations for practitioners in similar regions worldwide are outlined to help overcome obstacles and advance their low-carbon transition. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
When cultural services and biodiversity matter most: Gaining a deeper insight into badlands ecosystem services preferences,"Most dryland ecosystems are characterised by a low ecosystem services (ES) provision, being socially perceived as lacking in cultural and regulating ES. This is the case of the badlands, highly eroded arid ecosystems without vegetation, which have been extensively analysed from a physical point of view, but hardly studied from the point of view of the benefits they provide to society. This paper aimed to determine the social preferences for and the relative importance of the ES provided by badlands. To achieve this objective, a representative sample of the population was taken from the Region of Murcia (Spain), a semiarid Mediterranean area with an abundant presence of these ecosystems. This study area is of additional interest for the provision of ES derived from agroecosystems. The contingent ranking method was used to identify aspects such as the utility provided by the different types of ES and the social well-being derived from different management policies to be implemented. The results show a preference of the population for cultural ES and biodiversity in the badlands. Given that the implementation of badlands ES protection and a management policy based on the maintenance of agricultural ES are the two strategies that yield the highest social well-being, the provisioning and regulating ES derived from agroecosystems in the area should be evaluated simultaneously, given the trade-off that can occur between the two ecosystems. These results provide dryland ecosystem managers with a view of soil erosion management that is different from the traditional one, since it promotes not only its control, but also a greater presence of educational and recreational activities. © 2022 The Authors.

Operation of a cyclonic preheater in the ca-looping for CO2 capture,"Calcium looping is an emerging technology for CO2 capture that makes use of the calcium oxide as a sorbent. One of its main issues is the significant energy consumption in the calciner, where the regeneration of the sorbent takes place. Nevertheless, as a high temperature looping technology, the surplus heat flows may be used to reduce the energy needs in this reactor. The addition of a cyclonic preheater similar to those used in the cement industry is proposed in this work. A calcium looping system was modeled and simulated to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the inclusion of a cyclonic preheater. Despite the negative effect on the maximum average capture capacity of the sorbent, a reduction on the coal and oxygen consumptions and on the extra CO2 generated in the calciner is obtained. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of global change on snakebite envenoming incidence up to 2050: a modelling assessment,"Background: Human activities are driving climate, land cover, and population change (global change), and shifting the baseline geographical distribution of snakebite. The interacting effects of global change on snakes and communities at risk of snakebite are poorly understood, limiting capacity to anticipate and manage future changes in snakebite risk. Methods: In this modelling study, we projected how global change will affect snakebite envenoming incidence in Sri Lanka, as a model system that has a high incidence of snakebite. We used the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenario analysis framework to integrate forecasts across the domains of: climate change (historical trend from WorldClim plus three underlying regional circulation models [RCMs] in the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment-South Asia repository, with two emissions pathways [representative concentration pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5]); land cover change (Dyna-CLUE model); and human population density change (based on Gridded Population of the World data) from Jan 1, 2010 to Dec 31, 2050. Forecasts were integrated under three different development scenarios: a sustainability pathway (SSP1 and no further emissions), a middle-of-the-road pathway (SSP2 and RCP4.5), and a fossil-fuelled pathway (SSP5 and RCP8.5). For SSP2 and SSP5, we nested three different RCMs (CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CCM3, and MPI-ESM-LR; mean averaged to represent consensus) to account for variability in climate predictions. Data were used as inputs to a mechanistic model that predicted snakebite envenoming incidence based on human–snake contact patterns. Findings: From 2010 to 2050, at the national level, envenoming incidence in Sri Lanka was projected to decrease by 12·0–23·0%, depending on the scenario. The rate of decrease in envenoming incidence was higher in SSP5-RCP8.5 than in SSP1 and SSP2-RCP4.5. Change in envenoming incidence was heterogenous across the country. In SSP1, incidence decreased in urban areas expected to have population growth, and with land cover changes towards anthropised classes. In SSP2-RCP4.5 and SSP5-RCP8.5, most areas were projected to have decreases in incidence (SSP5-RCP8.5 showing the largest area with incidence reductions), while areas such as the central highlands and the north of the country showed localised increases. In the model, decreases occurred with human population growth, land use change towards anthropised classes (potentially shifting occupational risk factors), and decreasing abundance of some snake species, potentially due to global warming and reduced climatic and habitat suitability, with displacement of some snake species. Interpretation: Snakebite envenoming incidence was projected to decrease overall in the coming decades in Sri Lanka, but with an apparent emerging conflict with sustainability objectives. Therefore, efforts to mitigate snakebite envenoming incidence will need to consider the potential impacts of sustainability interventions, particularly related to climate and land use change and in areas where increases in incidence are projected. In view of global change, neglected tropical diseases and public health issues related to biodiversity, such as snakebite, should be managed collaboratively by both environment and health stakeholders.

Implications of global environmental change for the burden of snakebite,"Snakebite envenoming is a set of intoxication diseases that disproportionately affect people of poor socioeconomic backgrounds in tropical countries. As it is highly dependent on the environment its burden is expected to shift spatially with global anthropogenic environmental (climate, land use) and demographic change. The mechanisms underlying the changes to snakebite epidemiology are related to factors of snakes and humans. The distribution and abundance of snakes are expected to change with global warming via their thermal tolerance, while rainfall may affect the timing of key activities like feeding and reproduction. Human population growth is the primary cause of land-use change, which may impact snakes at smaller spatial scales than climate via habitat and biodiversity loss (e.g. prey availability). Human populations, on the other hand, could experience novel patterns and morbidity of snakebite envenoming, both as a result of snake responses to environmental change and due to the development of agricultural adaptations to climate change, socioeconomic and cultural changes, development and availability of better antivenoms, personal protective equipment, and mechanization of agriculture that mediate risk of encounters with snakes and their outcomes. The likely global effects of environmental and demographic change are thus context-dependent and could encompass both increasing and or snakebite burden (incidence, number of cases or morbidity), exposing new populations to snakes in temperate areas due to “tropicalization”, or by land use change-induced snake biodiversity loss, respectively. Tackling global change requires drastic measures to ensure large-scale ecosystem functionality. However, as ecosystems represent the main source of venomous snakes their conservation should be accompanied by comprehensive public health campaigns. The challenges associated with the joint efforts of biodiversity conservation and public health professionals should be considered in the global sustainability agenda in a wider context that applies to neglected tropical and zoonotic and emerging diseases. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Fair ways to share benefits from community forests? How commodification is associated with reduced preference for equality and poverty alleviation,"This research is concerned with the trend towards commodification of forestry, in the context of community forest governance for sustainable development in the tropics. In these contexts, commodification takes different forms, including sales of certified timbers and sales of carbon credits. In addition to the general aim to enhance income, these market-based forestry interventions typically aim to align with sustainable development agendas, including (a) safeguarding ecological integrity and (b) promoting poverty alleviation. Our concern here is that the process of forest commodification might lead to a shift in local norms of benefit-sharing, in ways that can hinder these key components of sustainable development goals. We report the results of a survey (N = 519) conducted across sites in Bolivia, China and Tanzania that shows that switching from non-monetary to monetary benefits is associated with changes in preferences for distributional fairness in ways that may be detrimental to the poor. In particular, we show that forest commodification is associated with a lower likelihood of selecting pro-poor or egalitarian approaches to benefit sharing and higher likelihood of selecting to distribute benefits in a way that rewards individual contributions or compensates losses.",Not About Sufficiency
A systematic quantitative review of coastal and marine cultural ecosystem services: Current status and future research,"Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are the non-material benefits obtained from ecosystems that contribute to human well-being. They are often under-represented in ecosystem services assessments due to difficulties identifying and valuing intangible attributes. This risks a lack of understanding and consideration of CES by decision-makers. A systematic review was done on coastal and marine CES to identify: geographic distribution of research; effective methods for assessing CES; specific habitats/ecosystems that supply CES; subcategories most frequently addressed; and knowledge gaps. Results revealed limited information exists about coastal and marine CES. There is a disparity in the global distribution of studies with little knowledge about CES in developing countries, as well as a disparity within developed countries; with most research undertaken in Europe and North America. There is a dearth of information on CES derived from specific coastal and marine habitats/ecosystems, reflecting a poor understanding of socio-ecological relationships and the different values people assign to these areas. There is a need to develop indicators with the capacity to measure and track changes in CES over time. Participatory approaches using qualitative methods were most effective in identifying CES; however, these lacked a deliberative element that would provide a comprehensive assessment of shared values in public areas. Overall, publications typically theorised about the usefulness of data on CES to inform and support decision makers, and more research is required on how qualitative data on CES can be represented for practical use by coastal and marine resource managers, and the value of these in the real world.

The need to respect nature and its limits challenges society and conservation science,"Increasing human population interacts with local and global environments to deplete biodiversity and resources humans depend on, thus challenging societal values centered on growth and relying on technology to mitigate environmental stress. Although the need to address the environmental crisis, central to conservation science, generated greener versions of the growth paradigm, we need fundamental shifts in values that ensure transition from a growthcentered society to one acknowledging biophysical limits and centered on human well-being and biodiversity conservation. We discuss the role conservation science can play in this transformation, which poses ethical challenges and obstacles. We analyze how conservation and economics can achieve better consonance, the extent to which technology should be part of the solution, and difficulties the ""new conservation science"" has generated. An expanded ambition for conservation science should reconcile day-today action within the current context with uncompromising, explicit advocacy for radical transitions in core attitudes and processes that govern our interactions with the biosphere. A widening of its focus to understand better the interconnectedness between human wellbeing and acknowledgment of the limits of an ecologically functional and diverse planet will need to integrate ecological and social sciences better. Although ecology can highlight limits to growth and consequences of ignoring them, social sciences are necessary to diagnose societal mechanisms at work, how to correct them, and potential drivers of social change.",Not About Sufficiency
Traditional uses of wild and tended plants in maintaining ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes of the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa,"Background: Many communities in developing countries rely on ecosystem services (ESs) associated with wild and cultivated plant species. Plant resources provide numerous ESs and goods that support human well-being and survival. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize wild and tended plant species, and also investigate how local communities in the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa perceive ESs associated with plant resources. Methods: The study was conducted in six local municipalities in the Eastern Cape Province, between March 2016 and September 2021. Data on socio-economic characteristics of the participants, useful plants harvested from the wild and managed in home gardens were documented by means of questionnaires, observation and guided field walks with 196 participants. The ESs were identified using a free listing technique. Results: A total of 163 plant species were recorded which provided 26 cultural, regulating and provisioning ESs. Provisioning ESs were the most cited with at least 25 plant species contributing towards generation of cash income, food, traditional and ethnoveterinary medicines. Important species recorded in this study with relative frequency of citation (RFC) values > 0.3 included Alepidea amatymbica, Allium cepa, Aloe ferox, Artemisia afra, Brassica oleracea, Capsicum annuum, Cucurbita moschata, Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Opuntia ficus-indica, Spinacia oleracea, Vachellia karroo and Zea mays. Conclusion: Results of this study highlight the importance of plant resources to the well-being of local communities in the Eastern Cape within the context of provision of essential direct and indirect ESs such as food, medicinal products, construction materials, fodder, regulating, supporting and cultural services. The ESs are the basis for subsistence livelihoods in rural areas, particularly in developing countries such as South Africa. Therefore, such body of knowledge can be used as baseline data for provision of local support for natural resource management initiatives in the province and other areas of the country. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Mapping forest condition in Europe: Methodological developments in support to forest biodiversity assessments,"Forest condition, biodiversity, and ecosystem services are strongly interlinked. The biodiversity levels depend to a large extent on the integrity, health, and vitality of forests at the same time as losses of forest biodiversity lead to decreased forest productivity and sustainability. Under this conceptual framework, this study presents a methodology for mapping forest condition at European scale supporting the attainment of the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Target 5 “the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced” and the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), as well as the EU forest strategy since the sustainable forest management is oriented to support the provision of forest services and to enhance the condition of biodiversity forests’ host. The work presents the developments of an operational indicator at European scale. This spatially explicit information on forest condition can be the baseline map with a 1 km resolution to monitor the state and changes of condition by exposition to pressures and threats. This condition indicator considers structural, functional, and compositional aspects of forest with relevance for health and vitality of species and habitats hosted by forest ecosystems. The methodology implemented used harmonized, published and open datasets. It provided confident results for the assessment of the condition within hemiboreal, temperate and alpine forests, showing the Carpathian, Dinaric Alps and Alps, among others, as hotspots with pre-dominantly good condition. The results were validated with data derived from the reporting for the EU Habitat Directive and explicit dataset on known primary forests in Europe. However, this method underestimated the forest condition in the Mediterranean and Boreal forest types due to data gaps, regional specific characteristics, and design limitations. This study illustrates an operational and transferable approach for addressing the assessment of ecosystem forest condition at European scale being considered as a support tool for European countries when mapping and assessing their national territory, as potential common approach to map forest ecosystems that allows for consistent aggregation and comparisons across scales. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Health care in rural areas: proposal of a new telemedicine program assisted from the reference health centers, for a sustainable digitization and its contribution to the carbon footprint reduction","Introduction: This paper studies and quantifies the environmental benefits of implementing a new telemedicine service for users of the public health system in a rural area of Alicante (Spain). The proposed telemedicine service is based on carrying out 20% of the follow-on consultations with a specialist virtually from the Reference Health Centres with the support of qualified staff. This way of providing medical care remotely will be a good transition to fully online medical services, especially for the elderly. The proposed model avoids the displacement of users to the Alcoy Hospital, reducing the distances to be travelled, which will be directly reflected in a reduction of the emission of pollutants (carbon footprint) generated by patients' vehicles. Methods: Data from the Alcoy Health Department were used for 2019, the last year of normal activity of the health centres before Covid-19. Using data from the Department's health management report and the emission factors of the vehicles, we calculated the distances, hours, litres of fuel saved, as well as the tonnes of CO2 equivalent, CO2, CH4 and N2O. Results: With the implementation of this type of telemedicine, journeys would be avoided, saving 447,279 km, 7,580 h and 38,019 L of fuel. The emission into the atmosphere of 79.26 metric tons of CO2, 74.5 kg of CH4 and 487.28 kg of N2O per year would be avoided. Conclusions: The implementation of this telemedicine service contributes to a high degree to: (a) increasing the environmental sustainability of the rural health sector thanks to the reduction of traffic emissions (saving 9% of pollutants compared to the current system), (b) decongesting the health system by reducing face-to-face visits to specialists, (c) increasing the quality of life of patients by avoiding road travel (d) promoting the digitalisation of the rural population. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Sanitary versus environmental policies: Fitting together two pieces of the puzzle of European vulture conservation,"Between 1996 and 2000 the appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy swiftly became one of the most serious public health and political crises concerning food safety ever experienced in the European Union (EU). Subsequent sanitary regulations led to profound changes in the management of livestock carcasses (i.e. the industrial destruction of around 80% of all animal carcasses), thereby threatening the last remaining healthy scavenger populations of the Old World and thus contradicting the long-term environmental policies of the EU.2. Several warning signs such as a decrease in breeding success, an apparent increase in mortality in young age classes of vultures and an increase in the number of cases of vultures attacking and killing cattle, as well as a halt in population growth, suggest that the decrease in the availability of food resources has had harmful effects on vulture populations.3. Between 2002 and 2005, a number of dispositions to the EU regulations (2003/322/CE 2005/830/CE) enabled conservation managers to adopt rapid solutions (i.e. the creation of vulture restaurants) aimed at satisfying the food requirements of vultures. However, these conservation measures may seriously modify habitat quality and have indirect detrimental effects on avian scavenger populations and communities.4. Synthesis and applications. Conservation managers and policy-makers need to balance the demands of public health protection and the long-term conservation of biodiversity. The regulations concerning carrion provisioning need to be more flexible and there needs to be greater compatibility between sanitary and environmental policies. We advocate policies that authorize the abandonment of livestock carcasses and favours populations of wild herbivores to help to maintain populations of avian scavengers. Conservation strategies should be incorporated into new European Commission regulations, which should be effective in 2011. © 2010 The Authors.

Land-use trade-offs between tree biodiversity and crop production in the Atlantic Forest,"Trade-offs in ecosystem services (ES) have received increasing attention because provisioning services often come at the expense of biodiversity loss. When land-use patterns are not maximally efficient relative to productivity, provisioning services, such as crop production, can often be increased without losing biodiversity. The Atlantic Forest (AF) encompasses dense, mixed, and seasonal forests and has high levels of endemism and anthropogenic threat. We examined trade-offs between biodiversity and crop production in the AF to provide insights into land-use management decisions. We developed a biodiversity metric that combines information on tree species richness, evolutionary distinctiveness, and rarity at the local level. We examined the extent to which the nature of ES trade-offs differ among the 3 forest types. We assessed how annual deforestation rates and land management practices affect biodiversity and agricultural revenues. Finally, we tested whether it is possible to achieve the same total regional revenue without reducing biodiversity by improving local management practices. The 3 forest types had similar patterns in ES trade-offs, although within mixed forest patterns differed. Biodiversity appeared to be more sensitive to land-use change than crop revenues. Certain crops yielded up to 10 times higher values in some sites. Enhanced crop productivity may increase revenues without reducing biodiversity. Our results showed that to enhance human well-being without further conversion of AF, maximizing crop productivity is needed. Increasing efficiency of management outcomes by maintaining higher biodiversity and increasing provisioning services depends on knowledge of forest type, the comparative advantage of planting crops in the best places, and preserving species in a balanced manner across forests. © 2018 Society for Conservation Biology",Not About Sufficiency
"Specialist by preference, generalist by need: availability of quality hosts drives parasite choice in a natural multihost–parasite system","Encountering suitable hosts is key for parasite success. A general assumption for disease transmission is that the contact of a parasite with a potential host is driven by the density or relative frequency of hosts. That assumption ignores the potential role of differential host attractiveness for parasites that can drive the encounter of hosts. It has been posited that hosts may be chosen by parasites as a function of their suitability, but the existing literature addressing that hypothesis is still very scarce. In a natural system involving a parasitic Philornis botfly and its multiple bird hosts, there are profound differences in host quality. The Great Kiskadee tolerates and does not invest in resisting the infection, which makes it an optimal host. Alternative hosts are frequently used, but whilst some of them may be good options, others are bad alternatives. Here we examined the host selection processes that drive parasite dynamics in this system with 8 years of data from a longitudinal study under natural conditions. We found that the use of an alternative host was not driven by its density or relative frequency, but instead selection of these hosts was strongly dependent on availability of more suitable hosts. When optimal hosts are plentiful, the parasite tends to ignore alternative ones. As broods of optimal hosts become limited, good alternative hosts are targeted. The parasite chooses bad alternative hosts only when better alternatives are not sufficiently available. These results add evidence from a natural system that some parasites choose their hosts as a function of their profitability, and show that host selection by this parasite is plastic and context-dependent. Such findings could have important implications for the epidemiology of some parasitic and vector-borne infections which should be considered when modelling and managing those diseases. The facultative host selection observed here can be of high relevance for public health, animal husbandry, and biodiversity conservation, because reductions in the richness of hosts might cause humans, domestic animals, or endangered species to become increasingly targeted by parasites that can drive the encounter of hosts. © 2021 Australian Society for Parasitology",Not About Sufficiency
Expanding the protected area network in Namibia: An institutional analysis,"Protected areas remain vital to global conservation efforts. To simultaneously improve biodiversity conservation and promote human well-being, protected areas cannot be considered separate from their surrounding landscapes. As such, protected areas and adjacent landscapes are increasingly being viewed as integrated. Planning for such multifunctional landscapes requires an understanding of the institutional context, since institutions serve as an interface between the social and ecological components of a system. Here, we assessed the institutional aspects (i.e. norms or rules-in-use) of including various land use practices around Etosha National Park in Namibia into an integrated conservation landscape. The present landscape provides several ecological benefits, including provisioning ecosystem services (pasturage and water) and cultural ecosystem services (hunting and tourism). Data on stakeholder perspectives and resource governance were obtained from semi-structured interviews conducted with park management, landowners, farmers and communal residents. We identified six distinct resource governance systems, each variably focused on ecosystem services and each guided by different institutions that shape stakeholder behavior. A broad repertoire of norms and shared strategies were found to be practiced in isolation from each other and constrained by land tenure. Expanding the protected area network requires integration of the different governance approaches and a landscape approach to management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Are agricultural commodity production systems at risk from local biodiversity loss?,"Compelling evidence for feedbacks between commodity crop production systems and local ecosystems has led to predictions that biodiversity loss could threaten food security. However, for this to happen agricultural production systems must both impact and depend on the same components of biodiversity. Here, we review the evidence for and against the simultaneous impacts and dependencies of eight important commodity crops on biodiversity. We evaluate the risk that pollination, pest control or biodiversity-mediated soil health maintenance services are at risk from local biodiversity loss. We find that for key species groups such as ants, bees and birds, the production of commodities including coffee, cocoa and soya bean is indeed likely to be at risk from local biodiversity loss. However, we also identify several combinations of commodity, ecosystem service and component of biodiversity that are unlikely to lead to reinforcing feedbacks and lose-lose outcomes for biodiversity and agriculture. Furthermore, there are significant gaps in the evidence both for and against a mutualism between biodiversity and agricultural commodity production, highlighting the need for more evaluation of the importance of specific biodiversity groups to agricultural systems globally.",Not About Sufficiency
Progress of in situ conservation and use of crop wild relatives for food security in a changing climate: a case of the underutilised Vigna Savi,"Crop wild relatives (CWRs) - wild plant taxa genetically closely related to domesticated plants - are considered an alternative pathway to solving global food insecurity in a changing climate. However, their potential contribution is undermined by fundamental knowledge gaps in taxa diversity, distributions, taxonomic affiliations, conservation strategies, and valuable traits. To address these gaps, we reviewed the literature on the progress made between 2000 and 2021 in support of in situ conservation and use of CWRs under the changing climate in five thematic areas focusing on the genus Vigna: (1) species diversity, global distribution, conservation status, gene pools, and importance of the genus; (2) CWR-in situ conservation-protected area debate; (3) cultivation and domestication of CWR populations; (4) adaptive response to drought stress; and (5) adaptive response to Striga stress. We report that 104 Vigna CWR species in five subgenera, Ceratotropis, Haydonia, Lasiosporon, Plectotropis, and Vigna, are distributed mostly in Africa and Asia. Nine species are domesticated while six are threatened. Vigna gene pools remain poorly understood. Many Vigna CWRs provide various ecosystem services for human and environmental health. Attention is increasing towards in situ conservation of CWRs, within and outside protected areas, and complemented by ex situ conservation approaches. Several Vigna CWR taxa exhibit good agronomic traits for potential cultivation and neo-domestication. Many taxa have demonstrated tolerance to drought stress and race-specific Striga resistance. We conclude that if effectively conserved and used, Vigna CWRs can contribute to sustainable and climate-resilient food systems, either as wild edible plants, new plants for neo-domestication or novel sources of genetic material for use in pre-breeding programmes to improve the resilience, quantity and quality of Vigna domesticates under the changing climate. This study could stimulate further research and policy change for effective CWR conservation and use for sustainable food security in a changing climate.",Not About Sufficiency
Animal Feed Production and Its Contribution to Sustainability of Livestock Systems: African Perspective,"The global demand increase for animal-source foods allows smallholder livestock farmers to improve food and nutrition security and their livelihoods. However, livestock production significantly contributes to global change with several negative environmental effects, including greenhouse gas emissions, high water consumption, acidification, air pollution, land degradation, and biodiversity loss. Therefore, the sustainable intensification of livestock production systems, such as improving the quality of feed, range and grazing land rehabilitation, and introduction of improved forages that deliver economic and ecosystem services without compromising the future integrity, health, and welfare of the environment and humans as a whole has become a critical global research priority. This study reviews the improved sustainable approaches to animal feed production to increase food security and reduce greenhouse gas emission forces in Africa. Therefore, in the transition to sustainable livestock production, there is a need for assessments related to appropriate strategies for sustainable intensification of livestock, such as improving the quality of feed, introducing improved forages, and improving herd genetics can reduce greenhouse gas emissions while strengthening livestock productivity; nutrition, and feeding system. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

"Soil is brown gold in the Emilia-Romagna region, Italy","Soil is a natural resource essential to human welfare by virtue of its numerous crucial functions. In the past, soil has been taken for granted because of its widespread, albeit finite, availability. However, now that world's population is projected to exceed ten billion before the end of this century, soil is increasingly perceived as a precious commodity. Consequently, soil is increasingly under pressure by rich private investors and governments within the poorest countries to satisfy appetites for food production and biofuel. A case study is used to explore the plausibility of soil being considered as 'brown gold'. Based on the comparison of land use maps, we estimated the value in terms of resource from raw material, carbon sink and virtual calories of the productive soil lost during the period 2003-2008 in the Emilia-Romagna Plain, one of the most productive areas of Italy. More than fifteen thousand hectares of cropland underwent land use change - in particular urbanization - over the 6-year period with an implied loss of crop production potential equivalent to the daily calorific requirement of more than 440,000 people. Taking into account that Italy is no longer self-sufficient in food production, such a loss appears to be strategically significant. Perhaps more importantly, urbanization and soil sealing has had negative ramifications on environmental sustainability, on both local and broad scales, with increased consumption of public funds. A logical framework of the socio-economic impact of land use change has been compiled and is presented as a possible example of a policy relevant approach to managing productive soils as a finite resource. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Willingness to pay for the ecological restoration of an inland freshwater shallow lake: case of Lake Malombe, Malawi","Lake Malombe is ranked among the most vulnerable inland freshwater shallow lakes in Malawi.

In line with the 2021-2030 United Nations' Declaration on massive upscaling of the ecosystems restoration effort, this study applied the contingent valuation method (CVM) and binary logistic regression model to determine the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for ecosystem restoration and the influencing factors. The aim was to integrate science into policy framework to achieve a sustainable flow of ecosystem services (ESs). Qualitative data were collected by employing focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and field observation. Quantitative data were collected using structured questionnaires covering 420 households. The results revealed that 56% of the respondents were willing to pay an average of US$28.42/household/year.

Fishmeal partial substitution within aquafeed formulations: life cycle assessment of four alternative protein sources,"Purpose: Fed aquaculture has long been based on fishmeal (FM) as the main protein source for carnivorous species, but when its demand and price began increasing, both researchers and the industry started to search for alternative protein sources to meet the challenge of securing aquafeed. Consequently, this study has recourse to life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to identify any critical points and improvement strategies in the current production of four partial substitutes for FM namely dried microalgae biomass from Tetraselmis suecica (DMB_TETRA) and Tisochrysis lutea (DMB_TISO); insect meal (IM) from Hermetia illucens larvae; and poultry by-product meal (PBM). Methods: System boundaries are from the cradle to the mill gate, thus including the production phase (and the related upstream activities) and the subsequent biomass processing into unpackaged dried meal. One tonne of protein content was chosen as functional unit. The inventory was based on foreground data provided by the industry and complemented by background data sourced from the Ecoinvent v 3.4 and Agribalyse® v 1.3 LCI databases. The environmental effects were assessed considering five impacts namely global warming (kg CO2 eq.), acidification (kg SO2 eq.) and eutrophication (kg PO43− eq.) estimated via the CML-IA method, plus cumulative energy use (MJ) and water use (m3 m−2 month−1). Two alternative scenarios per production chain were considered in order to increase the robustness of the results. Results and discussion: The performance-based ranking indicated the PBM and IM scenarios as the most sustainable options. Both microalgal systems scored the worst performances in four impacts out of five, with eutrophication impact as the only exception. The nutrients provided to poultry and insects (i.e. the feed) as well as to microalgae (the carbon source and the fertilizers) were the main contributors to impacts, together with energy consumption. Despite being cultivated with identical technologies, the two microalgae showed different performances due to their different annual yields and to different consumable goods, water and energy consumptions. Conclusions: The results provided a ranking of these four partial FM substitutes and allowed to make useful considerations on how to improve their environmental sustainability. To this regard, the impacts of IM and DMB production could be reduced by improving nutrient efficiency and reducing energy needs. On the other hand, PBM production is already optimized and is not expected to change substantially in the future years. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Biodiversity and Climate Extremes: Known Interactions and Research Gaps,"Climate extremes are on the rise. Impacts of extreme climate and weather events on ecosystem services and ultimately human well-being can be partially attenuated by the organismic, structural, and functional diversity of the affected land surface. However, the ongoing transformation of terrestrial ecosystems through intensified exploitation and management may put this buffering capacity at risk. Here, we summarize the evidence that reductions in biodiversity can destabilize the functioning of ecosystems facing climate extremes. We then explore if impaired ecosystem functioning could, in turn, exacerbate climate extremes. We argue that only a comprehensive approach, incorporating both ecological and hydrometeorological perspectives, enables us to understand and predict the entire feedback system between altered biodiversity and climate extremes. This ambition, however, requires a reformulation of current research priorities to emphasize the bidirectional effects that link ecology and atmospheric processes. © 2024.

A life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) of oxymethylene ether as a diesel additive produced from forest biomass,"Purpose: Due to efforts to reduce dependence on limited fossil energy reserves and increasing GHG emissions related to fossil fuel extraction and use in transportation vehicles, renewable fuel use is growing rapidly. By adding renewable oxygenated fuel additives such as oxymethylene ether (OME) to conventional diesel, combustion GHG emissions can be reduced significantly without modifications to vehicle engines. However, life cycle sustainability assessments (LCSA) of OME production and its use with diesel are scarce. The objective of this paper is to develop an LCSA model of OME production from forest biomass to be used in vehicles as a diesel additive. Methods: This study conducts an LCSA of OME production from two types of forest biomass as feedstock, whole tree and forest residue. A framework was developed to assess environmental, economic, and social impacts of unit operations along the life cycle for a functional unit of 1 MJ of heat produced from OME. Then, PROMITHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment and Evaluation) was used to rank and select the best sustainable pathway for OME production and the most sustainable OME-diesel blend based on a number of indicators. Results and discussion: Based on the sustainability assessments results, the forest residue pathway is found to be more sustainable than the whole tree pathway. In addition, the environmental, economic, and social impact results for different OME-diesel blends show that a blend of 10% OME in 90% diesel is the most sustainable fuel mix. Assuming that the GHG emissions from biofuel combustion are offset by CO2 sequestered during plant growth, the biomass production operation contributes the highest global GHG emissions in the OME life cycle; this is due to the high energy intensity of harvesting operations for both pathways (13 gCO2eq/MJ for whole tree and 7.13 gCO2eq/MJ for forest residue). OME production costs are higher for the whole tree (1.92 $/L) than the forest residue pathway (1.71 $/L). All the social indicators (i.e., employment potential and employee wages and benefits) are more favorable in the forest residue pathway. Conclusions: We conducted sensitivity analyses by varying parameters such as sustainability impact weights, threshold values, and indicator impact values. We then determined the parameters’ impacts on overall ranking to verify the robustness of the model. This model can be used to assess and rank other energy technologies that integrate environmental, economic, and social sustainability impacts and thereby contribute to policy-making for the energy industry. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Is skewed income distribution good for environmental quality? A comparative analysis among selected BRICS countries,"A large number of studies have examined the linkage between income inequality and environmental quality at the individual country levels. This study attempts to examine the linkage between the two factors for the individual BRICS economies from a comparative perspective, which is scarce in the literature. It examines the selected countries (Brazil, India, China and South Africa) by endogenising the patterns of primary energy consumption (coal use and petroleum use), total primary energy consumption, economic growth, and urbanisation as key determining factors in CO2 emission function. The long-run results based on ARDL bounds testing revealed that income inequality leads to increase in CO2 emissions for Brazil, India and China, while the same factor leads to reduction in CO2 emissions for South Africa. However, it observes that while coal use increases CO2 emissions for India, China and South Africa, it has no effect for Brazil. In contrast, the use of petroleum products contributes to CO2 emissions in Brazil, while the use of the same surprisingly results in reduction of carbon emissions in South Africa, India and China. The findings suggest that given the significance of income inequality in environmental pollution, the policy makers in these emerging economies have to take into consideration the role of income inequality, while designing the energy policy to achieve environmental sustainability. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency

"Emerging and reemerging neglected tropical diseases: A review of key characteristics, Risk factors, And the policy and innovation environment","In global health, critical challenges have arisen from infectious diseases, including the emergence and reemergence of old and new infectious diseases. Emergence and reemergence are accelerated by rapid human development, including numerous changes in demographics, populations, and the environment. This has also led to zoonoses in the changing human-animal ecosystem, which are impacted by a growing globalized society where pathogens do not recognize geopolitical borders. Within this context, neglected tropical infectious diseases have historically lacked adequate attention in international public health efforts, leading to insufficient prevention and treatment options. This subset of 17 infectious tropical diseases disproportionately impacts the world’s poorest, represents a significant and underappreciated global disease burden, and is a major barrier to development efforts to alleviate poverty and improve human health. Neglected tropical diseases that are also categorized as emerging or reemerging infectious diseases are an even more serious threat and have not been adequately examined or discussed in terms of their unique risk characteristics. This review sets out to identify emerging and reemerging neglected tropical diseases and explore the policy and innovation environment that could hamper or enable control efforts. Through this examination, we hope to raise awareness and guide potential approaches to addressing this global health concern. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

Use of Single Large or Several Small Policies as Strategies to Manage People-Park Interactions,"Biodiversity conservation has been criticized for undermining or ignoring social well-being. Currently efforts to mutually promote social justice, rural development, and biodiversity conservation, which have been contentious and yielded mixed results, continue to spread despite a general dearth of effective management strategies. We contend that social and economic concerns should be integral to conservation planning and propose that the scale of these phenomena is also critical. To evaluate the merit of this proposal, we adopted and expanded a conservation management strategy framework developed by Joel Heinen and examined how population density, economic disparity, and ethnic heterogeneity vary spatially surrounding 2 contrasting protected areas in East Africa: Kibale National Park in Uganda and Tarangire National Park in Tanzania. Analyses of demographic, wealth, and ethnicity data from regional censuses and household surveys conducted in 2009 and 2010 indicated that choice of scale (landscape or community) changed the management strategies recommended by the model. Therefore, ""several small"" people-park management strategies varying around a given protected area may be more appropriate than a ""single large"" people-park strategy applied across an entire protected area. Correspondingly, scale adjusted Heinen recommendations offered new strategies for effective conservation management within these human landscapes not incorporated in current in situ management plans. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the potential for seaweed cultivation in EU seas through an integrated modelling approach,"The potential of large-scale seaweed cultivation to contribute to achieving ambitious EU-wide objectives, such as food security, energy independence, carbon neutrality and ecosystems restoration, is widely recognized. However, there is a lack of information on the suitability of EU marine regions for the installation of floating macro-algae cultivation infrastructures. In this study, we utilize the World Offshore Macro Algae Production Potential (WOMAPP) model in conjunction with state-of-the-art coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models, to assess the environmental suitability of EU marine regions for seaweed cultivation. Our analysis reveals that the EU Atlantic regions are the most suitable areas for seaweed cultivation, particularly for cold-water and intermediate-water species. The potential cultivation area is extensive, spanning over 1 million km2, and even taking a precautionary approach by occupying only 1% of that area could yield a yearly production of over 30 million tonnes dry weight. Adding logistical constraints (water depth and distance to coast) further limit the potential production to 5 million tonnes per year, only considering EU member states' waters. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunity to use integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), to increase the potential for seaweed cultivation. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
A Comparison of Mangrove Forest Structure and Ecosystem Services in Maputo Bay (Eastern Africa) and Príncipe Island (Western Africa),"Mangroves are critical to maintaining human well-being and global biodiversity. Eastern and western African shores present major environmental contrasts that reflect on mangrove forests’ structure and the ecosystem services they provide to human communities. This study compares the mangrove forest structure and condition, ecosystem services, and uses of resources in Maputo Bay (Mozambique in eastern Africa) and Príncipe Island (São Tomé and Príncipe in western Africa). Five mangrove species were identified in Maputo Bay, Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora mucronata, and Xylocarpus granatum, and the importance value index was higher for A. marina. Mangroves in Príncipe were exclusively dominated by Rhizophora harrisonii. In Maputo Bay, a weak regeneration characterized by a low quantity of seedlings was observed, although in Príncipe the sites were characterized by a low regeneration rate but well-established forests. The comparison of the mangrove structure between Maputo Bay and Príncipe Island presented statistically significant differences for mean DBH and height, whereas the trees in Príncipe presented higher values for both parameters. Strong human disturbance (through cutting) was identified in almost all sites in Maputo Bay but was rarely observed on Príncipe Island. In Maputo Bay, more than 90% of the coastal human community is involved in activities related to the surrounding mangroves, with a diversified exploitation of forest resources. On Príncipe Island, the exploitation of mangroves targets only tannin from the mangrove bark to dye fishing nets and small boats. The economic value of mangroves in Maputo Bay has subsistence and commercial importance, in contrast to Príncipe, which revealed no major economic value to the community. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Embedding biodiversity and ecosystem services in corporate sustainability: A strategy to enable Sustainable Development Goals,"The Sustainable Development Goals are a powerful lever to mainstream sustainability priorities in business' strategies and operations. At the same time, a new corporate sustainability based on a strategic understanding and management of biodiversity and ecosystem services is key to enact the new agenda for development. With the aim to better understand how businesses can operationalize the Agenda 2030, authors adopt a transdisciplinary approach and carry out an analysis of selected Italian business practices focused on biodiversity and ecosystem services management. Through a content analysis method and with the contribution of practitioners and experts, the main impacts of the practices have then been reconciled with the new framework for development. Finally, from primary data collected and further supported by semistructured interviews with company representatives (sustainability and environmental departments), authors propose a conceptual model that connects strategic biodiversity and ecosystem services management, its drivers and barriers, with the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Different Land-Use Systems: A Case Study of CO2 in the Southern Zone of Ghana,"The emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) results in global warming and climate change. The extent to which developing countries contribute to GHG emissions is not well known. This study reports findings on the effects of different land-use systems on GHG emissions (CO2 in this case) from two locations in the southern zone of Ghana, West Africa. Site one (located at Kpong) contained a heavy clay soil while site two (located at Legon) contained a light-textured sandy soil. Land-use systems include cattle kraals, natural forests, cultivated maize fields, and rice paddy fields at site one, and natural forest, woodlots, and cultivated soya bean fields at site two. CO2 emissions were measured using the gas entrapment method (PVC chambers). Trapping solutions were changed every 12-48 h and measurement lasted 9 to 15 days depending on the site. We found that, for the same land-use, CO2 emissions were higher on the clay soil (Kpong) than the sandy soil (Legon). In the clay soil environment, the highest average CO2 emission was observed from the cattle kraal (256.7 mg·m-2·h-1), followed by the forest (146.0 mg·m-2·h-1) and rice paddy (140.6 mg·m-2·h-1) field. The lowest average emission was observed for maize cropped land (112.0 mg·m-2·h-1). In the sandy soil environment, the highest average CO2 emission was observed from soya cropped land (52.5 mg·m-2·h-1), followed by the forest (47.4 mg·m-2·h-1) and woodlot (33.7 mg·m-2·h-1). Several factors influenced CO2 emissions from the different land-use systems. These include the inherent properties of the soils such as texture, temperature, and moisture content, which influenced CO2 production through their effect on soil microbial activity and root respiration. Practices that reduce CO2 emissions are likely to promote carbon sequestration, which will consequently maintain or increase crop productivity and thereby improve global or regional food security. © 2018 Dilys Sefakor MacCarthy et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Dots Prepared via Microchannel Method for Visual Detection of Copper Ions,"Copper ions (Cu2+) play a crucial role in biological processes; however, excessive intake can result in severe health problems. Current methods for detecting copper ions are both expensive and complex. Therefore, there is a need for efficient and straightforward visual detection methods. In this study, novel nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) were synthesized via a microchannel method using diethylenetriamine and citric acid as precursors and were characterized by TEM, XRD, and IR, among others. The N-CDs demonstrated high selectivity and strong fluorescence, showing a linear quenching response to copper ions with a detection limit of 46 nM, whereas other common metal ions, such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, exhibited negligible interference even at higher concentrations. These N-CDs were subsequently applied to test paper, allowing for on-site visual and quantitative detection of copper ions via a colorimetric method. This approach provides a novel solution for the rapid detection of copper ions, with significant potential in environmental monitoring, public health, and industrial applications. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Understanding how digital infrastructure construction could promote sustainable development,"Progress made in environmental protection may negatively affect regional socioeconomic development, reducing or impairing the ability of local economic systems to defend against external shocks, culminating in weakened economic resilience. Implementing carbon abatement programs without risking economic resilience is therefore an urgent problem for the international community, especially for its emerging national economies. Digital infrastructure construction (DIC), as a driving force of technological progress and structural transformation, may offer a viable solution to that problem. Here, we used county-level data for China, the biggest emerging economy in the world, to investigate whether and how Smart City Pilot policy (SCP, a policy close to DIC) has lowered regional carbon emissions and influenced economic resilience. We find that the SCP could significantly promote carbon abatement goals, and this result is robust under several tests. Further, chain-based mediating effect analysis revealed that the SCP's beneficial impact could have arisen by first promoting innovation and then productivity, and public concern acting as a stressor that pressures officials to engage in environmental governance. Furthermore, our results show the SCP is capable of bolstering regional economic resilience, and could even offset or negate the adverse effects of strict environmental regulation on that resilience. However, the positive effects of the SCP on carbon abatement in China's developed counties, or ones located in a resources-based city, were not significant. Altogether, our empirical results highlight how DIC can serve as a way to help achieve sustainable development, but more studies on its contributing role are clearly needed. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Synergy and Co-benefits of Reducing CO2 and Air Pollutants Emissions by Using Waste Heat Recovery in China’s Refineries,"The Refineries in China face pressing local air pollution and CO2 control issues. This study explores the solution of synergistic reduction of atmospheric pollutants and carbon dioxide in the context of the Chinese petrochemical enterprises. Specifically, we present an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power generation method to reuse the low-temperature residual heat from the Aromatics Complex units, which typically accounts for the highest proportion of waste heat resources in refineries. The results show that the refineries’ massive waste heat will generate remarkable mutual interest, through re-utilization, the NOx, SO2, PM10, and carbon emissions reduced by 1632 t, 3264 t, 29596 t and 104455 t, respectively. Our research findings provide a potential solution for Chinese refineries and other energy companies with the same demand to co-control of air pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions in the future. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
New perspectives on temperate inland wetlands as natural climate solutions under different CO2-equivalent metrics,"There is debate about the use of wetlands as natural climate solutions due to their ability to act as a “double-edged sword” with respect to climate impacts by both sequestering CO2 while emitting CH4. Here, we used a process-based greenhouse gas (GHG) perturbation model to simulate wetland radiative forcing and temperature change associated with wetland state conversion over 500 years based on empirical carbon flux measurements, and CO2-equivalent (CO2-e.q.) metrics to assess the net flux of GHGs from wetlands on a comparable basis. Three CO2-e.q. metrics were used to describe the relative radiative impact of CO2 and CH4—the conventional global warming potential (GWP) that looks at pulse GHG emissions over a fixed timeframe, the sustained-flux GWP (SGWP) that looks at sustained GHG emissions over a fixed timeframe, and GWP* that explicitly accounts for changes in the radiative forcing of CH4 over time (initially more potent but then diminishing after about a decade)—against model-derived mean temperature profiles. GWP* most closely estimated the mean temperature profiles associated with net wetland GHG emissions. Using the GWP*, intact wetlands serve as net CO2-e.q. carbon sinks and deliver net cooling effects on the climate. Prioritizing the conservation of intact wetlands is a cost-effective approach with immediate climate benefits that align with the Paris Agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change timeline of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Restoration of wetlands also has immediate climate benefits (reduced warming), but with the majority of climate benefits (cooling) occurring over longer timescales, making it an effective short and long-term natural climate solution with additional co-benefits. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Terrain gradient variations in ecosystem services of different vegetation types in mountainous regions: Vegetation resource conservation and sustainable development,"Natural vegetation plays a vital role in ecosystem services, while anthropogenic land-use change causes extensive damage to natural vegetation, decreasing ecosystem services, and impacting human well-being. Therefore, it is of great significance to establish protected areas and implement vegetation protection measures. Ecosystem services depend on the vegetation type and terrain, but this topic has not been considered in detail in policy implementations. In this study, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model was used to evaluate water yield, carbon storage, soil conservation, and water purification in the Chuan-Dian ecological shelter. Statistical methods were applied to analyze the differences in ecosystem services of different vegetation types and determine spatial variations in ecosystem services along terrain (altitude, slope, landform relief, and terrain niche) gradients. The results showed that ecosystem services differed for different vegetation types, and natural forests provided higher ecosystem services than other vegetation types, except for water yield. The rational allocation of forests, shrubs, and grasses and the implementation of organic agriculture and agroforestry systems are important measures to ensure sustainable economic and ecological development. We used the ordered weighted average method to select priority conservation areas based on ecosystem services. The priority conservation areas can play an important role in vegetation management in mountainous regions.

Do protected areas matter? A systematic review of the social and ecological impacts of the establishment of protected areas,"There is growing interest in evaluating the effects of establishing protected areas (PAs). However, the mechanisms through which the establishment of PAs achieved significant positive effects remain unclear, and how different conservation mechanisms have achieved significant positive social and ecological benefits has also not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we systematically reviewed exemplary cases from Asia, Africa, and South America, using panel data to assess the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves and national parks. By surveying 629 literature samples reported in 31 studies, we found that the establishment of PAs has positive influences on poverty reduction, family incomes, household expenditure, employment, forest cover, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and a reduction in forest fragmentation. Furthermore, we analyzed the specific aspects that influence the publication of a paper in a high-impact journal. We found that publication is more likely when the research uses panel data, matching methods of data analysis, large samples, and plots or PAs as research units and has significant evaluation results. Our results suggest that future studies should use panel data and matching method analysis to assess the impacts of PAs from multiple perspectives and focus on the effectiveness of specific conservation mechanisms in achieving positive effects. © 2020 by the authors.

A partial least squares regression approach to analyze the ecological footprint of 123 nations,"The per capita ecological footprint (EF) is one of the most widely recognized measures of environmental sustainability. It tries to quantify the earth's biological capacity required to support human activity. This study first summarized the previous literature, and then presented the six factors which influenced the per capita EF, they are the nation's gross domestic product(GDP), urbanization independent of economic development, the distribution of income measured by the GINI coefficient, exports dependence as measured by the percentage of exports to total GDP, service intensity measured by the percentage of service to total GDP and their position in the core/periphery hierarchy of world system(WSP). Based on it, a new ecological footprint model based on partial least squares regression (PLSR) which is specifically designed to deal with multiple regression problems, especially for the number of observations is limited, missing data are numerous and the correlations between the predictor variables are high was conducted to predict the 13 nations' per capita EF used the 110 nations' data.

"Quantifying the potential triple benefits of photovoltaic energy development in reducing emissions, restoring ecological resource, and alleviating poverty in China","China has set ambitious carbon neutrality goals and is actively developing photovoltaic (PV) energy. The construction of PV stations could have impacts on the land surface and vegetation. This study employs multiple models and machine learning to simulate the impact of PV station construction on net primary productivity (NPP) and triple benefits: emission reduction, income increase, and ecosystem services (ES). Results reveal spatially varied NPP changes due to PV construction, with improvements concentrated in arid northwestern regions, covering 44.1 % of China's potential construction areas. Over 76 % of barren land PV installations enhance NPP, averaging 17.4 gC/m²/year increase. Northwest of China emerge as key areas for future PV development. By 2060, PV construction could yield emission reduction and carbon trading values of 757 billion yuan annually. Balancing suitability and ecological impacts in PV planning can achieve multi-benefits, including 42.5 billion yuan/year in ES value, while conserving land. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Tracking long-term population exposure risks to PM2.5 and ozone in urban agglomerations of China 2015–2021,"China has experienced severe air pollution in the past decade, especially PM2.5 and emerging ozone pollution recently. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed long-term population exposure risks to PM2.5 and ozone in urban agglomerations of China during 2015–2021 regarding two-stage clean-air actions based on the Ministry of Ecology and the Environment (MEE) air monitoring network. Overall, the ratio of the population living in the regions exceeding the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard (35 μg/m3) decreases by 29.9 % for PM2.5 from 2015 to 2021, driven by high proportions in the Middle Plain (MP, 42.3 %) and Lan-Xi (35.0 %) regions. However, this ratio almost remains unchanged for ozone and even increases by 1.5 % in the MP region. As expected, the improved air quality leads to 234.7 × 103 avoided premature mortality (ΔMort), mainly ascribed to the reduction in PM2.5 concentration. COVID-19 pandemic may influence the annual variation of PM2.5-related ΔMort as it affects the shape of the population exposure curve to become much steeper. Although all eleven urban agglomerations share stroke (43.6 %) and ischaemic heart disease (IHD, 30.1 %) as the two largest contributors to total ΔMort, cause-specific ΔMort is highly regional heterogeneous, in which ozone-related ΔMort is significantly higher (21 %) in the Tibet region than other urban agglomeration. Despite ozone-related ΔMort being one order of magnitude lower than PM2.5-related ΔMort from 2015 to 2021, ozone-related ΔMort is predicted to increase in major urban agglomerations initially along with a continuous decline for PM2.5-related ΔMort from 2020 to 2060, highlighting the importance of ozone control.

Linking regional sustainable development goals with ecosystem services to identify ecological security patterns,"Ecological security patterns (ESPs) have become an important spatial approach to alleviate the contradiction between ecological protection and economic development. The identification of ecological sources is the primary part of studying ESPs, and methods based on ecosystem services (ESs) have been widely used. However, the current method of simply overlaying ESs for ecological source identification has difficulty supporting different regional decision-making needs of the target. Taking the West Liaohe River basin in China as an example, this study aims at developing four regional sustainable development goals (RSDGs) of carbon neutrality, water security, soil security, and biodiversity protection. Six ESs, including net primary production (NPP), water retention (WR), water purification (WP), soil conservation (SC), soil loss by wind (SL), and habitat quality (HQ), in the West Liaohe River basin from 2010 to 2020 were evaluated. Based on the current mainstream research paradigm of 'source identification-resistance surface construction-corridor extraction-safety pattern identification', combined RSDGs and ESs, the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model was used to identify the West Liaohe River basin development goals. The pattern of ecological security was discussed, and the identification, optimization, and construction plan of the regional comprehensive ESP were discussed in combination with the actual situation of the region. The study found that simply overlaying ESs to identify ecological sources leads to the neglect of some areas that provide key ESs, and it is difficult to directly support regional ecological protection decisions under different objectives, while a multiobjective-oriented comprehensive ecological security pattern helps to promote ESs and their relationships. The research results will help to improve the understanding of the ESP and provide a basis for the ecological protection and restoration of the basin and the optimization of the spatial structure to promote the sustainable development of the 'social-economic-ecological' complex system in the West Liaohe River basin.",Not About Sufficiency
"Plant-based diets: Considerations for environmental impact, protein quality, and exercise performance","Plant-based diets provide well-established physical and environmental health benefits. These benefits stem in part from the degree of restriction of animal-derived foods. Historically, meat and other animal-derived proteins have been viewed as an integral component of athletes’ diets, leading some to question the adequacy of vegetarian or vegan diets for supporting athletic performance. The purpose of this review is to examine the impact of plant-based diets on human physical health, environmental sustainability, and exercise performance capacity. Based on currently available literature, it is unlikely that plant-based diets provide advantages, but do not suffer from disadvantages, compared to omnivorous diets for strength, anaerobic, or aerobic exercise performance. However, plant-based diets typically reduce the risk of developing numerous chronic diseases over the lifespan and require fewer natural resources for production compared to meat-containing diets. As such, plant-based diets appear to be viable options for adequately supporting athletic performance while concurrently contributing to overall physical and environmental health. Given the sparse literature comparing omnivore, vegetarian, and vegan athletes, particularly at the elite level, further research is warranted to ascertain differences that might appear at the highest levels of training and athletic performance. © 2018 by the authors.

Plant biodiversity knowledge varies by gender in sustainable Amazonian agricultural systems called chacras,"Chacras, which are Amazonian agricultural systems, are examples of traditional agricultural management that are sustainable. They are also characteristic of the identities of different ethnographic groups in tropical America. However, information regarding the botanical characterization of chacras is scant. In tropical rural communities, there is a gender bias hypothesis that makes women potential reservoirs of traditional chacras plant knowledge. We present an experimental study in order to demonstrate if this knowledge difference really exists and to plan accordingly. We performed workshops in an isolated Kichwa community from Amazonian Ecuador. We calculated the cultural signififcance index (CSI) for 97 local flora plants. Our results revealed statistically significant differences. They were coherent with the Kichwa worldview and the structure of their society.

"Four Years of Promising Trap–Neuter–Return (TNR) in Córdoba, Spain: A Scalable Model for Urban Feline Management","Urban free-roaming cat populations (or community cats, according to the Spanish legislation) present complex challenges, including public health risks, coexistence conflicts with residents, animal welfare, and threats to biodiversity conservation. In 2020, Córdoba, Spain, initiated one of the most extensive citywide trap–neuter–return (TNR) programs, incorporating 225 groups of cats (usually named colonies) into a meticulously structured management framework. Over four years, the program stabilized cat populations, achieving 95% sterilization coverage and effectively limiting population growth despite external challenges, including abandonment, influxes from unmanaged areas, and compensatory effects. Although the overall population showed a modest decline of 2.68%, this outcome reflects not only the recent inclusion of numerous colonies still undergoing stabilization but also the prevention of an estimated 70% population growth without intervention, as projected by our population viability analysis (PVA). Key results highlight the program’s cost-effectiveness, with an average annual cost of EUR 0.62 per person. The long-term projections from a population viability analysis (PVA) using demographic modeling suggest a potential 55% population reduction by 2028, contingent on sustained efforts. The program’s integration of citizen science, systematic data collection, and adaptive management demonstrates its scalability and replicability as a model for urban and peri-urban feline management globally. Its significance lies not only in its scope and scale but also in demonstrating the ethical and practical feasibility of large-scale TNR initiatives in urban contexts. Córdoba’s program, which predates Spain’s Animal Welfare Law 7/2023 mandating structured feline colony management plans, demonstrates a pioneering framework for compliance and innovation in urban animal management. These findings underscore the critical role of sustained interventions, community collaboration, and legal frameworks in ensuring long-term success and addressing global challenges in urban animal welfare and biodiversity conservation. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Continuity and change in hunting behaviour among contemporary indigenous peoples,"Though subsistence hunting in tropical rainforests contributes to local food security and livelihoods, it also constitutes a major challenge to wildlife conservation. In this paper we examine different hunting practices of contemporary Tsimane', an Amazonian indigenous society native to Bolivia, and discuss their potential impact on wildlife. We also explore whether such different practices relate to greater integration into the national society and the market economy. Between 2009 and 2010, we conducted interviews with 344 Tsimane’ adult men from 40 villages to collect information on their 1) hunting engagement, success, effort, offtake and prey profile and 2) their individual level of integration into the national society and the market economy. Overall, 71% of the interviewed men engaged in subsistence hunting albeit using different practices and achieving different outcomes. We used hierarchical cluster analysis to classify hunters into four groups according to their engagement and success in hunting. Two large groups of hunters had a diversified prey profile and targeted resilient species, whereas the two remaining groups were smaller, displayed high levels of offtake and efficiency, and targeted mainly ungulates and primates. We argue that the potential impact of expert hunters on wildlife is higher because they target more vulnerable species. Our results also suggest that there are no clear pathways relating hunting strategies and individual levels of integration into the national society and the market economy. However, our study provides evidence of how rapid and increasing contact with mainstream society affects hunting and subsistence livelihoods of contemporary indigenous peoples, posing severe potential impacts on biodiversity conservation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Plastic wastes for carbon-based materials: Investigations on recent applications towards environmentally sustainable, carbon dioxide capture and green energy","The rapid growth in plastic production, coupled with inadequate waste management, has led to a significant accumulation of plastic waste in different environments. This raises substantial concerns about long-term ecological impacts, including bioaccumulation in organisms and potential risks to human health. This review focuses on plastic waste-derived carbon materials (PWCMs) and their role in promoting sustainable, eco-friendly energy solutions. The novelty of the study examines the current progress in converting plastic waste into carbon-based materials, with a particular emphasis on recent applications in environmentally sustainable practices, carbon dioxide capture, and green energy solutions. The growing interest in carbon-based materials is due to their unique characteristics, including high specific surface area, porosity, electronic conductivity, stable structure, and versatile surface chemistry. The utilization of PWCMs and their composites has shown promise in absorbing a wide range of contaminants. For organic pollutants, this includes dyes such as methylene blue and pharmaceuticals like antibiotics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). For inorganic contaminants, PWCMs effectively target heavy metals, i.e., cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic, as well as anions like nitrate and phosphate. Converting waste plastics into carbonaceous adsorbents holds excellent potential for removing up to 99% of toxic metal elements from wastewater. Furthermore, carbon capture through PWCMs provides an environmentally friendly and practical approach to closing the carbon loop, advancing carbon neutrality, and fostering a more sustainable future. Repurposing waste plastic for hydrogen production has significant potential to contribute to decarbonization efforts and accelerate achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). The findings also offer valuable insights into the advanced uses of PWCMs, encouraging future efforts in upcycling plastic waste for innovative and sustainable solutions. Yet, a comprehensive evaluation of PWCM applications and their limitations is needed to guide future research toward optimizing their synthesis for economic and environmental sustainability. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Application of the IoT in the Food Supply Chain─From the Perspective of Carbon Mitigation,"With the rising demands on supply chain transparency and food security, the rapid outspread of the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve logistical efficiency, and the rising penetration of sensor technology into daily life, the extensive integration of the IoT in the food sector is well anticipated. A perspective on potential life cycle trade-offs in regard to the type of integration is necessary. We conduct life cycle assessment (LCA) integrated with shelf life-food loss (SL-FL) models, showing an overall 5-fold leverage on carbon reduction, which is diet dependent and a function of income. Meat presents the highest leverage, 35 ± 11-times, owing to its high carbon footprint. Two-thirds (65%) of global sensors (1 billion) engaged in monitoring fruits and vegetables can mitigate less than 7% of the total reduced carbon emissions. Despite the expected carbon emission reductions, widespread adoption of the IoT faces multiple challenges such as high costs, difficulties in social acceptance, and regional variability in technological development. Furthermore, changes in the distribution of transportation resources and dealer service models, requirements regarding the accuracy of sensor data analysis, efficient and persistent operation of devices, development of agricultural infrastructure, and farmer education and training have all increased uncertainty. Nonetheless, the research trend in smart sensors toward smaller chips and the potential integration of machine learning or blockchain as further steps make it possible to leverage these advantages to facilitate market penetration. These insights facilitate the future optimization of the application of IoT sensors for sustainability. © 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Aquatic alien animals in China: Their introduction, invasion and management","Globally, biological invasion is a threat to economy, biodiversity, and human health. Most of the alien species were mediated by human activity, which is true for aquatic invasion species as well. China has become the world's second largest economic entity and the world's first aquaculture and fisheries trade powers. A total of 544 alien invasive species, including 51 of 100 of the world's worst invasive alien species, have successfully invaded China and have caused great damage to ecological environment, economic development, and public health; ultimately caused by the increase of trade, tourism and logistics. To date, however, few systematic reviews existed to summarize the process, impact and management measures concerning invasive species, especially for aquatic non-native invasive species in China. Here in this chapter, we first reviewed the advance of aquatic animal invasion, including the definition of aquatic animal invasion and their unique presence in the world biological invasion. Secondly, we listed 31 main invasive and potential nuisance aquatic alien animal species, 221introduced species including 100 aquaculture animals and 121 ornamental fish, summarized the ecological impact, economic loss and invasion progress, and gave some examples with respect to ecologic destruction. Thirdly, taking apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata) and fish as examples, we comprehensively analyzed the management strategy, and the current prevention and control measures for invasive alien aquatic animals. Finally, we gave some suggestions about the future management and research topics of aquatic animal invasion. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Assessing the interaction of land cover/land use dynamics, climate extremes and food systems in Uganda","Rainfed agriculture is Uganda's mainstay across the different regions of its territory. Farmland area has been reported to increase despite agriculture's vulnerability to climate variations. This great interplay among land-use dynamics, climate extremes, and food systems is, however, understudied. The current research, therefore, explores this interaction at both national and regional scales for the period between 2001 and 2017. Following an approach that employs remote sensing datasets on Net Primary Productivity (NPP), land cover types, drought indices, and climate variables, i.e. precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration, impacts of climate extremes and land cover changes on food production have been analysed. Similarly, the performance of ten major crops in Uganda over the last 6 decades has been detected using the Regime Shift technique. Key findings, thereof, indicate that NPP in farmlands is sensitive to climate variability, and this sensitivity varies spatially among the regions. Forests and permanent wetlands have been massively changed into farmlands, hence, moving a step forward into offsetting food insecurity but a step backward in preserving ecosystem services, espcially mitigating climate change. Furthermore, the noticeable increase in the total production of the major crops in Uganda seems to be derived mainly by the increase in area harvested affirming the step towards food security. However, the influences, thereof, may aggravate climate change impacts especially through reversing carbon sinks into carbon sources. This reversal could impact the crop yields further. Contrastingly, results from some crops illustrate the potential to increase crop production without necessarily expanding the cropland area. Therefore, Uganda may, instead, consider exploiting the maximum yield potential of crops through, for instance, augmenting rainfed agriculture with irrigation and enforcing effective policies rather than expanding farmland area. These findings collectively contribute further to our understanding of the importance of policies that ensure food security but at the same time preserve a healthy environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Dataset of microscale atmospheric flow and pollutant concentration large-eddy simulations for varying mesoscale meteorological forcing in an idealized urban environment,"By 2050, two-thirds of the world's population will live in urban areas under climate change, exacerbating the environmental and public health risks associated with poor air quality and urban heat island effects. Assessing these risks requires the development of microscale meteorological models that quickly and accurately predict wind velocity and pollutant concentration with high resolution, as the heterogeneity of urban environments leads to complex wind patterns and strong pollutant concentration gradients. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has emerged as a powerful tool to address this challenge by providing obstacle-resolved flow and dispersion predictions. However, CFD models are very expensive and require intensive computing resources, which can hinder their systematic use in practical engineering applications. They are also subject to significant uncertainties, particularly those arising from the mesoscale meteorological forcing and the internal variability of the atmospheric boundary layer, some of which are aleatory and thereby irreducible. Given these issues, the construction of CFD datasets that account for uncertainty would be an interesting avenue of research for microscale atmospheric science. In this context, we present the PPMLES (Perturbed-Parameter ensemble of MUST Large-Eddy Simulations) dataset, which consists of 200 large-eddy simulations (LES) characterizing the complex interactions between the turbulent airflow, the tracer dispersion, and an idealized urban environment. These simulations reproduce the canonical MUST dispersion field campaign while perturbing the model's mesoscale meteorological forcing parameters. PPMLES includes time series at human height within the built environment to track wind velocity and pollutant release and dispersion over time. PPMLES also includes complete 3-D fields of first- and second-order temporal statistics of the wind velocity and pollutant concentration, with a sub-metric resolution. The uncertainty of the fields induced by the internal variability of the atmospheric boundary layer is also provided. The computation of PPMLES required significant resources, consuming 6 million CPU core hours, equivalent to the emission of approximately 10 tCO2eq of greenhouse gases. This significant computational effort and associated carbon footprint motivates the sharing of the data generated. The added value of the PPMLES dataset is twofold. First, the perturbed-parameter ensemble of LES enables to quantify and understand the effects of the mesoscale meteorological forcing and the internal variability of the atmospheric boundary layer, which has been identified as a major challenge in predicting atmospheric flow and pollutant dispersion in urban environments. Secondly, PPMLES reference data can be used to benchmark models of different levels of complexity, and to extract key information about the physical processes involved to inform more operational modeling approaches, for example through learning surrogate models. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying and valuing carbon flows and stores in coastal and shelf ecosystems in the UK,"Evidence shows that habitats with potential to mitigate against greenhouse gases emissions, by taking up and storing CO2, are being lost due to the effects of on-going human activities and climate change. The carbon storage by terrestrial habitats (e.g. tropical forests) and the role of coastal habitats (‘Blue Carbon’) as carbon storage sinks is well recognised. Offshore shelf sediments are also a manageable carbon store, covering ∼9% of global marine area, but not currently protected by international agreements to enable their conservation. Through a scenario analysis, we explore the economic value of the damage of human activities and climate change can inflict on UK marine habitats, including shelf sea sediments. In a scenario of increased human and climate pressures over a 25-year period, we estimate damage costs up to US$12.5 billion from carbon release linked to disturbance of coastal and shelf sea sediment carbon stores. It may be possible to manage socio-economic pressure to maintain sedimentary carbon storage, but the trade-offs with other global social welfare benefits such as food security will have to be taken into account. To develop effective incentive mechanisms to preserve these valuable coastal and marine ecosystems within a sustainability governance framework, robust evidence is required. © 2018",Not About Sufficiency
Field-scale modeling of tree-crop interactions: Challenges and development needs,"Agroforestry has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of its potential to reduce poverty, improve food security, reduce land degradation and mitigate climate change. However, progress in promoting agroforestry is held back because decision-makers lack reliable tools to accurately predict yields from tree-crop mixtures. Amongst the key challenges faced in developing such tools are the complexity of agroforestry, including interactions between various system components, and the large spatial domains and timescales over which trees and crops interact. A model that is flexible enough to simulate any agroforestry system globally should be able to address competition and complementarity above and below ground between trees and crops for light, water and nutrients. Most agroforestry practices produce multiple products including food, fiber and fuel, as well as income, shade and other ecosystem services, all of which need to be simulated for a comprehensive understanding of the overall system to emerge. Several agroforestry models and model families have been developed, including SCUAF, HyPAR, Hi-SAFE/Yield-SAFE and WaNuLCAS, but as of 2015 their use has remained limited for reasons including insufficient flexibility, restricted ability to simulate interactions, extensive parameterization needs or lack of model maintenance. An efficient approach to improving the flexibility and durability of agroforestry models is to integrate them into a well established modular crop modeling framework like APSIM. This framework currently focuses on field-scale crops and pastures, but has the capability to reuse or interoperate with existing models including tree, livestock and landscape models, it uses parameters that are intuitive and relatively easy to measure, and it allows scenario analysis that can include farm-scale economics. Various types of agroforestry systems are currently being promoted in many contexts, and the impacts of these innovations are often unclear. Rapid progress in reliable modeling of tree and crop performance for such systems is needed to ensure that agroforestry fulfills its potential to contribute to reducing poverty, improving food security and fostering sustainability.

Regenerative Design of Archaeological Sites: A Pedagogical Approach to Boost Environmental Sustainability and Social Engagement,"Sustainable pedagogical approaches and practices have changed during the years, generating a set of philosophical, theoretical, and scientific concepts. Inside them, regenerative design is a proactive method based on systemic frameworks and developmental processes for maintaining the integrity of natural ecosystems, also enhancing human life, environmental awareness, social equity, and economic sustainability through the support of codesign techniques. This approach is widely used in architectural design, both for existing and heritage buildings, to address negative impacts of global warming, climate change, urban sprawl, touristic pressure, and other contemporary challenging phenomena. Specific workflows for archaeological sites have been never proposed, despite the fact that these sites face problems and risks completely different from other cultural heritage settings (e.g., physical development, pollution, tourism pressure, vandalism, looting, inappropriate excavations or interventions, lack of maintenance, funding, and legislation). This study presents a multicriteria decision analysis workflow for preserving and regenerating archaeological sites in a sustainable way through a deep understanding of current problems, values, features, and risks at urban and building levels. This method is tested with a pedagogical experiment at the UNESCO Site of Casterseprio (Italy), to investigate the interaction between heritage, environmental, social, and economic dynamics as well as to define its feasibility, applicability, limitations, and opportunities for further developments. The didactic process is supported by a participatory program among the key players of the site (owners, heritage and public authorities, and local associations), to create strong public support and a shared vision of the sustainable regeneration of the area. Differences between traditional and regenerative design processes, key design principles, shared criteria, replicability, novelty, and limitations of the pedagogic approach are also identified. Key findings of the present study are: (i) students need clear and shared design workflows for supporting their design projects; (ii) “regenerative design” involves multilevel dynamic training methodologies that motivate and involve the student while also improving their consciousness; (iii) the cooperation and the involvement of the stakeholders is important to favor a human-centered approach based also on social and economic interactions; (iv) digital technologies are fundamental for quantifying the key performance indicators in each design stage; (v) “regenerative design” boosts long-term planning and financial self-sustainability of the intervention; and (vi) multicultural design teams producing more innovative design ideas. © 2023 by the author.",Not About Sufficiency
The right incentives enable ocean sustainability successes and provide hope for the future,"Healthy ocean ecosystems are needed to sustain people and livelihoods and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Using the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges: overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the behavior of different system components is critical for building robust, sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review reveals that altering incentives-either economic or social norms, or both-can achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between individual actors and emergent system properties were altered, triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In short, getting incentives right matters.",Not About Sufficiency
Toxicity and environmental aspects of surfactants,"As the single largest class of specialty chemicals, surfactants are consumed in huge quantities in our daily life and in many industrial areas. In the past, the attention was focused entirely on technical performance. However, starting from the 1970s and 80s, surfactant related environmental concerns have become the main driving force to upgrade surfactant production technology to make more benign or “greener” products. For this reason, environmental issues, dermatological effects, and oral toxicity are the main priorities when surfactants are considered for a specific purpose. In this paper, we present five cases to demonstrate how the surfactant industry tackles these challenges to mitigate the environmental and health effects associated with surfactant consumption. We also discuss the important role played by surfactants in a current carbon capture and storage (CCS) strategy to reduce the CO2 level in the atmosphere. Surfactant-based stable CO2 foam flooding is a well-established enhanced oil recovery technique. It has been considered to be an economically realistic procedure to sequester large amounts of CO2 in geological formations. © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.",Not About Sufficiency
"The effect of landscape composition, complexity, and heterogeneity on bird richness: a systematic review and meta-analysis on a global scale","Context: Birds, as indicators of biodiversity, are experiencing habitat reduction and loss due to landscape changes. Evidence is mounting that the response of bird richness to landscape patterns remains controversial on a global scale. In this study, we conducted a quantitative global synthesis to gain a comprehensive understanding of this relationship. Our findings contribute to the development of bird conservation strategies that align with the objectives of SDG15. Objective: Through a quantitative review, this study investigated the effects of landscape patterns on bird richness and analyzed the sources of heterogeneity in the results. Methods: A random-effects model was utilized to merge the impacts of landscape metrics on bird richness, and a meta-regression analysis was performed to investigate the origins of heterogeneity. Results: The review encompassed 101 articles from 51 countries worldwide. Field sampling emerged as the primary method for acquiring bird data, with multiple linear regression and generalized linear models as the main analytical approaches. The meta-analysis results highlighted landscape area as a crucial factor influencing bird richness. Regarding landscape composition, the proportions of forests, shrublands, and water bodies positively impacted bird richness, while agricultural land and urban land had negative effects. The relationship between landscape complexity and bird richness is influenced by factors, including net primary productivity (NPP) and precipitation. Landscape heterogeneity was identified as a contributing factor to increased species richness. Conclusion: Compared to landscape complexity, indicators of landscape composition and heterogeneity are more suitable as reference tools for bird conservation. The results of landscape complexity exhibit variation. Moreover, our findings underscore the crucial role of preserving forested areas in supporting bird diversity, emphasizing the necessity to account for regional variations when establishing forest cover thresholds. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

"Monitoring the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Habitat Quality and Its Driving Factors Based on the Coupled NDVI-InVEST Model: A Case Study from the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, China","Globally, mountains have suffered enormous biodiversity loss and habitat degradation due to climate change and human activities. As an agent of biodiversity, evaluating habitat quality (HQ) change is an indispensable key step for regional ecological security and human well-being enhancement, especially for fragile mountain ecosystems in arid areas. In this study, we aimed to propose an integrated framework coupled with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST)-HQ module to improve the effectiveness and accuracy of HQ estimation. We highlighted the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang as an example to validate the model, as it is a typical representative of mountain ecosystems in the temperate arid zone. Specifically, we aimed to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of HQ over the past two decades and investigate its influencing factors using a geographical detector model. The results show that, first, grassland and unused land were the main land-use types in the study area. The land-use transitions were mainly concentrated in grassland, woodland, water body, and unused land. Second, the total area of very important habitats and general habitats accounted for over 70% of the Tianshan Mountains. The average HQ decreased from 0.5044 to 0.4802 during 1995–2015. Third, the HQ exhibited significant spatial differentiation, and the Ili River Valley and Kaidu River Basin were the hot spots, while the south and east of the Tianshan Mountains were the cold spots. Habitat quality was strongly related to the terrain gradient, with an inverted “U” type. Protected areas of different categories played a vital role in biodiversity conservation. Finally, soil type, land-use change, precipitation, temperature, and grazing intensity were the dominant factors in response to HQ change for both the total Tianshan Mountains and sub-regions, followed by elevation, the relief degree of the land surface, gross domestic product, population density, and distance to tourism attractions. The interaction effects of the influencing factors were improved compared to the effects of the individual factors in each zone. Furthermore, these results provide decision-making criteria for formulating a scientific and systematic protection of ecology and restoration planning systems to enhance the capacity to address climate change. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Time Series Analysis of Policy Discourse on Green Consumption in China: Text Mining and Network Analysis,"Green consumption in China is a major promotion strategy for achieving sustainable development goals. It should be promoted from a long-term perspective based on cooperation from all levels of society. In addition, constantly revising the policy direction using policy discourse as feedback is necessary. This study analyzes policy discourse on green consumption in China from the long-term and time series perspectives. It employs text mining and network analysis by collecting Chinese online portal data on policy discourse over a period from 2000 to 2020. Using text mining, the study finds that green consumption develops through four stages, namely awareness, practice, diffusion, and social responsibility. From a long-term perspective, policymaking and the preparation of government guidelines take place during the awareness stage, the distribution of action plans and related guidelines from central to local governments takes place in the practice stage, and participation in green consumption in the different classes of society occurs in the diffusion stage. The conscious transition to green consumption by the government, the business sector, and the public can be found in the social responsibility stage. The results of the convergence of iterated correlation analysis reveal that policy discourse on green consumption initially transitions from a specific to a diversified topic. This means that, since there are many complex policy and social issues related to green consumption, it is necessary to select and focus on appropriate topics when setting policy directions. Lastly, core-periphery analysis indicates that growers related to global environmental issues, such as carbon neutrality and climate change, are leading green consumption in China. This confirms that green consumption is a key issue that the government and the public must practice to support the sustainable development of mankind, transcending constraints of time, space, class, and ideology. On the basis of its results, the study proposes a development strategy that can strike a balance between the universality and specificity of green consumption in China.",Not About Sufficiency
Existent nature reserves not optimal for water service provision and conservation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China,"Water ecosystem services dynamically connect human society and the biosphere across spatiotemporal scales to finally support socioeconomic development and human well-being. Water ecosystem services are usually abundant in the so-called water tower regions which comprise mainly the mountains and plateaus where many big rivers originate. However, these water tower regions are also ecologically vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Furthermore, the effectiveness of conservation management on water ecosystem services in these regions is still not so clear. We developed a biophysical-based composite water ecosystem service index (ESw) for quantifying and mapping the spatial patterns and temporal changes of water ecosystem services on a large regional scale. We apply this approach to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) in southwestern China, the world's largest and most highly protected water tower region. The results show that the areas with a high level of ESw as the priority areas for conservation account for 39.88% of the QTP with a spatially heterogeneous distribution among river basins and nature reserves. But these nature reserves accommodate only 22.52% of the priority areas with large conservation gaps in the river basins and at local scales. The nature reserves are effective in mitigating water ecosystem services degradation and facilitating their restoration. Therefore, the spatial optimization of nature conservation can be addressed for the sustainable management of the ecosystems and their water ecosystem services to support well-being of local and downstream societies. The assessment method formulated in this research is adaptable to other similar water tower regions.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem type and quality changes in Lhasa River Basin and their effects on ecosystem services,"Due to the impact of climate change and human activities, both the type and quality of ecosystems are changing in complex ways. As a result, ecosystem services and human well-being are profoundly affected. Nevertheless, how the ecosystem quality change affects ecosystem services is often neglected in previous studies. Compared with the dominant and obvious change in ecosystem types (or land cover types), the change of ecosystem quality is more subtle and continuous. However, the ecosystem quality change usually involves a much wider range, and may cause greater influence to the ecosystem resilience, function and services. Since Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is of great ecological importance and one of the most sensitive areas to climate change, it is desired to study the ongoing changes of the ecosystem and its services. Located at the south-east part of the Tibetan Plateau, Lhasa River Basin is the center of Tibet Autonomous Region in terms of economy, agriculture and demography. To reveal the recent ecosystem changes and the consequent service changes of Lhasa River Basin, especially the change in the ecosystem quality and its effects, we selected the growing season (from June to October) NDVI as the indicating factor of ecosystem quality to adjust the parameters of the InVEST model, and then assessed three ecosystem services (soil retention, seasonal water yield and carbon storage) from 1990 to 2015. The effects of the ecosystem type change and ecosystem quality change on ecosystem services, as well as their relative contributions, were then analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) from 1990 to 2015, the overall ecosystem type change was insignificant, and the change mainly occurred during the last 5 years. However, the area of artificial surfaces and wetland increased sharply by 82.65% and 32.40%, respectively. (2) The growing season NDVI of all vegetation types increased significantly between 1990 and 2000, and then slightly decreased afterwards. The growing season NDVI of meadow and grassland decreased by 7.48% and 5.44% respectively from 2000 to 2015, indicating an obvious degradation trend. (3) Overall, from 1990 to 2015, the ecosystem service changes caused by ecosystem type change were relatively small, while the ecosystem quality change had rather remarkable effects on the ecosystem services. From 1990 to 2000, the soil retention and carbon storage increased by 4.63% and 12.05% respectively, and the baseflow decreased by 22.14%; the contributions of ecosystem quality to these changes were 100.22%, 99.99% and -99.78% respectively. From 2000 to 2015, the soil retention, baseflow and carbon storage decreased by 0. 62%, 1. 17% and 2. 62%, respectively; the contributions of ecosystem quality to these changes were -89.28%, 40.21% and -126.12% respectively; the contributions of land cover change were -10.94%-140.26% and 27.44% respectively, indicating that the land cover change began to have greater effect on the ecosystem services after 2000. © 2018 Science Press.

Agent-Based Life Cycle Assessment enables joint economic-environmental analysis of policy to support agricultural biomass for biofuels,"Production of agricultural biofuels is expected to rise due to increasing climate change mitigation ambitions. Policy interventions promoting targeted bioenergy solutions can be motivated by the large environmental externalities present in agricultural systems and the local context of biomass production co-benefits. Introducing energy crops in crop rotations in arable land with depleted Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) levels offers the potential to increase SOC stocks and future crop yields as a step towards more sustainable agricultural systems. However, the environmental performance of a policy incentive for energy crops with SOC co-benefits is less evident when considering its land-use effects within and outside of the target agricultural system. We study the potential impacts of a change in agricultural policy on regional agricultural structure and production, and the environment with an Agent-Based Life Cycle Assessment approach. We simulate a policy payment that would achieve adoption of grass leys in crop rotations corresponding to 25 % of the highly productive land in an intensive farming region of southern Sweden. Although enhancing soil health in SOC-depleted farming regions is a desirable environmental objective, its significance is limited within the life-cycle performance of the payment. Instead, crop-displacement impacts and the grass potential as biofuel feedstock are the main drivers. The active utilisation of grasses for biofuel purposes is key in reaching a positive environmental evaluation of the policy instrument. Our environmental evaluation is likely generalisable to other regions with similar technological levels and farming intensity, while our analysis on structural shifts is specific to the policy instrument and agricultural production system under study. Overall, our work provides a method to contrast regional effects and global environmental impacts of policy instruments supporting agricultural biomass for biofuels prior to implementation. This contributes to the environmental assessment of land-based biofuels at a time when their sustainability is highly debated. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

Assessing the link between farming systems and biodiversity in agricultural landscapes: Insights from Galicia (Spain),"Agriculture is a major driver of change with manifold impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. As social-ecological systems, agricultural landscapes result from the intertwined interaction between farmers and nature, and contribute to several ecosystem services key to human well-being. The social-ecological outcomes of farmlands ultimately reflect the management practices of the dominant farming systems (FS) at the landscape level. However, data-driven research linking agricultural management and biodiversity is still scarce, a knowledge gap limiting our understanding on the impacts of different farming systems on biodiversity at the landscape level. This research contributes to fill this knowledge gap, by being among the few explicitly exploring the relationship between FS and patterns of biodiversity at the landscape level, using as illustrative case the region of Galicia, northwest Spain. Using data from agricultural policies paying agencies, and protected species and habitats data, the following research questions were pursued: (1) Can farm-level data be used to map and characterize different FS at the landscape-level? and, (2) Is the occurrence of specific FS linked with higher levels of biodiversity? Results allowed the identification and characterization of seven different FS distributed across Galicia, which dominance allowed to identify seven landscape types. Moreover, besides depicting the dominance of cattle-based farming systems in Galicia, results showed a gradient of management from the most intensive located in coastal lowlands (west) towards less intensive mountain areas (east). Such gradient of decreasing management intensity matched a gradient of increasing nature value of farmlands, reflected as higher habitat diversity and richness for some of the targeted taxonomic groups. To our knowledge, this research is among the few explicitly addressing the relationship between FS and biodiversity at the landscape level. By highlighting potential links (positive or negative) between specific landscape types and habitats and/or species richness across targeted taxonomic groups, these results constitute a preliminary assessment of the agricultural practices promoting species and habitat richness.

By highlighting potential links (positive or negative) between specific landscape types and habitats and/or species richness across targeted taxonomic groups, these results constitute a preliminary assessment of the agricultural practices promoting species and habitat richness. Further scrutinizing this assessment can support the identification of farm-level indicators that can be then translated into the design of policies (biodiversity or agriculture-related) fostering biodiversity at several scales of decision making.",Not About Sufficiency

Sharing Financial Benefits from Deep Seabed Mining: The Case for a Seabed Sustainability Fund,"As the prospect of commercial deep seabed mining comes closer to reality, the International Seabed Authority (ISA) has begun to turn its attention to the question of how to achieve equitable sharing of the benefits from such mining asmandated by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. One approach to equitable distribution is to develop a methodology for distribution of net financial benefits based on agreed rules or formulae. Under this scenario, ISA would collect the net financial benefits and transfer the monetary proceeds to a pool of qualified beneficiaries. However, there are inherent weaknesses to this approach. We propose, in line with similar suggestions by the Finance Committee of ISA, that an alternativeform of distribution could be a Seabed Sustainability Fund, similar to a sovereign wealth fund, administered by ISA. Such a fund would support and enhance knowledge about the deep-sea for the benefit of all humanity. In line with this, it is envisaged that the Fund could also support other global public goods that benefit all of humanity, such as adaptation or mitigation of climate change, advancing scientific knowledge of the ocean and deep-sea ecosystems, and ensuring biodiversity conservation. These are known to be underprovided and underfunded and could also benefit from funding sourced from and returned to all humanity. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Phygital workspace: a systematic review in developing a new typological work environment using XR technology to reduce the carbon footprint,"The urgency of environmental sustainability has catalyzed a thorough reconsideration of traditional workspaces and their environmental impact, particularly concerning carbon footprint stemming from business-related travel and daily commutes. In response to these concerns, the innovative notion of the “Phygital Workspace” has arisen. Moreover, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the proliferation of this technology. In a Phygital Workspace, physical and digital elements coexist and interact to enhance productivity, collaboration, and overall work experience. This integration is often facilitated using advanced digital technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR), and other immersive or interactive tools. This conceptual framework sets the stage for the seamless integration of both physical and digital dimensions, empowered by the potential of Extended Reality (XR) technology. An integral part of this review involves the analysis of various workspace scenarios, and further examines the role of a Phygital Workspace plays in reducing carbon footprint within each context. The scenarios under examination include flexible workspace scenarios, field work scenarios, and hybrid work scenarios. XR technology’s contributions to reducing carbon footprint are evaluated by minimizing the need for physical travel, enabling remote collaboration, and enhancing workspace efficiency within these scenarios. Employing a systematic review methodology, this review considers the status of XR technology adoption in diverse business environments, pinpointing its strengths and limitations. The aim is to provide a solid foundation for the framework of a new typological work environment that leverages XR technology to effectively reduce the carbon footprint associated with travel. The framework comprises four key dimensions: XR Infrastructure, Collaborative Work Environment, Social Interaction Enhancement, and Environmental Impact Assessment. These dimensions collectively guide the development and implementation of sustainable Phygital Workspaces, catering to technological, social, and ecological considerations. It is an impassioned call for collaborative efforts among researchers, policymakers, and organizations to converge their expertise for a more environmentally conscious future of work.

State of Knowledge on UK Agricultural Peatlands for Food Production and the Net Zero Transition,"Agricultural peatlands are the most productive soils in the UK for the cultivation of many food crops. Historical drainage of peat for agriculture (i.e., cropland and managed grassland), without consideration of other associated environmental and climatic impacts, has resulted in a significant emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). There is a need to reduce GHG emissions without compromising the rural economy and jeopardizing food security in the UK to a greater extent than is currently being experienced. In March 2023, in a bid to identify alternative land management systems for agricultural peatlands to support the UK's commitment to achieving net zero GHG emissions by 2050, a group of forty investigators met at a workshop convened by the AgriFood4NetZero Network+. The workshop reviewed the state of knowledge surrounding the Fens of Eastern England and their importance for food provision, the economy, cultural identity, and climate change mitigation. A broad consensus emerged for research into how GHG emissions from agricultural peatlands could be reduced, whether alternative farming methods, such as seasonal farming or paludiculture, would offer a solution, and how a localized approach for the Fens could be defined. The development of a holistic, inclusive, and plausible land use scenario that considers all aspects of ecosystem services provided by the Fens is urgently needed.",Not About Sufficiency
Mixed impacts of protected areas and a cash crop boom on human well-being in North-Eastern Madagascar,"Tropical forest frontier areas support the well-being of local populations in myriad ways. Not only do they provide the material basis for people's livelihoods, they also sustain socio-cultural foundations through relational values. They host some of the most biodiverse ecosystems and largest carbon stocks on the planet, and are thus a focus of global conservation efforts. They are also a prime location for the production of many global agricultural commodities. These dynamics-often intertwined-may trap local populations between powerful interests, with the potential to affect their well-being. We conducted 100 structured interviews in four biodiversity-rich landscapes of north-eastern Madagascar to investigate how multi-dimensional human well-being is affected by the recent establishment of protected areas and surge in cash crop prices. We asked households about their satisfaction-and changes in satisfaction-with locally relevant well-being components, mapping their answers through Nussbaum's Central Capabilities approach. We also investigated the cultural significance of key natural resources beyond the material benefits they provide. All issues were explored along four variables: site, main source of rice, gender and household land use portfolio. Our findings are as follows: first, human capabilities are interconnected and mutually interdependent, with relational values linking many of them. Second, subjective accounts of well-being are influenced by cognitive biases, such as treadmill effects, adaptive preferences and recency bias. Third, while households perceived a positive influence of protected areas, those most reliant on forest land and products held a more negative view of conservation interventions. And fourth, while households more engaged in commercial agriculture may be benefitting economically from the recent increase in cash crop prices, these very dynamics might be leading to trade-offs between capabilities. This is most notably so for the Bodily Health capability (e.g. greater spending on housing) and Affiliation and Bodily Integrity (i.e. worsening social relations and security). These insights highlight the importance of addressing the multiple dimensions of well-being when assessing the impacts of conservation and economic dynamics in forest frontier populations. Particular attention should be paid to the relational values ascribed to the natural resources the communities rely on.

Unveiling long-term indirect socio-economic and environmental effects of large-scale hydropower project,"Large hydropower projects (LHPs) can generate significant direct socio-economic and environmental (SEE) impacts, which may radiate and accumulate gradually through the supply/consumption chains over different development periods. Therefore, a dynamic hydroengineering equilibrium analysis (DHEA) model is developed in this study to comprehensively quantify the cumulative indirect SEE impacts of LHPs during their construction and long-term operation period. The proposed DHEA model will be applied initially to the Baihetan hydropower project (BHT), the second-largest LHP in the world, which recently commenced operation. The results indicate that the construction of BHT generates approximately 0.81 billion yuan in GDP annually for the YREB region through supply/consumption chains. Starting in 2023, the operation of BHT will have a long-term positive indirect impact on the YREB region, with significant cumulative effects over time. It is expected that by 2033, the cumulative contribution of BHT's construction and operation to the YREB's GDP will exceed the initial government investment in BHT (220 billion yuan). Additionally, during the operation periods, BHT will significantly reduce the YREB's energy input/consumption and trade/local embedded carbon emissions through supply/consumption chains. The developed DHEA approach is expected to highlight the multi-dimensional, multi-phase, and multi-sectoral indirect impacts of LHPs and contribute to evaluating the SEE effects of other LHPs worldwide. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Low-carbon transition and social equity: Will carbon trading mechanism lead to an unequal carbon burden among households?,"The carbon emission trading (CET) has become an effective policy tool for global carbon emission reduction, and it is also very important to pay attention to its carbon burden and impact on equity. This paper firstly based on the traditional non-competitive input-output price model, measured the product price changes in the production sector when CET only covers the power industry (Scenario I) and covers seven high energy consumption industries (Scenario II). Then, combined with micro household consumption data, we studied the unequal carbon burden caused by CET. In addition, we studied the impact of CET on residents’ carbon burden after taking into account price control and cost transmission capabilities. The research results show that: 1) In the initiative sector, the sector with higher carbon intensity will have a larger increase in product price; water production and supply industry, metal and non-metal industry chain sectors’ price rise significantly under scenario I; In scenario II, the prices of products in the transportation and extractive industries will increase significantly. The direct and indirect effects vary from driven sector to driven sector. 2) In scenario I, the carbon burden ratio of residential consumer goods is the highest, and that of rural residents is gradually higher than that of urban residents; In scenario II, the carbon burden of transportation consumer goods increases significantly. 3) In both scenarios, the carbon burden rate is progressive between urban and rural areas; but in scenario I, it is regressive within cities and towns; in scenario II, due to the increase in transportation carbon burden, the carbon burden rate will become progressive. 4) Price control policies of different industries will have a heterogeneous impact on residents’ carbon burden; taking into account cost transmission capabilities will reduce the overall carbon burden rate of residents, but will not change the relative size of the carbon burden rates of different income groups. © 2025 Systems Engineering Society of China.

Geographical boundary line of the Yellow River’ s ‘Ji Zi Bend’ and its main ecological issues,"Due to different positions, goals, and research contents, there was no consistent geographical boundary line on Yellow River’s ‘Ji Zi Bend’. On the basis of geographical location and key ecological position within the national strategic layout, we defined Yellow River’ s ‘Ji Zi Bend’ as the geographical boundary lines of “Jishaped” area, which started from Lanzhou City on the west till Sanmenxia City on the east, and from Baotou City on the north till the southern fringe of Sanmenxia City, forming a distribution area of the upper and middle reaches of Yellow River. The area covers 24 cities in six provinces, including Gansu Province, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shanxi Province, Shaanxi Province, and Henan Province. It includes desertified regions in northwestern area, and soil and water loss regions in southeastern area, as well as wetland and alluvial plain alongside both sides of Yellow River, with an area of about 6.04×105 km2 and a population of 6.01× 107 persons. The main ecological issues in this region are as below: scarcity and uneven distribution of water resources together with frequent occurrence of extreme climatic events; unequilibrium and poor regulation of water and sand together with serous soil and water loss; great desertification intensification and conflict between land utilization efficiency and ecological security; the conflict between energy resource exploitation and fragile ecological protection; land degradation and environmental pollution. The reasons for these aforementioned issues include: poor natural resources, and susceptible ecological conditions; history brand of desertification and soil and water loss in recent hundred years; the coupling drivers of climate change and human perturbation; the imbalance between increasing intensity of resource exploitation and utilization and regional development. More attention needs to be paid, including: enhancing management and configuration of water resources and the ability of prevention and reduction of natural disasters, being active response to climate changes; suitable measures to local real conditions and categorical policy for the improvement of ecosystem quality and the restoration and conservation of fragile ecosystems; policy coordination and management synergy, and the enhancement of holistic approach and integrating restoration. In the future, we should focus on ecological protection, concentrate on green development of energy resources, promote technological innovation in biodiversity conservation, strengthen the deep integration of biodiversity with ecological industries and green development, cultivate new quality productivity, and help win the battle against the ecological protection “bend” of the Yellow River. © 2025 Science Press.

Investigating Potential Ecological Benefits From Mariculture,"Mariculture has been gradually regarded as an important solution to the global food production crisis. Increasing scientific evidence reveals that mariculture can provide a large number of ecologic benefits, in accordance with several United Nations sustainable development goals. However, previous studies mostly focused on the negative impacts of mariculture, which may impede its increased production. Here, based on Emergy Accounting (EMA), we propose a comprehensive ""Multiple Inputs-Ecosystem Service Multifunctionality-Multiple Environmental Impacts"" (MI-ESM-MEI) evaluation framework, trying to describe mariculture's overall environmental performances beyond just limiting to the production of seafoods. As the world's largest mariculture producer, China is taken as an example for evaluation. Our results show that both cultured species and cultivation patterns determine the environmental performance of mariculture: seaweed-raft, shellfish-raft, shellfish-hanging cage, shellfish-bottom sowing and others-bottom sowing mariculture could be more influential in environmental support. By identifying priority areas for offshore mariculture development, ecological benefits can be significantly improved using about 27% of China's territorial sea area. At present, mariculture in Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang performs better than that in other regions. Under the condition of recognizing nonnegligible ecological benefits of mariculture, additional improvements for more sustainable development are urgently needed. In addition, mariculture activities especially seaweed mariculture can help solve water contamination problem and alleviate the effects of eutrophication on coastal ecosystems. For most China coastal regions, if integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) mode can be promoted, the ecological burden of mariculture can be reduced and even converted into ecological benefit. Mariculture has gradually become a proposed solution to address the global food production crisis, prompting it to become the fastest growing food production sector in recent years. Therefore, mariculture's environmental and ecological influences have also been paid more attention, including both negative and positive aspects. At present, a comprehensive evaluation of mariculture's ecological performance is still lacking, so we propose an evaluation framework with China as a case study. We find that both cultured species and cultivation patterns determine the performance of mariculture. At present, mariculture in Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang performs better than that in other regions. Offshore mariculture will be paid more attention in the future. By identifying priority areas for offshore mariculture development, ecological benefits such as carbon sequestration and water purification can be significantly improved, while environmental impacts such as water contamination can be reduced. If the local cultured species can be properly matched, ecological burden such as water contamination can be reduced and even converted into ecological benefit. The goal of the study is to provide a way of comprehending the complexity of the mariculture system, thus providing reference and theoretical support for the sustainable development of mariculture both in China and around the world. Mariculture can bring plenty of ecological benefits and even transform ecological burdens such as water contamination into ecological benefits in some cases Both cultured species and cultivation patterns determine the environmental performance of mariculture In China, mariculture's ecological benefits can be significantly improved if offshore mariculture can be developed in the future",Not About Sufficiency
Accounting of value of ecosystem services in the desert: an example of the Kubuqi Desert ecosystem,"Ecological products and ecosystem services are essential for human survival and development. Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) is a method to combine the value of ecosystem services and can reflect the status of ecosystem and ecological conservation and restoration performance. The conservation and restoration of desert ecosystems play an important role in expanding global cultivated land, ensuring food security, and improving human wellbeing. However, ecosystem services and the value of GEP in deserts have been neglected. Taking the Kubuqi Desert ecosystem as an example, this study evaluated the pattens, GEP value, and its change in the Kubuqi Desert ecosystem from 2000 to 2020. Our study found that 1) over the past 20 years, the areas of wetlands, forests, grasslands, and shrubs in the Kubuqi desert ecosystem had increased by 100.65%, 6.05%, 2.24%, and 2.03%, respectively, while that of desert had decreased by 10.62%; 2) the GEP of Kubuqi in 2020 was 55.48 billion CNY, among which its sandstorm prevention value was the highest (39.39%); 3) The value of ecosystem services in the Kubuqi desert ecosystem were all increased over the 20-year period and the largest increase came from sandstorm prevention (increased by 195.09%). This study emphasizes how GEP accounting can promote desert conservation and restoration, quantifies the contribution of desert ecosystems to human wellbeing, and provides future GEP accounting suggestions for desert ecosystems.

"Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Simulation of Land Use and Ecosystem Service Value Assessment in Agro-Pastoral Ecotone, China","In the past, during development processes, major ecological and environmental problems have occurred in the agro-pastoral ecotone of China, which have had a strong impact on regional sustainable development. As such, analyzing the evolution of the regional ecosystem service value (ESV) and predicting the futural spatio-temporal evolution under different development scenarios will provide a scientific basis for further sustainable development. This research analyzed the regional land use and land cover change (LUCC) from 2000 to 2020, adopted the Mark-PLUS model to construct different scenarios (prioritizing grassland development, PDG; prioritizing cropland development, PCD; business as usual, BAU), and simulated the future LUCC. The driving factors influencing each land use type were revealed using the PLUS model. Based on the LUCC data, the spatio-temporal distribution of the regional ESV was calculated via the ESV equivalent factor method, including four primary services (supply service, adjustment service, support service, and cultural service) and eleven secondary services (water resource supply, maintaining nutrient circulation, raw material production, aesthetic landscape, food production, environmental purification, soil conservation, maintaining biodiversity, gas regulation, climate regulation, and hydrologic regulation). The results showed that the total ESV increased first and then declined from 2000 to 2020, reaching the highest value of CNY 8207.99 million in 2005. In the different future scenarios, the ESV shows a trend of PGD (CNY 8338.79 million) > BAU (CNY 8194.82 million) > PCD (CNY 8131.10 million). The global Moran index also follows this distribution. Additionally, precipitation (18%), NDVI (16%), and DEM (16%) are the most important factors in the regional LUCC. The spatial agglomeration characteristics of ESV were revealed using the global Moran’s index and local indicators of spatial auto-correlation, which show a high coordination degree between the high–high cluster areas and water areas. These results point out the key points in the next step of ecological restoration projects and help with achieving the sustainable development goals more effectively. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
A more plant-based diet can boost public health and reduce environmental impact in China,"The current diet structure of Chinese residents poses significant challenges to both health and the environment. Accordingly, in this study, a diet structure optimization model was developed to simulate the diet structure of urban and rural residents in four regions of China, taking into account nutritional needs and environmental sustainability for optimization. The results showed that by optimization based on nutrition alone, nutrient adequacy ratios could increase by 2.8% on average, narrowing regional disparities. Incorporating environmental sustainability slightly reduced nutritional improvements but significantly lowered carbon emissions, water usage, and ecological footprints by 2.9%, 6.9%, and 2.4%, respectively. By simulating the optimization of diet structure, the Qinghai-Tibet region showed potential for nutrient enhancement, whereas the southern and northern regions had opportunities for environmental impact mitigation. This study highlights the significance of transitioning towards a sustainable diet structure that enhances nutritional levels while prioritizing individual and environmental well-being and emphasizes the urgent need for change. It also offers targeted recommendations for diet structures in different regions of China, thereby providing invaluable references for policymakers and other countries striving to establish sustainable and balanced diets. © International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Distributed Collaborative Low-carbon Economic Dispatching of Source, Grid and Load Considering Dual-layer Carbon Trading Mechanism with Reward and Punishment","With the goal of carbon emission peak and carbon neutrality, it is of great significance for energy conservation and emission reduction to design a reasonable carbon trading mechanism so that the source, grid and load can participate in the carbon market together. In this context, a distributed collaborative low-carbon economic dispatching strategy of source, grid and load considering the dual-layer carbon trading mechanism with reward and punishment is proposed. First, a collaborative low-carbon dispatching model of integrated energy suppliers and park under the dual-layer carbon trading mechanism with reward and punishment is established. The integrated energy suppliers directly participate in the external ladder-type carbon trading market with reward and punishment, and the parks indirectly participate in the carbon market by paying carbon fees to integrated energy suppliers or obtaining carbon benefit, thus stimulating all entities to actively participate in energy conservation and emission reduction. Secondly, a ladder-type carbon price model with reward and punishment is established, and a carbon cost/benefit allocation method of integrated energy suppliers and multi-parks under the ladder-type carbon price mechanism with reward and punishment is proposed to ensure the effectiveness and rationality of carbon cost/benefit allocation. Thirdly, the low-carbon dispatching models for the integrated energy suppliers and multi-parks are established, respectively, and the cooperation game between parks is described based on Nash bargaining, so as to reduce carbon emissions and improve social benefits through mutual power exchange among parks. Then, a dual-layer distributed solution for nested alternating direction method of multipliers based on adaptive adjustment mechanism is proposed. Finally, the source-grid-load integrated energy system composed of IEEE 14-bus distribution network and 12-line thermal network is taken as a case to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.

Co-benefits in carbon reduction from freight mode shifts under China’s ‘Clean Air Action’,"China’s air pollution mitigation policy promotes the shift of bulk cargo transportation from roadways to railways and waterways, which might also influence carbon emissions. In this study, we developed a novel emissions assessment framework encompassing three truck types, rail, and waterways at the provincial level. Using counterfactual scenarios during the ‘Clean Air Action’ (2013-2020), we quantitatively examined the co-benefits of freight mode shifts on mitigating CO2 and air pollutant emissions. Our findings indicate that nearly 6.4 Mt of CO2 emissions in the freight sector, equivalent to 2.4% of the total anthropogenic emissions (266.8 Mt, 95% CI: 192.1-320.0) in 2020, are avoided in China. Medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks contribute the most to this reduction over different phases. Rail transportation acted as the most effective mode for simultaneous emissions mitigation. However, while co-reductions are observed in HC (hydrocarbon, 3.9 Kt), CO (carbon monoxide, 83.6 Kt), and NOx (nitrogen oxides, 158.6 Kt) emissions, PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ⩽2.5 μm) emissions increased slightly due to increased share of the waterway freight. More than 80% of provinces in China benefited from freight mode shifts in carbon reductions during the second phase (2017-2020) due to the ambitious goals. To enhance freight mode shifts’ co-benefit, attention should emphasize controlling waterway emissions, expanding railway capacity, and optimizing energy structures. These strategies will amplify policy impact on reducing air pollutant emissions from freight transport and contribute to China’s journey towards carbon neutrality. © 2024 The Author(s).

Charge self-shuttling triboelectric nanogenerator based on wind-driven pump excitation for harvesting water wave energy,"The most important ocean energy sources are wind energy and water wave energy, both of which are significant to carbon neutrality. Due to uneven distribution and random movement, the conversion efficiency from the two energies into electrical energy is limited, so the coupling of them is necessary. However, the current energy harvesting technologies generally target one certain type, or are simple mechanical coupling. Here, we propose a composite water wave energy harvesting scheme with wind excitation based on triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). A rotation TENG driven by wind is introduced as a pump to inject charges into the main TENG. For the main TENG driven by water waves, a specially designed charge self-shuttling mode is applied (CSS-TENG). Under the pump excitation, the shuttling charge amount is increased by 11.8 times, and the peak power density reaches 33.0 W m−3, with an average power density of 2.4 W m−3. Furthermore, the CSS-TENG is expanded into an array by parallel connection, and the practical applications are demonstrated. This work organically couples the wind and water wave energy in the ocean scene, through the charge pumping and self-shuttling mode, providing a new pathway for the synergistic development of clean and renewable energy sources. © 2024 Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

Social and economic analysis of integrated building transportation energy system,"The increasing greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions constitute one of the most significant global environmental issues. CO2 emissions from buildings and transportation are responsible for the largest proportion of total global carbon emissions from various sectors. Therefore it is necessary to utilize clean energy sources (e.g., renewable energy, energy storage systems, and electric vehicles) to decarbonize the building and transportation sectors. The integrated building transportation energy system (IBTES) is a system that combines the energy demands of buildings and transportation in an integrated manner. However, this integrated system has many issues in its practical applications, especially considering the social and economic aspects. A social and economic analysis of IBTES will consider the impacts on various stakeholders, including building owners and users, transportation users, energy suppliers, etc. This study will systematically summarize the current application and development status of IBTES from both social and economic perspectives. In terms of the social perspective, IBTES can improve energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions, which will have a positive impact on the environment and public health. From an economic perspective, IBTES has the potential to decrease the energy costs of buildings and transportation users. In addition, it has the potential to create new jobs in the energy and transportation sectors, and potentially attract new businesses and investments to a region. This study also summarizes several issues and challenges of IBTES, including the cost of implementing and maintaining the system, social acceptance, and inadequate related regulations. Based on this, the study proposes recommendations to effectively promote the implementation of IBTES.

Exploring the relationship and influencing factors of cultivated land multifunction in China from the perspective of trade-off/synergy,"In China, the fast growth of the economy and society is causing a change in the multifunction of cultivated land (MCL), but there is still a lack of proper understanding of the structural connections between these internal functions. Based on exploring the theoretical concept of MCL and quantitative measurement, this paper applied the trade-off/synergy model and the bivariate spatial autocorrelation model to investigate the relationships between the various dimensions of MCL, and the influential factors was revealed by Geographical Detectors. Our research demonstrated that the function of China's cultivated land has obviously changed from a single grain production to a complex including social security, ecological and cultural functions during 2010-2020. Through quantitative measurement of MCL, the results show that, on the one hand, the total amount of MCL increases significantly over time; on the other hand, MCL shows a typical spatial differentiation characteristic of ""high in the southern and low in the northern"". According to the analysis of trade-off/synergy, overall, the MCL presents a positive synergy situation, and this situation has been enhanced over time. As to the influencing factors, the socio-economic development, especially the rural development, significantly affected the trade-off/synergy. Moreover, multi-factor interaction considerably improves the explanatory power of the trade-off/synergy relationship for MCL.

"Mapping human appropriation of net primary production in agroecosystems in the Heihe River Basin, China","The Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production (HANPP) of agroecosystems is critical to food security, sustainable cropland use, and key biogeochemical processes such as carbon cycling and energy flow. However, current agroecosystem management lacks the support of high-resolution crop-type-specific HANPP information. To this end, this study integrated multi-source data of crop type, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series, irrigation and climate, and multiple methods of the Miami model, the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, and process parameters to map the 30-m resolution spatial distribution of agroecosystem HANPP in the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in 2007 and 2012. We then analyzed the influences of climate condition, irrigation, and crop type on the HANPP. The average HANPP in the HRB decreased from 762.4 to 712.1 g C/m2 from 2007 to 2012, with a decrease by 6.6%. The HANPP values of wheat, barley, and oilseed rape decreased by more than 10.0%, whereas that of corn only decreased by 3.1%. The ratio of HANPP to potential NPP (NPPpot) dropped from 82.7% to 81.4% and that of land-use-induced HANPP (HANPPLUC) to HANPP from 61.9% to 58.5%, whereas that of crop-harvest-induced HANPP (HANPPharv) to HANPP increased from 38.1% to 41.5%. These changes indicated that crop productivity increased whereas NPP loss decreased. Crop type conversion accounted for 84.7% of the HANPP changes in HRB, with a value of -93.6 x 109 g C. Due to irrigation supplementation, the HANPP in high-temperature areas was higher than that in low-temperature areas with high precipitation. However, irrigation above 1000 mm no longer promoted HANPP, indicating that the irrigation efficiency in the HRB is low. Reducing HANPPLUC and carbon-water inputs while increasing HANPPharv is the key approach to obtain food security and sustainable agroecosystem development. Effective irrigation strategies and scientific crop planting adjustment should take into account their spatially heterogeneous and crop-specific impacts on the HANPP to help achieve these goals.",Not About Sufficiency

Importing or self-dependent: energy transition in Beijing towards carbon neutrality and the air pollution reduction co-benefits,"Beijing has implemented air pollution control policies and transitioned its energy system with lower carbon emissions to tackle severe air pollution. However, further advancing to a carbon–neutral future necessitates comprehensive measures far beyond the air-quality-oriented policies. This study aims to explore and compare different transition strategies of the Beijing energy system to achieve carbon neutrality and assess the associated air pollution reduction co-benefits by using an integrated modelling framework consisting of an energy system model MESSAGEix-Beijing and an air quality assessment model GAINS. Three scenarios are developed, namely, baseline (BS), indigenous (IND), and imported electricity-dependent (EIMP). The two distinct low-carbon pathways differ in cost-optimal technological solutions and the associated impacts of air pollution reduction. Compared to the BS scenario, the IND and EIMP scenarios could reduce the carbon dioxide emissions in Beijing by 94 to 96% in 2050 and achieve substantial air pollution co-benefits. In the IND scenario, the NOx, SO2, and PM2.5 emissions would decrease by 50%, 84%, and 30% in 2050, respectively. Importing full electricity from other provinces, as indicated by the EIMP scenario, would achieve even higher emissions reduction for air pollutants. The results highlight the necessity for concerted regional development of adjacent provinces to avoid the spillover of carbon emissions and air pollution. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Closing Greenhouse Gas Emission Gaps of Staple Crops in China,"China is facing the dual challenge of achieving food security and agricultural carbon neutrality. Developing spatially explicit crop emission profiles can help inform policy to mitigate agricultural greenhouse gases (GHGs), but previous life-cycle studies were conducted mostly at national and provincial levels. Here, we estimate county-level carbon footprint of China's wheat and maize production based on a nationwide survey and determine the contribution of different strategies to closing regional emission gaps. Results show that crop carbon footprint varies widely between regions, from 0.07 to 3.00 kg CO2e kg-1 for wheat and from 0.09 to 2.30 kg CO2e kg-1 for maize, with inter-county variation generally much higher than interprovince variation. Hotspots are mainly concentrated in Xinjiang and Gansu provinces, owing to intensive irrigation and high plastic mulch and fertilizer inputs. Closing the regional emission gaps would benefit mostly from increasing crop yields and nitrogen use efficiency, but increasing manure use (e.g., in Northeast, East, and Central China) and energy use efficiency (e.g., in North and Northwest China) can also make important contributions. Our county-level carbon footprint estimates improve upon previous broad-scale results and will be valuable for detailed spatial analysis and the design of localized GHG mitigation strategies in China.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability assessment and carbon budget of chemical stabilization based multi-objective remediation of Cd contaminated paddy field,"The feasibility of chemical stabilization-based strategy for extensive field application is under debate due to lacking a proper framework for its sustainability assessment during its life cycle. Herein, a comprehensive framework consisting of crop production, soil quality, and carbon footprint was constructed for assessing agricultural land remediation based on a two-year paddy field trial. Results show that between the two representative agents, biochar scenario substantially benefits for environmental, social, and agricultural sustainability, because of its more positive impacts on human health and ecosystem, public acceptance, soil reproductive, and rice yield. A notably higher sustainability score of 80.7 for biochar scenario than that of 47.0 for lime is found, in spite of the economical sustainability of lime. The net ecosystem carbon budget of the biochar scenario exhibits an unprecedentedly positive value of 17.8 t CO2-eq ha−1, which can finely contribute to a positive carbon budget during remediation. Our finding demonstrates that biochar strategy enables a multi-objective achievement of soil quality – crop production – carbon budget during agricultural land remediation. This study provides new insights into sustainability assessment for restoring agricultural land for safe crop production and synergizing with carbon neutral plan. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Landscape multifunctionality: Concept clarification. recent progress, and frontier issues","Landscape multifunctionality refers to the characteristic of landscapes in which they provide multiple different functions, which interact with each other, at the same time, Good landscape multifunctionality can effectively improve regional human well-being, making landscape multifunctionality a typical topic of human-land coupling research. However, vague concepts, rough measurement methods, and a lack of practical application are major obstacles to the further development of landscape multifunctionality research. This study clarified the concepts and the logical relationships among ecosystem function, ecosystem service, land function, landscape service, and landscape sustainahility. International studies in recent years classified as agricultural landscape multifunctionality, urban landscape multifunctionality, and other and others featuring regional landscape multifunctionality have been reviewed. 'Hie cascade research chain of ""pattern, process, service, sustainahility"" has gradually emerged. Four frontier issues were set in this study, comprising the following; optimizing the indicators and methods of landscape function evaluation based on the principle of supply and demand; correctly understanding the relationship between the dominance and diversity of landscape function; exploring a multi-objective collaborative approach to achieve sustainable development goals; and providing theoretical, methodological, and practical guidance for the optimization of national territory development. © 2019 Science Press.

Enhancing the sustainability narrative through a deeper understanding of sustainable development indicators,"Different sustainability indicators tend to reflect different or even converse outcomes in terms of countries. A careful comparative study is needed to clarify whether these indicators are actually coherent with each other. We analyze and compare five sustainable development indicators. Pearson correlation was used to make a comparative study among them. Within the two groups, the indicators are positively correlated. The Sustainable Development Index (SDI) of the second group also shares a negative correlation with the Human Development Index. On the other side, the Emergy Sustainability Index was negatively correlated with the Environmental Performance Index, and had little or no correlation with the Environmental Sustainability Index. Furthermore, when examining the scores obtained from the different SDIs, the results demonstrate that they might present somewhat conflicting findings, if not considering their complementarity. This, from one side, depends on the fact that Human Development Index (HDI), Environmental Performance Index (EPI), and Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) provide a short-term local perspective on ""sustainability"", while the Emergy-based Sustainability Index (EmSI) and Surplus Biocapacity are more long-term and global in their perspective. HDI, EPI, and ESI have a more social and economic focus, including indicators whose dynamics are disjoined from the natural one. The emerging differences might be explained through the analysis of the individual sub-indicators for each of the SDIs. © 2017 by the author.",Not About Sufficiency

China's environmental challenges and implications for the world,"After three decades of exceptional economic growth, China has become a global economic powerhouse. As the economy has grown, though, so have China's environmental challenges, causing enormous socioeconomic consequences for China and the rest of the world. The global financial crisis has prompted China to create more domestic demand for consumption and implement massive infrastructure construction. Although China has the second-largest total gross domestic product (GDP) in the world, its per capita GDP is still much lower than per capita GDP of developed countries: there is much room for further increase in GDP and consequent environmental challenges. Despite China's many efforts to protect the environment and improve resource use efficiency, increasing environmental pollution and resource scarcity have become a severe bottleneck for sustainable development. Because of China's size, these and other challenges and opportunities have huge implications for the world. However, literature related to China's various environmental challenges and rapid changes is scattered. In this article, we outline China's socioeconomic transformation, synthesize China's environmental challenges and their interrelationships, illustrate impacts of environmental challenges on human well-being in China and beyond, and offer a systems approach to addressing environmental sustainability. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecological and socioeconomic effects of China's policies for ecosystem services,"To address devastating environmental crises and to improve human well-being, China has been implementing a number of national policies on payments for ecosystem services. Two of them, the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain to Green Program (GTGP), are among the biggest programs in the world because of their ambitious goals, massive scales, huge payments, and potentially enormous impacts. The NFCP conserves natural forests through logging bans and afforestation with incentives to forest enterprises, whereas the GTGP converts cropland on steep slopes to forest and grassland by providing farmers with grain and cash subsidies. Overall ecological effects are beneficial, and socioeconomic effects are mostly positive. Whereas there are time lags in ecological effects, socioeconomic effects are more immediate. Both the NFCP and the GTGP also have global implications because they increase vegetative cover, enhance carbon sequestration, and reduce dust to other countries by controlling soil erosion. The future impacts of these programs may be even bigger. Extended payments for the GTGP have recently been approved by the central government for up to 8 years. The NFCP is likely to follow suit and receive renewed payments. To make these programs more effective, we recommend systematic planning, diversified funding, effective compensation, integrated research, and comprehensive monitoring. Effective implementation of these programs can also provide important experiences and lessons for other ecosystem service payment programs in China and many other parts of the world.",Not About Sufficiency

Impacts of land use and climate change on carbon dynamics in south-central Senegal,"Total carbon stock in vegetation and soils was reduced 37% in south-central Senegal from 1900 to 2000. The decreasing trend will continue during the 21st century unless forest clearing is stopped, selective logging dramatically reduced, and climate change, if any, relatively small. Developing a sustainable fuelwood and charcoal production system could be the most feasible and significant carbon sequestration project in the region. If future climate changes dramatically as some models have predicted, cropland productivity will drop more than 65% around 2100, posing a serious threat to food security and the efficiency of carbon sequestration projects. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic modelling shows substantial contribution of ecosystem restoration to climate change mitigation,"Limiting global warming to a 1.5 degrees C temperature rise requires drastic emissions reductions and removal of carbon-dioxide from the atmosphere. Most modelled pathways for 1.5 degrees C assume substantial removals in the form of biomass energy with carbon capture and storage, which brings with it increasing risks to biodiversity and food security via extensive land-use change. Recently, multiple efforts to describe and quantify potential removals via ecosystem-based approaches have gained traction in the climate policy discourse. However, these options have yet to be evaluated in a systematic and scientifically robust way. We provide spatially explicit estimates of ecosystem restoration potential quantified with a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model. Simulations covering forest restoration, reforestation, reduced harvest, agroforestry and silvopasture were combined and found to sequester an additional 93 Gt C by 2100, reducing mean global temperature increase by similar to 0.12 degrees C (5%-95% range 0.06 degrees C-0.21 degrees C) relative to a baseline mitigation pathway.

Earth stewardship science-transdisciplinary contributions to quantifying natural and cultural heritage of Southernmost Africa,"Evaluating anthropogenic changes to natural systems demand greater quantification through innovative transdisciplinary research focused on adaptation and mitigation across a wide range of thematic sciences. Southernmost Africa is a unique field laboratory to conduct such research linked to earth stewardship, with 'earth' as in our Commons. One main focus of the AEON's Earth Stewardship Science Research Institute (ESSRI) is to quantify the region's natural and cultural heritage at various scales across land and its flanking oceans, as well as its time-scales ranging from the early Phanerozoic (some 540 million years) to the evolution of the Anthropocene (changes) following the emergence of the first human-culture on the planet some 200 thousand years ago. Here we illustrate the value of this linked research through a number of examples, including: (i) geological field mapping with the aid of drone, satellite and geophysical methods, and geochemical fingerprinting; (ii) regional ground and surface water interaction studies; (iii) monitoring soil erosion, mine tailing dam stability and farming practices linked to food security and development; (iv) ecosystem services through specific biodiversity changes based on spatial logging of marine (oysters and whales) and terrestrial (termites, frogs and monkeys) animals. We find that the history of this margin is highly episodic and complex by, for example, the successful application of ambient noise and groundwater monitoring to assess human-impacted ecosystems. This is also being explored with local Khoisan representatives and rural communities through Citizen Science. Our goal is to publicly share and disseminate the scientific and cultural data, through initiatives like the Africa Alive Corridor 10: 'Homo Sapiens' that embraces storytelling along the entire southern coast. It is envisioned that this approach will begin to develop the requisite integrated technological and societal practices that can contribute toward the needs of an ever-evolving and changing global 'village'. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

"Grassland irrigation and grazing prohibition have significantly affected vegetation and microbial diversity by changing soil temperature and moisture, evidences from a 6 years experiment of typical temperate grassland","Grasslands are characterized by high primary productivity and offer a diverse array of ecosystem services that contribute to human well-being. The dynamic balance between vegetation-soil in grassland ecosystems is being affected by anthropogenic activities and climate change, in which soil microbial communities play a critical regulating role. However, how microbial biodiversity interacts with vegetation-soil and responds to environmental change remains unclear. We conducted a six-year field experiment in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia to study the effects of grazing and altered precipitation on major vegetation types (or species), soil properties, and microbial community composition. The results showed that increased precipitation influenced positive associations within microbial communities, which helped to increase vegetation diversity. The biomass of Stipa.sareptana increased by 0.054 % under reduced precipitation, while it significantly increased by 2.07 % under the combination of grazing ban and reduced precipitation. Grazing prohibition had a significant negative effect on bacterial diversity and Shannon's index, but a significant positive effect on fungal diversity and abundance. Increasing precipitation had no significant effect on bacterial diversity under grazing conditions, while decreasing precipitation significantly reduced the Shannon index of bacteria. Fungal communities were very sensitive to changes in precipitation, and both increasing and decreasing precipitation significantly affected the structure of fungal communities. In summary, our results highlight how grassland irrigation and moderate grazing can be employed as a management strategy to promote plant diversity and thereby improve ecosystem functioning and resilience. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Preserving and utilizing microbial diversity for innovation and sustainability,"Microbial culture collections have been fundamental to microbiology since their inception in the late nineteenth century. Initiated by Professor Král, the collections preserve and distribute microbial strains, enabling scientific advancements. Over time, they evolved into microbiological resource centres, integrating taxonomic expertise and adhering to international legal frameworks and quality management systems. Legal frameworks, including the Nagoya Protocol and biosecurity regulations, ensure ethical access and use of microbial resources. Regional networks, such as Microbial Resource Research Infrastructure – European Research Infrastructure Consortium at the European level, or, in the future, the Global Biological Resources Centres Network, coordinate efforts, fostering innovation and collaboration. Today, microbial culture collections support biotechnology, personalized medicine, agriculture and environmental sustainability. They also play a crucial role in public education, addressing misconceptions about microbes. As research progresses, these collections will continue to contribute to scientific discovery, bioeconomic growth and solutions to global challenges such as climate change, food security and ecosystem health. © 2025 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating strict protection and sustainable use areas to preserve the Brazilian Pampa biome through conservation planning,"Biodiversity conservation planning must be ecosystem-specific and take into account human needs as food production. The Pampa biome is a temperate grassland with high species richness and with an important role in food production in South America. Here we present the first formal Systematic Conservation Planning for the Brazilian part of the Pampa, which is the least protected biome in Brazil. We aimed to build conservation scenarios where at least 17 % of the biome area were protected, following the 11th Aichi target for terrestrial lands protection according to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Our conservation targets were the vegetation types of this biome. Three scenarios were built varying in their proportions of strict protection (SP) and sustainable use areas (SU): Permissive scenario (5 % SP, 12 % SU); Intermediate scenario (10 % SP, 7 % SU) and Restrictive scenario (15 % SP, 2 % SU). Urban and rural areas, as well as bovine and ovine density, were used as prioritization costs, aiming to minimize possible conservation conflicts. Four main clusters of priority areas to protect the vegetational diversity can be observed in all scenarios and should be considered when implementing future protected areas in this threatened biome. Sustainable use areas are suitable for low-density livestock raising, combining biodiversity protection and food production, but strictly protected areas are still important to species most affected by livestock. The combination of strict protection and sustainable use areas can be effective in similar biomes. It should be considered in future international negotiations, such as the 2020 Conference to be held in Beijing, opening new strategies to achieve the 17 % of land protection. We expect that this Systematic Conservation Planning reinforces the recently started scientific discussion regarding the conservation of non-forest ecosystems in Brazil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

(Climate, (2023), 11, 3, (62), 10.3390/cli11030062)","There were errors in the original publication [1]. A correction has been made to Section 1, Paragraph 3: This is demonstrated by the fact that CO2 levels have now risen since mid-2019 to 421 ppm [2] from an initial 410 ppm. A correction has been made to Section 1, Paragraph 4: In referring to the USD 100 billion “loss and damage” funding released for vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters, Guterres [1] declared that “A fund for loss and damage is essential”. A correction has been made to Section 2.3, Paragraph 3: Most of the following AE methods are possibly much more expensive but more politically acceptable as they can be carried out by many countries, with some producing food and being capable of control. A correction has been made to Section 2.3.3, Total Area Required, Paragraph 1: The benefits of extending AE projects onto arid land with nontoxic reflective material would be demonstrated. A correction has been made to Section 2.4.1, Paragraph 1: In over 28 countries, the results ranged from −1.04 W/m2 (in Spain) to −8.74 W/m2 (in Poland), with an average of −1.49 W/m2. A correction has been made to Section 2.4.1, Paragraph 2: Using a ‘temporary carbon’ measure of ThreC at only USD 10 per Ton year or only USD 10/365x100 = USD 2.74 per ton-100 days, i.e., USD 0.0274 per ton day, we find: On a per hectare basis, this becomes an average of USD 30.05 per hectare for average Europe; USD 20.97 per hectare for Spain; and USD 176.25 for Poland. On a per acre basis, this becomes USD 12.16 for Europe on average, USD 8.49 for Spain and USD 71.33 for Poland (In the EU, normal long-term carbon credits are about USD 96 per ton in 2023). In the likely event of more El Nino-driven stronger heat waves, these prices may soon appear too low to incentivize enough farmers to convert to maintaining cover crops in this regenerative agriculture. In a similar way, the local and continental cooling produced by this AE can be calculated using the ScCd data and equivalents. In addition to this, in effect by timed release (as demanded naturally when heat waves strike), the latent heat cooling from additional retained moisture of these cover crops can easily exceed that through albedo enhancement [9]. A correction has been made to Section 3.1: 3.1. Communicating for Broader Comprehension A correction has been made to Section 3.2.2, Paragraph 1: Such AU would also cool the air with sensible heat transfer from deep ocean water, AE from surface algae reflection, and AE from DMS-produced clouds. A correction has been made to Section 3.2.5, Algal Selection, Research, and Propagation, Paragraph 2: A further measure may be inoculation, alongside fertilizer, with healthy algae that have the potential to dominate. A correction has been made to Section 3.2.5: Tropospheric Release of Iron Chloride A correction has been made to Section 3.2.5, Coccolithophores, Paragraph 2: Again, limestone fertilization may be worth considering as it could accompany the natural or artificial production of coccolithophores [68] (Keller1989), and these are producers of the precursor of DMS, which acts as an excellent CCN for cloud AE to accompany their apparently excellent carbon sequestration function. A correction has been made to Section 3.2.5, Coccolithophores, Paragraph 6: Use of some transport vessels or cruise ships, with monitors on board, should be considered as they are simple means for distribution. Their marine transport carbon footprint and perhaps more may be offset and even add to their revenue with the sale of carbon credits generated by ThreC and sequestration. Certainly even experimental use could add to their image and help educate their passengers so commercial participation should be possible to achieve. The time for the sole use of scientific research vessels may be past. A correction has been made to Section 3.3, Paragraph 1: The timeliness of such action is critical, as permanent loss of reflective surfaces such as snow cover needs to be replaced by new alternative AE to maintain the existing Earth Energy Imbalance (EEI) and resist its further increase. A correction has been made to Section 3.5, Paragraph 5: Suitable ThrEC estimates for LW radiation could be identified (Section 3.6.2 below) and used to further evaluate those projects. A correction has been made to Section 3.5, Paragraph 6: Deserts, on the other hand, have an advantage over arid lands in that their atmosphere is clearer, with greater quantities of short-wave radiation available to reflect any AE activities into space; thus, larger ThrEC effects per sq. km would occur. A correction has been made to Section 3.6.1: However, this approximation does not allow for the lower ratio of other GHG to total CO2. In the sentence below (in Section 3.8), the word “of” is missing. A correction has been made to Section 3.8, Paragraph 2: The above analysis points to the prospect of massive losses in albedo from snow melt on land becoming a trigger point for an unacceptable rate of heat increase. A correction has been made to Section 4.2, Paragraph 1: The disconnect from climate can be overcome through comprehension of the heat effect of clouds. Even a smart ninth grader can feel the cooling effects of a cloud, relate it to a learnt understanding of cloud albedo, and teach their parents. A correction has been made to Section 4.3, Paragraph 1: If we can further expose the potency of albedo enhancement and quickly move to utilize it, while also doing so for the latent heat portion of the hydrological cycle [9,57] (Lightburn 2024), we will win the war. Forest preservation, afforestation and reforestation [36] (Swanston et al., 2016), and regenerative farming [34] (Gilchrist 2021) will play large roles on this last path, along with precipitation and, later, evaporation from the new cloud formations. A correction has been made to Section 4.4, Paragraph 7: Payments by developed countries made to underdeveloped countries can activate these measurable AE projects, thus offering a thousand possible stepping stones to climate justice and yielding time to reduce our emissions.

"Exploring zeolite-based composites in adsorption and photocatalysis for toxic wastewater treatment: Preparation, mechanisms, and future perspectives","Water scarcity has become a critical global concern exacerbated by population growth, globalization, and industrial expansion, resulting in the production of wastewater containing a wide array of contaminants. Tackling this challenge necessitates the adoption of innovative materials and technologies for effective wastewater treatment. This review article provides a comprehensive exploration of the preparation, applications, mechanisms, and economic environmental analysis of zeolite-based composites in wastewater treatment. Zeolite, renowned for its versatility and porous nature, is of paramount importance due to its exceptional properties, including high surface area, ion exchange capability, and adsorption capacity. Various synthetic methods for zeolite-based composites are discussed. The utilization of zeolites in wastewater treatment, particularly in adsorption and photocatalysis, is thoroughly investigated. The significance of zeolite in adsorption and its role in the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants are examined, along with its applications in treating volatile organic compounds (VOCs), dye wastewater, oil-field wastewater, and radioactive waste. Mechanisms underlying zeolite-based adsorption and photocatalysis, including physical and chemical adsorption, ion exchange, and surface modification, are elucidated. Additionally, the role of micropores in the adsorption process is explored. Furthermore, the review delves into regeneration and desorption studies of zeolite-based composites, crucial for sustainable wastewater treatment practices. Economic and environmental analyses are conducted to assess the feasibility and sustainability of employing zeolite-based composites in wastewater treatment applications. Future recommendations are provided to guide further research and development in the field of zeolite-based composites, aiming to enhance wastewater treatment efficiency and environmental sustainability. By exploring the latest advancements and insights into zeolite-based nanocomposites, this paper aims to contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment strategies. The integration of zeolite-based materials in wastewater treatment processes shows promise for mitigating water pollution and addressing water scarcity challenges, ultimately contributing to environmental preservation and public health protection. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Does digital transformation promote the green innovation of China's listed companies?,"Green innovation is essential to sustainable development and carbon neutrality. How to adopt digital technology to promote corporate green innovation (CGI) has become a widespread topic among scholars. This paper examines how digital transformation influences CGI in Chinese non-financial listed companies from 2008 to 2020. Using textual analysis to construct indicators of digital transformation, we find that CGI can be significantly enhanced by enterprise digital transformation in both quantity and quality. We also explore the underlying channels and find that enterprise digital transformation promotes CGI by improving environmental management, human capital upgrading, and resource allocation efficiency. Moreover, we investigate the moderating effects of various factors and conclude that enterprise digital transformation's favorable effects on CGI are more pronounced in companies with good environmental responsibility, labor-intensive industries, high financial risks, intense market competition, and state-owned enterprises, as well as in companies located in regions with strong environmental regulations and a low level of digital economy development. This paper contributes to the literature on green innovation and digital transformation, as well as provides empirical evidence for enterprises in emerging market countries to promote energy saving and green transformation using digital technology.",Not About Sufficiency
"A low carbon bridge over the River Thames, London, UK","The construction industry must make a concerted effort to reduce its carbon footprint. This initiative for carbon reduction should supplement the social and economic benefits that infrastructure projects offer.

To this end, the Nine Elms to Pimlico site, in London, was chosen as our challenge. The project has shown that a low carbon bridge over the river is feasible, although achieving an upfront carbon of less than 250 kgCO2e/m2 proved to be too ambitious for this bridge with current design constraints. The need for unconventional materials, technologies and design processes has been identified.

Asymmetric framework engineering of carbon nitride nanotubes for polarization promoted H2O2 photosynthesis,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis from oxygen and water has become an attracting route due to its green, low-carbon and sustainable features. Although carbon nitride (CN) is a remarkable semiconductor for photocatalytic H2O2 production, CN also suffers from slow transfer and poor separation efficiency of photo-generated charges due to the intrinsically molecular structures. Herein, we report a facile method to enhance H2O2 evolution with asymmetric CN via molten-salt assisted supramolecular assemblies of melamine and 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (T). The optimum M-CNT exhibited a photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of 44.63 μmol‧L−1h−1, which is more than 4 times higher than that of pristine CN without any sacrificial agents. Experimental and DFT results demonstrate T molecule can tune the charge location of CN frameworks, promoting electron transfer and efficient separation. Furthermore, under the synergy of molten salt, the uneven distribution of intramolecular charges can be exacerbated to boost the photocatalytic performance through significant polarization effects. This work provided a paradigm of charge characteristics of carbon nitride via asymmetric molecular engineering for enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 generation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Systematic identification of factors influencing the spatial distribution of soil organic matter in croplands within the black soil region of Northeastern China across multiple scales,"Cultivated soil organic matter (SOM) plays a critical role in maintaining soil health and promoting ecosystem services. However, the multi-scale influences on SOM changes in cropland and their interactions in the Black Soil Region of Northeastern China (BSR-NEC) remain unclear. Existing studies mainly focus on a single scale and lack a systematic multi-scale analysis. In this study, we systematically examined the multi-scale influences on SOM spatial variation in cropland within BSR-NEC using spatial autocorrelation analysis (SA), random forest models (RF), geodetector (GD), and structural equation modeling (SEM). We integrated multi-scale SOM spatial distribution influences across grid scale (GS), watershed scale (WS), and prefecture level city scale (PLS) to unveil significant differences in the spatial distribution of SOM in cropland across regions in BSR-NEC. The research indicated that: (1) the proportion of cropland with SOM content greater than 30 g/kg in BSR-NEC was 68.31 %, where the spatial distribution of SOM was more uniform at the watershed scale; (2) the Moran indices of the spatial distribution of SOM content all indicated that cropland SOM showed a trend of spatial concentration, with the grid scale (GS) > watershed scale (WS) > prefecture level city scale (PLS), mainly manifested in the form of ""high-high (HH)"" and ""low-low (LL)"" aggregation types; (3) at multiple scales, temperature and cropland type are always the main factors driving the changes of cropland SOM in BSR-NEC; (4) factors such as precipitation, elevation, and distance from urban centers exhibited varying impacts on SOM; moreover, interactions between any two factors typically resulted in nonlinear enhancements. By developing region-specific management strategies that target these key factors, our findings contribute to advancing precision and efficiency in cropland protection, aligning with the goals of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG2030) to promote sustainable land use, improve soil health, and enhance ecosystem resilience.",Not About Sufficiency
Rhizosphere microecological mechanism of carbon sequestration and its emission mitigation in rice ratooning,"Rice ratooning plays a critical role in mitigating global climate change and enhancing soil carbon sequestration due to its properties of carbon fixation and emission reduction. The rhizosphere micro-ecosystem emerges as one of the key determinants, thus it is highly significant to investigate the impact changes in rhizosphere microbial composition on the ecological mechanisms associated with carbon sequestration and emission reduction in paddy fields. Over two consecutive years, this study analyzed greenhouse gas emission characteristics, photosynthetic carbon assimilation patterns, and rhizosphere microenvironmental differences between the main crop (MC) and ratoon season rice (RSR) using four rice varieties with distinct growth stages and genetic traits. The results demonstrated that compared to MC, RSR reduced the daily average methane (CH4) emissions from paddy field by 57.78 similar to 64.31 %, while decreasing the distribution of photosynthetic products to the rhizosphere soil by 78.15 %. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a significant increase in the abundance of autotrophic microorganisms, and the carbon-fixing bacterium Pseudarthrobacter was isolated and identified in RSR soil. The exogenous addition of this microorganism increased the soil organic carbon (SOC) content of RSR by 4.65 %, while simultaneously reducing CH4 emissions from paddy fields by 26.25 %. The significant increase in autotrophic carbon-fixing bacteria in the rhizosphere soil is one of the key micro-ecological mechanisms driving carbon sequestration and emission reduction in paddy fields. This is attributed to the reduced allocation of photosynthetic carbon assimilation products to the belowground components, thereby promoting the abundance of autotrophic carbon-fixing bacteria in RSR field. Consequently, the ecological niche width of heterotrophic microorganisms, such as methanogens, is reduced, while autotrophic carbon-fixing bacteria mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from RSR field by fixing CO2 and increasing SOC content. The findings offer valuable theoretical and practical perspectives on attaining the overarching objectives of carbon neutrality and food security.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem Service Trade-Offs and Synergies in a Temperate Agricultural Region in Northeast China,"Ecosystem services (ESs) are essential for balancing environmental sustainability and socio-economic development. However, the sustainability of ESs and their relationships are increasingly threatened by global climate change and intensifying human activities, particularly in ecologically sensitive and agriculturally-intensive regions. The Songnen Plain, a crucial agricultural region in Northeast China, faces considerable challenges in sustaining its ESs due to the overexploitation of agricultural land, environmental degradation, and climate variability. This study assessed five key ESs in the Songnen Plain from 2000 to 2020 across multiple scales: habitat quality (HQ), soil conservation (SC), water yield (WY), food production (FP), and windbreaking and sand fixing (WS). We evaluated the trade-offs and synergies between these ESs, as well as the driving factors of the main ES trade-offs. Our findings indicate that provisioning services (WY and FP) and regulating services (SC and WS) improved over time, with FP exhibiting the most significant increase at 203.90%, while supporting services (HQ) declined by 32.61%. The primary ecosystem service multifunctionality areas were those that provided FP, SC, and WY, accounting for 58% of the total. ES trade-offs and synergies varied across spatial scales, with stronger synergies being observed at the pixel scale and more pronounced trade-offs at the county scale. Climate factors, particularly precipitation and temperature, played a more significant role in shaping ES trade-offs than anthropogenic factors. Our study provides valuable insights into the restoration and sustainable management of ESs in temperate agriculturally-intensive regions, with significant implications for the protection of the northeastern black soil region and safeguarding national food security. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon emissions assessment of ultra-high performance concrete in construction industry: Calculation method and case study,"The promotion of high-performance concrete in engineering can significantly reduce carbon emissions in the urban construction industry, which is essential for achieving green and sustainable development goals. However, the specific contributions of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) and ultra-high performance concrete with coarse aggregate (UHPC-CA) have not been thoroughly investigated. To accurately quantify the carbon emission benefits of UHPC and UHPC-CA, the carbon emissions calculation method considering the influence of multiple factors for the main aboveground structure construction has been proposed. A specific 11-story reinforced concrete frame structure (RCFS) is selected for the case study. Subsequently, the carbon emissions of various types of concrete under five designed building construction programs are calculated and evaluated. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness and performance benefits are discussed concurrently. Based on an actual engineering case, this study comprehensively evaluates the environmental, cost, and performance benefits of using UHPC, UHPC-CA, and ordinary concrete in the construction industry. The results indicate that both UHPC and UHPC-CA can reduce carbon emissions while enhancing the performance benefits of the RCFS and lowering construction costs. Specifically, UHPC-CA can reduce carbon emissions and construction costs by 20% at equivalent performance, while UHPC can improve performance by 76% at equivalent costs, with a 6% increase in carbon emissions. The engineering value of UHPC and UHPC-CA is remarkable, characterized by significant reductions in carbon emissions, ultra-high performance, and superior durability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"The green response of financial inclusion, infrastructure development and renewable energy to the environmental sustainability: A newly evidence from OECD economies","Recently, economic environmental degradation is being considered a leading chellenge in forefront of policy analysts. Thus, the present study introduces core environmental determinants such as infrastructure development, finacail inclusion, gross domestic product, population, and renewable energy consumption. Financial inclusion (FI) is crucial for attaining a environment. The present study selects the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) over period of 2004–2022. The results show that financial inclusin, infrastructure development(ID), and renewable energy (RE) play a vital influence in decreasing carbon emissions. The OECD nations should surge their investment in renewable energy and infrastructure development. Furthermore, to ensure long-term environmental sustainability, it is imperative to broaden the scope of FI. Thus, the inclusion of green infrastructure is essential in order to shift from the utilization of fossil fuels to RE sources. Similarly, policymakers should incorporate FI into climate actions at the local, national, and regional levels. However, it is crucial to promote the economic shift towards RE sources in order to mitigate the environmental impact from humn and economic activities.

Steering Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Selectivity toward CH4 or C2H4 on N-Doped Carbon-Coated Cu/Cu2O Composite Catalysts,"Understanding the catalytic mechanism is crucial for the rational design of efficient catalysts. However, the dynamic reconstruction of copper (Cu) catalysts under harsh electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) conditions poses great challenges for studying the mechanism. Herein, we prepared a series of N-doped carbon-coated Cu/Cu2O composite catalysts with varying Cu/Cu2O ratios and N-doping levels by annealing copper acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2) with different amounts of potassium nitrate (KNO3), which can steer CO2RR toward either CH4 or C2+ (mainly C2H4) production. The in situ formed carbon layer effectively stabilized the Cu catalyst structures under cathode potentials, facilitating mechanistic studies of CO2RR. Through CO temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and in situ infrared spectroscopy characterizations, it is revealed that the coexistence of Cu0 and Cu+ sites promoted the generation of a high-coverage, strongly adsorbed *CO intermediate on the catalytic surface, thereby enhancing C-C coupling to generate C2+ products. Conversely, the surface with only Cu0 sites exhibited a low-coverage and weakly adsorbed *CO, benefiting its hydrogenation/deoxygenation toward CH4 production. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
High energy-efficiency decomplexation of metal-complexes by H*-mediated electro-reduction on hydroxyphenyl Co-porphyrin catalysts,"Electrochemical reduction of metal-organic complex pollutants has been recognized as an environmental benign method that operates at mild condition. However, the selective reduction of metal complexes and energy consumption in cathodic process are still a big challenge. Herein, we found that hydroxyphenyl Co-porphyrin catalyst (CoTH@NG) realizes the highly selective decomplexation of metal-organic complexes by H* -mediated reduction, and simultaneously the impressive recovery efficiency of metal ions. Density functional theory (DFT) confirms the generation and capturing ability of H* on CoTH@NG, verifying the dominant role of H* -mediated reduction in the selective decomplexation of Cu-EDTA. CoTH@NG realizes the superior energy efficiency for Cu-EDTA removal (279.3 g kWh−1 of EEOCu-EDTA) and Cu recovery (48.6 g kWh−1 of EEOCu), which are remarkably 3.3 × 102 and 9.7 × 102 times higher than traditional carbon cloth electrode. Moreover, the recovered Cu0(s) nanowires on the electrode surface can be efficiently regenerated in HCOOH by a galvanic reaction through the electron channel of CoTH@NG, regenerating catalytic electrode. This is one of the pioneer studies on H* -mediated electro-reduction decomplexation of metal-complexes, metal recovery, and electrode regeneration on CoTH@NG, which providing a technical strategy for developing efficient electrocatalytic system for pollution control. Environmental Implication Metal complexes is a dramatic increase in the electroplating and mining industries, and seriously affect both public health and environmental sustainability. Our work reported a new hydroxyphenyl Co-porphyrin catalyst (CoTH@NG) which achieves the selective decomplexation of metal-organic complexes, and simultaneously the recovery of metal ions. CoTH@NG realizes the superior energy efficiency for Cu-EDTA removal (279.3 g kWh−1) and Cu0(s) recovery (48.6 g kWh−1), which are remarkably 3.3 × 102 and 9.7 × 102 times higher than traditional carbon cloth electrode.

Air pollution control and carbon reduction policies: Assessing effectiveness in alleviating PM2.5-associated mortality in China,"To confront the challenges posed by air pollution and climate change, China has undertaken significant initiatives to develop strategies that address both issues concurrently. However, the health benefits of these initiatives have not been clearly articulated. In this study, the dynamic changes in health impacts under air pollution and carbon reduction actions in China are evaluated by employing the latest concentration–response models and projected PM2.5 concentrations under future scenarios. From 2020 to 2060, the enforcement of clean air and climate mitigation policies is expected to increase the percentage of the population living with PM2.5 concentrations meeting the 10 μg/m3 standard by 79 %. Without the implementation of relevant mitigation measures, PM2.5-associated deaths are projected to double due to an aging population. In comparison to the 2060 reference scenario, the joint implementation of clean air and carbon neutrality measures is expected to reduce nationwide PM2.5-associated mortality by 62 %, equivalent to 2.15 (95 % CI: 1.80–2.48) million deaths. Stringent pollution controls are crucial for reducing PM2.5-associated deaths before 2030, after which carbon neutrality actions become increasingly significant from 2030 to 2060. The challenges of mitigating future PM2.5-associated deaths vary greatly across regions, showing a critical response to pollution control and carbon reduction. The research proves the effectiveness of China's future air pollution control and carbon reduction policies in mitigating PM2.5-associated deaths. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"Navigating the path to environmental sustainability: Exploring the role of fintech, natural resources and green energy in Belt and Road countries","The world is currently facing a major environmental crisis, with rising global warming, sea levels, droughts, and floods. This has particularly affected the poorest nations, leading to increased flooding and droughts that impact their livelihoods. To combat this, nations worldwide need to develop strategies to reverse environmental damage and achieve carbon neutrality. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries are responsible for a significant portion of pollution, making it crucial for them to take strong climate action. Besides, the financial technology (FNT), renewable energy generation (GEN) and the optimum usage of natural resources (NTR) can help the BRI economies towards Environmental Sustainability. This study used the “Cross-Sectional Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model” (CS-ARDL) model and focused on BRI countrieswhereby the data comprised of obervationsfrom 1990–2020. It was found that FNT can help reduce the cost of financial services and increase financial inclusion while also reducing carbon emissions. However, the use of NTR can have a detrimental effect on achieving environmental targets. It is important to transition towards GEN to reduce CO2 emissions and promote sustainable growth. Popular GEN methods like wind and solar power can significantly reduce emissions and satisfy a large portion of energy needs. BRI countries must take environmental action, promote the use of GEN, incentivize its adoption, encourage the development of FNT, and discourage the use of NTR-related fossil fuels to achieve environmental targets. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Realizing the value of grassland ecosystem services: global practice and its inspiration for the karst desertification control area,"The conflict between grassland ecosystem conservation and economic development is an important but challenging question. Realizing the value of ecosystem services (ES) is considered to be a solution for the dual sustainability of ecology and economy. However, there is a lack of systematic understanding of value realization of grassland ES, especially in the karst desertification (KDC) area, which is still at an exploratory stage. We obtained 527 studies from 48 countries in the past 20 years through the Scopus database, and systematically reviewed the current understandings and practices by the content analysis method, and enlightened the inspiration for the grassland in the KDC area. Results showed that: (i) Over the past 20 years, the literature number showed a fluctuating growth trend, and the study areas are mainly concentrated in economically developed countries with rich grassland resources; (ii) Pathways such as grassland management and payment for ecosystem services (PES) are widely used to improve grassland ES and human well-being, and most studies have shown positive effects; (iii) Their performance is significantly impacted by stakeholders, governments, as well as the attributes of ES, and a path of government-led, stakeholder participation and market-oriented operation should be explored; and (iv) There are still some knowledge gaps, such as, uneven distribution of study areas, few effective pathways for realizing the public grassland ES value, and deficient linkage mechanisms of ""grassland ES-industry development-economic system feedback-ecosystem protection,"" and so on. Based on our findings, we not only make recommendations for the current dilemma of realizing the value of grassland ES, but also put forward the enlightenments to the grassland in the KDC area based on experiences and lessons learned from global practices.

Promoting Sustainable Development Goals by Optimizing City-Level Solar Photovoltaic Deployment in China,"Solar photovoltaic (PV) installations, which enable carbon neutrality, are expected to surge in the coming decades. This growth will support sustainable development goals (SDGs) via reductions in power-generation-related environmental emissions and water consumption while generating new jobs. However, where and to what extent PVs should be utilized to support SDGs must be thoroughly addressed. Here, we use multiple PV deployment scenarios to compare the benefits of PVs and related SDGs progress in 366 prefectural-level cities in China. We developed an assessment framework that integrates a PV allocation model, an electricity system optimization model, and a benefit assessment approach. We identify vast differences in PV distribution and electricity transmission and elucidate trade-offs and synergies among the SDGs under various PV implementation scenarios. The water conservation-oriented scenario yields substantial carbon reduction, air pollutant mitigation, and water saving cobenefits, leading to the greatest SDGs improvements. Prioritizing employment creation enhances job-relevant SDGs but inhibits environmental resource benefits. SDGs in less developed cities present greater progress across all scenarios. This study highlights the need to consider spatial heterogeneity and the potential trade-offs between different SDGs and regions when designing energy transition strategies. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
Deep return of straw improves topsoil health and maize productivity more efficiently than shallow return,"Straw return is an important nature-based solution to identify optimal management practices to maintain cropland soil health and food security. However, there is still limited information available regarding the impacts of different straw return strategies on soil health, especially when considering a comprehensive assessment of soil physical, chemical and biological characteristics. Soil microorganisms are the core and key to maintaining soil health. The present research aims to determine the impact of straw return to different depths on soil health index (SHI) and crop productivity across different soil layers. We conducted a 3–year field experiment with four treatments: a blank control with no straw return (NR), straw return treatments with shallow return (SR), mulch return (MR) and deep return (DR), and the straw application rate was 10,500 kg/ha. The results showed that it was the microbial indicators that dominated the effects on soil health, rather than soil organic carbon (SOC). Specifically, we found that the SR treatment exhibited the highest extracellular enzyme activities of both hydrolases and oxidases in the subsoil, and the peroxidase (PEO) activity was 758.99 nmol/g/h. In addition, compared with MR and DR treatments, the abundance of symbiotroph fungi in SR treatment increased by 78.41% and 54.38%, releasing more nutrients to the soil. Hence, SR treatment increased SHI mainly by increasing the PEO activity and NO3−–N content, and SR treatment significantly increased SHI by 25.59% and 22.16% compared with MR and DR treatments. By contrast, the DR treatment greatly increased the topsoil SHI by 43.33% and 58.98% compared with SR and SM treatments, mainly due to the enhanced microbial biomass N (MBN) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). The DR treatment in topsoil had the lowest soil bulk density (BD) which enhanced Bacteroidota but decreased Methylomirabilota abundance, thus resulting in the accumulation of MBN. Moreover, DR treatment led the highest maize yield which increased with an increasing SHI. To conclude, DR treatment is an effective method to improve SHI and crop productivity in nutrient-rich topsoil, while SR treatment has a much better effect in the subsoil. Our results will provide a theoretical paradigm for selecting straw return strategies, which is crucial for promoting soil health and food productivity, achieving high crop yields, and supporting sustainable agricultural development. © 2024 British Society of Soil Science.",Not About Sufficiency
Additively manufactured fine-grained ultrahigh-strength bulk aluminum alloys with nanostructured strengthening defects,"In response to the critical need for lightweight designs and carbon neutrality, we introduce an innovative additively manufactured ultrafine-grained Al-Mg-Mn-Sc-Zr alloy reinforced with nano-structured planar defects via laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), developed for complex-shaped parts that demand high strength and superior ductility. Owing to the uneven distribution of the L12-ordered Al3(Sc, Zr) nanoparticles, the as-printed alloy demonstrates a hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure featuring a triple-modal grain distribution. Tailored planar defects comprising stacking faults, 9R phase and nanotwins are strategically introduced in the as-printed alloy. Beyond the nano-scaled planar defects and the triple-modal grain distribution, further direct ageing process augments the abundance of nanoprecipitates, collectively boosting the yield strength to 656 MPa, which is higher than almost all L-PBFed Al alloys hitherto reported, and a decent ductility of 7.2 %. This work paves the way for the near net shape forming of high-performance Al alloy components for advanced structural applications. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Indices and methods for evaluating gross ecosystem product in sea areas: a case study in Changdao County, China","Introduction: Coastal nations heavily rely on their sea areas to achieve sustainable socioeconomic development. Sea areas offer abundant marine ecosystem products and services that are difficult to substitute with industrial goods. Although considerable research has been performed to evaluate the contribution offrom the marine ecosystems to human well-being, systematic and measurable indices are lacking. Methods: To address this knowledge gap, ecosystem service theory was used to establish a framework for assessing the gross ecosystem product (GEP) of a sea area, which represents the total monetary value of final ecosystem products directly and indirectly used by people within a specific administrative jurisdiction in one year. To evaluate marine GEP, three primary indices, i.e., material products, regulating products, and cultural products, were employed, and they consist of eight secondary indices. Material products in the sea area include aquatic products and oxygen products; regulating products include carbon sequestration, climate regulation, waste treatment, and coastal protection; and cultural products include leisure and recreation, and seascape-added value. The marine GEP was calculated for the administrative sea areas of Changdao County, which is located in the Yellow Sea-Bohai Sea transitional zone. Results and discussion: Our analysis indicated that from 2017 to 2019, the marine GEP in Changdao ranged between 32.59 and 33.35 billion Chinese yuan (CNY). Regulating products contributed two-thirds of this total value. However, over the three-year period, the marine GEP underwent a 5.64% decrease in Changdao. Specifically, the value of material products increased by 38.85% while that of regulating and cultural products decreased by 9.16% and 15.87%, respectively. Notably, the spatial distribution of ecosystem product values in Changdao displayed two prominent trends: (1) higher values along the coastal sea areas of islands and lower values in offshore sea areas; and (2) higher values in coastal areas of southern islands and lower values in coastal areas of northern islands. Marine GEP may serve as a comprehensive indicator for assessing the sustainability of marine ecosystem. Combining the assessment of both marine and terrestrial GEP facilitates an understanding of how marine and terrestrial ecosystems interact in coastal regions. Furthermore, the combined use of marine GEP and GDP helps better evaluate and sort the level of green development of coastal nations and regions.

Industrial Water Use Efficiency and Regional Deviations Among the Provinces Along the Yangtze River Economic Belt Under the“Double Carbon“Goals,"The implementation of industrial carbon peak action is an important task to achieve the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality (double carbon) goals. Improving industrial water efficiency is the key to achieve industrial low-carbon transformation, which lays a solid foundation for the carbon peak of industry in 2030. This paper fully considered the task of carbon peaking in the industrial field at the present stage, and incorporated water conservation and emission reduction into the input - output index system. By using the super - efficiency SBM model, Dagum Gini coefficient decomposition and convergence test, this study investigated industrial water efficiency and identified the gaps among the upper, middle and lower reaches of provinces along the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2010 to 2021. The empirical results showed that: (1) the overall improvement of industrial water use efficiency was slow, where Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces and Shanghai city ranked the top three. Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces showed relatively stable industrial water use efficiency. The industrial water use efficiency in Hunan Province was greatly improved. There existed a downward trend in industrial water use efficiency in Anhui and Guizhou provinces. (2) Both the overall gap and intra-regional gap of industrial water use efficiency demonstrated an enlarging trend. The upstream and downstream inter - regional gap and the fluctuation range were large. The interaction of inter-regional and intra-regional gap contributed the most to the overall gap. (3) The σ convergence characteristics of industrial water use efficiency were not obvious. The dispersion of different regions did not show a consistent decline over time. There was only a brief convergence trend from 2020 to 2021, but there were typical absolute 茁 convergence and conditional convergence characteristics in the whole sampling period. This implied that the regions with low industrial water use efficiency were struggling to narrow the gap between those with high industrial water use efficiency. Meanwhile, the industrial water use efficiency of each region would eventually converge to its own steady-state level. Therefore, in order to improve industrial water use efficiency in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, it is necessary to further enhance the ability of industrial technology innovation, accelerate the regional integration construction, and promote the industrial green development. © 2023 Resources and Environment in the Yangtze Basin.

"How can ecosystem status be more comprehensively reflected? A case study of Jinan City, China","Ecosystems provide benefits to human well-being, but highly concentrated human activities also cause environmental pressure. Previous studies focused only on one aspect: either ecosystem services (ESs) or ecosystem damage (ED). To provide comprehensive view of ecosystem status in the selected study area, an integrated ecosystem performance analytic framework was established based on the ED-ESs synergistic effect. This study quantitatively analyzed the dynamic variation in ecosystem status from both ED and ESs perspectives with a case study of Jinan City, China, from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that the environmental and economic impacts caused by pollution were 692.87 species.year and $15.58 × 108 in 2020, respectively, and they were mainly derived from energy consumption. Regarding ESs, three regulating services (water retention, soil retention, and carbon sequestration) increased from south to north, whereas material services presented the opposite trend. Ecosystem service value had declined after peaking in 2010 when material services contributed the most. Overall, the Jinan City suffered from ecosystem decline, with ecosystem performance on a downward trend from 2000 to 2020. Finally, the characterization factors of four ESs were appropriately incorporated into the life cycle impact assessment to drive the evolution in ecosystem performance calculations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

"A process simulation-based framework for resource, food, and ecology trade-off by optimizing irrigation and N management","Improving food production and resource utilization efficiency and mitigating the functional degradation of agroecosystems are major challenges worldwide. However, few studies have reconciled the conflicts among resources, food, and ecology (RFE) in agricultural production. This study develops a water–carbon–nitrogen process simulation-based framework for RFE trade-off by coupling the agro-hydrological model, i.e., AHC (Agro-Hydrological & chemical and Crop systems simulator) with the ecosystem service value (ESV) assessment method and decision-making method, i.e., VIKOR (VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje). The framework is capable of (1) quantifying farmland ESVs; (2) reconciling conflicts among resource utilization, food production and ecosystem development by optimizing farmland irrigation and nitrogen (N) application strategies (FINS). The framework was used to analyze the FINS, and then to obtain the compromise decision focusing on a lower negative ESV and the maximizing group utility decision focusing on a higher yield and positive ESV for spring wheat farmland in Northwest China. Results indicated that under the local FINS, i.e., 450 mm irrigation and 340 kg ha−1 N application, the total ESV generated by spring wheat farmland per season was [4.76, 4.87] × 104 CNY ha−1. Among these ESVs, every 1 CNY ha−1 positive ESV generation was accompanied by approximately 0.11 CNY ha−1 negative ESV. Compared with the local FINS, the compromise decision, i.e., the FINS with 210 mm irrigation and 200 kg ha−1N application, significantly reduced negative ESV but caused slight losses in yield and positive ESV, while the maximizing group utility decision, i.e., the FINS with 210 mm irrigation and 260 kg ha−1N application, increased yield and positive ESV but resulted in a small negative ESV mitigation. Moreover, both FINSs could save irrigation water and N fertilizer resources, and improve water and N productivity to various degrees. This framework has excellent performance in reconciling conflicts among RFE systems and generating coordinated solutions and has potential to achieve sustainable development goals in agricultural RFE systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Research Progresses on Farmland Soil Ecosystem Multifunctionality,"Building healthy soil is a prerequisite for the improvement of cultivated land productivity. It is fundamental for meeting the challenges of food security and environmental protection as well as realizing the agricultural green development and a community of shared future. The core of building healthy soil is to realize the soil ecosystem multifunctionality. In the new era of ecological civilization construction, research on the evaluation and cultivation of soil multifunctionality, and the underlying mechanisms have become hotspots and frontiers of global soil health initiatives. In this paper, we systematically review the concepts of soil functions, soil ecosystem services and soil ecological multifunctionality. The impact of soil biodiversity on soil multifunctionality and the synergies and trade-offs between soil functions are discussed as well. Also, the approaches to evaluating and quantifying soil functions are summarized. Finally, we put forward the pathways of healthy soil cultivation based on the integrated regulation of soil multifunctionality beyond the single pursuit of high grain yield. Different strategies to increase soil multifunctionality are proposed: adjusting the way of land use and agricultural structure at the national scale, coordinating resource allocations at a regional scale, constructing agricultural infrastructure and landscape pattern at the landscape scale, and optimizing the field soil management practices to improve soil health and multifunctionality at the field scale. It is necessary to explore the maintenance mechanism of soil multifunctionality at different temporal and spatial scales, and to combine modern technologies with relevant policies and implementation plans for functional soil management, emphasizing the multi-dimensional role of soil multifunctionality in sustainable environmental policy and management. It will provide important support for the coordinated development of mountain, water, forest, farmland, lake and grass life community, and the implementation of the national strategy of carbon peak and carbon neutrality. © 2022 Science Press.

Using Green IoT as a Development Path of Green Trade Economy for Ecological Sustainable Development,"The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology and its incorporation into the trade economy has altered and improved our way of life and work. However, IoT technologies pose various issues in the green economy, including increased energy consumption, hazardous pollutants, and electronic waste. Therefore, green IoT contributes to a more environmentally friendly atmosphere that is more affordable for the green economy. As a result, it is critical to address tactics and strategies for decreasing pollution threats, traffic waste, resource utilization, energy usage, public safety, living standard, environmental sustainability, and cost management. Apart from these, the continual deepening of the trade economy has accelerated Shandong Province's rapid economic development, and the province's broad economic development mode had major negative consequences on the ecological environment. Based on the evolution of international commerce in Shandong Province and the present status of the ecological environment, this study first calculates the province's carbon emissions using the Kaya identity and derives the regression findings using the Eviews software. It examines the data link between the province's carbon emissions, energy consumption, and trade by determining the province's export carbon emissions from various industrial sectors. According to the statistics, the export carbon emissions of Shandong Province's ferrous metal rolling industry, chemical raw material production sector, and textile industry are relatively high, at 6.764 million tons, 5.502 million tons, and 3.918 million tons, respectively. The carbon emissions from the three industrial sectors mentioned above account for approximately 49% of total carbon emissions, which is a considerable reduction and in line with the concept of green IoT. © 2022 Xin Li.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying ecosystem service bundles and the spatiotemporal characteristics of trade-offs and synergies in coal mining areas with a high groundwater table,"Understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of the interactions among ecosystem services (ESs) is a crucial but challenging task for maintaining human well-being and achieving sustainable regional development. However, understanding the spatiotemporal interactions of multiple ESs at different grid scales and within different ecosystem services bundles (ESBs) is relatively limited, particularly in coal mining areas with a high groundwater table (CMA-HGT) where the land use has drastically changed as a result of mining subsidence. This study examines CMA-HGT in Huainan, aiming to identify ESBs and explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of trade-offs/synergies among ESs at distinct grid scales and ESBs. Five ESs relating to provisioning, regulation, and maintenance, including food production (FP), water yield (WY), soil conservation (SC), carbon sequestration (CS), and biodiversity maintenance (BM) were quantified using different biological models during the period 1987-2018. Spatiotemporal trade-offs/synergies among ESs were explored using correlation analysis and significance tests at different scales. The spatiotemporal distributions and main characteristics of distinct ESBs were identified using a self-organizing map (SOM) and Calinski criterion. The interactions among ESs in different ESBs were detected. Relationships between ESs and land use or coal production (CP) were explored using redundancy analysis (RDA). The results demonstrate that spatiotemporal trade-offs were generally observed among provisioning services at distinct grid scales and within different ESBs. Meanwhile, spatiotemporal synergies generally appeared between regulation and maintenance services at distinct grid scales. Interactions among ESs presented temporal dynamic, spatial heterogeneity and scales dependence due to the relationships of FP-BM or SC-CS had changed with the increasing of research scales. Three FSBs-ESB1, ESB2, and ESB3-were identified at a grid of scale of 1000 m, and their spatial locations varied across different periods, but the areas of variation covered less than 24% of the study area. BM was synergistic with FP, WY, SC, and CS; while WY had only a trade-off relationship with FP in ESB1. WY had trade-off relationships with FP, SC, CS, and BM in ESI32. In ESB3, BM was synergistic with FP, SC, and CS; while it was in a trade-off relationship with WY. Cultivated land, construction land and CP were the main driving factors in the WSA, ESB1, ESB2 and ESB3. There was a certain degree of change in the relationships between ESs and land use/CP, and the relationships among ESs at different grid scales and ESBs over time and space, which indicates strong regional heterogeneity and scale dependence. These results can provide detailed guidelines for formulating spatially targeted ecosystem management, restoration programs and ES payment policies. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

"Optimizing the Compensation Standard of Cultivated Land Protection Based on Ecosystem Services in the Hangzhou Bay Area, China","The significant positive externality of cultivated land ecosystem services leads to the low comparative benefit of cultivated land utilization and then causes practical problems such as the abandonment and non-agriculturalization of the cultivated land, which poses a threat to China's food security. The existing protection system only focuses on the quantity requirement and food production service of cultivated land and ignores the multi-function of cultivated land as an ecosystem, resulting in insufficient incentives and poor effect. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the protection's economic compensation standard by adding the cultivated land's ecosystem service value in order to comprehensively assess cultivated land resources and correct for externalities. Taking the area around Hangzhou Bay, where the contradiction between cultivated land protection and economic development is prominent, as an example, the values of six typical cultivated land ecosystem services in 2016 was constructed and calculated, including food production, carbon sequestration and oxygen production, water conservation, soil conservation, biodiversity maintenance, and cultural leisure. Combined with ecosystem services' values and the quality index, we finally determined the new county-level compensation standard of cultivated land protection in the Hangzhou Bay area. The results show that the value of cultivated land ecosystem services present obvious regional disparities, meaning that there exist significant differences in the sustainable use capacity of cultivated land and the necessity of establishing grading compensation standards in the region. Finally, we analyze the rationality and innovation of the new compensation standard model as well as its role in the protection of cultivated land and look forward to promoting the sustainable use of cultivated land through these new incentives.",Not About Sufficiency
"Empirical research on the relationship between marine biodiversity damage and economic growth in coastal areas, China","Marine biodiversity is fundamental to the provision of Marine ecosystem services. Protecting Marine biodiversity is not only essential to the functioning of the earth′s ecosystems, but also closely related to human well-being. Based on the indicators of Marine ecosystem health and species diversity damage in China′s coastal provinces, this paper use panel regression model to analyze the relationship between economic growth and Marine biodiversity damage in China′s coastal areas. The results showed that:(1) there is a significant linear relationship between the sub-health degree of Marine ecosystems and the economic growth in coastal areas. With the economic growth, the sub-health status of typical Marine ecosystems has a continuous upward trend. In addition, the implementation of pollution charge system and the establishment of Marine nature reserves are conducive to suppress the deterioration of Marine ecosystem. (2) There is an inverted U- shaped relationship between the damage of Marine species diversity and the economic growth of coastal areas. The turning point was 45,145 yuan per capita GDP. With economic growth, the damage of Marine species diversity increase first and then decrease. From the perspective of time trajectory, the inflection point of species diversity damage corresponds to the time stage from 2009 to 2010. From the perspective of spatial distribution, Hainan province, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Hebei Province are still in the rising part of the curve, The economic growth level of Shandong, Liaoning, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Fujian provinces has passed the inflection point value, those provinces are in the curve decline stage. The pollution charge system is beneficial to suppress the Marine species diversity damage, but the current industrial structure in coastal areas aggravate the Marine species diversity damage. According to the results of empirical analysis, we know that if the economic growth is based on the destruction of the ecological environment, it is bound to cause damage to biodiversity. Even though there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between Marine species diversity and economic growth in coastal areas, there is still no inflection point between economic growth and Marine ecosystem health, so the sub-health of Marine ecosystem may further lead to the loss of Marine biodiversity, forming a vicious circle. some suggestions are put forward to protect and manage Marine biodiversity:(1) we should strengthen biodiversity protection, broaden the ways of Marine biodiversity protection, and ensure the diversity of Marine biodiversity protection methods;(2) we should maintain a green and sustainable pattern of economic development and promote industrial restructuring and upgrading. meanwhile, we should guide the smart growth of coastal areas and prevent the occupation of coastal wetlands and large-scale reclamation of land due to blind pursuit of economic growth. © 2022 Science Press.

The hidden risk in China's cropland conversion from the perspective of slope,"Cropland conversion is a significant theme of the influence of human activities on ecological systems and global food security. Conventionally, cropland conversion in China has been deemed to match the dynamic balance of cropland resources well and to ensure food security for the whole country. However, local studies have presented some conflicting signs that call for an integrated analysis from a national viewpoint. In this paper, by considering the significance of slope in cropland-related natural and socioeconomic issues, we explore the slope features of China's cropland conversion during 2000-2015 and endeavor to identify some potential risks hidden in the process. High-resolution remotely sensed images, digital elevation model and spatial analytical methods are adopted to conduct the analysis. The results show that, the features of cropland conversion in diverse slope division areas are all distinct. Some risks indicated by these conversion features can be identified as follows: (1) unsuitable reclamation of cropland in flat areas causes ecological damage, (2) the invasion of sparsely populated construction land on cropland in steep areas has a dramatic impact on the local area, (3) excessive greening in Northwest and Northeast China, and insufficient greening in Southwest China are not healthy for regional sustainability, (4) cropland's upslope reclamation and downslope loss pose potential risks for food security. In the context of dynamic balance management and other related national policies, cropland conversion in China is not as optimistic as former surveys have indicated, and promoted measures should be elaborately adjusted based on local conditions.",Not About Sufficiency
Responses of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Productivity to Droughts in China,"The terrestrial ecosystem productivity (hereafter, TEP) is a key index of global carbon cycles and a fundamental constraint of carbon sequestration capacity, and also an important measure of ecosystem services and food security. However, the TEP has been significantly affected by the long-lasting droughts. Identifying the spatial relationship between droughts and the TEP is crucial for enhancing ecosystem services in China. Here the net primary production (hereafter, NPP) derived from the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model (CASA-NPP) and two drought indices, namely the Standard Precipitation Index (hereafter, SPI) and the Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index (hereafter, SPEI), are used to examine the spatial relationship between droughts and the NPP in China for the period of 1982-2012. Our main results have shown that: (1) China's annual NPP has increased slowly from 3.82 to 4.35 PgC per year (hereafter, PgC/yr), while droughts have become much severer from 1982 to 2012; (2) on the 3-month timescale, the NPP in arid and semi-arid ecosystems has decreased at a rate of 1.28 TgC per month with per ""unit"" decrease in the drought index (indicating drier conditions). (3) Overall, the NPP in China has increased 5.71 TgC per month with per ""unit"" increase in the drought index (indicating wetter conditions); the contribution of this NPP increase is mainly from forests and farmlands; (4) the SPEI is a relatively more effective and sensitive index in representing China's droughts. In southern China, the lagging period for the NPP response to droughts is about 3-month, while a 6-month lagging period is found in the arid and semi-arid ecosystems in northern China.",Not About Sufficiency
An analysis of research hotspots and modeling techniques on carbon capture and storage,"With the significant role that carbon capture and storage (CCS) could play in limiting the future temperature increase to below 2 °C higher than pre-industrialization levels, a growing research interest of CCS is attracted to the environmental, economic, and social field. However, a bibliometric analysis-based comprehensive review of CCS which covers mainly all industry sectors and all regions of the globe has not been made yet. To provide deeper insight into the research trends, this study employs a bibliometric analysis to examine the basic features of the literature from 1997 to 2017 and identifies the key research hotspots and modeling techniques by reviewing the current status and new efforts. Based on the analysis of the temporal and spatial trends, disciplines and journals distribution, institutions, authors, and citations, the publications relating to the environmental, economic and social aspects of CCS are assessed. The results indicate that the total number of publications has rapidly increased since 2006 and entered a stable stage. The most productive country, journal, institute, and author are the USA, International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, United State Department of Energy, and Rubin E S, respectively. Based on the co-occurrence analysis of keywords, five hot research topics in CCS are recognized, including tackling climate change, CCS technology prospects, cost estimates, sectoral applications, and social attitudes. In addition, three main methodologies including life cycle analysis, optimization methods, and real options methods used in quantifying the social, economic, and environmental impacts of CCS are thoroughly refined based on selection, limitation, and improvement. Finally, the recommendations for CCS future work concerning environmental, economic, and social aspects are proposed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Heatwave trends and the population exposure over China in the 21st century aswell as under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C globalwarmer future scenarios,"Heatwaves exert negative socio-economic impacts and particularly have serious effects on public health. Based on the multi-model ensemble (MME) results of 10 downscaled high-resolution Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) model output from NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NASA-GDDP), the intensity (largest lasting time), frequency and total duration of heatwaves over China as well as population exposure in the 21st century and at 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C above pre-industrial levels are investigated by using the three indices, the HeatWave Duration Index (HWDI), annual total frequency of heatwaves (N_HW) and annual total days of heatwaves (T_HW) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The MME results illustrate that heatwaves are projected to become more frequent (0.40/decade and 1.26/decade for N_HW), longer-lasting (3.78 days/decade and 14.59 days/decade for T_HW) as well as more extreme (1.07 days/decade and 2.90 days/decade for HWDI under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively) over China. High latitude and high altitude regions, e.g., the Tibetan Plateau and northern China, are projected to experience a larger increase of intensity, frequency and the total time of heatwaves compared with southern China (except Central China). The total population affected by heatwaves is projected to increase significantly and will reach 1.18 billion in later part of the 21st century, and there will be more and more people expected to suffer long heatwave time (T_HW) in the 21st century. Compared with a 2.0 °C global warming climate, holding the global warming below 1.5 °C can avoid 26.9% and 29.1% of the increase of HWDI, 34.7% and 39.64% for N_TW and 35.3%-40.10% of T_HW under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively. The half-degree less of warming will not only decrease the population exposure by 53-83 million but also avoid the threat caused by longer heatwave exposure under the two scenarios. Based on the comprehensive assessment of heatwave under the two RCP scenarios, this work would help to enhance the understanding of climate change and consequent risk in China and thus could provide useful information for making climate adaptation policies. © 2019 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Positive effects of apple branch biochar on wheat yield only appear at a low application rate, regardless of nitrogen and water conditions","Purpose: The agriculture industry is under intense pressure to produce more food with a lower environmental impact, while also mitigating climate change. Biochar has the potential to improve food security while improving soil fertility and sequestering carbon. The aim of our research was to evaluate the effects of apple branch biochar on wheat yield and soil nutrients under different nitrogen (N) and water conditions. Materials and methods: Durum wheat was grown for nearly 6 months in pots with silt clay soil supplemented with apple branch biochar. The biochar was applied at five rates (0, 1, 2, 4, and 6% w/w; B0, B1, B2, B3, and B4), and N fertilizer was applied at three rates (0, 0.2, and 0.4 g kg−1; N0, N1, and N2). From the jointing to maturation stages, the soil water content was controlled at two rates to simulate sufficient water and drought conditions (75 and 45% of field capacity; W1 and W2). After harvest, we investigated grain yield and soil nutrient status. Results and discussion: The application of biochar alone had a positive effect on wheat production and soil nutrients, especially under sufficient water conditions. Compared with the addition of N fertilizer alone, the addition of biochar at B1 and B2 combined with N fertilizer under sufficient water conditions increased the crop yield by 7.40 to 12.00%, whereas this was not the case under drought stress. Furthermore, regardless of water conditions, compared with N fertilizer application alone, a high rate of biochar application (B3 and B4) led to a significant decrease in the grain yield of approximately 6.25–21.83%. Biochar had strong effects on soil nutrients, with NO3 − and available phosphorus contents and the C:N ratio exerting the greatest effects on wheat yield. Conclusions: The effects of biochar on wheat production and soil nutrients varied with the biochar application rate, N fertilizer application rate, and water conditions. Drought stress weakened or offset the positive effect of biochar on crop production, especially under the high-N level (N2) conditions. The optimum application combination was 1% (or possibly even less) apple branch biochar (B1) and moderate N fertilizer (N1). © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Physicochemical assessment of a waste rock dump in the hidden valley gold mine: a case study for bioremediation in Papua New Guinea,"Deforestation, environmental degradation, and pollution from the mining activities are much studied global environmental concerns. The effect of waste rock dumping from mining activity on the forest soil characters and suitability of waste rock dumps for bioremediation is least explored. Such information is necessary for making rehabilitation decisions. In this study, soil physicochemical characteristics and some index polluting elements were assessed in the waste rock dump stations (n = 16) and adjacent natural forest stations (n = 14) in a gold mine situated in the Morobe province of Papua New Guinea. Results indicated that the waste rock dump was poorer in organic C, but rich in available P, exchangeable Ca and Mg contents, and extractable Cu and Mn. Comparison of established diagnostic norms for potential sufficiency and toxicity of nutrient elements with those observed in the study indicated that organic carbon content, exchangeable K, Ca and Mg as well as, extractable Cu content was at an insufficient level in a majority of stations of waste rock dump for arable crops. Besides, the mean Cd content of waste rock dump was 15-times greater than that in forest stations while that of extractable Mn was 400-fold higher. Findings of the study warranted the use of adaptable and hardy forest species instead of arable crops for safe bioremediation of waste rock dump. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate-driven oscillation of phosphorus and iron limitation in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre,"The supply of nutrients is a fundamental regulator of ocean productivity and carbon sequestration. Nutrient sources, sinks, residence times, and elemental ratios vary over broad scales, including those resulting from climate-driven changes in upper water column stratification, advection, and the deposition of atmospheric dust. These changes can alter the proximate elemental control of ecosystem productivity with cascading ecological effects and impacts on carbon sequestration. Here, we report multi-decadal observations revealing that the ecosystem in the eastern region of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) oscillates on subdecadal scales between inorganic phosphorus (Pi) sufficiency and limitation, when Pi concentration in surface waters decreases below 50-60 nmol.kg(-1). In situ observations and model simulations suggest that sea-level pressure changes over the northwest Pacific may induce basin-scale variations in the atmospheric transport and deposition of Asian dust-associated iron (Fe), causing the eastern portion of the NPSG ecosystem to shift between states of Fe and Pi limitation. Our results highlight the critical need to include both atmospheric and ocean circulation variability when modeling the response of open ocean pelagic ecosystems under future climate change scenarios.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimization of Parameters for the Detoxification of Cr(VI) by the Microbial Consortium Developed from the Isolates of Chromite Mines,"Hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) is one of the ubiquitous contaminants in Odisha since it is being a rich belt of chromite mines. Discharged water from the mines to the surface water bodies consists of Cr(VI) above permissible limit which can cause numerous health effects. Bioremediation can be an eco-friendly remedy to detoxify the Cr(VI) in which Chromium resistant microorganisms can be used. Three chromium resistant organisms were isolated from the ore soil of chromite mines. Isolated organisms were identified as Serratia nematodiphila, Bacillus cereus and Kocuria rosea using 16S rRNA sequencing. A bacterial consortium was developed with the isolated organisms after their acclimatization. The process parameters such as pH, temperature, inoculum size, inoculum age and carbon source were optimized for maximum Cr(VI) reduction by one variable at a time method. Optimization results revealed that pH of 8.5 and the temperature of 35 °C were the optimum conditions and glucose was an effective carbon source. The Cr(VI) reduction was more effective at the inoculum age of 24 h and 4% of inoculum volume. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to evaluate the effect of three independent variables including pH, temperature and carbon source concentration on the Cr(VI) reduction. The presence of chromium in the microorganisms after the treatment was observed using SEM monograph and EDX spectra data. The maximum specific growth rate (µ max) of consortium was 0.1899 h−1 at the initial Cr(VI) of 5 mg/L. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
"The roles of humans and apex predators in sustaining ecosystem structure and function: Contrast, complementarity and coexistence","In nearly every ecosystem, human predators (hunters and fishers) exploit animals at extraordinarily high rates, as well as target different age classes and phenotypes, compared to other apex predators. Demographically decoupled from prey populations and technologically advanced, humans now impose widespread and significant ecological and evolutionary change. In this paper, we investigate whether there is evidence that humans provide complementary services and whether ecosystem services of predators can be maintained by humans where wild predators are lost. Our objective is to contribute to two key ecological themes: the compatibility of human harvesting within ecosystems and management approaches in consideration of the intentional or unintentional loss of predators. We reviewed evidence for five key effects of predators: natural selection of prey, disease dynamics, landscape effects, carbon cycling and human well-being. Without carefully designed management strategies, such changes can impose harm to ecosystems and their constituents, including humankind. Ultimately, we applied this information to consider management paradigms in which humans could better support the role of, and potentially behave more like, apex predators and discuss the challenges to such coexistence.

"Ecosystem services: Origins, contributions, pitfalls, and alternatives","The concept of ecosystem services (ES) has taken the environmental science and policy literature by storm, and has become almost the approach to thinking about and assessing the nature-society relationship. In this review, we ask whether and in what way the ES concept is a useful way of organising research on the nature-society relationship. We trace the evolution of the different versions of the concept and identify key points of convergence and divergence. The essence of the concept nevertheless is that the contribution of biotic nature to human well-being is unrecognised and undervalued, which results in destruction of ecosystems. We discuss why this formulation has attracted ecologists and summarise the resultant contributions to research, particularly to the understanding of indirect or regulating services. We then outline three sets of weaknesses in the ES framework: confusion over ecosystem functions and biodiversity, omission of dis-services, trade-offs and abiotic nature, and the use of an economic valuation framework to measure and aggregate human well-being. Underlying these weaknesses is a narrow problem frame that is unidimensional in its environmental concern and techno-economic in its explanation of environmental degradation. We argue that an alternative framing that embraces broader concerns and incorporates multiple explanations would be more useful, and outline how this approach to understanding the nature-society relationship may be implemented.",Not About Sufficiency
Global Solar Droughts Due To Supply-Demand Imbalance Exacerbated by Anthropogenic Climate Change,"Solar power will become the largest renewable energy source, contributing to global carbon neutrality. In addition to the well-recognized temporal intermittency of solar energy supply, the local energy demand to cope with extreme weathers can further stress the energy grid; both the supply and demand can be greatly influenced by future climate change. Here, we redefine solar drought events by considering supply demand imbalance in solar power. Observation and multi-model simulations reveal an anthropogenic exacerbation of global solar drought frequency in the past three decades. Moreover, compared to the pathway SSP2-4.5, the carbon neutrality pathway SSP1-2.6 can mitigate the increasing frequency and severity of solar droughts by 60% and 63% in the 2090s, respectively. Our study suggests a co-benefit of solar energy stability and security toward carbon neutrality, especially in developing nations where the local supply demand imbalance is a major issue. © 2024.

The synergistic effect between Renewable Portfolio Standards and carbon emission trading system: A perspective of China,"Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and carbon emission trading (CET) system are the top-level system design of China's energy low-carbon transformation, which have great strategic significance for realizing the “carbon peak in 2030 and carbon neutrality in 2060”. At present, China's tradable green certificates market and CET market are still in the initial stage. The implementation single system may have diverse trials and errors in its initial stage, and the market activity and transaction frequency are low. Therefore, this paper aims to explore whether the synergistic effect between the two systems can effectively promote China's energy low-carbon transformation. This paper establishes the system dynamic model of the synergistic effect between the RPS and CET in China's electricity market to reveal the influence mechanism and the synergistic effect. The results show that: (1) There is a positive synergistic effect between the RPS and CET, which will change with the institutional parameters. (2) The simultaneous implementation of the RPS and CET can effectively stimulate market vitality and promote the development of the renewable energy industry. (3) Higher quota and lower benchmark price can optimize power source structure, and improve social welfare and institutional performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The Economic Value of New Sustainable Products: The Case of Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) Hybrid Solar Collectors,"Among green energy technologies, solar power is a promising technology in the net-zero era of the power industry. Conventional solar modules have decreasing efficiency weaknesses as the temperature rises, whereas photovoltaic thermal (PVT) systems do not remove heat from the module or lower the temperature. However, the profitability of PVT systems has been underestimated. The profitability of new convergence products, such as PVT technology, entering the market for the first time allows for the evaluation of the appropriate starting price and policy requirements to support the product’s market entrance. We used the contingent valuation method (CVM) to solve this problem. The survey derived the respondents’ mean willingness to pay (WTP) and the total amount of social benefits. Among these CVM models, the one-and-one-half-bound (OOHB) spike model was used to distinguish zero WTP. Based on a survey of 300 households, respondents were willing to pay an additional yearly average income tax of KRW 10,608 (USD 7.90), and the total social benefit of PVT technology was calculated to be KRW 145 billion (USD 108 million). This result shows that individuals evaluate the value of PVT as 3.69% of their monthly electricity bill and 2.8% of their monthly gas bill. Several additional factors that influence WTP were analyzed, indicating a high possibility of PVT adoption by individuals who have replaced or are planning to replace photovoltaic (PV) modules. This study is significant because it examines the economic value of PVT and proposes a focus group for the effective market entry of new carbon neutrality products. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Implications on equity in agricultural carbon market projects: a gendered analysis of access, decision making, and outcomes","Carbon market projects have focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, often at the expense of achieving sustainable development goals. A central pillar in sustainable development is equity, yet most projects pay little attention to equity implications for underrepresented farmers, especially women. Agricultural carbon market projects that explicitly seek to promote sustainable agricultural land management practices are quickly gaining attention worldwide for their promise to deliver the triple-win': adaptation, food security, and mitigation. Previous experience with other payment for ecosystem services projects indicate that women often are marginalized and their needs ignored. To address this gap, this case study examined the Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project with a focus on gender equity in access, decision making, and outcomes. Results show that women had less access to joining the project than men, because they did not have the same level of influence in decision making at a household level. At the project level, both men and women had little influence in establishing project requirements and potential benefits, as these were decided upon prior to farmer recruitment. Regarding outcomes, women tended to participate in more project activities, and would in return reap more nonmonetary benefits than men. However, the costs involved in achieving these benefits was nontrivial: women's farm labor time increased significantly due to the substantial time and effort required to implement sustainable agricultural land management practices. If agricultural soil carbon market projects are to achieve better outcomes by addressing equity issues, they need to pay special attention to gender and the differing needs of farmersmale, female, young, old, poor, and less poorby involving them at the project design stage. Our findings show the importance of additional project benefits unrelated to carbon income for addressing the requirements of equity perceived by both the implementing agency and women themselves.",Not About Sufficiency
Future battlegrounds for conservation under global change,"Global biodiversity is under significant threat from the combined effects of human-induced climate and land-use change. Covering 12% of the Earth's terrestrial surface, protected areas are crucial for conserving biodiversity and supporting ecological processes beneficial to human well-being, but their selection and design are usually uninformed about future global change. Here, we quantify the exposure of the global reserve network to projected climate and land-use change according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and set these threats in relation to the conservation value and capacity of biogeographic and geopolitical regions. We find that geographical patterns of past human impact on the land cover only poorly predict those of forecasted change, thus revealing the inadequacy of existing global conservation prioritization templates. Projected conservation risk, measured as regional levels of land-cover change in relation to area protected, is the greatest at high latitudes (due to climate change) and tropics/subtropics (due to land-use change). Only some high-latitude nations prone to high conservation risk are also of high conservation value, but their high relative wealth may facilitate additional conservation efforts. In contrast, most low-latitude nations tend to be of high conservation value, but they often have limited capacity for conservation which may exacerbate the global biodiversity extinction crisis. While our approach will clearly benefit from improved land-cover projections and a thorough understanding of how species range will shift under climate change, our results provide a first global quantitative demonstration of the urgent need to consider future environmental change in reserve-based conservation planning. They further highlight the pressing need for new reserves in target regions and support a much extended 'north-south' transfer of conservation resources that maximizes biodiversity conservation while mitigating global climate change. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Not About Sufficiency
"Co-simulation for thermodynamic coupling of crops in buildings. Case study of free-running schools in Quito, Ecuador","Rooftop farms can improve a building's thermal and energy performance, especially for uninsulated free-running buildings. The non-refurbished educational building stock lacks indoor comfort related to temperature and high CO2 concentration, and could benefit from the thermal insulation, food security and social cohesion provided by rooftop farms. However, to assess the adequacy of such strategies, building energy simulations need to include the thermal effect of plants. This study develops a novel co-simulation to leverage the transient flow exchange between crops and buildings by incorporating the plant's heat and mass balances in building simulation. This co-simulation allows an online closed-loop computation using Energy Plus for building energy modelling and MATLAB for crops modelling. The latter solves three agronomical sub-models: 1) crop's growth, 2) energy balance, and 3) net photosynthesis. This dynamic crop's growth function reflects how crops development affects heat, mass and CO2 flows. This co-simulation was first applied to assess the thermal coupling of three rooftop farm systems in two free-running archetype schools in Quito, Ecuador. The assessed rooftop farms were: edible green roofs, hydroponic rooftop greenhouses, and thermally integrated rooftop greenhouses. Results showed that rooftop farms are adequate to improve thermal comfort conditions and air quality in classrooms and diminish thermal demand. Integrated rooftop greenhouses achieve the best overall performance with a 42% decrement in thermal load, a 0.7 °C increment in indoor temperature, and a 40% reduction in hours exceeding CO2 concentration limits, despite a 2.94 kWh/m2 rise in electricity demand. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Creative approaches in engaging the community toward ecological waste management and wetland conservation,"Wetlands play an important role in biodiversity conservation and protection from climate change events. However, they are also faced with serious environmental issues arising from human activities such as industrial and agricultural development, tourism, and settlements growth. As a result, these bodies of water have become a dumping ground of waste, which has affected aquatic life and habitats. Marine litter is now one of the largest contributors to the decline of the quality of water bodies and the demise of biological diversity. Changing this pattern requires a menu of interventions consisting of policy, behavioral change, hard infrastructure, and sustained education. This entails a shift in thinking from linear to circular economy where 4Rs (refuse, reuse, reduce, and recycle) principles are adopted. At the government level, policies geared toward eliminating single-use plastic from the waste stream and incentives for environment-friendly materials need to be crafted. At the community-level, innovative, and game-changing education campaigns make a difference in transforming behavior and attitudes. Likewise, engineering interventions need to be put in place that use indigenous and appropriate materials and built from local knowledge and practices. This chapter presents an intervention framework to reverse wetland degradation emanating from indiscriminate and improper waste disposal from industrial, agricultural, and settlement activities. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

"Cattle, climate and complexity: food security, quality and sustainability of the Australian cattle industries","Background: Marked increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations are largely associated with the release of sequestered carbon in fossil fuels. While emissions of green-house gasses (GHG) from cattle have significant global warming potential, these are biogenic sources and substantially involve carbon in natural cycles, rather than fossil fuel. Cattle use human inedible feeds and by-products of human food production to produce nutrient-dense foods of great value to humans. Interventions to reduce GHG production: Reductions in land clearing and burning of grasslands and increased carbon sequestration in soils and trees have potential to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Increased efficiencies of production through intensified feeding and enteric modification have markedly reduced intensity of GHG emissions for cattle in Australia. Genetic selection for lower emissions has modest, but cumulative potential to reduce GHG (mostly CH4) emissions and intensity. Improved reproductive performance can reduce intensity of GHG emissions, especially in beef production. Feeds and technologies that reduce GHG production and intensity include improved pastures, grain feeding, dietary lipids, nitrates, ionophores, seaweed, 3-NOP, hormonal growth promotants in beef, and improved diets for peri-parturient dairy cattle. There is considerable potential to further reduce emissions from cattle using the technologies reviewed. Interventions to reduce heat stress: Cattle are susceptible to heat stress and ameliorating interventions include tree and shelter belts, shade, housing, cooling with fans and water and dietary manipulations. Conclusions: Numerous interventions can reduce GHG emissions and intensity from cattle. There are opportunities to increase carbon capture and maintain biodiversity in Australia's extensive rangelands, but these require quantification and application. We can reduce the intensity of CH4 emissions for cattle in Australia and simultaneously improve their well-being. © 2021 Australian Veterinary Association.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatio-seasonal patterns of demersal fish communities on the French Guiana Coast,"Estuarine and coastal areas are often considered as hotspots due to their high diversity and ecological importance. However, communities living on those areas are often submitted to fishery and climate change pressures causing modifications on fish assemblages. French Guiana's coastal shelf is characterised by warm waters with high turbidity and low salinity caused by the large river discharges from the Amazon and nearby estuaries. The high productivity of these areas supports fisheries and aquaculture activities. However, the structure and dynamics of coastal fish populations in French Guiana have seldom been studied. The aim of this study was to understand the effect of environmental conditions, as well as the influence of the coast and nearby estuaries on the spatio-seasonal variability of demersal fish communities living in shallow coastal waters (less than 20m depth). Data were collected from two fishing campaigns using a multi-filament drifting net during the rainy and dry season at 55 sampling stations along the coast. Results showed a high spatial patchiness and no clear seasonal pattern. Higher abundances and diversities were observed near estuaries where both marine and estuarine species were cohabitating. The high number of rare species and the aggregative behaviour recorded in this study suggest that those communities could be particularly affected by climate change, pollution and overfishing. In the light of increasing pressures expected in this area, new regulations and management programs should be developed to ensure food security and biodiversity conservation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
A Socio-economic Approach for Coastal Zone Assessment,"The PEGASO project (People for Ecosystem based Governance in Assessing Sustainable development of Ocean and coast) develops an ICZM governance platform which aims at producing integrated assessments in support of policy making decision for the sustainable development of the Mediterranean coastal zone. This paper presents the socio-economic approach developed for the assessment of the ""Bouches du Rhone"" (France) where conflicting uses and coastal waters pollutions are common management issues. In order to support decision-making, the socio-economic assessment intend to i) identify indicators at appropriate scales, ii) produce a clear overview of socio-economic pressures and associated environmental degradation, iii) analyse the existing links between ecosystem services production and human well-being and iv) underline the cost of management responses. This paper outlines detailed methodological approach developed for this task and the first results obtained in a case study dealing with the analysis of seaside tourism, nautical activities and coastal water quality.",Not About Sufficiency
"Biodiversity, genetic resources and intellectual property","The ongoing debates about access to and commercial use of biodiversity and genetic resources, and the application of intellectual property over gene-based products and technologies, have attracted a huge body of academic commentary and critique. While these debates have continued with some progress at international and national levels, there remains a number of issues that are yet to be addressed. The new dimension to the ongoing debates about biodiversity, genetic resources and intellectual property is the growing use of new biological technologies and knowledge systems such as genetics, genomics, synthetic biology and bioinformatics. These technologies and knowledge systems have made genetic resources more valuable because of their potential to address the pressing global challenges of agricultural growth, food security, public health, climate change and environmental sustainability, including meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. To deliver on potential solutions to these global challenges the demand for the use of the materials of biodiversity and genetic resources is rising, but the perennial questions of who can provide or obtain access to these resources, who gains the benefits from such access, and how to ensure that genetic resources are accessed and used in a fair and equitable way still remain. Perhaps the turning point for the current debates about access to and use of biodiversity and genetic resources can be traced to the adoption of the United Nations’ Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 19921 that formally recognised the sovereignty of Nation States to control their biodiversity and genetic resources. While there had been important developments preceding this international agreement2 - for example under the Antarctic Treaty in 1950s, 3 the Outer Space Treaty in the 1960s, the Convention on the Law of the Sea in the 1970s/19804 and the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in the 1980s5 - it was the CBD that delivered 1 (1992) 1760 UNTS 79 (CBD). 2 See Charles Lawson, Regulating Genetic Resources: Access and Benefit-sharing in International Law (Edward Elgar, 2012). 3 (1959) 19 ILM 860. 4 (1982) 1833 UNTS 3. © 2018 Taylor and Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
Life at the borderlands: microbiomes of interfaces critical to One Health,"Microbiomes are foundational components of the environment that provide essential services relating to food security, carbon sequestration, human health, and the overall well-being of ecosystems. Microbiota exert their effects primarily through complex interactions at interfaces with their plant, animal, and human hosts, as well as within the soil environment. This review aims to explore the ecological, evolutionary, and molecular processes governing the establishment and function of microbiome–host relationships, specifically at interfaces critical to One Health—a transdisciplinary framework that recognizes that the health outcomes of people, animals, plants, and the environment are tightly interconnected. Within the context of One Health, the core principles underpinning microbiome assembly will be discussed in detail, including biofilm formation, microbial recruitment strategies, mechanisms of microbial attachment, community succession, and the effect these processes have on host function and health. Finally, this review will catalogue recent advances in microbiology and microbial ecology methods that can be used to profile microbial interfaces, with particular attention to multi-omic, advanced imaging, and modelling approaches. These technologies are essential for delineating the general and specific principles governing microbiome assembly and functions, mapping microbial interconnectivity across varying spatial and temporal scales, and for the establishment of predictive frameworks that will guide the development of targeted microbiome-interventions to deliver One Health outcomes. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Moving on to Greener Pastures? A Review of South Africa’s Housing Megaproject Literature,"South Africa is a leader in the scholarship on green urbanism in the Global South, but academic progress has not translated to broad implementation. Notably, government-subsidized housing projects have produced peripheral developments featuring low build quality, conventional gray infrastructure, and deficient socio-economic and environmental amenities. Declining delivery and increasing informal settlement spawned a 2014 shift to housing megaprojects to increase output and improve living conditions, socio-economic integration, and sustainability. The shift offered opportunities for a normative focus on greener development mirrored in the discourse surrounding project descriptions. Yet, the level of enactment has remained unclear. In reflecting on these points, this paper employs environmental justice as a theoretical framework and completes a comprehensive review of the academic literature on housing megaprojects and the depth of their greener development commitments. A three-phase, seven-stage review protocol retrieves the relevant literature, and bibliometric and qualitative content analyses identify publication trends and themes. Results indicate limited scholarship on new megaprojects with sporadic and superficial references to greener development, mostly reserved for higher-income segments and private developments. In response, this paper calls for more determined action to launch context-aware and just greener megaprojects and offers corresponding guidance for research and practice of value to South Africa and beyond. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
A reconnaissance-scale GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis to support sustainable biochar use: Poland as a case study,"Although increasing numbers of research papers regarding biochar are being published worldwide, in some countries growing interest in biochar has only recently been observed; this is true of Poland. We analysed information on biochar research in Poland alongside lessons learned elsewhere in order to identify the significant opportunities and risks associated with biochar use. This data fed into a GIS-based multicriteria analysis to identify areas where biochar application could deliver greatest benefit. We found that 21.8% of agricultural land in Poland has at least moderate indication for biochar use (soil organic matter below 2% and pH below 5.5), while 1.5% was categorized as a priority as it also exhibited contamination. Potential barriers identified included biomass availability and associated risks of indirect land-use change due to possible national and transnational biomass production displacement. Biochar use could have positive global consequences as a climate change mitigation strategy, particularly relevant in a country with limited alternatives. Scaling up a mitigation technology that is viable on account of its co-benefits might be cost-effective, which could, in turn, adjust national perspectives and stronger involvement in developing mitigation policies at the regional level. Biochar has much promise in temperate conditions and further research should therefore be assigned to explore biochar’s environmental and socio-economic impacts. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by VGTU Press and Informa UK Limited, [trading as Taylor & Francis Group].",Not About Sufficiency
Aligning climate change mitigation and agricultural policies in eastern Europe and central Asia,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are largely determined by howenergy is created and used, and policies designed to encourage mitigation efforts reflect this reality. An unintended consequence of an energy-focused strategy is that the set of policy instruments needed to tap mitigation opportunities in agriculture is incomplete. In particular, market-linked incentives to achieve mitigation targets are disconnected from efforts to better manage carbon sequestered in agricultural land. This is especially important for many countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) where once-productive land has been degraded through poor agricultural practices. Often good agricultural policies and prudent natural resource management can compensate for missing links to mitigation incentives, but only partially.At the same time, two international project-based programs, Joint Implementation (JI) and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), have been used to finance other types of agricultural mitigation effortsworldwide. However, a reviewof projects suggests that fewECAcountries take full advantage of these financing paths. This chapter discusses mitigation opportunities in the region, the reach of current mitigation incentives, and missed mitigation opportunities in agriculture. The chapter concludes with a discussion of alternative policies designed to jointly promote mitigation and co-benefits for agriculture and the environment. © 2015 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Ecosystem Services Justice: The Emergence of a Critical Research Field,"Ecosystem services justice is an emergent research field. Over the past decade, research on ecosystem services has increasingly developed a justice perspective and incorporated it into its conceptual and empirical frameworks. This perspective aims at providing a review of the emergent strands of research addressing ecosystem services justice, and at creating an outlook on future research needs and frontiers. The review departs from central critiques to the ecosystem service approach, which have been foundational for the research field of ecosystem services justice. To be precise, we address three different research strands on which justice issues arise. First, ecosystem services production, considering the (increasing) commodification of ecosystem services, the concentration of ecosystem services production assets and the role of trade-offs in production capacities. Second, the distribution of ecosystem services benefits under the aspects of unequal vulnerabilities, the consideration of accessibility and individual's capabilities to obtain ecosystem services. Third, the recognition of ecosystem services pluralisms, including socially differentiated forms of wellbeing, plural values and knowledge concerning ecosystem services. While ES justice has strongly advanced from a scientific perspective, we are still lacking a stronger reflection of these advances in practice. Future research, we argue, needs to develop holistic procedural frameworks for integrating the complexity of ecosystem services justice, addressing the ecosystem services production under consideration of historic inequalities, the distribution of ecosystem services benefits with respect to people's diverse needs, vulnerabilities, and capabilities, as well as diverse wellbeing-, value-, and knowledge-systems. The social- ecological understanding of ecosystem services co-production, which recognizes the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between humans and ecosystems, is identified as a crucial framing for this endeavor.",Not About Sufficiency
Putting More “System” into Ecosystem-Based Management Using Qualitative Analysis,"Marine ecosystem-based management is designed to enhance the sustainable use of marine ecosystem services for human well-being while addressing threats like biodiversity loss, resource exploitation, and climate change among others. Ecosystem-based management entails studying large interconnected ecological and socioeconomic systems and understanding their causal interrelationships. While the rationale for developing ecosystem-based management is clear since the health of the global ocean is critical to human well-being, there has been increasing concern about how to conduct holistic marine management. Three key components of ecosystem-based management include: system description, prediction, and intervention. All require an understanding of causal pathways at the ecosystem-level. System ecologists often use large quantitative models to characterize marine ecosystems as well as their relevant socioeconomic/human relationships. An alternative approach is qualitative analysis. This chapter explores two types of loop analysis, a qualitative, signed-digraph methodology, which elucidates the feedbacks of ecosystem structure and function, and provides improved causal understanding. Several benefits of loop analysis are discussed. While managing complex marine ecosystems embedded in larger socio-economic networks will continue to be challenging, if more “system” conceptualization could be put into ecosystem-based management using qualitative analysis, it could be more operational at a holistic level. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
Educational building renovation for sustainability: Exploring key factors and pathways,"In recent years, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and China's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 have significantly increased interest in green building practices. Educational building renovations aim to promote sustainability not only by conserving energy and reducing carbon emissions but also by enhancing the quality of education and advancing environmental awareness. Despite these multifaceted benefits, the success of such projects depends heavily on the selection of appropriate retrofit strategies and the establishment of effective operational mechanisms-factors that have been underexplored in the context of educational building renovations. Prior research has primarily centered on energy-saving strategies for educational buildings and green renovation strategies for residential and commercial buildings, often overlooking the broader sustainability outcomes. This study seeks to fill this gap by examining representative educational building renovation projects in China, identifying the key factors that influence the sustainability of these projects, and proposing a new theoretical framework. Using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), we analyzed 30 campus renovation projects completed over the past two decades and identified three distinct pathways to achieving sustainable educational building renovations,each with its own unique characteristics. Our findings underscore the need to consider mechanisms, user willingness, and other factors beyond energy efficiency when developing green renovation strategies. This research offers valuable insights for stakeholders involved in campus renovation projects,helping guide them towards sustainable practices that not only improve the educational environment but also promote environmental education.",Not About Sufficiency
"Trade-offs and synergies of farmland ecosystem services in Loess Plateau: A case study of Longdong Region, Northwest China","Trade-off and synergy relationships of farmland ecosystem services is not only important research topic in the agricultural ecosystem but also closely related to cropland protection and food security. However, existing researches lack analysis on trade-off and synergy relationships of farmland ecosystem services in Longdong Loess Plateau, where fragile ecoenvironment (e.g. severe soil erosion, scarce water resources, etc.) seriously threatens cropland resources and land productivity. In order to clarify trade-off and synergy relationships of farmland ecosystem services, Longdong Loess Plateau, one of the birthplaces of Chinese farming civilization, was selected as the study area, and six ecosystem service models, including precipitation storage, universal soil loss equation, and InVEST etc were utilized to calculate the amount of farmland ecosystem services in 2020 based on the socio-economic and resource-environmental data such as the statistical yearbooks, land use/cover, digital elevation models, normalized difference vegetation index, meteorology, soil, net primary productivity, and road POI. Meanwhile, the Pearson correlation coefficient and the bivariate global/local Moran's index were used to distinguish trade-off and synergy relationships between providing services and other services, and identify the spatial heterogeneity of the relationships among services, respectively. The results showed that: 1) The amount of food provision service, water conservation service, carbon sequestration service, soil retention service in 2020 was 4.61×106 t, 2.45×108 m3, 2.94×106 t, 6.61×109 t, respectively, and the mean value of habitat quality service was 0.26. Both providing services and cultural services shared a distribution pattern of “high in the east and west, low in the central and north”, due to the spatial heterogeneity of climate, soil, terrain and socio-economic development planning. By contrast, both adjusting services and supporting services had a ""belt-like"" distribution. 2) The correlation coefficient between providing services and adjusting services, supporting services, and cultural services was 0.97, 0.85, and 0.97, respectively. And the correlation coefficient between food provision service and water conservation service, carbon sequestration service, soil retention service, habitat quality service, landscape service was 0.94, 0.99, 0.93, 0.82, and 0.97, respectively. All of correlation coefficients showed that all relationships of farmland ecosystem services were synergistic in Longdong Loess Plateau. 3) Trade-off and synergy relationships among four types of services, and among each sub-service of farmland ecosystem had spatial auto-correlation, and significant spatial heterogeneity. Synergy relationships among each sub-service were clustered obviously, appeared mainly in the central and northern Longdong, while trade-off relationships among each sub-service were distributed sporadically. Therefore, it is very significant to maintain multifunctionality of farmland ecosystem in Longdong Loess Plateau, to implement zoning management strategies, to fully exploit synergistic effect of various services of farmland ecosystem, to integrally improve service functions of farmland ecosystem (especially food provision service), and further consolidate the position of ""Longdong Grain Warehouse"" in the new era. © 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Enabling value co-creation in the sharing economy: The case of mobike,"The disruptive rise of the sharing economy has inspired multiple social innovations embodying significant potential towards achieving urban sustainability in crucial areas like low-carbon mobility. Increasingly, consumers in such sharing systems participate in activities of value co-creation together with firms and peers, such as through enforcing rules that help maintain trust and reciprocity. Why do people choose to invest their time and energy in co-creating values that may benefit wider social and environmental sustainability in the sharing economy? This study addresses this question through an analysis of an emerging shared mobility community, the innovative socio-economic relationships it has spawned, and the cultural and cognitive forces that underpin these new forms of economic organization and value creation in relation to sustainability. Through a mixed method case study of a newly emerged free-floating bike sharing system in China, called Mobike, the paper explores the main enabling factors which is transforming people from passive product/service receivers to active value co-creators in the sharing economy, such as self-efficacy, cognition of duty, anticipated awards and learning processes. The paper argues that business, social and government organizations may leverage these enabling factors to achieve a more sustainable sharing business and society. Finally, based on quantitative and qualitative data analysis, the article proposes a value co-creation framework between users and firms that involves a clear social learning process on the one hand, and has strong links with social innovations towards sustainability, on the other. © 2017 by the authors.

Managing soils for negative feedback to climate change and positive impact on food and nutritional security,"The increase in atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide from 278 ppm in the pre-industrial era to 405 ppm in 2018, along with the enrichment of other greenhouse gases, has already caused a global mean temperature increase of 1°C. Among anthropogenic sources, historic land use and conversion of natural to agricultural eco-systems has and continues to be an importance source. Global depletion of soil organic carbon stock by historic land use and soil degradation is estimated at 133 Pg C. Estimated to 2-m depth, C stock is 2047 Pg for soil organic carbon and 1558 Pg for soil inorganic carbon, with a total of 3605 Pg. Thus, even a small change in soil organic carbon stock can have a strong impact on atmospheric CO2 concentration. Soil C sink capacity, between 2020 and 2100, with the global adoption of best management practice which creates a positive soil/ecosystem C budget, is estimated at 178 Pg C for soil, 155 Pg C for biomass, and 333 Pg C for the terrestrial biosphere with a total CO2 drawdown potential of 157 ppm. Important among techniques of soil organic C sequestration are adoption of a system-based conservation agriculture, agroforestry, biochar, and integration of crops with trees and livestock. There is growing interest among policymakers and the private sector regarding the importance of soil C sequestration for adaptation and mitigation of climate change, harnessing of numerous co-benefits, and strengthening of ecosystem services. © 2020, © 2020 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.",Not About Sufficiency

Improving Soil Health and Human Protein Nutrition by Pulses-Based Cropping Systems,"Low crop yields and poor nutritional quality of the produce, aggravated by soil degradation and climate change, are exacerbating food and nutritional insecurity especially in developing countries of Africa, South Asia, the Caribbean, etc. Pulses, food legumes harvested as dry seeds which are rich in protein and essential minerals, have an important role to play in addressing the food and nutritional insecurity. Thus, U.N. declared 2016 as the International Year of Pulses. An average per capita daily intake of 100–125 g of pulses to provide 25–30 g of protein would require increase in global production of pulses (106 Mg per year) from 70 in 2015 to 370 in 2030, 440 in 2050, and more than 500 in 2100. Therefore, the land area (106 ha) and agronomic yield (Mg/ha) would have to be increased, respectively, from 85.6 and 0.70 in 2015 to 296 and 1.25 in 2030, 248 and 1.50 in 2050, and 238 and 2.15 in 2100. While the increasing trend in agronomic yield of pulses since 1961 is encouraging, the rate of growth must be much higher. Being legumes, incorporation of pulses in the rotation cycle can also improve soil fertility and benefit the productivity of the following cereals. Restoration of soil health through biological N fixation is especially pertinent to Africa where the average rate of input of chemical fertilizers is ~ 15 kg/ha on continental basis. Annual input of biological N fixation is estimated at ~ 3 Tg for the pulses and 18.5 Tg for the oilseed legumes. Increase in soil N content also enhances soil organic carbon concentration and improves the overall soil health. Therefore, incorporation of pulses in cropping/farming systems is important to enhancing soil and human health. With sustainable intensification of agroecosystems, cropland area of 500 Mha under cereals and 250 Mha under pulses/food legumes would be adequate to provide nutritious food to the present and future world population. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil carbon sequestration in agroecosystems of india,"Soils of agroecosystems of India are degraded, depleted and severely devoid of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool which is often <1 g kg-1 or barely 10 to 15 Mg C ha-1 to 40 cm depth. Thus, crop yields are low, water and air resources are polluted, and the overall environment is degraded. Indeed, environmental sustainability in India remains a major issue to be addressed. Concentration of SOC is a strong determinant of soil quality. Furthermore, quality of soil also impacts those of plants and animals, and thus, health of human population. Restoration of SOC pool to above the threshold level of 10 to 15 g kg-1 in the root zone is essential to advancing food and nutritional security, achieving climate change adaptation and mitigation, improving water quality and renewability, increasing biodiversity, and alleviating poverty by increasing productivity. Among causes of the severe depletion of SOC pool are extractive farming practices of residue removal, indiscriminate plowing, excessive irrigation by flooding, none or unbalanced application of fertilizers, and use of dung as a household fuel rather than manure. Uncontrolled grazing and shifting cultivation also contribute to soil degradation. The extent and severity of degradation are exacerbated by accelerated erosion by water and wind, salinization, acidification, elemental imbalance, and anerobiosis. Thus, soil degradation trends must be reversed by improving SOC concentration through creation of a positive soil/ecosystem C budget. Among best management practices (BMPs) are afforestation and reforestation of hill slopes and agriculturally marginal lands. Establishment of plantations and agroforestry systems is another option. Some BMPs for cropland, essential to improving SOC pool and advancing food security, are conservation agriculture, integrated nutrient management, and crop diversification especially of the rice-wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains. Policy interventions are needed to promote the adoption of BMPs through payments for ecosystems services. Improved governance and strong political will power are essential to revolutionizing the stagnating Indian agriculture. © 2018, IndianJournals.com. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil Carbon Management and Climate Change,"Among global issues of the twenty-first century are: population growth, increase in energy demand, enrichment of atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the attendant climate change, increase in food production needed to meet the demands of growing and increasingly affluent population, and aggravated risks of soil and environmental degradation. Thus, enhancing the magnitude and mean residence time (MRT) of soil carbon (C) pool is integral to any strategy of addressing these and other related global issues. The promise of soil C sequestration is based on the magnitude of net biome productivity (NBP) of similar to 3 Pg C/year, and the hypothesis that some of the NBP can be retained in the soil to offset emissions and also enhance the resilience of soil and agroecosystems to climate change. Complementary to soil organic C (SOC) is soil inorganic C (SIC) pool, together estimated at similar to 4,000 Pg to 3-m depth, and play a major role in the global C cycle (GCC). The soil C sink capacity has been enhanced by depletion of the antecedent SOC pool in degraded soils. Despite the large potential of 0.5-1 Mg C/ha/year, there are numerous uncertainties: (1) increased emissions of GHGs with increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 because of accelerated decomposition and erosional processes, (2) change in the rate of C uptake in soils of the tropics by climate change, (3) impact of chemical weathering of silicate rocks in altering terrestrial sinks, (4) unknown fate of C transported by erosional processes, (5) a possible positive feedback from the melting of permafrost, (6) decrease in capacity of terrestrial sinks because of soil degradation, and (7) the effects of wild/managed fi res on soot, charcoal and NBP. These uncertainties interact with mechanisms of SOC stabilization and those which enhance its MRT. These mechanisms include: physical protection through deep placement and formation of stable aggregates, interaction between SOC and clay minerals, landscape position, and humification leading to formation of recalcitrant fractions. There is a vast potential of SOC sequestration through adoption of recommended management practices on croplands (e.g., conservation agriculture, cover cropping, integrated nutrient management) grazing lands (e.g., controlled grazing, better forage/tree species, soil and water conservation), forestlands (e.g., afforestation, stand management, species selection), wetland/peatland restoration, and reclamation of degraded soils. Comparatively low rate of SIC sequestration as pedogenic carbonates exist in vast arid and semi-arid lands, and in agroecosystems irrigated with good quality water. However, there are also challenges of credible measurements of small changes in soil C in a relatively large pool, and of scaling up the data from profi le to watershed and regional scale. There are numerous co-effects of soil C sequestration including improvements in soil quality, increase in agronomic productivity, enhancement of biodiversity, reduction in non-point source pollution etc. Payments to land managers for ecosystem services and trading of C credits may enhance adoption of recommended technologies especially by resource-poor farmers, and small landholders in the tropics. Researchable priorities include understanding of trends and variability in principal determinants of SOC pools and its MRT, assessing the impact of C-climate feed-backs and understanding coupled cycling of C with other elements (N, P, S) and H2O. Soil C sequestration has a finite sink capacity. However, it has numerous co-benefits (e.g., food security), and is a cost-effective, win-win option, and a bridge to the future until low-C or no-C fuel sources take effect.",Not About Sufficiency
Beyond Copenhagen: mitigating climate change and achieving food security through soil carbon sequestration,"This article explains the technical potential of C (carbon) sequestration in world soils for mitigating climate change and describes its positive impacts on agronomic productivity and global food security through the improvement of soil quality. It also supports the idea of economic development through the provision of payments to farmers in developing countries for their stewardship and enhancement of ecosystem services. These would be generated by their use of recommended management practices for improved agriculture. The technical potential of C sequestration in soils of terrestrial ecosystems and restoration of peat soils is similar to 3 Petagram (Pg) C/yr (i.e. 3 x 10(15) g=3x 109 tonnes C/yr) or 50 ppm draw down of atmospheric CO2 by the end of the 21st century by increasing the soil C pool at a rate of 1 Mg/ha/yr. Depending upon climate and other variables, this could increase cereal and food legume production in developing countries by 32 million Mg/yr and roots and tubers by 9 million Mg/yr. It is precisely this strategy which would have received broad political support at the COP-15 meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009 from developing countries, emerging economies and the industrialized world. Addressing the issue of food-insecurity and global warming through sequestration of C in soils and the biota, along with payments to resource-poor farmers for the ecosystem services rendered, would be a timely win-win strategy.",Not About Sufficiency
Enhancing crop yields in the developing countries through restoration of the soil organic carbon pool in agricultural lands,"Food production in developing countries, estimated at 1223 million metric tons (Mg), must be increased by 778 million Mg or 2.5 percent y(-1) between 2000 and 2025 to meet the needs of an increased population and projected change in diet. Among numerous options, the one based on enhancing soil quality and agronomic productivity per unit area through improvement in soil organic carbon pool has numerous ancillary benefits. The available data show that crop yields can be increased by 20-70 kg ha(-1) for wheat, 10-50 kg ha(-1) for rice, and 30-300 kg ha(-1) for maize with every I Mg ha(-1) increase in soil organic carbon pool in the root zone. Adoption of recommended management practices on agricultural lands and degraded soils would enhance soil quality including the available water holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, soil aggregation, and susceptibility to crusting and erosion. Increase in soil organic carbon pool by I Mg ha(-1) y(-1) can increase food grain production by 32 million Mg y(-1) in developing countries. While advancing food security, this strategy would also off-set fossil fuel emissions at the rate of 0.5 Pg Cy-1 through carbons sequestration in agricultural soils of developing countries.

Under-Appreciated Phylogroup Diversity of Escherichia coli within and between Animals at the Urban-Wildland Interface,"Wild animals have been implicated as reservoirs and even ""melting pots""of pathogenic and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria of concern to human health. Though Escherichia coli is common among vertebrate guts and plays a role in the propagation of such genetic information, few studies have explored its diversity beyond humans nor the ecological factors that influence its diversity and distribution in wild animals. We characterized an average of 20 E. coli isolates per scat sample (n = 84) from a community of 14 wild and 3 domestic species. The phylogeny of E. coli comprises 8 phylogroups that are differentially associated with pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance, and we uncovered all of them in one small biological preserve surrounded by intense human activity. Challenging previous assumptions that a single isolate is representative of within-host phylogroup diversity, 57% of individual animals sampled carried multiple phylogroups simultaneously. Host species' phylogroup richness saturated at different levels across species and encapsulated vast within-sample and within-species variation, indicating that distribution patterns are influenced both by isolation source and laboratory sampling depth. Using ecological methods that ensure statistical relevance, we identify trends in phylogroup prevalence associated with host and environmental factors. The vast genetic diversity and broad distribution of E. coli in wildlife populations has implications for biodiversity conservation, agriculture, and public health, as well as for gauging unknown risks at the urban-wildland interface. We propose critical directions for future studies of the ""wild side""of E. coli that will expand our understanding of its ecology and evolution beyond the human environment. IMPORTANCE To our knowledge, neither the phylogroup diversity of E. coli within individual wild animals nor that within an interacting multispecies community have previously been assessed. In doing so, we uncovered the globally known phylogroup diversity from an animal community on a preserve imbedded in a human-dominated landscape. We revealed that the phylogroup composition in domestic animals differed greatly from that in their wild counterparts, implying potential human impacts on the domestic animal gut. Significantly, many wild individuals hosted multiple phylogroups simultaneously, indicating the potential for strain-mixing and zoonotic spillback, especially as human encroachment into wildlands increases in the Anthropocene. We reason that due to extensive anthropogenic environmental contamination, wildlife is increasingly exposed to our waste, including E. coli and antibiotics. The gaps in the ecological and evolutionary understanding of E. coli thus necessitate a significant uptick in research to better understand human impacts on wildlife and the risk for zoonotic pathogen emergence. © 2023 Lagerstrom and Hadly.",Not About Sufficiency
Technology Readiness Level of biodiversity monitoring with molecular methods – where are we on the road to routine implementation?,"Human activities are causing rapid biodiversity loss across ecosystems, affecting human well-being and crucial ecosystem services. Traditional biodiversity monitoring tools cannot keep up with the increasing demands of monitoring due to their limited spatial or temporal coverage, high costs, and lack of taxonomic expertise. Thus, implementation of novel molecular monitoring methods such as environmental DNA (eDNA) and DNA metabarcoding, are necessary. Molecular monitoring methods offer significant benefits for biodiversity monitoring and environmental assessment: high sensitivity and accuracy, non-invasive sampling, broad taxonomic range and cost and time efficiency. However, the diverse methodological approaches lead to poor comparability between studies and surveys, highlighting the need for standardised assessments. We used the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) framework to evaluate the maturity of molecular monitoring methods, providing a structured assessment of their readiness for routine use. In a systematic literature review, 420 articles fulfilling the study criteria were assessed and both individual studies and method categories ranked according to the TRL scale. The findings revealed a growing number of studies, particularly in aquatic environments, with most studies validating molecular technologies on a small scale but lacking large-scale system demonstrations. Aquatic eDNA-based methods targeting fish showed overall higher technology readiness compared to other sample types and taxa and applications of molecular monitoring methods ranked into the highest TRL were predominantly freshwater studies. Key barriers to the broader implementation of molecular methods to monitoring include the need for international standards, better quantitative estimates and comprehensive reference libraries. National and international cooperation is crucial for establishing common standards, ensuring reliable and comparable results and expediting the routine use of molecular methods in biodiversity monitoring.

Scenarios for climate change vary latitudinally and regionally and involve direct and indirect linkages for increasing temperature and the dissemination, amplification, and invasiveness of vector-borne parasites. High latitude regions are especially influenced by global climate change and thus may be prone to altered associations and dynamics for complex host-pathogen assemblages and emergence of disease with cascading effects on ecosystem structure. Although the potential for substantial ecological perturbation has been identified, few empirical observations have emanated from systems across the Holarctic. Coincidental with decades of warming, and anomalies of high temperature and humidity in the sub-Arctic region of Fennoscandia, the mosquito-borne filarioid nematode Setaria tundra is now associated with emerging epidemic disease resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality for reindeer and moose. We describe a host-parasite system that involves reindeer, arthropods, and nematodes, which may contribute as a factor to ongoing declines documented for this ungulate species across northern ecosystems. We demonstrate that mean summer temperatures exceeding 14A degrees C drive the emergence of disease due to S. tundra. An association between climate and emergence of filarioid parasites is a challenge to ecosystem services with direct effects on public health, sustainability of free-ranging and domestic ungulates, and ultimately food security for subsistence cultures at high latitudes.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem services classification: A systems ecology perspective of the cascade framework,"Ecosystem services research faces several challenges stemming from the plurality of interpretations of classifications and terminologies. In this paper we identify two main challenges with current ecosystem services classification systems: i) the inconsistency across concepts, terminology and definitions, and; ii) the mix up of processes and end-state benefits, or flows and assets. Although different ecosystem service definitions and interpretations can be valuable for enriching the research landscape, it is necessary to address the existing ambiguity to improve comparability among ecosystem-service-based approaches. Using the cascade framework as a reference, and Systems Ecology as a theoretical underpinning, we aim to address the ambiguity across typologies. The cascade framework links ecological processes with elements of human well-being following a pattern similar to a production chain. Systems Ecology is a long-established discipline which proVides insight into complex relationships between people and the environment. We present a refreshed conceptualization of ecosystem services which can support ecosystem service assessment techniques and measurement. We combine the notions of biomass, information and interaction from system ecology, with the ecosystem services conceptualization to improve definitions and clarify terminology. We argue that ecosystem services should be defined as the interactions (i.e. processes) of the ecosystem that produce a change in human well-being, while ecosystem components or goods, i.e. countable as biomass units, are only proxies in the assessment of such changes. Furthermore, Systems Ecology can support a re-interpretation of the ecosystem services conceptualization and related applied research, where more emphasis is needed on the underpinning complexity of the ecological system.

A standardised ecosystem services framework for the deep sea,"Despite its remoteness, human activity has impacted the deep sea and changes to the structure and function of deep-sea ecosystems are already noticeable. In terrestrial and shallow water marine environments, demonstrating how ecosystems support human well-being has been instrumental in setting policy and management objectives for sustainable resource use. Foundational to this approach is a framework of ecosystem service (ES) classification and a synthesis of the knowledge base, which can then be used to structure decision-support tools such as ecosystem accounts or Environmental Impact Assessments. At present, no such framework exists for the deep sea. There is thus an urgent need to determine and assess the ES provided by deep-sea habitats and species before (potentially irreversible) decisions are made about deep-sea habitat use and governance. As a first step towards the incorporation of ES in such decision-making, we undertake two systematic reviews of the scientific literature based on the principles of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) systematic process. This was to define a comparative ES framework and synthesise the current evidence base for how deep-sea habitats support ecosystem services. Our framework proposes four supporting services, three regulating services, four provisioning services and three cultural services for which there is an established and growing body of evidence for the role of deep-sea habitats. The ES framework presented here provides a structure for deep-sea ecosystem services. In its next phase of development, this could provide the foundation for the development of habitat-ecosystem service matrices, which are a critical component for truly accounting for ES in decision-making, particularly spatial management. This framework has significant implications for deep-sea management, conservation and policy, as it provides an ecosystem services-based tool that can be used in any deep-sea ecosystems management across the planet, and it also shows how critical these data gaps are for today's decisions and how seriously they should be considered in decision-making processes.",Not About Sufficiency
L,"Land degradation expresses a negative trend in land conditions as a long-term reduction or loss of biological productivity, ecological integrity, or economic value. Land degradation is directly or indirectly caused by humans and affects people and ecosystems. Human-induced drivers of land degradation include land-use changes and unsustainable land management, while agriculture is a dominant sector driving degradation. One-third of global land is degraded due to agriculture, and 75% of the terrestrial environment is severely altered by human actions (IPBES, 2018). Anthropogenic climate change increases the rate and magnitude of ongoing land degradation processes and introduces new degradation patterns. Also, land degradation is a driver of climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and reduced carbon-absorbing. Land degradation occurs over a quarter of the Earth’s ice-free land area, affecting an estimated 3.2 billion people, most of whom live in poverty in developing countries (Olsson et al., 2019). Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3 aims to restore degraded land and soil and achieve a land degradation-neutral world. Land degradation neutrality refers to a state whereby the amount and quality of land resources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services for food security remain stable or improve (UNCCD, 2022). The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification’s (UNCCD) goal of land degradation neutrality (LDN) aims to halt and reverse the global land degradation problem. More than 100 countries participated in the Changwon Initiative of the UNCCD, which supports national voluntary target-setting processes to achieve LDN. Land degradation can be avoided, reduced, or reversed by implementing sustainable land management, restoration, and rehabilitation practices which will provide many benefits, including adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. Therefore, combating land degradation and restoring degraded land are urgent priorities to protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services vital to all life on Earth and to ensure human well-being (IPBES, 2018). As a connected concept, land-use change expresses changes in the use or management of land, modifying the biological productivity, ecological integrity, or economic value of the land surface. Land-use change can result from human activities such as agriculture and irrigation, deforestation, reforestation and afforestation, industrialization, or urbanization and is considered a planetary boundary in the Planetary Boundaries Framework. This framework used the forest land area compared to the original forest cover as a control variable. Steffen et al. (2015) showed that humanity exceeded the land-system change boundary. Sustainable finance contributes to investing in activities that avoid land degradation and restore degraded land, namely sustainable land management activities. The benefits of land restoration include but are not limited to increased employment, increased business spending, improved gender equality, increased local investment in education, and improved livelihoods. The estimates of the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) initiative led by the UNCCD show that the returns on investment from land restorations are very high. For example, sustainable land management could deliver up to US$ 1.4 trillion in increased crop production, and enhancing carbon stocks through soils could create a value of up to USD 480 billion (ELD, 2022). © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Elisa Aracil and Ibrahim Sancak; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
Inclusive Economic Growth: Relationship between Energy and Governance Efficiency,"The ambitious goal of the European Union (EU) countries is to achieve carbon neutrality by providing inclusive economic growth, which requires the development of relevant incentives and initiatives. Furthermore, such incentives and initiatives should guarantee the achievement of the declared goals. Energy sectors are the core determinant of inclusive economic growth. Traditional energy resources (coal oriented) have a higher negative impact on nature and people’s well-being than on economic and social benefits. However, the transition to renewable energy raises new issues in achieving goals of inclusive economic growth: affordable and clean energy, responsible energy consumption, and energy infrastructure. The analysis of the theoretical framework found that the digitalization of government could be a core instrument for handling the abovementioned issues. The paper aims to justify the role of green energy in achieving inclusive economic growth empirically. The study applies the following methods: fully modified Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and canonical cointegrating regression. The findings allow concluding that institutional quality passively affects inclusive economic growth and that the digitalization of government has a U-shaped impact on inclusive economic growth. In this case, countries should boost the digital transformation of public services and continuously increase the quality of institutions. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Agroforestry delivers a win-win solution for ecosystem services in sub-Saharan Africa. A meta-analysis,"Agricultural landscapes are increasingly being managed with the aim of enhancing the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services and sustainability of production systems. However, agricultural management that maximizes provisioning ecosystem services can often reduce both regulating and maintenance services. We hypothesized that agroforestry reduces trade-offs between provisioning and regulating/maintenance services. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of studies carried out in sub-Saharan Africa focusing on crop yield (as an indicator of provisioning services), soil fertility, erosion control, and water regulation (as indicators of regulating/maintenance services). A total of 1106 observations were extracted from 126 peer-reviewed publications that fulfilled the selection criteria for meta-analysis of studies comparing agroforestry and non-agroforestry practices (hereafter control) in sub-Saharan Africa. Across ecological conditions, agroforestry significantly increased crop yield, total soil nitrogen, soil organic carbon, and available phosphorus compared to the control. Agroforestry practices also reduced runoff and soil loss and improved infiltration rates and soil moisture content. No significant differences were detected between the different ecological conditions, management regimes, and types of woody perennials for any of the ecosystem services. Main trade-offs included low available phosphorus and low soil moisture against higher crop yield. This is the first meta-analysis that shows that, on average, agroforestry systems in sub-Saharan Africa increase crop yield while maintaining delivery of regulating/maintenance ecosystem services. We also demonstrate how woody perennials have been managed in agricultural landscapes to provide multiple ecosystem services without sacrificing crop productivity. This is important in rural livelihoods where the range of ecosystem services conveys benefits in terms of food security and resilience to environmental shocks.",Not About Sufficiency
Natural Disturbance-Based Forest Management: Moving Beyond Retention and Continuous-Cover Forestry,"Global forest area is declining rapidly, along with degradation of the ecological condition of remaining forests. Hence it is necessary to adopt forest management approaches that can achieve a balance between (1) human management designs based on homogenization of forest structure to efficiently deliver economic values and (2) naturally emerging self-organized ecosystem dynamics that foster heterogeneity, biodiversity, resilience and adaptive capacity. Natural disturbance-based management is suggested to provide such an approach. It is grounded on the premise that disturbance is a key process maintaining diversity of ecosystem structures, species and functions, and adaptive and evolutionary potential, which functionally link to sustainability of ecosystem services supporting human well-being. We review the development, ecological and evolutionary foundations and applications of natural disturbance-based forest management. With emphasis on boreal forests, we compare this approach with two mainstream approaches to sustainable forest management, retention and continuous-cover forestry. Compared with these approaches, natural disturbance-based management provides a more comprehensive framework, which is compatible with current understanding of multiple-scale ecological processes and structures, which underlie biodiversity, resilience and adaptive potential of forest ecosystems. We conclude that natural disturbance-based management provides a comprehensive ecosystem-based framework for managing forests for human needs of commodity production and immaterial values, while maintaining forest health in the rapidly changing global environment. © Copyright © 2021 Kuuluvainen, Angelstam, Frelich, Jõgiste, Koivula, Kubota, Lafleur and Macdonald.",Not About Sufficiency
Five lessons to guide more effective biodiversity conservation message framing,"Communication and advocacy approaches that influence attitudes and behaviors are key to addressing conservation problems, and the way an issue is framed can affect how people view, judge, and respond to an issue. Responses to conservation interventions can also be influenced by subtle wording changes in statements that may appeal to different values, activate social norms, influence a person's affect or mood, or trigger certain biases, each of which can differently influence the resulting engagement, attitudes, and behavior. We contend that by strategically considering how conservation communications are framed, they can be made more effective with little or no additional cost. Key framing considerations include, emphasizing things that matter to the audience, evoking helpful social norms, reducing psychological distance, leveraging useful biases, and, where practicable, testing messages. These lessons will help communicators think strategically about how to frame messages for greater effect. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology",Not About Sufficiency
Interconnectedness of Ecosystem Services Potential with Land Use/Land Cover Change Dynamics in Western Uganda,"Understanding the evolution of land use/land cover change (LULCC) and how it shapes current and future ecosystem services (ES) supply potential remains critical in sustainable natural resource management. Community perception of historic LULCC was reconciled with previous study via remote sensing/geographical information systems using recall data in the Budongo-Bugoma landscape in Uganda. Then, a CA-Markovian prediction model of a LULC situation in 2040 under business as usual (BAU) and forest restoration scenarios was constructed. Additionally, we assessed the perceived proximate and underlying drivers of LULCC, and how LULCC shapes ecosystem services potential using household surveys. The perceived LULCC trend for the past three decades (1990-2020) corresponded with previous studies showing grassland, bushland, tropical high forest, and wetland cover declined greatly, while subsistence farmland, commercial farmland, and built-up areas had a great increment. The predicted LULC under (i) the business as usual scenario showed a continued decline of natural LULC while anthropogenic LULC increased greatly, tending to cover half of the landscape area; (ii) forest restoration under different levels showed an improvement of forest cover and other native LULC classes with a decline in mostly subsistence farmland. The proximate drivers were in three principal components (soil infertility, subsistence farming, drought; infrastructural development, commercial farming, overstocking of livestock, pest and disease challenges; tree planting), while underlying drivers were in two principal components (technology adoption, corruption of environment stewards, policy implementation gaps; cultural gaps). Food and cash crops were perceived to be the most important ecosystem services in the landscape. Generally, the landscape ES supply potential was dwindling and predicted to continue with a similar trend under BAU, despite the increment in ES contribution of subsistence and commercial farmland. Forest restoration would slightly improve the landscape ES potential but would cause a decline in subsistence farmland, which would result in either a threat to food/livelihood security or a livelihood shift. We recommend combined interventions that seek to achieve a progressive frontier that achieves development needs and priorities based on national need such as food security through local level production with recognition for sustainable availability of ecosystem services.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating biodiversity and conservation with modern agricultural landscapes,"To achieve food security and meet the demands of the ever-growing human populations, farming systems have assumed unsustainable practices to produce more from a finite land area. This has been cause for concern mainly due to the often-irreversible damage done to the otherwise productive agricultural landscapes. Agro-ecology is proclaimed to be deteriorating due to eroding integrity of connected ecological mosaics and vulnerability to climate change. This has contributed to declining species diversity, loss of buffer vegetation, fragmentation of habitats, and loss of natural pollinators or predators, which eventually leads to decline in ecosystem services. Currently, a hierarchy of conservation initiatives is being considered to restore ecological integrity of agricultural landscapes. However, the challenge of identifying a suitable conservation strategy is a daunting task in view of socio-ecological factors that may constrain the choice of available strategies. One way to mitigate this situation and integrate biodiversity with agricultural landscapes is to implement offset mechanisms, which are compensatory and balancing approaches to restore the ecological health and function of an ecosystem. This needs to be tailored to the history of location specific agricultural practices, and the social, ecological and environmental conditions. The offset mechanisms can complement other initiatives through which farmers are insured against landscape-level risks such as droughts, fire and floods. For countries in the developing world with significant biodiversity and extensive agriculture, we should promote a comprehensive model of sustainable agricultural landscapes and ecosystem services, replicable at landscape to regional scales. Arguably, the model can be a potential option to sustain the integrity of biodiversity mosaic in agricultural landscapes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Not About Sufficiency
"Assimilating Biodiversity, Conservation and Sustainable Development in the Himalayas","The Himalayan region, known for its breathtaking landscapes and unique biodiversity, stands at the crossroads of conservation and sustainable development. The delicate balance between these two imperatives is critical, as the immediate natural resources of the area are indispensable to the livelihoods of the local communities. However, this fragile environment faces severe threats from the rapid expansion of infrastructure, urbanization, and the impacts of climate change. The need of the hour is an all-encompassing strategy that integrates community involvement, scientific research, and traditional knowledge to conserve the Himalayas’ biodiversity effectively. In this context, it is imperative to recognize the interconnectedness of conserving diverse flora and fauna to pursue sustainable human development. Scientific research is crucial for understanding the complex ecosystems of the Himalayas and identifying sustainable practices. Community involvement ensures the preservation of indigenous wisdom and fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility among the people. The challenge is to strike a harmonious balance that considers the environment, the well-being of local communities, and economic development concurrently. Collaborative efforts involving stakeholders such as government bodies, local communities, and environmental organizations are essential. In essence, achieving a sustainable coexistence in the Himalayas requires a holistic perspective that blends environmental conservation with community well-being and economic progress. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Algae as a Source of Bioremediation and Resource Recycling,"Burgeoning pollutants from varying sources endanger public health and the rich natural resources. The disadvantages associated with the use of conventional wastewater plans poses a challenge for building a long-term waste management system for wastewater treatment and disposal. As a result, novel wastewater treatment systems are needed that are lower in carbon emissions and rich in resource recycling using less energy concepts. The employment of macroalgae or seaweeds to treat wastewaters appears to be a fine solution to the said problem. Bioremediation is a long-term treatment approach for reducing the influence of effluence on the marine setting by employing microbes to neutralize toxins, with a growing emphasis on seaweeds. Seaweeds have the ability to detoxify nutrients and metals from land-based as well as coastal aquaculture and industrial sites, according to current scientific and business advancements in seaweed cultivation. The employment of macroalgae in bioremediation is a hot research topic field that is currently focusing on implementing effective and cost-effective treatment approaches that also allow for the production of value-added products, resulting in a rising economy. The present chapter provides an overview of the use of macroalgae as a source of bioremediation and resource recycling. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Susmita Mukherjee, Sanket J.

Soil health restoration in degraded lands: A microbiological perspective,"Land degradation is one of the most pressing environmental problems of the 21st century particularly due to its impact on global food security and environmental quality through the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Land degradation happens at an accelerated rate and affects regions inhabited by more than one-third population of the world. This phenomenon resulted in a dramatic reduction in the productivity of cropland and rangeland of world thus threatening the environmental quality and food security. It manifests in various forms such as desertification, soil erosion, sodicity, salinity, heavy metal contamination, pesticide contamination, declining soil fertility, and fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The world now has a real chance for the next generation to grow sustainably and eliminate acute food scarcity. Microbes, as vital elements of soil, play an important role in maintaining soil biological properties and fertility. Due to their multifarious biological functions and metabolic uniqueness, microorganisms can fix or solubilize nutrients, add organic matters to the soil to improve its quality. Many of the microorganisms can produce biological compounds or enzymes, which can degrade or scavenge toxic substances from the soils. In this review, we have discussed in detail how diverse microorganisms can help to restore different types of degraded lands. The limitations in application of microorganisms in restoration of soil health and possible scopes to improve the applicability have also been discussed here. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Geospatial perspectives of sustainable forest management to enhance ecosystem services and livelihood security,"Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) contributes to human well-being by meeting people's socioeconomic, ecological, cultural, and spiritual needs at local, national, and global levels. Integrated SFM enhances forests' carbon value, and maintains or improves other important local or global ecosystem services to support local livelihoods. Enhancing the carbon stock of forests has the potential to make a large contribution to carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation. Forests also aid in the preservation of groundwater aquifers that contribute significantly to overall agricultural productivity. The geospatial techniques provide a systematic, consistent picture of earth at regular intervals that help in detecting land cover changes and revealing biodiversity dimensions. With the availability of high-resolution satellite data, remote sensing has aided in the detection and recovery of forest disturbances. Adoption of a landscape-based approach to comprehensive land use planning, with a focus on forest ecosystem services and their long-term usage to support local livelihoods may contribute to SFM. Forest management should be guided by broad environmental and socioeconomic objectives that lead to ecosystem-based approaches (EbAs) to manage the entire ecological system in a holistic and integrated manner.

Function-driven microbial genomics for ecofriendly agriculture,"Present agricultural research is focused on addressing dual issues of food security and environmental sustainability in the wake of changing climate. While intensive agricultural practices have managed to achieve food security, they are also associated with negative effects of environmental damage, biodiversity loss and land degradation. The negative effects highlight issues of loss in functional diversity of agricultural lands. Thus, necessitate changes in land management practices like inclusion of integrated and organic nutrient management for achieving long term ecological balance. These ecofriendly land management practices make positive impacts on soil microbiome which in turn benefit plant metabolic processes and bio-geo chemical cycles. Problems of low crop yields due to biotic and abiotic factors can be overcome by optimizing plant-microbe interactions. Microbes are generally studied using traditional techniques and are being utilized in the form of biofertilizers, bioremediation/biocontrol agents and biostimulants for decades. However, only handful of microbes’ functionalities are known (as less than 1% are cultivable in lab) and majority of microbes are largely uncharacterized. Microbial genomics is set of cultivation-independent methods accompanied by reductions in cost, technical advances in sequencing technologies and new computational developments which have markedly increased our knowledge on functionality of microbial communities in variety of environments. Genomic analyses are yielding unprecedented insights into microbial evolution, diversity and ecosystem services.

Biochar: a sustainable solution,"The planet Earth has been thronged by a horde of threatening issues since the late twentieth century. Climate change, fossil fuel depletion and various types of pollution, including heavy metal pollution, have hit the humanity hard. Application of biochar has been emerged as a viable option to tackle heavy metal pollution. Biochar is a carbonaceous product obtained on pyrolysing any substance containing biomass. The chemico-physical properties of biochar depend on the type of feedstock used and the pyrolysis temperature involved in its production. Its remarkable properties of high porosity, large surface area, surplus surface functional groups and high adsorption capacity make it an excellent substrate for removing heavy metals from contaminated soil and water. At the same time, it can also tackle the emerging issues of climate change, by sequestering carbon, curtail depleting fossil fuels via bio-oil and syngas production, and it turns out to be a cheap and eco-friendly method. Due to such wide ranging applications, the review was conceptualized to determine whether biochar can be a sustainable solution to deal with the various threatening issues.

Nature's contributions to people and biodiversity mapping in switzerland: Spatial patterns and environmental drivers,"Changes in climate and land use represent significant risks of biodiversity loss globally, affect ecological stability, impact nature's contributions to people (NCP, i.e. ecosystem services) and compromise human livelihood. As framings of conservation evolve to consider the interdependence between species and human needs, there is a growing recognition of the importance of NCP and biodiversity in conservation actions. However, knowledge on the interactions and spatial repartition of NCP and biodiversity remains limited. Here we show a comprehensive spatial assessment for 15 NCP and one biodiversity – distribution of threatened species – indicators in Switzerland. Indicators values were computed using a panel of mapping and modelling methods extracted from the literature, or specifically developed for this study. Through the analysis of their relationships, we reveal significant trade-offs and synergies in the spatial repartition of these indicators. Results from a spatial bundle analysis performed on the 16 indicators revealed the existence of four bundles showing a heterogeneous repartition over the Swiss landscape. Furthermore, we identified that topography (slope), climate (temperature and precipitations), and habitat (forest and meadows) were among the most influential factors to explain the spatial distribution of the four bundles. We conclude that various significant relationships exist between NCP and biodiversity indicators in Switzerland, emphasizing the importance of informed conservation approaches considering both NCP and biodiversity supply. This work helps fill the gap in our understanding of the links among different NCP, between NCP and biodiversity, and highlight their relationship to climate and land use, providing key insights for optimizing conservation efforts. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"Adoption, use and perception of Australian acacias around the world","Aim To examine the different uses and perceptions of introduced Australian acacias (wattles; Acacia subgenus Phyllodineae) by rural households and communities. Location Eighteen landscape-scale case studies around the world, in Vietnam, India, Réunion, Madagascar, South Africa, Congo, Niger, Ethiopia, Israel, France, Portugal, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic and Hawai'i. Methods Qualitative comparison of case studies, based on questionnaire sent to network of acacia researchers. Information based on individual knowledge of local experts, published and unpublished sources. Results We propose a conceptual model to explain current uses and perceptions of introduced acacias. It highlights historically and geographically contingent processes, including economic development, environmental discourses, political context, and local or regional needs. Four main groupings of case studies were united by similar patterns: (1) poor communities benefiting from targeted agroforestry projects; (2) places where residents, generally poor, take advantage of a valuable resource already present in their landscape via plantation and/or invasion; (3) regions of small and mid-scale tree farmers participating in the forestry industry; and (4) a number of high-income communities dealing with the legacies of former or niche use of introduced acacia in a context of increased concern over biodiversity and ecosystem services. Main conclusions Economic conditions play a key role shaping acacia use. Poorer communities rely strongly on acacias (often in, or escaped from, formal plantations) for household needs and, sometimes, for income. Middle-income regions more typically host private farm investments in acacia woodlots for commercialization. Efforts at control of invasive acacias must take care to not adversely impact poor dependent communities. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Dual discounting in cost-benefit analysis for environmental impacts,"Discounting has been a long-established intertemporal efficiency tool in cost-benefit analysis which focuses on project selection at communal level with a view to maximising the social welfare. However, with the relentless growth in environmental stress that, in good parts, stems from investment projects the established criterion in discounting appears to be inadequate especially when environmental issues are taken into consideration. This paper looks at how dual focus on efficiency and sustainability can be achieved by using dual discounting, i.e. discounting environmental benefits separately and differently from other costs and benefits and applies this alternative criterion to an afforestation scheme in the United Kingdom which contains carbon sequestration in addition to timber benefits. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil-Biogeochemical Aspects of Arable Farming in the Russian Federation,"Abstract: Soil-biogeochemical aspects of the current state of arable land in the Russian Federation are discussed. Considerable transformation of Russian agriculture has led to structural changes in the agricultural land use, including arable farming. About forty million hectares of former arable land have been abandoned and converted into the category of abandoned lands subjected to overgrowing with meadow and woody vegetation. The restoration of natural vegetation in postagrogenic ecosystems is accompanied by changes in the biological productivity and composition of vegetation on agricultural land in general. The reduction of plowlands and their transformation to abandoned lands have changed the carbon budget. In the early 1990s, arable farming was the net source of C-CO2. At present, the total arable land area in Russia is estimated at approximately 80 M ha. This area is a source of about 20 Mt C-CO2/yr. Forty million hectares of former arable land have turned into the sink of C-CO2 of about 40 Mt/yr in size. Thus, the entire agricultural land in Russia functions as the net sink for atmospheric CO2 at the rate of 20 Tg C/yr. This fact can be considered a contribution of Russian agriculture to the goals of the “soil 4 per mille” international program assuming carbon sequestration in agricultural soils. Changes in the agricultural land use patterns together with a sharp decrease in the application of all kinds of fertilizers have led to prevalent biogeochemical flux of nutrients (N, P, K) from arable soils to urbanized areas. The deficient nutrient budget implies that the soil-climatic potential and the potentials of other factors increasing farming productivity (new varieties, plant-protective chemicals, etc.) are not fully realized in agricultural production. In 25 years (1992–2016), the uptake of nutrients by crops from arable land comprised 91, 33, and 90 Mt for N, P2O5, and K2O, respectively. The amount of applied fertilizers in that period was only about 28 Mt for N, 10 Mt for P2O5, and 28 Mt for K2O. The highly deficient budget of phosphorus is of special concern. Under these conditions, it is necessary to significantly restrict the export of apatite concentrate and phosphate fertilizers as strategic (nonrenewable) resources necessary for ensuring the food security of Russia for decades ahead. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Review of potato biotic constraints and experiences with integrated pest management interventions,"Potato (Solanum spp.) ranks third in importance as a single food crop worldwide. Late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, is considered to be the most important single biotic constraint of potato, but degeneration of vegetative planting material, caused primarily by a complex of viruses, potentially causes even greater yield losses. Arthropod pests are also important, with the primary problems on a global scale being the potato tuber moth complex (Phthorimaea operculella, Symmetrischema tangolias and Tecia solanivora), leaf miner fly (Liriomyza huidobrenis), Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), and Andean potato weevil (Premnotrypes spp.). Potato is one of the most pesticide-demanding agricultural crops and health risks related to pesticide use in potato production are high, especially in developing countries where protective clothing is generally not used. Experiences with potato integrated pest management (IPM) interventions have been multiple, but some of the most promising for disease management involve efforts to integrate the use of resistant cultivars, fungicides (for late blight) and capacity building of farmers. Interventions for arthropod pests rely less on host resistance and focus more on sustaining biodiversity and habitat management, as well as technological innovations to improve on-farm management, for example, cultural management practices and biological control. It is concluded that farmer capacity building is one of the most important elements needed to improve potato IPM in developing countries and that farmer acceptance of new technologies is best achieved through their understanding of the economic, ecological and practical benefits of the new technologies. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.

This article contributes to closing this gap by analysing in detail SDG 15 and affiliated progress reports. Contravening the SDGs’ stated objective of leaving no one behind, the paper shows that SDG 15 ignores vital connections between human and nonhuman nature, fails to centre people and champion justice systematically, while reaffirming unsuccessful previous indicators. The article argues that SDG 15, its targets and indicators thus perpetuate ideas of conservation which exacerbate inequalities and prevent ‘transforming our world’. These structural shortcomings risk placing SDG 15 in the same intellectual vein as other contemporary large-scale conservation planning efforts in terms of lacking inclusion and recognition of human lives and livelihoods. © 2022 The Author(s).

Public willingness to pay for carbon farming and its co-benefits,"Governments worldwide have implemented climate change mitigation policies that aim to encourage abatement by changing agricultural practices. In Australia, farmers can gain carbon credits for sequestering carbon or reducing emissions. In addition to mitigation, these 'carbon farming' activities often generate ancillary (co-)benefits, such as creating native habitat or preventing erosion. This paper presents results of an Australia-wide choice experiment, conducted to estimate community values for climate change mitigation and the cobenefits of carbon farming. Values for carbon farming benefits are shown to depend on respondent's opinions about climate change. Respondents who do not believe that climate change is happening have a lower willingness to pay for reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions than people who believe climate change is (at least partly) caused by human actions. On average, respondents were willing to pay $1.13/Mt of CO2-e reduction. Respondents were willing to pay around $19/ha increase in the area of native vegetation on farmland. Value estimates for reducing soil erosion were not significant. Our results demonstrate that the community benefits from carbon farming extend beyond their effects on climate change mitigation. Future policies should take these positive values for cobenefits into account. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Group of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the International Climate Policy: Evolution, Achievements, Prospects","Global climate change is one of the main challenges of our time. Rising temperatures threaten the stability of the ecological, socioeconomic, and political systems of the world’s nations. Countries of the Global South suffer the greatest material losses due to climate change, without having a significant impact on it. The high vulnerability of the LDCs group to climate change, together with social and economic backwardness, population poverty, and lack of means for adaptation, determines the special rank and status of the group in international climate policy. The LDCs group acts as a single actor in it. During more than 30 years of the LDCs’ climate policy, the adoption of a number of important documents and the creation of structures, fundamental to the international climate policy, have been established. At the same time, there have been major transformations in the process of adaptation and decarbonization of national LDC structures. The purpose of this paper is to show the role of the LDCs group in the formation of the UN climate agenda, institutional structures, and international mechanisms, as well as to assess the current national climate policy based on the regulatory documents adopted in the LDCs to characterize the features and main directions of these countries’ domestic climate policy. The methodological framework of the research is based on the structural-analytical and comparative approaches. The main objective is to study the LDCs group’s climate policy trajectories, highlight the stages of its evolution, and assess the climate efforts of individual countries. Policy initiatives of LDCs played a direct role in the formation of climate funds (AF, GCF, LDCF, etc.), the LDC expert group, and national programs and plans for states’ adaptation to climate change. Therefore, it is concluded that there are two stages in the development of LDCs’ climate policy; it is assumed that international mechanisms for adaptation and decarbonization can become instruments of economic and technological modernization of LDCs and their achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Inequality in aquatic ecosystem services,"Multiple aquatic ecosystem services (ES) sustain humanity, but some of them may not be equitably accessible to all people. We take a transdisciplinary approach to recent literature to highlight some of the inequalities specific to aquatic ecosystems, focusing on provisioning, supporting and cultural aquatic ES. We also explore feedbacks between access to ES, awareness, and public support for those services. Without targeted interventions, inequality in aquatic ecosystem service delivery is likely to continue to increase with the projected increase in wealth gaps, increasing global trade insensitive to local values, decreasing awareness of ES availability, and increasing urban population without access to green and blue spaces. We conclude by highlighting examples of potential research needs, emphasizing that systematic assessment of inequality is the first step in seeking equitable access to ES and ensuring continuing public support for protection of aquatic ecosystems.",Not About Sufficiency
Comparison of selected airports in terms of sustainability,"The paper explores sustainable development in the context of European airports, analyzing economic, ecological, and social dimensions. Definitions of sustainable development evolve, with the emphasis on meeting current needs without compromising future generations. Four international European airports - Schiphol, Munich, Prague, and Bratislava - are compared and investigated to find out whether airport size affects sustainability. The paper reveals an interconnected relationship between these dimensions: social factors influence economic outcomes, impacting environmental resources for conservation. Ecologically, carbon emissions and noise pollution are examined, with Schiphol emerging as a leader in carbon neutrality due to its scale and resources. The paper highlights the significance of employees' well-being for social sustainability. © 2023 The Authors. Published by ELSEVIER B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustaining Forest Plantations for the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,"Located in the hearth of Africa, the Congo basin is the world’s second largest rainforest ecosystem, spanning over nine countries including the Republic of the Congo. Nature-based solutions, i.e., afforestation, reforestation or agroforestry supplying wood energy, halting food insecurity, restoring land desertification and fostering mitigation and adaptation to climate warming, have been increasingly used in the past decades. Within this framework, Congolese coastal plains have been afforested using fast growing trees since the early 1950s. Due to the low forest productivity and soil fertility, sustainable management of these forest ecosystems (trees, soils and environment) have been performed. Improved germplasms, increased stand wood biomass and healthier soils have the potential to enhance wood and fuel wood energy supply, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, food security, restoration of land and ecosystem biodiversity. This meets ten out of the seventeen sustainable development goals (SDG #), specifically goals related to alleviating poverty (1) and hunger (2), improving health (3), education (4), sanitation and access to clean water (6). Other goals include providing affordable clean energy (7), sustainable production and consumption (12), action on climate change (13), life on land (15), and partnerships for goals (17).

Nitrogen-fixing trees increase organic carbon sequestration in forest and agroforestry ecosystems in the Congo basin,"Experimental evidence on the effects of introducing nitrogen-fixing trees (NFTs) in forests and agroforestry systems on soil properties, crop yields, carbon (C) sequestration, and other ecosystem services in the Congo basin is scarce. A systematic literature review was conducted to study the effects of integrating NFTs in forests and agroforestry systems on tree biomass carbon stocks, soil properties (i.e., soil organic C (SOC), N, P, CEC, C:N ratio), crop yields and other ecosystem services; and examine their contribution to the objectives of 4 per 1000 Initiative. Electronic search engines (Google, Google Scholar) were searched focusing on Acacia auriculiformis-based agroforestry in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Acacia mangium-based forestry in Republic of the Congo (RoC). This study suggests that integrating NFTs in both agricultural and forest landscapes in the Congo basin (DRC and RoC) improves the soil health through C sequestration and nutrient restoration relative to tropical savannas. This practice also generates other ecosystem services (i.e., pulp and fuelwood energy supply, poles for electricity network, food availability, land restoration). Integrating NFTs in forest and agroforestry ecosystems could therefore improve soil health and food security, mitigate climate change, and hence promote the objectives of 4 per 1000 Initiative.",Not About Sufficiency
Ensuring planetary survival: the centrality of organic carbon in balancing the multifunctional nature of soils,"Not only do soils provide 98.7% of the calories consumed by humans, they also provide numerous other functions upon which planetary survivability closely depends. However, our continuously increasing focus on soils for biomass provision (food, fiber, and energy) through intensive agriculture is rapidly degrading soils and diminishing their capacity to deliver other vital functions. These tradeoffs in soil functionality - the increased provision of one function at the expense of other critical planetary functions - are the focus of this review. We examine how land-use change for biomass provision has decreased the ability of soils to regulate the carbon pool and thereby contribute profoundly to climate change, to cycle the nutrients that sustain plant growth and ecosystem health, to protect the soil biodiversity upon which many other functions depend, and to cycle the Earth's freshwater supplies. We also examine how this decreasing ability of soil to provide these other functions can be halted and reversed. Despite the complexity and the interconnectedness of soil functions, we show that soil organic carbon plays a central role and is a master indicator for soil functioning and that we require a better understanding of the factors controlling the behavior and persistence of C in soils. Given the threats facing humanity and their economies, it is imperative that we recognize that Soil Security is itself an existential challenge and that we need to increase our focus on the multiple functions of soils for long-term human welfare and survivability of the planet.",Not About Sufficiency
Suitable landscape classification systems for quantifying spatiotemporal development of riverine ecosystem services,"River systems provide numerous ecosystem services that contribute to human well-being. Biophysical quantification of spatiotemporal development of ecosystem services is useful for environmental impact assessments or scenario analyses of river management and could be done by linking biophysical indicators of relevant ecosystem services to landscape classifications that allow analyses of natural and management-induced changes in riverscape characteristics. We analyzed 126 case studies in which landscape classification systems (LCSs) were applied over the period 1989-2014. LCSs were mostly applied at regional (subnational) scales and linked to ecosystem services in 46 case studies. Ecosystem services were linked to landscape patches based on quantitative (monetary or biophysical) or semiquantitative approaches. Only 6 case studies linked ecosystem services to river systems. The number of ecosystem services quantified by biophysical indicators and linked to landscape classes also was limited. Moreover, the spatiotemporal development of these indicators in relation to landscape changes is poorly elaborated. Six selected LCSs were considered suitable for application to river systems and biophysical quantification of spatiotemporal development of ecosystem services (e. g., Coordination of Information on the Environment [CORINE] Land Cover, River Ecotope Classification). Future research should be directed to developing sound indicators for quantification of river ecosystem services and analyzing how these services develop spatiotemporally in relation to natural and anthropogenic changes of the riverscape.",Not About Sufficiency
Bioenergy and biofuels science and technology: Scientometric overview and citation classics,"With the ever-increasing human population and the ever-diminishing petroleum-based energy resources, energy security, food security, and environmental issues such as global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change have become a significant public concern in recent decades and bioenergy and biofuels have emerged as the potential key resources to address these concerns. However, as Hill et al. (2006) note, an optimal set of bioenergy and biofuels should “provide a net energy gain, have environmental benefits, be economically competitive, and be producible in large quantities without risking food security.” This paper presents data on the scientometric overview of the research on bioenergy and biofuels as well as the data on 50 citation classics in this research field and discusses the current emerging issues from an interdisciplinary perspective building on the recent pioneering scientometric studies in this field. The paper provides the base for the structure of the book in the lines of bioenergy and biofuels in general, liquid biofuels, gaseous biofuels, solid biofuels, and bioenergy (microbial fuel cells for bioremediation and bioelectricity production). There were more than 106,000 articles and reviews published in English between 1980 and April 2017, of which 60.4% were published recently in the 2010s, and the annual research output rose over 11,000 papers. The bulk of the citation classics (72%) were in biofuels in general terms and liquid biofuels. The paper concludes that these scientometric studies provide valuable insights for the stakeholders on the current state of the research in bioenergy and biofuels, highlighting the primary players such as authors, institutions, countries, grant bodies, and journals as well as highlighting influential papers significantly impacting the development of the research in their respective research streams.

Hotspots of land-use change in global biodiversity hotspots,"Land-use conversion from natural areas to agriculture and human settlements is causing global biodiversity loss. We proposed a human land-use disturbance index (LDI) to assess habitat loss and fragmentation in global biodiversity hotspots from 1992 to 2015. Negative (LDI > 1) and positive (LDI < 1) impacts on habitat were observed in 30 and 6 biodiversity hotspots, respectively. The hotspots with a relatively small proportional area of nature-dominated land were more likely to face habitat loss. The area of nature-dominated land in the global biodiversity hotspots decreased by 287.37 × 103 km2, which was 1.56% of the level in 1992. Agricultural land occupation and urban encroachment contributed to approximately 90% and 10% of the habitat loss in global biodiversity hotspots, respectively. Habitat loss caused by agricultural land occupation was notable in the hotspots (Sundaland, Indo-Burma and Cerrado) within the developing nations, whereas urban expansion threats to biodiversity were more evident in the hotspots (North American Coastal Plain and Forests of East Australia) within the developed nations. Together with the human development index (HDI) results, we found that low land-use disturbance did not occur as expected in developed areas. The 6 biodiversity hotspots with positive effects were all located in the developing nations. The results indicated that human development did not necessarily result in negative effects on habitats; however, human development goals oriented by the HDI without environmental and ecological dimensions would not be beneficial to biodiversity conservation. These findings shed new light on the impacts of land-use change on global biodiversity hotspots and provide valuable information for global land-use monitoring and biodiversity risk assessments. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
Relationships of priming effects with organic amendment composition and soil microbial properties,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration through the application of organic amendments (OAs) is considered an important strategy to offset anthropogenic Cv93.0O2 emissions while simultaneously enhancing soil quality and food security. The efficiency of SOC sequestration, however, depends on the priming effect which is influenced by interactions of OA composition with soil microbial response variables (MRVs). Yet, there remain large uncertainties surrounding the mechanisms and relationships defining these interactions, hampering the identification of OAs most effective for SOC sequestration and hindering the inclusion of OA dynamics in soil carbon models. In this study therefore, we performed an integrated assessment of these interactions for a cropland soil amended with wood chips, waterway residues, and isotopically enriched road-verge grasses, compost, and bokashi. Changes in 11 microbial properties and priming effects (for isotopically labelled OAs) were monitored for 150 days and related to 22 characterizations of OA composition. We demonstrate that i) hot water extractable to total carbon ratios of OAs are superior predictors of priming effects, ii) dissolvable to hot-water extractable carbon ratios are most closely related to variation in MRV expressions, and iii) priming effects correlate significantly with changes in several MRVs. Findings advocate for the adoption of energetic principles in modelling and predicting microbially-mediated soil carbon dynamics and suggest that application of OAs with high hot water to total carbon concentrations – potentially achievable by composting, but not fermenting, OAs prior to application – can allow for more efficient SOC sequestration. © 2022 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Socio-economic impacts of future electricity generation scenarios in Europe: Potential costs and benefits of using CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS),"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a potential key-technology to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as its use can lead to lower mitigation cost. However, research on other economic impacts of using CCS is scarce. In this paper, we look into economic upstream impacts of CCS use in terms of employment, Gross Value Added (GVA) and import dependency on the macro- and sector-level in Western Europe. We determine these impacts by a static comparison of two scenarios of power production with and without CCS (differences in energy efficiency investments between these scenarios were not accounted for). The two scenarios, both representing a stringent climate policy regime, were produced with the energy-system-simulation-model (TIMER) following the same emission profile until 2050. Data from the two scenarios were respectively implemented into a projected version of a global-multiregional IO-Model (EXIOBASE). Macro-level results suggest slightly higher gross employment, but lower Gross Value Added (GVA) (by 25%), and higher import dependency in the CCS-including scenario compared to the CCS-excluding scenario, given that biomass with CCS (BECCS) is available. Sector-level results show disproportionally higher differences between the scenarios in GVA and employment for some sectors compared to other sectors. Particularly, sectors providing fuels (here mostly bio-energy) have significantly higher GVA and employment in the CCS scenario. This study thus reveals interesting upstream economic effects, which can be linked to the technology choice. However, the exact quantitative results depend strongly on model assumptions. Results therefore need to be further explored in other models. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Leaf-cutting ants negatively impact the regeneration of the Caatinga dry forest across abandoned pastures,"The mechanisms affecting forest regeneration in human-modified landscapes are attracting increasing attention as tropical forests have been recognized as key habitats for biodiversity conservation, provision of ecosystem services, and human well-being. Here we investigate the effect of the leaf-cutting ants (LCA) Atta opaciceps on regenerating plant assemblages in Caatinga dry forest. Our study encompassed 15 Atta opaciceps colonies located in landscape patches with a gradient of forest cover from 8.7% to 87.8%, where we monitored regenerating individuals (seedlings and saplings of woody and herbaceous plants) in different habitats (nests, foraging areas, and control areas) over one year. We recorded 2,977 regenerating plant individuals, distributed among 55 species from 23 families. Herbaceous plants represented 82.1% and 58.2% of the total number of individuals and species, respectively. Species richness of both the whole and herbaceous plant assemblages increased along the forest cover gradient, but without difference between the habitats. Total plant abundance was highest in control areas followed by foraging areas and nests and this pattern held for both woody and herbaceous plants. Although forest cover did not influence the abundance of herbaceous plants and the whole plant assemblage, it positively affects woody plant abundance across control areas. Forest cover and habitat changed species composition of both the entire regenerating and the herbaceous assemblages. These results together indicate that LCA negatively impact regenerating plant assemblages, particularly in those sites with increased forest cover. As LCA proliferate in human-modified landscapes, they may prevent plant regeneration of disturbed areas. © 2020 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation",Not About Sufficiency
Overview of Ecosystem-Based Approaches to Drought Risk Reduction Targeting Small-Scale Farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Rain-fed agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) provides major but highly climate-dependent sources of livelihoods. Recurrent dry spells and droughts can impact SSA's agro-ecosystems in multiple ways, negatively affecting local social-ecological systems (SES).

However, ecosystems can also frequently be powerful agents for drought mitigation and resilient livelihoods. Ecosystem-based approaches mitigate drought impacts while providing multiple co-benefits which contribute to poverty alleviation and sustainable development, food security, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and livelihood resilience. In drought risk management, ecosystem-based solutions have always been important, even if not explicitly acknowledged as such. Based on available literature, this chapter provides an overview of approaches for drought risk reduction in SSA in the context of ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA). Using selected criteria, the review found many types of approaches, which strengthen functionality of the ecosystem and offer substantial environmental and socio-economic benefits, and thus help to mitigate drought impacts. More information on the limits of these approaches is needed in order to integrate them effectively into Eco-DRR and EbA programmes and complement them with more traditional disaster risk reduction strategies.",Not About Sufficiency

Advancing the Sustainability of US Agriculture through Long-Term Research,"Agriculture in the United States must respond to escalating demands for productivity and efficiency, as well as pressures to improve its stewardship of natural resources. Growing global population and changing diets, combined with a greater societal awareness of agriculture's role in delivering ecosystem services beyond food, feed, fiber, and energy production, require a comprehensive perspective on where and how US agriculture can be sustainably intensified, that is, made more productive without exacerbating local and off-site environmental concerns. The USDA's Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network is composed of 18 locations distributed across the contiguous United States working together to integrate national and local agricultural priorities and advance the sustainable intensification of US agriculture. We explore here the concept of sustainable intensification as a framework for defining strategies to enhance production, environmental, and rural prosperity outcomes from agricultural systems. We also elucidate the diversity of factors that have shaped the past and present conditions of cropland, rangeland, and pastureland agroecosystems represented by the LTAR network and identify priorities for research in the areas of production, resource conservation and environmental quality, and rural prosperity.

"Conservation in Africa: exploring the impact of social, economic and political drivers on conservation outcomes","Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) houses some of the globe's most valuable biodiversity-including charismatic megafauna, a great diversity of birds, endemic plants and ecological processes. But it also remains one of the most economically impoverished regions of the planet, introducing significant social, political, and economic challenges to conserving biodiversity while enhancing human well being. Much of the conservation effort in Africa has focused on biological diversity through the establishment of parks and protected areas to house endangered or valuable species. More recently, the efforts in SSA have begun to focus on ecosystem services-the goods and services (such as, e.g., clean water, disease regulation, sacred places) ecosystems and their resident species can deliver to humans. Many of the most significant impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services, however, or from domains and influences not traditionally explored or addressed by the conservation community. This special issue of Environmental Research Letters focuses on the social, economic, and political drivers of conservation outcomes in Africa, with a particular focus on sub-Saharan Africa. It explores the status of conservation in Africa, and examines how long-term environment and human-environment interactions can shape biodiversity distributions and conservation outcomes with emphasis on how institutions (governance); private investment (e.g., mineral exploitation, trade in ivory); foreign investment (aid, poverty alleviation); the status of women; wealth and wealth inequality; urbanization; civil conflict; and climate change can affect conservation-outcomes in Africa.",Not About Sufficiency
The costs and benefits of conservation versus logging of old-growth native forest: A case history,"Pureora Forest Park is one of the largest remaining and most ecologically and culturally significant areas of the native forest that once clothed almost all the North Island of New Zealand. Systematic logging and the establishment of sawmilling villages began in the Pureora area in the late 1940s. Concern about the effects of logging of virgin forest on native fauna accelerated until 1978, when a widely publicised tree-sitting protest led to a forced moratorium. The settlement that followed stopped the logging, closed the sawmills, and caused mass local unemployment and social conflict. The long-term solution required an integrated approach, reconciling the needs of economic resource utilisation with those of social welfare and biodiversity conservation. This paper describes the processes leading up to the unprecedented financial settlement that saved the forest, plus the details of the compensation package paid to timber companies for broken contracts, and the consequent benefits for conservation and tourism. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Seeking common ground: How natural and social scientists might jointly create an overlapping worldview for sustainable livelihoods: A South African perspective,"In this paper, an attempt is made to identify key factors that may enhance the basis for collaboration at the interface between social and natural sciences, and to describe conceptually how natural capital differs from social capital. The paper begins by building on what is believed to be concepts common to both fields. In particular, it equates ecosystem services with natural capital, drawing especially on notions of the underpinning nature of ecosystem services as natural capital and suggesting key aspects of social science that add indispensable value to conservation, as part of a wider recognition of social capital. It is concluded that it is most realistic and productive to regard the world, not as compartmentalised, but as an integrated socioecological system. In this regard by way of example, the positive potential of ecotourism in South Africa and how it integrates natural and social capital is contrasted with the negative potential of Invasive Alien Species. This leads to a discussion of South Africa's National Biodiversity Framework as an opportunity to make use of an integrated approach to biodiversity conservation. The mutually beneficial co-existence of people and protected areas is pivotal to any success in this regard and the 'Swi ta Lunga' Trust is discussed as an emerging Integrated Conservation and Development project which has poten-tial for mutually reinforcing positive natural and social capitals. A common understanding of the interconnectedness and interdependence of biophysical and social sciences, is the key to creating a joint platform for biophysical and social scientists, helping them to develop common objectives and a unified, or at least a significantly overlapping worldview. The paper concludes that a collaborative effort is required to drive the 'strong sustainability' paradigm that will allow the attainment of this common objective. © King et al. 2007.",Not About Sufficiency
"Environment and livelihood of the Kouni community of the Kayes sub-prefecture (Bouenza, Congo)","Background: The rainforest is a source of particularly diversified natural goods and services, satisfying at least 80% of the population’s needs. Notwithstanding the intimate link between population and biodiversity, anthropogenic pressure and its corollaries, such as global climate change, have led to a specific and genetic erosion of about 30% over the last three decades. The major causes of these are, in the case of the Congo, anarchic urbanization, construction of physical communication infrastructures without an environmental and social impact assessment; and unbridled collection of medicinal plants for commercial purposes. The loss of biodiversity is a clear sign of unsustainable use of natural resources, which the traditional societies depends on for their livelihoods. Methods: Our study conducted at Mvouandzi, subprefecture of Kayes (Congo), is based on the ethnobotanical knowledge survey and floristic inventory. The informants, aged between 15 and 50 years or more comprised 25 men and 43 women who possess plant secrets. Prior to fieldwork, we reviewed existing literature that provided information on the status of inventoried species, their phytogeographic distribution, and known uses within their range. The ethnobotanical knowledge survey took place in two phases, namely: Work with focus groups and conducting personalized interviews with the informants; and the collection of samples coupled, when possible, to the participatory approach. Results: The floristic inventory lists 81 useful species, corresponding to 72 genera and 43 families. Some species are multi-purpose, and 26 of the 60 medicinal plants inventoried are specifically associated with the traditional pharmacopoeia. 36 species are multi-purpose and the others 15 intervene specially in food, 26 in phytotherapy, and 5 in handicrafts. The high values of the ethnobotanical indices (the ethnobotanical use value (VU), the informant consensus factor (CFI), and the level of fidelity (NF)) show a strong involvement of these taxa in the daily life of this traditional society. Sociological analysis reveals that the level of ethnobotanical knowledge is proportional to the subjects’ age and in this matter, women excel in the exploitation of empirical knowledge. Conclusions: The Kouni community possesses a sophisticated ethnobotanical knowledge, which is a fundamental part of socio-cultural base of the Kouni community and an important cultural asset of Congolese nation. However, the Kouni community is shrinking due to rural exodus. Therefore, documenting the existing traditional knowledge is the first priority to preserve the Kouni cultural diversity. © 2019, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

Mobile phone data reveals spatiotemporal recreational patterns in conservation areas during the COVID pandemic,"Understanding visitation patterns is crucial in developing effective conservation strategies for protected areas, as it serves as an indicator for operating an ecosystem management plan that balances biodiversity and ecosystem services intertwined with public health and social benefits. However, limited data availability during the COVID-19 pandemic has hindered the comprehensive understanding of temporal changes in realized cultural ecosystem services, particularly in recreational activities within these areas. Our study utilized GPS data from mobile phones to quantify visitor characteristics and their contribution to recreational ecosystem services in protected areas at a national scale during the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimated the pandemic's relative impact on visitor patterns at 98 visitor centers in national parks and Ramsar sites in Japan. The total number of visitors and travel distance in various sizes of protected areas decreased after the outbreak of COVID-19. The number of visitors in the protected areas displayed a quick recovery despite the increasing positive COVID-19 cases during the following summer. Post-pandemic, visitors showed a preference for less densely populated protected areas closer to their home range. Our findings partly suggest that protecting a diverse range of conservation areas along the urban gradient could be an effective strategy for maintaining the resilience of recreational services during a prolonged pandemic. © 2023, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

Crop genetic erosion: understanding and responding to loss of crop diversity,"Crop diversity underpins the productivity, resilience and adaptive capacity of agriculture. Loss of this diversity, termed crop genetic erosion, is therefore concerning. While alarms regarding evident declines in crop diversity have been raised for over a century, the magnitude, trajectory, drivers and significance of these losses remain insufficiently understood. We outline the various definitions, measurements, scales and sources of information on crop genetic erosion. We then provide a synthesis of evidence regarding changes in the diversity of traditional crop landraces on farms, modern crop cultivars in agriculture, crop wild relatives in their natural habitats and crop genetic resources held in conservation repositories. This evidence indicates that marked losses, but also maintenance and increases in diversity, have occurred in all these contexts, the extent depending on species, taxonomic and geographic scale, and region, as well as analytical approach. We discuss steps needed to further advance knowledge around the agricultural and societal significance, as well as conservation implications, of crop genetic erosion.

However, this region is also subjected to some of the most intense land degradation processes, related to large scale land use change and climate change.To combat land degradation and pursue sustainable land management the concept of land degradation neutrality (LDN) has been proposed. LDN assessments are recommended to be based on global data in regions that lack sufficient regional data such as Central Asia. However, it remains unclear how the selection of datasets influences the estimated extent of land degradation. We followed the LDN framework and first calculated changes to three LDN indicators: land productivity, land cover, and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC). We then evaluated the impact of using different regional and global land cover data on the extent of land degradation in the region. Finally, we calculated a regionally specific integrated indicator on soil quality that we used to assess the ""like-for-like"" principle which enables counterbalancing losses and gains. Our results indicate that particularly the selection of land cover data has a significant impact on the overall assessment of degradation state. The extent of land between 2000 and 2019 varies considerably depending on the data and ranges between 15 and 34 % of the whole Central Asian region.Our findings reveal that the area of degraded land on high quality soils is twice as high as the area of high quality soils where the land condition has improved (12 % versus 6 %). In areas with low soil quality, 13 % was subject to degradation, and 10 % improved.Whilst the degradation extent varies according to the selected land cover datasets, our results demonstrates that Central Asia is undergoing land degradation affecting high quality soils. Sensitivity analysis of multiple datasets can reduce the risk of misjudgement in degradation extent assessments, especially in regions with mosaic ecosystems, such as grasslands.",Not About Sufficiency
Investing in Nature: A Bibliometric Analysis of Biodiversity Finance and Its Contribution to SDGs 14 and 15,"Biodiversity finance is a burgeoning field crucial to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Previous studies solely focused on biodiversity finance without linking it with broader perspectives of SDGs, particularly 14 and 15, highlighting the need to integrate the financial mechanism with these specific sustainability goals. The current study aims to explore the existing literature on biodiversity finance and its relevance to SDGs 14 and 15. It has conducted a bibliometric analysis from 1975 to 2024 based on the data extracted from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases, identified research gaps, existing practices, and trends, and suggested potential areas for further exploration. The findings underscore the critical importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration in supporting the attainment of SDGs. Results reported an increasing tendency in the number of publications and citations over the years. The United States is the most prominent country in terms of publications, institutional affiliation, and corresponding author production. Australia is reportedly the most collaborative country due to its connections with 13 countries. Sustainable finance, climate change, and biodiversity finance are trending topics. The study identified six research themes through thematic analysis: financial systems for conservation management and SDGs attainment, environmental and financial initiatives for human and biodiversity protection, integrated strategies for nature conservation and sustainable tourism, conservation finance and biodiversity management, environmental finance and green economy, and nature-based solutions. These results will highlight the significance of integrating biodiversity finance with the SDGs framework for addressing global environmental, social, economic, and policy issues.",Not About Sufficiency
Research on the development pattern and countermeasures of low-carbon impact of technology innovation capability and sharing economy,"In this study, the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide is an important factor contributing to global climate change. These crises have further exacerbated the growing structural weaknesses of the past decade. We support governments and private sector clients in addressing the ongoing crisis and rebuilding. Even if the Sustainable Development Goals are achieved by 2030, climate change could easily erode those gains. In recent years, greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production have attracted increasing attention. Especially in the context of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the development of low-carbon agriculture is particularly important. Further we investigate whether technology innovation capability directly impacts the performance of root companies, which is considered to be one of their key strengths. As a second objective, we examined whether internal resources that are considered. In order to maintain a company's competitive advantage and achieve excellent business results, it is essential business performance mediate the technology innovation capability and business performance of root companies. Financial and non-financial performance are positively affected by R and D capability, which is an element of technology innovation capability. Investment ratios are proven to affect financial results such as market share, sales and yield, as well as non-financial outcomes such as corporate image and employee satisfaction. Among the factors affecting technology innovation capability, the technology innovation system has positive effects on both financial and non-financial performance.

Assessment of Above-Ground Biomass in Pakistan Forest Ecosystem's Carbon Pool: A Review,"Climate change is acknowledged as a global threat to the environment and human well-being. Forest ecosystems are a significant factor in this regard as they act both as a sink and a source of carbon. Forest carbon evaluation has received more attention after the Paris Agreement. Pakistan has 5.1% forest cover of its total land area, which comprises nine forest types. This study covers the studies conducted on above-ground biomass and carbon stock in various forest types of Pakistan. Most of the studies on biomass and carbon stock estimation have been conducted during 2015-2020. The non-destructive method is mostly followed for carbon stock estimation, followed by remote sensing. The destructive method is used only for developing allometric equations and biomass expansion factors. The information available on the carbon stock and biomass of Pakistan forest types is fragmented and sporadic. Coniferous forests are more important in carbon sequestration and can play a vital role in mitigating climate change. Pakistan is a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol and still lacks regional and national level studies on biomass and carbon stock, which are necessary for reporting under the Kyoto Protocol. This study will help researchers and decision-makers to develop policies regarding Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), conservation, sustainable forest management and enhancement of forest carbon stocks",Not About Sufficiency
"Population, environment and poverty in Pakistan: Linkages and empirical evidence","This study explores the interlinkages among population, environment and poverty and presents empirical evidence in a developing country like Pakistan. It gives alternative views on population environment linkages. It explains poverty trap, market based harmony, and dual effect of poverty on the basis of a link between population growth and natural resource degradation. In addition, the paper also highlights social and political instability through population-poverty-environment spiral. It also presents empirical evidence on population-environment-poverty nexus in Pakistan. It also compares environmental sustainability index and human development index for selected Asian countries. The paper also gives scores for different components of environmental sustainability index for Pakistan and compares these with India. The paper concludes that the causal relationship between poverty and environment works in both directions, often through changes in GDP and population. Population stress does not have any significant direct effect on all aspects of environmental status in Pakistan. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Revisiting the sustainable industrialization paradigm in Africa: Exploring the influence of digitalization,"This research contributes to the ongoing discourse surrounding the sustainable industrialization of African nations, a pivotal aspect emphasized by the United Nations within the Sustainable Development Goals. Drawing inspiration from the burgeoning digitalization trends across Africa, this study examines the role of digitalization in mediating the environmental repercussions of industrialization within the 45 African countries spanning the years 2000–2022. The assessment of environmental sustainability is gauged through ecological footprint and biocapacity. Employing the Environmental Kuznets Curve, and the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology framework, empirical analyses leverage the Generalized Method of Moments and the mediation analysis using structural equation modeling to unveil insightful findings. The research findings highlight the detrimental impact of industrialization on ecological health, evidenced by its correlation with an increase in ecological footprint and a decrease in biocapacity. Conversely, digitalization emerges as a positive influence on environmental well-being. These findings remain consistent across diverse categorizations of digitalization, and ecological balance. Further examination of their interplay reveals a discernible favorable impact on environmental sustainability, with mediation analysis suggesting that digitalization mitigates approximately 4% and 6% of the overall impact of industrialization on ecological footprint and biocapacity, respectively. Additionally, our analysis lends credence to the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. As a result, it is imperative for governments to incentivize industries to adopt eco-friendly practices and technologies in order to mitigate their ecological footprint. At the same time, policies that promote digitalization should be encouraged to further enhance environmental quality. © 2024 The Author(s).

Delivering Goods Using a Baby Pram: The Sustainability of Last-Mile Logistics Business Models,"This study compares the differences in the attitudes of last-mile delivery companies operating with different business models toward economic, environmental, and social sustainability. The economic perspective focuses on productivity, the environment, and social sustainability, and where the environment and social sustainability are concerned, on carbon neutrality goals and means, and on what societal factors companies consider important, respectively. In this multi-case qualitative study, a literature review was carried out and 11 semi-structured expert interviews were conducted in companies representing three business model categories: crowdshipping companies, last-mile providers, and traditional logistics service providers. Based on this study, crowdshipping and last-mile companies were largely loss making, whereas logistics service providers were profitable. The first two groups invest heavily in growth, which explains the loss. All logistics service providers, half of the last-mile providers, and no crowdshipping companies set a carbon neutrality target. The biggest difference in environmental measures comes from the fact that in the crowdshipping business model deliveries are performed partly in conjunction with other travel, emphasizing job creation in society and freedom of work. In contrast, the last-mile and traditional logistics companies emphasized the responsibilities of the employer. For the scientific community, this study provides new insights into the subject from the perspective of different business models. For management, this research provides insight into the views of other companies that can be utilized in future decision making. For example, if the legislation of crowdshipping becomes clearer, then traditional companies could consider using it in their own operations to overcome labor shortages.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecological influences of human population size and distance to urban centres on fish communities in tropical lakes,"Human population growth is a major cause of species extinction worldwide, and tropical fresh waters are among the most imperilled ecosystems. The identification of major drivers of human impacts on fish can benefit conservation programmes and management plans. The influences of the proximity to urban centres and human population size on six ecological indicators of fish communities (abundance, biomass, richness, diversity, average size, and size dominance pattern) were investigated in 48 floodplain lakes of five main rivers of the Brazilian Amazon (Tocantins, Tapajós, Negro, Solimões, and the Lower Amazon). These ecological indicators were also compared among the rivers studied and checked for any influence of the environmental variables of lakes (size, shape of natural shoreline, distance to the main river channel, depth, transparency, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen). Lake distance to urban centre was positively related to average fish size and dominance of large fish, indicating direct human effects caused by fisheries or indirect effects by habitat alteration (e.g. deforestation). Unexpected positive relationships between human population size and the richness and diversity of fishes were found, and may be caused by ecological compensatory effects, the abundance of rare non-fished species, or the proximity of an urban centre to ecotone areas. The other ecological indicators were unrelated to anthropogenic variables. Environmental factors affected fish communities, but did not change the conclusions regarding the effect of the anthropogenic variables. River basin was strongly related to species richness, diversity, biomass, and abundance of fish. Distance to the river channel was positively related to fish biomass. The disappearance of large fish threatens the food security of riverine communities, and may harm essential ecosystem services. Conservation measures, including local management initiatives, protected areas, fisheries monitoring, and the enforcement of existing fishing rules need to be improved or established near urban centres in order to restore healthy fish communities in the Brazilian Amazon. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Optimizing land use decision-making to sustain Brazilian agricultural profits, biodiversity and ecosystem services","Designing landscapes that can meet human needs, while maintaining functioning ecosystems, is essential for long-term sustainability. To achieve this goal, we must better understand the trade-offs and thresholds in the provision of ecosystem services and economic returns. To this end, we integrate spatially explicit economic and biophysical models to jointly optimize agricultural profit (sugarcane production and cattle ranching), biodiversity (bird and mammal species), and freshwater quality (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment retention) in the Brazilian Cerrado. We generate efficiency frontiers to evaluate the economic and environmental trade-offs and map efficient combinations of agricultural land and natural habitat under varying service importance. To assess the potential impact of the Brazilian Forest Code (FC), a federal policy that aims to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services on private lands, we compare the frontiers with optimizations that mimic the habitat requirements in the region. We find significant opportunities to improve both economic and environmental outcomes relative to the current landscape. Substantial trade-offs between biodiversity and water quality exist when land use planning targets a single service, but these trade-offs can be minimized through multi-objective planning. We also detect non-linear profit-ecosystem services relationships that result in land use thresholds that coincide with the FC requirements. Further, we demonstrate that landscape-level planning can greatly improve the performance of the FC relative to traditional farm-level planning. These findings suggest that through joint planning for economic and environmental goals at a landscape-scale, Brazil's agricultural sector can expand production and meet regulatory requirements, while maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. © 2016 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Analysis of Land Use and Land Cover Changes through the Lens of SDGs in Semarang, Indonesia","Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCC) are occurring rapidly around the globe, particularly in developing island nations. We use the lens of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to determine potential policies to address LULCC due to increasing population, suburbia, and rubber plantations in Semarang, Indonesia between 2006 and 2015. Using remote sensing, overlay analysis, optimized hot spot analysis, expert validation, and Continuous Change Detection and Classification, we found that there was a spread of urban landscapes towards the southern and western portions of Semarang that had previously been occupied by forests, plantations, agriculture, and aquaculture. We also witnessed a transition in farming from agriculture to rubber plantations, a cash crop. The implications of this study show that these geospatial analyses and big data can be used to characterize the SDGs, the complex interplay of these goals, and potentially alleviate some of the conflicts between disparate SDGs. We recommend certain policies that can assist in preserving the terrestrial ecosystem of Semarang (SDG 15) while creating a sustainable city (SDG 11, SDG 9) and providing sufficient work for individuals (SDG 1) in a growing economy (SDG 8) while simultaneously maintaining a sufficient food supply (SDG 2).",Not About Sufficiency
Can African environmental ethics contribute to environmental policy in Africa?,"African policy makers have ignored indigenous environmental ethics. The relation between responsible use of the planet's resources and ethics remains apparent in many cultural and social systems of traditional Africa. The local people have developed detailed interactive knowledge of the natural environment, and preserved biodiversity resources, which they have nurtured and developed since time immemorial. African environmental ethics is based on the worldviews of the African people, and can contribute to biodiversity conservation and environmental rehabilitation and protection. It can enlighten policy makers by providing a theoretical foundation for sustainable living. Furthermore, African environmental ethics can expose environmental injustice committed by different groups in Africa, and assist local communities to secure environmental justice and protect their environment. It can create awareness within countries and globally about the actions of transnational corporations, irresponsible countries, and local industries which damage the environment. African environmental ethics may also alert the African people to understand the long-range effects of environmental degradation that are beyond the purview of local people and understanding of which is otherwise unavailable. Modern environmental knowledge about global environmental problems will provide peasant farmers and pastoralists an opportunity to look at their own local concerns and issues within the context of a greater global perspective. Only by involving peasant farmers, pastoralists, and indigenous people at the grass-roots level will African policy makers have the political strength and will to implement serious changes needed to address serious environmental and developmental problems. If policy makers continue to neglect the major contributors to biodiversity conservation and environmentally friendly practices, environmental policies will not have significant impacts on development and environmental protection in Africa.",Not About Sufficiency
Contribution of native forests to climate change mitigation - A common approach to carbon accounting that aligns results from environmental-economic accounting with rules for emissions reduction,"Comprehensive carbon stock and flow accounts integrated with economic information, under an environmental-economic accounting framework, provide a common approach for an information system to improve policy-making for climate change mitigation, sustainable development and forest management. The information system includes environmental and economic data, linkages between land use activities, their co-benefits, inputs to the economy and benefits for human well-being. Forest management was used as an example of application of the accounting framework because it has the greatest climate change mitigation potential of all land use activities. A case study developing carbon accounts for a forest region in south-eastern Australia demonstrated the mitigation benefits of long-term carbon storage and sequestration in native forests. Using environmental-economic accounts helped identify policy and market instruments required to value ecosystem services of carbon storage and sequestration by applying a potential market price for carbon. We identified benefits of native forest protection as a carbon abatement activity, and compared this value to that of current forest management for timber harvesting that reduces carbon stocks. Both land uses provided similar economic contributions (approximately $12 million yr(-1), using a minimal carbon price), but native forest protection has additional co-benefits of improving water yield, tourism, recreation and biodiversity conservation. The accounts determine values of land use activities in physical and monetary metrics, and link these to beneficiaries of ecosystem services, so that maximum benefits for public good are identified. Quantifying ecosystem services of carbon storage (protecting stocks) and sequestration (increasing flows) in a native forest region, by applying a potential market price, broadens the policy options for mitigation activities. Adopting a comprehensive accounting system, and changing some of the definitions and rules under the Paris Agreement and national emissions reduction policies and markets, would allow the mitigation benefit of protecting native forests to be realised.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem accounts define explicit and spatial trade-offs for managing natural resources,"Decisions about natural resource management are frequently complex and vexed, often leading to public policy compromises. Discord between environmental and economic metrics creates problems in assessing trade-offs between different current or potential resource uses. Ecosystem accounts, which quantify ecosystems and their benefits for human well-being consistent with national economic accounts, provide exciting opportunities to contribute significantly to the policy process. We advanced the application of ecosystem accounts in a regional case study by explicitly and spatially linking impacts of human and natural activities on ecosystem assets and services to their associated industries. This demonstrated contributions of ecosystems beyond the traditional national accounts. Our results revealed that native forests would provide greater benefits from their ecosystem services of carbon sequestration, water yield, habitat provisioning and recreational amenity if harvesting for timber production ceased, thus allowing forests to continue growing to older ages.",Not About Sufficiency
Life cycle assessment and synergistic effects of sustainable strategies to improve environmental sustainability in arid climates,"Adapting sowing date (SD) based on environmental sustainability and increasing productivity is crucial for creating flexibility in agriculture and maintaining food security. This study aimed to optimize SD and nitrogen (N) management using environmental indices in an arid climate. Yield, N use efficiency (NUE), water productivity (WP), and total environmental impact (EI) were assessed for five SDs for barley and triticale crops, along with three levels of N fertilizer application. The AquaCrop model was used for crop yield prediction, and EI was evaluated using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Delayed SD led to a shorter growing period (10.6–12.8 %), decreased WP (76.4–87.5 %), and decreased yield (58.3–87.6 %) for both crops compared to conventional SD. In contrast, earlier SD resulted in an extended growing period (1.7–3.6 %), increased WP (14.8–20.4 %), and increased yield (8.3–10.2 %). NUE showed an inverse relationship with increasing fertilizer levels. The most significant EIs were due to N consumption (33.4 %), followed by diesel (28.5 %) and potassium fertilizer (13.7 %) for both crops. Early SD could reduce EI by an average of 12.5 %. Combining early SD with moderate N levels was the most sustainable approach to maximize yield, minimize water use, and reduce EI, thereby informing sustainable practices for cereal cultivation in similar climates. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Optimization and characterization of lime and GGBS treated fly ash for sustainable road pavement applications,"The increasing consumption of natural aggregates in road construction depletes limited resources and exacerbates environmental degradation, while industrial by-products like fly ash accumulate in landfills, posing health risks and straining land use.

Himalayan ecosystem services and climate change driven agricultural frontiers: a scoping review,"Climate change, rising temperatures, snow melts and more frequent droughts and floods are disproportionately affecting food and water security, habitat health, and agricultural productivity in the Himalayan region. These climatic changes are negatively impacting productivity of staple crops including wheat, maize, and rice at lower altitudes, but may provide opportunities to utilize Climate Change Driven Agricultural Frontiers [CCDAFs] at higher altitudes. Agricultural expansion into CCDAFs paired with behavioural shifts such as replacing traditional crop systems with commercial crops will predominantly affect forests, water resources, and soil health, which are already negatively affected by climate change unless adaptation options are directed to just and sustainable agroecological transitions. By trading regulating, supporting, and cultural services for food and water provisioning services, as are evident in land sparing strategy, the utilization of CCDAFs will have long-term implications for the sustainability of mountain farming systems. Climate change is affecting Himalayan agriculture, food security, and ecosystem services, and scientific literature predominantly focus on one of these topics in isolation, occasionally connecting results to another topic. By classifying literature as predominantly agriculture, food security, or ecosystem service themed, this scoping review identifies sources with multiple dominant themes and explores how the relationships between these topics are represented in literature to provide research based evidence to promote the future expansion of agriculture that is low-carbon, just and sustainable. Gaps in the literature reveal that research is needed on the extent of CCDAFs in the Himalayas and the potential trade-offs on utilizing the frontier areas. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
New services and roles of biodiversity in modern agroecosystems: A review,"Ecosystem services and biodiversity are critical to ensure sustainable development of agricultural activities. Based on available scientific knowledge, high shares of biodiversity are followed by more carbon sequestration, reduced soil erosion risk, improved production and food security. This review aims to detect biodiversity services in three aspects; (1) providing ecosystem services in modern agroecosystems in response to future challenges, (2) the ability of biodiversity to support agroecosystems, and (3) the agenda for future research on biodiversity. To address our research objectives, we conducted a widespread literature search to estimate new services and roles of biodiversity in modern agroecosystems. The search was set from the date of the first relevant article until the end of the year 2017. Biodiversity is measured by many indices. Many recent studies have proposed new methods and software for biodiversity assessment such as BioFTF, BAT, LaDy and Entropart. According to the present literature review, biodiversity has a pervasive role in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. Levels of biodiversity, such as genetic, species and ecosystem, can affect pest control in several ways such as biological control, resulting in complex multi-trophic interactions. The relationships between land use and biodiversity are fundamental in understanding the links between people and their environment. Two models have been planned to increase production in agroecosystems whilst minimizing the consequences for biodiversity: land sharing and land sparing. Studies have shown how biodiversity can be integrated into Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on a global scale. LCA mainly introduces biodiversity as an endpoint category modeled as a loss in species richness due to the conversion and management of land in time and space. This review shows that ecological restoration of agroecosystems is generally effective and can be recommended as a way to increase biodiversity in agricultural ecosystems. The conservation, management, and sustainable use of these services require specific attention and a coherent global policy approach. In conclusion, to protect biodiversity in agroecosystems, a policy consonance and strategic support to ecosystems should be considered. This review suggests that advanced research are needed on relationships between biodiversity and genetic erosion, map of life, pest control and urban agriculture. © 2018",Not About Sufficiency
Kenyan pastoralist societies in transition: varying perceptions of the value of ecosystem services,"In the drylands of northern Kenya, as elsewhere in Africa, traditional pastoralist social-ecological systems are undergoing profound transformations.

In those communities, we examined residents' perceptions of five different potential ecological and economic benefits from the conservation areas. We found that communities varied in residents' perceptions of grazing resource adequacy, the economic sufficiency of their livestock herds, and the benefits of conservation areas. Communities also varied in measures of social capital. We contextualize our findings in terms of the rules and conditions governing each conservation area, the roles of social capital, and the challenges of resource-use trade-offs when perceptions diverge. We conclude that taking stock of perceptions and values placed on ecosystem services is a crucial element of formulating plans for sustainable resource management and navigating trade-offs in the future.",Not About Sufficiency

EDIBLE INSECTS - SAFE FOOD FOR HUMANS AND LIVESTOCK,"This paper describes the contribution of insects to food security and survey future prospects for raising insects at a commercial scale to improve food and feed production, diversify diets, and support livelihoods in both developing and developed countries. It indicates some traditional and potential uses of insects for direct human consumption and the opportunities for and constraints to farming them for food and feed. The concept of sustainable diets, with biodiversity and at its core, has recently received renewed attention as the world struggles with many natural and man-made disasters. Sustainable diets are those diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources [222]. Edible insects have always been a part of human diets. Although the majority of consumed insects are gathered in forest habitats, mass-rearing systems are being developed in many countries. Insects offer a significant opportunity to merge traditional knowledge and modern science to improve human food security worldwide. However, the urbanization has led to new human bahaviour that is far from natural resources and distant to the wild environment. Additionally, in some societies there is a degree of distaste for inscts consumption that further developed a standstill of the grasshopers in the Nile vally (Amar, 2003). Although the majority of edible insects are gathered from forest habitats, innovation in mass-rearing systems has begun in many countries. Insects offer a significant opportunity to merge traditional knowledge and modern science in both developed and developing countries. Edible insects as food fit comfortably within this environmentally sound scenario and, by extension, ought to be considered prime candidates as both food staples and supplements, as well as more generally for their role in sustainable diets. Sustainability of food and agriculture activities upon which 2.4 billion people depend for livelihoods was considered a key driver in the transition towards a green economy, due to its dual positive impact on ecosystem services and poverty alleviation [222, 229]. Recent studies confirm that the insects are potentially an important energy efficient source of protein for humans, either through a direct consumption or as food supplements for stock. The high protein content is an indication that the insects can be of value in man and animal ration and can eventually replace higher animal protein usually absent in the diet of rural dwellers in developing countries [87]. The protein content varies by species of insects, but generally is of a good quality and high digestibility [48]. Analyses showed that in egg, larva, pupa and adult stages, the raw protein content is generally 15-81% / dry basis. With a daily growing world population, there are now more than 3.7 billion people suffering from malnutrition, mainly due to lack of protein and energy from food. Associated with the declining availability of land, water and energy resources per capita [35], we need to conserve and manage these resources to produce more food. Animal husbandry competes for these vital resources, as the land is occupied by the production of feed and cannot be used to produce food for humans [18]. Livestock production is very expensive because it requires a large input of water, grain and fodder as well as human effort and energy from fossil resources [35]. Utilization of insects as a protein source could benefit insect conservation through habitat protection [18]. Insects are essential agents feeding on organic matter in nature, and they efficiently exploit all organic sources. It is also important that insects are able to recycle organic waste and provide nutrients for farm animals [1, 179, 191]. Hence, insects could be used as efficient biotransformers to convert abundant, low cost organic wastes into animal biomass rich in proteins and suitable for use in animal nutrition. In a world as it is today, insects can contribute to human nutrition. Raising insects using waste biomass is already being implemented and managed today, with minimal infrastructure. Furthermore, insect culture requires little areas. Many of the edible insect species do not compete with human beings for food resources. The energetic cost of collecting edible insects is lower than that for vertebrates. Hence, insects may efficiently provide the necessary energy for the vital functions of our organism. Some species of edible insects have mostly the polyunsaturated fat type, as they feed on vegetables with largely unsaturated fats [1]. Mostly, the fat content of edible insects is between 10-50%. The fat content of insects depends on many factors such as species, reproductive stages, season, age (life stage), or sex, habitat and diet. For example, the fat content is higher in the larva and pupa stages; at the adult stage, the fat content is relatively lower. Female insects contain more fat than male insects. As a general statement it could be said that insects are not inferior to other sources of protein such as fish, chicken or beef. Insects can partly replace the increasingly expensive protein ingredients of compound feeds in the livestock, poultry and aquaculture industries. Grains now used as livestock feed, which often comprise half the cost of meat production, could then be used for human consumption [182]. In 2011, combined world feed production was estimated at 870 million tonnes, with revenue from global commercial feed manufacturing generating approximately US$350 billion globally. FAO estimates that production will have to increase by 70 percent to be able to feed the world in 2050, with meat outputs (poultry, pork and beef) expected to double [19]. A major constraint to further development are the prohibitive costs of feed, including meat meal, fishmeal and soybean meal, which represent 60-70 percent of production costs. Another problem is manure disposal, which is becoming a serious environmental problem; large amounts of manure to be stockpiled in open-air, swarming with flies and potential human health hazards. It is striking to realize that the agricultural sector is the leading cause of human-induced climate change. Roughly one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions are due to agriculture, if we include the carbon dioxide emissions from deforestation (mainly to clear land for farming and pasture), energy use in agriculture (including the production of chemical fertilizers), methane released by ruminant livestock and rice paddies, and nitrous oxide released by the heavy use of nitrogen fertilizers. We will need new technologies, and new patterns of food consumption, based on healthier and more sustainable diets [20]. There is a wealth of traditional and cultural knowledge on the uses of edible insects as food in tropical countries, yet production is largely concentrated in household and small-scale operations. In temperate countries, processing technology is virtually nonexistent because edible insects are not recognized food and feed sources. If insects are to become a useful and profitable raw material in the food and feed industries, large quantities of quality insects will need to be produced on a continuous basis. This requires both introducing new farming and processing methods, which remains a challenge for the development of the sector. However, major requirements are rearing practices in tropical countries should employ local species because they pose virtually no risk to the environment, there is no need for climate control, and such local species are likely to be more culturally accepted. Selection criteria should involve ease of rearing, taste, colour and whether they can be used as feed. In temperate zones, cosmopolitan species like the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) should be used, or those that do not pose environmental risks. Species destined for mass production, moreover should possess certain characteristics, including a high intrinsic rate of increase; a short development cycle; high survival of immatures and high oviposition rate; a high potential of biomass increase per day (i.e. weight gain per day); a high conversion rate (kg biomass gain per kg feedstock); the ability to live in high densities (kg biomass per m(2)); and low vulnerability to disease (high resistance). Good candidates were considered to be the black soldier fly (Hermetia illuscens) for feed and the yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) for both food and feed [1]. Additionally, insect animal feed developed from manure and related organic waste streams raises bacteriological, mycological and toxicological concerns. The polarity of views surrounding the practice of entomophagy requires tailor-made communication approaches. In parts of the world where entomophagy is well established, such as the tropics, communication strategies need to promote and preserve edible insects as valuable sources of nutrition in order to counter the growing westernization of diets. In areas where food security is fragile, edible insects need to be promoted as key foods and feeds for nutritional, cultural and economic reasons. However, Western societies still largely averse to the practice of eating insects will require tailored strategies that address the disgust factor and break down common myths surrounding the practice. In general, education is the key instrument for creating public awareness of the potential roles of insects and in influencing consumer choices towards a more balanced and favourable outlook on insects as food and feed. Research on the contribution of edible insects to nutrition and economy, on insect species' biology and ecology has to be implemented in projects on sustainable agriculture/food. Additionally, addressing the entomophagy disgust factor in Western societies might depend largely on the ability to involve the entire educational community. The past decade, however, has seen a slow but steady rise in food insects in formal education. As of the end of 2011, 46 percent of the universities in the United States - the main food and agricultural universities in the country - had at least one course in their curricula that featured food insects. In the Netherlands, the Laboratory of Entomology at Wageningen University offers ""insects and society"" courses including entomophagy. The Laboratory has an outstanding reputation in multitrophic interactions, biological control, malaria vector research and entomophagy, and draws worldwide attention to the issue of entomophagy. The objective is to explore the potential sustainable production of edible insects and insect-derived products, particularly proteins, as a reliable and high-quality food source with a lower negative environmental impact than conventional meat production. Governmental bodies have important roles to play in promoting insects as food and feed. In particular, the development of this new sector as a viable (and environmentally friendly) alternative to the conventional food and feed. Experts from international agencies, scientific institutions and private-sector stakeholders, together with staff from relevant FAO sectors created webportal on edible insects since 2010. It provides basic information on the use and potential of edible insects as well as relevant weblinks, such as to the proceedings of the conferences, information on the Expert Consultation Meetings and other relevant technical information, videos and media coverage. The address of the webportal is www.fao.org/forestry/edibleinsects. In developed countries, insect rering occurs mainly on family-operated farms. Presently, there are only a few large-scale industrial plans that rear insects. The most common insects that were collected or reared within Europe are: Acheta domesticus, Bombyx mori, Galleria mellonella, Gryllus assimillis, Hermetia illucens, Locusta migratoria, Musca domestica, Schistocerca gregaria, T. molitor and Zophobas atratus [225]. The H. illucens reperesent the species of good rearing potential because it substantially reduce biowaste and house fly breeding and additionally can be used as animal food [226]. Except this invasive species, few native species as grass hopers, crickets, and mealworms, are significant source of proteins. A number of species in Serbia are highly abundant and pose a molesting problem. This is a case with flood water mosquitoes, insects of Chironomidae family and house flies. Resarch on their mass production as potential food source for house pets, animals or as a part of organic fertilazers could support a small scale of organic farming production in rural regions. Additionally, it should not be forgotten that some of the species have important impact in waste decomposition, hence create additional value to the family-operated farms. Insect rearing is easy, does not require much of technical knowledge nor high investments, therefore accessable to a majority of rural inhabitants of a law income. The production and consumption of insects should also be analysed from the viewpoint of their potential impact on health and biodiversity and the potential environmental hazards associated with insect production and release, including the accidental release of insect species not indigenous to the area of production. People, especially in areas where insects were not consumed for a long time, prefer incorporating insects into the food in a way they are not visible, so they accept only the idea that the insects have a nutritional value. This shows that people especially in North America and Europe can eat insects if they do not know what they are eating.These factors suggest that insect transformation will facilitate its consumption in the future. In practice, dried insects may be crushed or pulverized, and raw or boiled insects ground or mashed, making their insect form unrecognizable [9]. Much work still needs to be done and many issues taken into account when elaborating normative frameworks and adjusting for insect-inclusive food laws. At the Expert FAO Meeting in 2012, therefore, a working group developed the following proposals for elaborating regulatory frameworks [59]. Private and public standards may establish the basis of harmonized regulatory practices on the use of insects as food and feed. Legal frameworks should be developed to consolidate and set binding provisions and to ensure the implementation and enforcement of such provisions throughout the sector. It is necessary to promote the establishment of appropriate international and national standards and legal frameworks to facilitate the use of insects as food and feed and the development and formalization of the sector. It is also very important to take into consideration the potential effects of insect production and rearing on the environment, and the environmental and trade implications of the international movement of insects. Develop a clear and comprehensive legal framework at the (inter-) national level that can pave the way for production and trade in insect products for food and feed internationally. In the Western world, consumer acceptability will be determined, in large part, by pricing, perceived environmental benefits, and the development by the catering industry of tasty insect-derived protein products. Preservation and processing techniques are needed to increase shelf life, conserve quality and increase the acceptability of insect food products; processing procedures are also needed to transform insects into protein meal for animal/fish feedstock and for the extraction of insect proteins to be used as ingredients in the food industry. Considering the immense quantities of insect biomass needed to replace current protein-rich ingradients such as meal and oil from fish and soybeans, automated massrearing facilities that produce stable, reliable and safe products need to be developed. The challenge for this new industry will be to ensure the cost-effective, reliable production of an insect biomass of high and consistent quality. Regulatory frameworks need to be developed. The close collaboration of government, industry and academia will be essential for success.",Not About Sufficiency

ICT service exports and CO2 emissions in OECD countries: the moderating effect of regulatory quality,"This research assesses the impact of information communication technology (ICT) service exports on carbon (CO2) emissions and examines regulatory quality's moderating role. The study sample comprises OECD countries' data from 2001 to 2019. Random-effect generalized least-square regression, feasible generalized least square, and panel-corrected standard error models are used for the estimations. The results show that ICT service exports are negatively related to CO2 emissions, and the negative effect of ICT on CO2 emissions will be enhanced when regulatory quality is higher. OECD countries should give greater support to improve the innovation capabilities of ICT companies and implement more sound policies and regulations to achieve sustainable development goals and carbon neutrality.",Not About Sufficiency
Indicators and tools for assessing sustainability impacts of the forest bioeconomy,"Abstract: The sustainable use of renewable resources has become an important issue worldwide in the move towards a less fossil-fuel-intensive future. Mainstream method for fulfilling this aim is to increase the share of renewable energy and materials to substitute fossil fuels and to become fully independent from fossil fuels over the long-term. However, the environmental sustainability of this endeavor has been questioned. In addition, economic and social sustainability issues are also much debated topics in this particular context. Forest resources are often thought to contribute partially to achieving a so-called “carbon-neutral society”. In this review, we discuss sustainability issues of using forest biomass. We present several sustainability indicators for ecological, economic and social dimensions and discuss the issues in applying them in sustainability impact assessments (SIAs). We also present a number of tools and methods previously used in conducting SIAs. We approach our study from the perspective of the Finnish forestry; in addition, various aspects regarding the application of SIAs in a broader context are also presented. One of the key conclusions of the study is that although sufficient data are available to measure many indicators accurately, the impacts may be very difficult to assess (e.g. impact of greenhouse gases on biodiversity) for conducting a holistic SIA. Furthermore, some indicators, such as “biodiversity”, are difficult to quantify in the first place. Therefore, a mix of different methods, such as Multi-criteria Assessment, Life-cycle Assessment or Cost-Benefit Analysis, as well as different approaches (e.g. thresholds and strong/weak sustainability) are needed in aggregating the results of the impacts. SIAs are important in supporting and improving the acceptability of decision-making, but a certain degree of uncertainty will always have to be tolerated. Highlights: •Forest bioeconomy involves a range of multidimensional impacts. •A variety of methods exist to assess and evaluate sustainability. •Social sustainability is the most case-specific dimension to assess. •Indicators used in SIAs need case-specific considerations. •More consistency is needed regarding the concept and terminology of sustainability. © 2017, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

Joint nitrogen and phosphorus management for sustainable development and climate goals,"The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Climate Agreement are possibly the two most important pieces of international environmental policy thus far this century. The SDGs set a number of socioeconomic and environmental targets to be achieved by 2030, and the Paris Climate Agreement provides a framework for the international community to stay below the 2 degrees C temperature threshold. Such a range of ambitious goals will require measures that can simultaneously address several issues and produce multiple co-benefits, from improved water quality to reduced food waste. A joint approach to reducing nitrogen and phosphorus pollution is a prime example given their myriad impacts on the environment and human health. This study assesses the national climate plans of fifteen countries for language indicating a target or clear commitment that could involve improved N and P management. These countries represent 75% of both global greenhouse gas emissions and N and P consumption. We find that a joint approach could make important contributions to achieving all the national climate plans analyzed and 7 out of 17 SDGs. Joint abatement measures exist for wastewater, agriculture and consumer behavior. Challenges to a joint approach to nitrogen and phosphorus management include their role as essential nutrients and key differences in their availability and chemistry. Whilst there is currently insufficient integration between science, policies and practice on this issue, near-term policy opportunities exist. Looking forward, how humanity manages its relationship with these essential nutrients over the coming decades will be a key bellwether of whether sustainable development is truly achievable.",Not About Sufficiency
"Atrazine decontamination by a newly screened psychrotroph Paenarthrobacter sp. KN0901 in an aquatic system: Metabolic pathway, kinetics, and hydroponics experiment","Atrazine residues running off the fields and entering water resources are a major threat to food security and the ecosystem. In this study, a psychrotrophic functional strain named KN0901 to remove atrazine residues was screened. KN0901 could degrade 30 mg·L−1 atrazine in 4 days at 15ºC with 105 CFU·mL−1 incubation. The phylogenetic results showed KN0901 belonged to Paenarthrobacter sp. PCR results showed that the functional genes consist of trzN, atzB, and atzC, suggesting atrazine was transformed to cyanuric acid by KN0901. KN0901 could degrade atrazine without adding exogenous carbon and nitrogen sources. What's more, KN0901 could tolerate extreme low temperature (5ºC) and high atrazine concentration (100 mg·L−1). When growth and degradation curves were compared, the results indicated the length of lag time showed significant correlation to atrazine degradation rate. The hydroponic experiments showed that the toxicity of atrazine was significantly reduced with KN0901 treatment. The study provided an effective, economic, and eco-friendly bioremediation measure to address atrazine contamination. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Journal of crop improvement and the sustainable development goals,"Journal of Crop Improvement: (JCI) began its journey in 1997. It has been publishing papers related to sustainability of agriculture in one form or another ever since. Sustainable agricultural systems involve the use of farming practices that protect the environment, public health and human communities. They also ensure animal welfare, protect biodiversity and promote healthy ecosystems. Agricultural scientists recognize that one of the best ways of alleviating the twin scourges of poverty and hunger is through agriculture, i.e., by increasing food production. JCI published a special issue on ‘Agricultural and Environmental Sustainability’ in 2007. In 2009–2010, several articles were published, which specifically addressed important water and agricultural sustainability strategies. In 2013–2014, numerous articles on combating climate change from the standpoint of agriculture were published. The issues at the core of JCI have also been enshrined in the United Nations’ ‘Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDGs), which were established in 2015. In this article, I have highlighted and documented how what we publish in JCI relate to most of the 17 SDGs.

Carbon dynamics in agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and removals: a comprehensive review,"Agriculture is a pivotal player in the climate change narrative, contributing to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while offering potential mitigation solutions. This study delved into agriculture’s climate impact. It comprehensively analysed emissions from diverse agricultural sources, carbon sequestration possibilities, and the repercussions of agricultural emissions on climate and ecosystems. The study began by contextualising the historical and societal importance of agricultural GHG emissions within the broader climate change discourse. It then discussed into GHG emitted from agricultural activities, examining carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions individually, including their sources and mitigation strategies. This research extended beyond emissions, scrutinising their effects on climate change and potential feedback loops in agricultural systems. It underscored the importance of considering both the positive and negative implications of emissions reduction policies in agriculture. In addition, the review explored various avenues for mitigating agricultural emissions and categorised them as sustainable agricultural practices, improved livestock management, and precision agriculture. Within each category, different subsections explain innovative methods and technologies that promise emissions reduction while enhancing agricultural sustainability. Furthermore, the study addressed carbon sequestration and removal in agriculture, focussing on soil carbon sequestration, afforestation, and reforestation. It highlighted agriculture’s potential not only to reduce emissions, but also to serve as a carbon reservoir, lowering overall GHG impact. The research also scrutinised the multifaceted nature of agriculture, examining the obstacles hindering mitigation strategies, including socioeconomic constraints and regulatory hurdles. This study emphasises the need for equitable and accessible solutions, especially for smallholder farmers. It envisioned the future of agricultural emissions reduction, emphasising the advancements in measurement, climate-smart agricultural technologies, and cross-sectoral collaboration. It highlighted agriculture’s role in achieving sustainability and resilience amid a warming world, advocating collective efforts and innovative approaches. In summary, this comprehensive analysis recognised agriculture’s capacity to mitigate emissions while safeguarding food security, biodiversity, and sustainable development. It presents a compelling vision of agriculture as a driver of a sustainable and resilient future.

Managing Soil Organic Carbon for Multiple Benefits: The Case of Africa,"Organic matter is of great importance in soil, because it impacts on the physical, chemical and biological properties of soils. Physically, it promotes aggregate stability and therefore water infiltration, percolation and retention. Biologically, it stimulates the activity and diversity of organisms in soil. Decomposing organic matter releases nutrients, such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S) and potassium (K), essential for plant and microbial growth. Sustainable land management practices enhance carbon sequestration and sustain agricultural productivity, thus mitigating against climate change. In Western Africa, there is a rapid decline of soil organic carbon (SOC) levels with continuous cultivation. For the sandy soils, average annual losses may be as high as 4.7%, whereas with sandy loam soils, losses are lower, with an average of 2%. In the equatorial forest zone with higher rainfall, abundant moisture favours high biomass production, which in turn brings about higher SOC (similar to 24.5 g kg(-1) organic C) and nitrogen contents. In the Sudan savannah, organic carbon (similar to 3.3-6.8 g kg(-1)) and total nitrogen are very low, because of low biomass production and high rates of decomposition. Estimates of SOC stocks and changes made for Kenya using the Global Environmental Facility Soil Organic Carbon (GEFSOC) Modelling System indicated soil C stocks of 1.4-2.0 Pg (0-20 cm), which compared well with a soil and terrain (SOTER)-based approach that estimated similar to 1.8-2.0 Pg (0-30 cm) of soil C between 2000 and 2030 in Kenya. Direct field sampling and laboratory measurements of soil carbon in Kenya has been going on for over half a century, and the data exist in the form of numerous technical and research reports, theses, journal papers and workshop proceedings, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute annual reports and geographic information system (GIS) databases. A combination of biomass measurements and empirical equations has also been employed in Kenya to measure organic carbon stocks. Stratified random sampling of herbaceous standing crop has been carried out at Nairobi National Park to estimate primary production of the grassland savannah. The Carbon Benefits Project, developed between 2009 and 2012 by Colorado State University (USA) in collaboration with Kenya, Nigeria, Niger and China, is able to estimate carbon stocks and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Increasing soil organic matter content can both improve soil fertility and reduce the impact of drought, improving adaptive capacity, making agriculture less vulnerable to climate change, while also sequestering carbon. Agronomic practices in western Kenya include using improved crop varieties, extending crop rotations, notably those with perennial crops that allocate more C below ground, and avoiding or reducing the use of bare unplanted fallow among others. Increasing the soil carbon in farms improves soil fertility, hence improves food security, increases economic returns from carbon revenues and creates business development opportunities for farmers to diversify income-generating activities. Population pressures, declining plot sizes and resource constraints in Africa have led to agricultural intensification and continuous cropping with insufficient inputs, leading to rapid decline in SOC stocks. Sustainable management of organic resources will require interventions by regional governments to help farmers access inputs cheaply, as well as educating farmers on sustainable land management practices.",Not About Sufficiency
"Can cultural ecosystem services contribute to satisfying basic human needs? A case study from the Lofoten archipelago, northern Norway","There is gradual recognition that cultural ecosystem services are critical building blocks for human well-being. Cultural and provisioning services are often intertwined, difficult to separate, and play salient roles in maintaining local identities. However, multiple studies assume links between cultural ecosystem services and human well-being, without quantifying relationships. We surveyed a representative sample of the population in the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway, a region faced with great policy challenges around resource harvesting options. Our objective was to examine how public interest in management issues and attachment to place influences the appreciation of cultural ecosystem services benefits and if these benefits can act as satisfiers of wellbeing. Findings suggest that cultural ecosystem services provide a salient contribution to quality of life in this region, and help satisfy the needs of affection, understanding, creation, subsistence, identity, freedom, participation, protection and leisure. Cultural ecosystem services also constitute salient environmental attributes which contribute to the basic needs of being, having, doing and interacting. The importance of ecosystem services benefits for well-being increases with increasing attachment to the Lofoten environment. We argue that not only the ecosystem services benefits, but the values that emanate from the relationship between people and land should be given greater attention in land use policy.",Not About Sufficiency
The circular economy as a catalyst for environmental and human health,"Sustainable socio-ecological health is key to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the intensification of global grand challenges, including climate change, land and water degradation, rapid urbanization, migration, and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, is compounding the existing poor human and environmental issues. The challenges call for immediate intervention to safeguard socio-ecological well-being if humankind is to achieve the SDGs by 2030 and enhance resilience to change. This chapter focuses on the role that can be played by the circular economy (CE) approach in minimizing negative human and environmental health impacts. Specifically, the degradation of natural resources as a driver for biodiversity loss and climate change is juxtaposed as the main trigger for the emergence of infectious diseases with dire socio-ecological consequences. The failure of linear models to consider transformative and integrated approaches in addressing current interlinked challenges is driving the adoption of circular models to reduce waste in the environment. Although there is still more that needs to be achieved through the CE model, particularly regarding its ability to holistically reduce socio-ecological impacts, its ability to reduce, reuse, and recycle waste materials in the production and consumption process has given it a competitive advantage against the traditional linear economy. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Luxon Nhamo, Sylvester Mpandeli, Stanley Liphadzi and Tafadzwanashe Mabhaudhi.

Crop management practices for carbon sequestration,"Climate change is the worldwide pressing issue as it has impacted on greenhouse gas effect, global temperature rise, change on weather pattern, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. Better soil organic carbon stocks and sequestration potential ensure better land quality through better soil microbial biodiversity and biomass carbon, which are being considered as the major indicators of land quality. Maintaining the equilibrium between influx and out flux soil carbon level through sustainable agricultural management practices is brought out as one of the 17 sustainable development goals. Main aim of the climate change summit and policies is to limit the global mean temperature rise to 2°C above preindustrial level to attenuate climate change by carbon sequestration. Capturing the atmospheric carbon into terrestrial soil pool through improved agricultural management practices results in reduction of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and improvement of soil quality and ensures sustainable agriculture, and it is being considered as one of the possible solutions to mitigate the ill effects of climate change as agriculture is the predominant global land use. Unsustainable intensive agricultural activities depleted soil organic carbon from active carbon pool, which is sensitive to crop production activities, whereas sustainable crop management practices such as conservation tillage, pooling back of crop stubble and farm residues, mulching, incorporation of organic amendments, integrated nutrient management, crop rotation, organic farming, land use change, agroforestry, mixed farming, biochar application, etc. ensure better soil aggregation and its stability, water and nutrient retention, reduced erosion, increased microbial activity, temperature regulation, root growth ascertain carbon sequestration, soil quality, and reduced anthropogenic emissions.

A systematic survey on demand response management schemes for electric vehicles,"The unprecedented proliferation of electric vehicles is envisioned to revolutionize the Intelligent Transportation System as an energy-efficient and environment-friendly alternative to fossil-fuel vehicles. Despite the indispensable benefits of electric vehicles, the enormous and fluctuating energy demand for electric vehicles can imperil the efficiency and stability of the electric grid, which further necessitates the discussion on balancing the demand and supply for electric vehicle efficient charging at the charging station. Some of the research studies focus on the electric vehicle demand response management but without considering various critical aspects such as security, optimality, and fluctuating parameters (electric load or traffic condition) that impact the net-zero emission or carbon neutrality that is required to fulfil some of the United Nation Sustainable Development Goals. Thus, this research study presented an exhaustive meta-survey to secure electric vehicles’ demand response management towards a smart grid environment. Consequently, the research in the meta-survey discussed the taxonomy of demand response for electric vehicles, considering various aspects such as electric vehicle modelling, load forecasting, and optimization techniques. Furthermore, this review studied the holistic discussion on various security techniques such as encryption, authentication, and consensus protocols for protected and preserved electric vehicle demand response management through the smart grid environment. Moreover, a case study is presented that focuses on the security and optimality aspects of demand response management for electric vehicles using blockchain and the reinforcement learning approach. The proposed case study focuses on optimizing electric vehicle energy trading based on optimized energy consumption for secure and efficient demand response management with the smart grid. Finally, the meta-surveys research challenges and future opportunities have been targeted and discussed for secure and optimal electric vehicle demand response management for future works. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Community perceptions to climate change in Finnish Lapland: Examining vulnerabilities and adaptive responses to the changing characteristics of Arctic tourism,"The speed of global warming in the Arctic is faster than in the rest of the world. Climate change is increasingly affecting small communities in the Arctic, which are typically resource-dependent. Local communities are progressively relying on more modern livelihoods such as tourism, the economic role of which has rapidly grown in the region. As Arctic tourism is highly nature-based, its characteristics are changing along with communities, which are dependent on the industry. Thus climate change generates both economic transformations and socio-cultural changes. This thesis focuses on the interplay between tourism development and community-based adaptation, which represents an emerging approach in climate change and tourism research. It aims to assess the current and future vulnerabilities of two communities in Northern Finland. The empirical vulnerability assessment was conducted through 47 semi-structured interviews in two case study communities in Finnish Lapland: Kilpisjärvi and Saariselkä. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify current and future vulnerabilities and adaptation mechanisms. Disaster risk reduction acted as a foundation for developing a selection of participatory tools to visualise vulnerability in terms of space and time. In general, more emphasis should be placed at merging disaster risk reduction with climate change adaptation as they share commonalities in their approach to vulnerability. The results indicate that the current vulnerability in terms of tourism development arises from a limited coping range and strong seasonality. Additional vulnerability is generated through relatively intangible factors related to social vulnerability such as the effects on place attachment and the role of conflicts. The perceived and expected environmental changes combined with other factors force the communities to reconsider their current development paths. The positive impacts of climate change included having relative snow security compared with other regions as well as warming summers. The perceived negative impacts comprised of shortening winters and impacts on flora and fauna. The differences in vulnerabilities were linked with infrastructure and seasonality. Both livelihood and intangible vulnerabilities are affected by a variety of external and internal stresses including community characteristics, global economy and development pressures initiated from the outside. Future vulnerability may increase as communities are keen on increasing nature-based tourism however, simultaneously several adaptation mechanisms are being deployed to reduce vulnerabilities. However, more consideration should be placed on sustainability of adaptation responses as not all of the options currently support the idea of environmental and social integrity.",Not About Sufficiency
Comparative fertilization effects on maize productivity under conservation and conventional tillage on sandy soils in a smallholder cropping system in Zimbabwe,"Components of conservation agriculture (CA) are being widely promoted in southern Africa as one of the strategies to increase food security and mitigate rural poverty, despite there being scarce empirical evidence on their efficacy on degraded soils. On-farm trials were established in Eastern Zimbabwe to assess the effects of tillage systems on maize grain yields under rain-fed conditions across a soil organic matter gradient. The study compared the effects of a) conventional tillage (CT), b) basins-based CA (B-CA), and c) furrow-based CA (F-CA) on sandy soils with contrasting soil organic carbon (SOC). Fields had SOC ranging from 0.18 to 0.89% and clay content from 60 to 150 g kg(-1). A nutrient omission trial using nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), cattle manure (M) and their combinations was set up on twenty farms each with two fields selected by the host farmer as either poor or rich in soil fertility in Study 1, and ten farms in Study 2, each with two fields selected as in Study 1. Fields selected by farmers as poor fields had SOC < 0.4%, were more acidic, had lower amounts of exchangeable bases (Mg, Ca, K), available P and total N. These lab-based results corroborated well with farmers local rating of soil fertility. For Study 1, nutrient management significantly increased maize yields across the three years (P<0.001) but there were no significant tillage effects observed. Grain yields increased from 0.3 Mg ha(-1) for unfertilized control to 4.1 Mg ha(-1) for the NPKSM treatment. Yield response to N was consistently larger than for P or K, irrespective of soil fertility status. Response to N increased with increase in soil fertility, suggesting higher N use efficiency for soils with higher SOC. Except for NPKSM, no significant yield differences were observed under the residual and additive plots for treatments, when N was added each year. At productivity levels of < 4 Mg ha(-1), there was no yield gain in applying both P and K for consecutive years, suggesting that nutrient investments by resource constrained farmers for Year 2 could target only N application. For Study 2, maize grain yields were significantly higher under B-CA compared with both F-CA and CT in the second year (P < 0.01). The consistently larger NPKSM yields highlight the importance of integrated nutrient management, combining mineral and organic sources of nutrients to ensure maize productivity on poor soils in agro-ecologies receiving unreliable rainfall.",Not About Sufficiency
Digital twin-driven strategic demolition plan for circular asset management of bridge infrastructures,"Economic growth plays an important role in the rapid increase in construction of transportation and bridge infrastructures, which in turn causes enormous greenhouse gas emissions contributing directly to climate change. An innovative and effective method, so-called Building Information Modeling (BIM), to sustainably manage detailed lifecycle of infrastructures, has been recently adopted to revolutionise the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Its major function is to sustainably optimise all detailed stages of an infrastructure asset’s lifecycle. A three-dimensional architectural BIM incorporating three additional dimensions (time, cost, and carbon emissions) has then been created in this study to virtualise the whole lifecycle performance of bridge infrastructure through BIM data. For circular asset management, multi-scale details of assets and infrastructures are indispensable. On this ground, these information dimensions are highly critical to asset managers to assure not only public safety, but also sustainability over the whole lifecycle. It is thus critical to quantify carbon footprint in order to identify better alternative solutions for construction and maintenance, resulting in carbon neutrality and carbon credit. Our digital twin (DT), driven by the BIM, has embedded demolition scenarios whose lifecycle cost and carbon footprint can be quantified and optimized simultaneously. Our study is the first to also demonstrate circular end-of-life management through strategic demolition planning that enhances circular economy practice. This aspect is novel and has not been commonly adopted in practice. Our study reveals that the construction stage of the asset lifecycle for this study is the main contributor to carbon emissions and costs stemming from raw materials and their productions. This eventually leads to significant waste at the end of asset’s life, requiring strategic demolition plan to maximise reuse, repurpose, and recycle of materials, parts and components. Our innovative DT is capable of dealing with the cradle-to-cradle lifecycle management. Another co-benefit of using the BIM-based digital twin is to minimise streamlining design, re-work, mitigating risk, and real time processing of design changes in all stakeholders, reducing the effect on carbon emissions, costs, and time schedules. All dimensions (i.e. 6D) can be updated and re-calculated in real time when cross-linked with inspections and condition monitoring, generating real-time digital twin driven solutions. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Is a 'green economy' possible?,"The outcome of the 2012 Rio+20 summit was a sleek 53-page declaration, The Future We Want, reaffi rming all that is to be done in the years to come. The same was said at the 1992 Earth Summit as well. The only thing added in 2012 was the concept of the 'Green Economy' to reduce the impact of the Brown Economy model of growth the world over. The Green Economy model is portrayed as an opportunity to enhance ecosystem services, and enable growth and sustainable livelihoods for the poor. But this well-intended vision is without a design to enable green investments to reduce carbon intensities and a framework for creating global Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) market opportunities without jeopardising the basic right to livelihood. The 2012 report reveals a total disjoint between a vision and the operational feasibility of a Green Economy.",Not About Sufficiency
"Water quality, biological quality, and human well-being: Water salinity and scarcity in the Draa River basin, Morocco","River ecosystems are being threatened by rising temperatures, aridity, and salinity due to climate change and increased water abstractions. These threats also put human well-being at risk, as people and rivers are closely connected, particularly in water-scarce regions. We aimed to investigate the relationship between human well-being and biological and physico-chemical river water quality using the arid Draa River basin as a case study. Physico-chemical water measurements, biological monitoring of aquatic macroinvertebrates, and household surveys were used to assess the state of the river water, ecosystem, and human well-being, as well as the as-sociations between them. Salinity levels exceeded maximum permissible values for drinking water in 35 % and irrigation water in 12 % of the sites. Salinity and low flow were associated with low biological quality. Human satisfaction with water quantity and quality, agriculture, the natural environment, and overall life satisfaction were low particularly in the Middle Draa, where 89% of respondents reported emotional distress due to water salinity and scarcity. Drinking and irrigation water quality was generally rated lower in areas characterized by higher levels of water salinity and scarcity. The study found positive associations between the river water quality and biological quality indices, but no significant association between these factors and human satisfaction. These findings suggest that the relationship between human satisfaction and the biological and physicochemical river water quality is complex and that a more comprehensive approach to human well-being is likely needed to establish relationships.",Not About Sufficiency
Replacing coniferous monocultures with mixed-species production stands: An assessment of the potential benefits for forest biodiversity in northern Europe,"Conifer dominated plantations in central and northern Europe are associated with relatively low ecological values, and in some cases, may be vulnerable to disturbances caused by anthropogenic climate change. This has prompted the consideration of alternative tree species compositions for use in production forestry in this region. Here we evaluate the likely biodiversity costs and benefits of supplanting Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures with polycultures of spruce and birch (Betula spp.) in southern Sweden. This polyculture alternative has previously been evaluated in terms of economic, recreational, and silvicultural benefits. By also assessing the ecological implications we fill a gap in our understanding of the range of socio-ecological benefits that can be achieved from a single polyculture alternative. We project likely broad scale changes to species richness and abundance within production stands for five taxonomic groups including ground vegetation, tree-living bryophytes, lichens, saproxylic beetles, and birds. Our research leads us to three key findings. First, the replacement of spruce monocultures with spruce-birch polycultures in the managed forest landscapes of southern Sweden can be expected to result in an increase in biological diversity for most but not all taxa assessed, but it is unlikely to improve conditions for many red-listed forest species. Second, modification of other aspects of forest management (i.e. rotation length, dead wood and green tree retention, thinning regimes) is likely to contribute to further biodiversity gains using spruce-birch polycultures than spruce monocultures. Third, the paucity of empirical research which directly compares the biodiversity of different types of managed production stands, limits the extent to which policy relevant conclusions can be extracted from the scientific literature. We discuss the wider implications of our findings, which indicate that some climate change adaptation strategies, such as risk-spreading, can be readily integrated with the economic, environmental and social goals of multi-use forestry. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem-Based Strategies for Community Resilience to Climate Variability in Indonesia,"Rural communities have long been using ecosystems to sustain their livelihoods, especially in times of disasters when forests act as safety nets and natural buffers. However, it is less clear how climate variability influences changes in land uses, and their implications for human well-being. We examined how forests and trees can reduce human vulnerability by affecting the three components of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. A total of 24 focus group discussions and 256 household surveys were conducted in two smallholder-dominated rural landscapes in Indonesia, which were affected by floods, drought and disease outbreaks. Our results suggest that forests and trees are important in supporting community resilience and decreasing their vulnerabilities to climate-related stresses in different ways. The role of trees varied according to the type of ecosystem service, whether provisioning or regulating, in relation to the phase of the climatic hazard, either in the pre-disaster phase or in the post-disaster recovery phase. It is therefore important to distinguish between these elements when analyzing people's responses to climatic variability in order to fully capture the contribution of forests and trees to reducing people's vulnerability. Landscape spatial characteristics, environmental degradation and community awareness of climate variability are crucial because if their linkages are recognized, local people can actively manage natural resources to increase their resilience. Interventions related to forests and trees should take into consideration these aspects to make ecosystem services a valuable option for an integrated strategy to reduce disaster risks and climate-related vulnerabilities.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil health - a perspective,"Governments and organizations are expressing growing concerns about soil health, driven largely by uncertainties of food security with an increasing human population and unpredictable effects of climate change. Although considerable literature and debate exist, there is discord around the question, what is a healthy soil? This is not surprising, given the complex roles the soil provides, from the range of food, fiber and medical products, hosting a biodiverse community, and supporting the water and nutrient cycles. While a consensus seems to suggest that a soil in good health should be able to provide goods and services in perpetuity, this does not define soil health, rather its provisioning functions. To explore the question, 'what is healthy?', we propose an analogy comparing indicators of human and soil health. For example, to identify the cause of a symptom, we compare the diagnostic pH in both humans and soil, demonstrating the similarities between the way human and soil health concerns are addressed. Additionally, we consider the context that necessitates health and use a set of holistic predictors to link human and soil health further. In humans, genetics express many traits and can predispose one to certain illnesses or diseases, in the same way, parent material, soil texture, and length of time exposed to weathering can inform a soil's capability and predisposition for certain habitats or uses. In both cases, science informs the state of health and appropriate management solutions. We posit the null hypothesis ""the concept of human health cannot be applied to soil"".",Not About Sufficiency
Does the world need a global project on artificial photosynthesis?,"This paper introduces a theme issue of Interface Focus derived from papers presented at the Royal Society supported meeting ‘Do we need a global project on artificial photosynthesis?’ held at Chicheley Hall in July 2014. At that meeting, leaders of national solar fuels and chemicals projects and research presented ‘state of the art’ on artificial photosynthesis (AP) in the context of the policy challenges for globalizing a practical technology to address climate change and energy and food security concerns. The discussions included contributions from many experts with legal and policy skills and uniquely focused on producing principles for prioritizing and specializing work while enhancing the funding and attendant public policy profile. To this end, representatives of major public, philanthropic and private potential stakeholders in such a project (such as the Wellcome Trust, the Moore Foundation, Shell, the Leighty Foundation, the EPSRC and Deutsche Alternative Asset Management) were invited to provide feedback at various points in the meeting. For this Interface Focus issue, speakers at the Chicheley Hall meeting were required to present a snapshot of their cutting edge research related to AP and then draw upon the Chicheley Hall discussions to innovatively analyse how their research could best be advanced by a global AP project. Such multidisciplinary policy analysis was not a skill many of these researchers were experienced or trained in. Nonetheless their efforts here represent one of the first published collections to attempt such a significant task. This introduction contains a brief summary of those papers, focusing particularly on their policy aspects. It then summarizes the core discussions that took place at the Chicheley Hall meeting and sets out some of the central ethical principles that were considered during those discussions. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

"Climate Change and the Dung Beetle: Evaluation of Global Warming Impact on the Distribution of Phyllognathus excavatus (Forster, 1771) through the Mediterranean Region","Featured Application: The featured application of this paper focuses on the impact of climate change on ecosystem services provided by the Phyllognathus excavatus beetle, specifically its role in recycling organic matter. The study highlights that dung beetles, including Phyllognathus excavatus, play a crucial ecological role in nutrient cycling, waste decomposition, and soil improvement. These beetles facilitate the breakdown of organic matter, such as dung, and contribute to the recycling of nutrients back into the ecosystem. However, climate change can disrupt the life cycles and habitat suitability of these beetles, affecting their ability to perform their recycling function effectively. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can alter the availability of fresh dung, which is essential for successful reproduction and larval development. Shifts in rainfall patterns and increased temperatures can also impact the timing of dung decomposition and alter the composition of microbial communities associated with dung, indirectly affecting the survival and fitness of dung beetles. Determining the resilience of ecosystem services, such as recycling, and creating effective conservation strategies to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on these significant ecological processes depend on our ability to understand the potential effects of climate change on Phyllognathus excavatus and other dung beetles.Climate change poses a significant threat to ecosystems, food security, and human well-being. This study focuses on the Phyllognathus excavatus beetle, an important insect species in the Mediterranean region with ecological importance in nature recycling of organic wastes. The aim of this study is to assess its current habitat suitability and predict its distribution under future climate scenarios. The beetle's occurrence records were gathered and climate information, including 19 bioclimatic variables, was retrieved from the Global Biodiversity Informatic Facility (GBIF) and WorldClim depository, respectively. The MaxEnt algorithm was used to calculate habitat appropriateness using geographic information systems (GISs) and species distribution modeling (SDM) with an accuracy of 0.907 using the AUC test. The findings show that the annual mean temperature is the most important factor, with the beetle flourishing in temperatures between 13.9 and 19.1 C-degrees. The distribution is greatly impacted by the mean temperature of the warmest quarter. Future projections using different climate scenarios suggest potential changes in the beetle's distribution. By integrating climate data and occurrence records, this study provides insights into the vulnerability of Phyllognathus excavatus to climate change and identifies regions where its habitat may be at risk as 81% of its current habitat will be lost. The research helps to prioritize efforts to reduce the harmful effects of climate change on insect biodiversity and to design effective conservation strategies. Overall, this study advances our knowledge of the Phyllognathus excavatus beetle's present and projected distribution patterns in the Mediterranean region under the influence of climate change. It illustrates the significance of taking into account how climate change would affect insect populations and the use of SDM and GIS tools for researching and protecting insect biodiversity.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrated spatial planning for biodiversity conservation and food production,"Ambitious area-based conservation targets are at the forefront of the post-2020 biodiversity conservation agenda. However, implementing such targets cannot be done without accounting for the increasing demand for farmland products, the main driver of biodiversity loss worldwide. Here, we analyze the expected conservation gains and farming opportunity costs of three alternative global conservation strategies under business-as-usual demand in farmland products by 2030. We find that integrated spatial planning can reach the same species conservation objectives at 25%–40% of the opportunity cost for food production, or 400%–600% the biodiversity benefit for similar opportunity costs as opposed to planning for each objective separately. This requires managing over 60% of land in ways that are compatible with biodiversity conservation, which includes restoring 8%–11% of land surface. Achieving global conservation targets can be compatible with protecting biodiversity and ensuring food security but only with efforts to negotiate land governance strategies across multiple stakeholders and their objectives. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Investigation on Recognition of the Type of Multifunctional Landscape in Persian Garden (Case Study: Akbariyeh World Heritage Garden) (Case Study: Akbariyeh World Heritage Garden),"Multifunctionality is a strategy for developing healthy, biodiversity-friendly, and sustainable productive urban and rural landscapes that have recently attracted the attention of researchers. Multifunctional landscapes simultaneously provide food security, livelihood opportunities, maintain of species and ecological functions, and fulfill cultural, aesthetic recreational needs. The traditional gardens and landscapes usually recognized as multifunctional open spaces. While in Iran, the Persian garden encompassed a wide variety of functions including recreational, productive, habitat, and cultural services, the landscape multifunctionality of the historical gardens has not yet been investigated. In response to this gap, the authors selected the Akbariyeh World Heritage Garden, one of the most significant Persian gardens in the East of Iran, to investigate the features of the multifunctional landscape in this garden. Accordingly; the main question of the research is whether Akbariyeh garden, as a prototype of the traditional historical garden, encompasses a multifunctional landscape? What are the characteristics of the multifunctional landscape in Akbariyeh garden and in which category of multifunctionality is it classified? The research was benefited from the field studies, historical documents, and interviews with experts, as well as holding a discussion group in February 2020. The researchers used the data from the field studies, historical documents, and interviews with experts, as well as holding a discussion group in February 2020.

Furthermore, among three main models of landscape multifunctionality (mosaic, weighted, and radical), Akbariyeh garden embraced the weighted multifunctional landscape model (integration several homogeneous functions in the spatial unit).",Not About Sufficiency
Conservation agriculture effects on ecosystem health and sustainability – A review of rice–wheat cropping system,"Conventional tillage, extreme climate events, increasing weed incidence, pest and disease pressures, and diminished farm input availability negatively impact crop yield, stability, profitability, and water productivity in South Asia's rice-wheat (R-W) systems. This article reviews and evaluates the effectiveness and benefits of conservation agriculture (CA) practices in improving soil health, water productivity, and sustainability in R-W systems. CA practices focus on minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover, and crop rotations. Techniques such as direct seeding in rice and zero tillage in wheat are employed, supported by advancements in zero tillage sowing machinery like super-seeders. CA practices contribute significantly to ecosystem health by conserving soil and water, enhancing soil quality, reducing erosion, and improving nutrient use efficiency. They also lower production costs, increase water use efficiency, stabilize yields, promote crop diversification, and mitigate climate change effects through carbon sequestration and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. However, initial challenges include increased weed pressure and the need for suitable rice varieties for direct seeding. In conclusion, CA practices support sustainable and climate-resilient farming, improving land and water productivity, food security, and on-farm profits. Despite the benefits and growing government support, widespread adoption in South Asia remains limited. Effective support systems, including incentives, technical knowledge dissemination, and integrated weed management, are crucial for overcoming barriers and enhancing CA adoption in R-W systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Diversifying food and diets: Using agricultural biodiversity to improve nutrition and health,"Currently 868 million people are undernourished and 195 million children under five years of age are stunted. At the same time, over 1 billion people are overweight and obese in both the developed and developing world. Diseases previously associated with affluence, such as cancer, diabetes and cardio-vascular disease, are on the rise. Food system-based approaches to addressing these problems that could enhance food availability and diet quality through local production and agricultural biodiversity often fall outside the traditional scope of nutrition, and have been under-researched. As a consequence, there remains insufficient evidence to support well-defined, scalable agricultural biodiversity interventions that can be linked to improvements in nutrition outcomes.; Agricultural biodiversity is important for food and nutritional security, as a safeguard against hunger, a source of nutrients for improved dietary diversity and quality, and strengthening local food systems and environmental sustainability. This book explores the current state of knowledge on the role of agricultural biodiversity in improving diets, nutrition and food security. Using examples and case studies from around the globe, the book explores current strategies for improving nutrition and diets and identifies key research and implementation gaps that need to be addressed to successfully promote the better use of agricultural biodiversity for rural and urban populations and societies in transition. © 2013 Bioversity International.

Enhanced soil water recovery and crop yield following conversion of 9-year-old leguminous pastures into croplands,"Pasture-crop rotation has been considered as an efficient agronomical practice to improve soil and water con-servation, develop livestock production, and promote food security. However, the characteristics of soil water restoration and performances of crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE) after conversion of long-term legu-minous pasture into croplands still remain unclear. A field experiment was conducted in China's Loess Plateau to investigate soil water restoration and wheat yields in crop rotation with Italian ryegrass (Festuca perennis Lam.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) converted from three 9-year-old leguminous pastures, viz. milk vetch (Astragalus adsurgens Pall.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and bush clover (Lespedeza davurica S.), and unplanted control (fallow). Soil water in the alfalfa treatment gradually recovered from up to down compared to the fallow treatment (control) during cultivation phase. After one year of rotation, the recovery levels of soil water in the three pasture-crop rotation systems at 0-500 cm soil depth were 97.1%, 95.5% and 94.2%, respectively, compared to the fallow treatment. The legume treatments significantly enhanced the crop yield (35.6%-64.5%), aboveground biomass (28.7%-59.4%) and WUE (60%-68.3%) of winter wheat compared with fallow. These results imply that the concerns about soil desiccation from long-term alfalfa was resolvable after long-term alfalfa converted into cropland in the rainfed farming area of Loess Plateau. The results also suggest that legume pasture-crop rotation can facilitate achieving a sustainable development of rainfed farming.",Not About Sufficiency
Struggles for just conservation: an analysis of India's biodiversity conservation conflicts,"The protection of the Earth's remaining biodiversity continues to be a debate of global importance as well as a source of contestation. In this context, the Indian government started with its post-colonial forest conservation from the 1970s, by ushering in the Wildlife Protection Act in 1972. It has since reinforced its conservation policies, over the last 15 years giving particular focus to the protection of tigers, considered a keystone and endangered species. In 2004, a Tiger Task Force was set up to protect the tiger, followed by the establishment of protected habitats for tiger conservation, which in turn reinforced the idea of a human-wildlife binary and legitimized the control of these spaces through armed policing. These changes in environmental governance have altered the relationship between local communities and forest guards, in many cases aggravating already conflictual interactions. This article discusses the political ecology of emerging conflicts around protected areas (national parks, tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuaries) in India through an analysis of 26 conflicts documented in the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas), and informed by field research conducted within and around protected areas of India. Specifically, the article analyzes the interplay between conservation policies and the rights of the commons recognized under the Forest Rights Act, 2006, as well as the socio-economic impacts of conservation policies in terms of dispossession, violence and the increase of ""green militarization."" The article also highlights the social resistance movements developed against these trends, which are framed as part of the growing environmental justice movement. The article concludes with how this struggle may be essential to achieving an ecologically sustainable society in the future and to shape a new conservation model. © 2022, Journal of Political Ecology.

"Reconciling Spatial Conservation of Multiple Hydrological Ecosystem Services across Teshio Watershed, Northern Japan","Ecosystem services (ESs) including provisioning, regulating, and cultural services for sustaining and fulfilling human well-being are formed based on various conditions, processes, and components of natural and artificial ecosystems. Spatial conservation planning for sustainable ecosystem development requires precise information on the local potential for providing hydrological ecosystem services in a watershed. The principal challenges in spatially conserving multiple ESs are that they are not independent of each other, and that the interactive relationships between them are in the forms of trade-offs and synergies. The rationality of spatial priority conservation on reconciling multiple ESs will be enhanced if the interactive relationships are recognized at the planning stage. Such a framework is developed by integrating a hydrology model into a systematic conservation model, and it is illustrated with data about multiple hydrological ESs in the Teshio watershed, with the aim of developing a priority conservation ranking map that reconciles competing and compromising interactive relationships among multiple services. The water yield, sediment, and organic nutrient retentions concentrated in eastern and some northern areas with higher precipitation, more forest lands, and steeper slope, but the inorganic nutrient retention concentrated in riverine and southwestern places with agricultural lands. The spatial priority conservation ranking map of an individual ES is closely related to its spatially distributed pattern. The spatial priority conservation areas for sediment and organic nutrient retentions are traded off against those for inorganic nutrient retention. There are obvious differences between the spatial priority conservation ranking maps of individual ESs and those of multiple services together. The spatial priority conservation areas for multiple ESs together simultaneously include southwestern, riverine, eastern, and some northern places of the study watershed, which can balance the conflicts existing between sediment and organic nutrient retentions and inorganic nutrient retention. The systematic priority conservation areas of hydrological ESs provide an effective tool for identifying trade-offs between environmental protection and agricultural economic development. The proposed framework in this study can be applicable to similarly structural prioritization problems of other watersheds, which can sustain ecosystem conservation and economic development.

"Environmental Impacts of Natural Resources, Renewable Energy, Technological Innovation, and Globalization: Evidence from the Organization of Turkic States","Environmental challenges have intensified as a result of global warming and climate change, creating significant threats to environmental quality. The member nations of the Organization of Turkic States (OTS) are especially impacted by these issues, primarily because of their reliance on fossil fuels, leading to elevated carbon emissions. This study examines the influence of natural resources, renewable energy, technological innovation, and globalization on environmental degradation in five OTS member countries—Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Türkiye, and Uzbekistan—covering the years 1996 to 2020. The ecological footprint and CO2 emissions are employed as the main indicators of environmental harm. Through the application of the Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR), the findings reveal that natural resources significantly contribute to CO2 emissions in the lower quantiles but show a lesser impact on the ecological footprint. Conversely, renewable energy consistently improves environmental quality across all quantiles, whereas technological innovation and globalization are both associated with increased environmental degradation. Additionally, the causality test reveals a bidirectional causality between renewable energy consumption and both CO2 emissions and the ecological footprint (EF), as well as between technological innovation and EF. Moreover, a unidirectional causal relationship is observed from globalization to EF. Based on the findings, policy recommendations for OTS member states include promoting the adoption of renewable energy, fostering green technological innovations, and addressing the negative environmental effects of globalization. Such measures are vital for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and ensuring long-term environmental sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Food Plant Biodiversity and Conservation of Upland Landscape in Indonesia for Sustainable Development: A Review,"The agricultural practice in upland landscape area throughout Indonesia provide examples of complex socio-ecological systems experiencing rapid socio-economic and environmental transformations in response to sustainable development challenges. There is a close relationship between agriculture productivity, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable landscape management. This paper examines the biodiversity and conservation of food plants for food security toward sustainable development in the uplands of Indonesia. A desk study with descriptive qualitative was implemented in this paper. The data were collected from secondary sources and thus analyzed through understanding and synthesizing the literature. We review the studies between 2007-2022, agriculture commodities were the dominant food plants found in the farmland and home garden in Sumatra, Java, Sumbawa, and Papua, for subsistence and commercial purpose, especially for horticulture commodities. The results showed that there is a challenge today in how to push agricultural systems so as to promote an agroecosystem, and it is clear that sustainable agriculture both promotes and is enhanced by food plant biodiversity. In order to reduce environmental trade-offs and social and institutional tensions, economic expansion and conservation agendas in the upland should be matched. It is expected that protecting food plants in upland areas will promote sustainable growth and ensure community food security.

The study aims to understand how these variables interact and influence each other, particularly focusing on the impact of NRR and REC on CO2 emissions within the context of Pakistan's economic growth and energy consumption patterns. Given the country's rapid economic growth and increasing energy demands, there is an imperative need to investigate how these factors influence environmental quality, particularly CO2 emissions employing the autoregressive distributed lag approach with structural breaks, we analyze the long-term interactions and causality among NRR, REC, energy use (EU), gross domestic product (GDP), and CO2 emissions. Our findings demonstrate that while NRR and REC negatively correlate with CO2 emissions, a positive association exists between EU, GDP growth, and emissions. These results underscore the potential of strategic environmental policies, aligned with Sustainable Development Goals 7, 13, and 8, to foster sustainable development pathways in Pakistan.

Identifying ecological production functions for use in ecosystem services-based environmental risk assessment of chemicals,"There is increasing research interest in the application of the ecosystem services (ES) concept in the environmental risk assessment of chemicals to support formulating and operationalising regulatory environmental protection goals and making environmental risk assessment more policy-and value-relevant. This requires connecting ecosystem structure and processes to ecosystem function and henceforth to provision of ecosystem goods and services and their economic valuation. Ecological production functions (EPFs) may help to quantify these connections in a transparent manner and to predict ES provision based on function-related descriptors for service providing species, communities, ecosystems or habitats. We review scientific literature for EPFs to evaluate availability across provisioning and regulation and maintenance services (CICES v5.1 classification). We found quantitative production functions for nearly all ES, often complemented with economic valuation of physical or monetary flows. We studied the service providing units in these EPFs to evaluate the potential for extrapolation of toxicity data for test species obtained from standardised testing to ES provision. A broad taxonomic representation of service providers was established, but quantitative models directly linking standard test species to ES provision were extremely scarce. A pragmatic way to deal with this data gap would be the use of proxies for related taxa and stepwise functional extrapolation to ES provision and valuation, which we conclude possible for most ES. We suggest that EPFs may be used in defining specific protection goals (SPGs), and illustrate, using pollination as an example, the availability of information for the ecological entity and attribute dimensions of SPGs. Twenty-five pollination EPFs were compiled from the literature for biological entities ranging from 'colony' to 'habitat', with 75% referring to 'functional group'. With about equal representation of the attributes 'function', 'abundance' and 'diversity', SPGs for pollination therefore would seem best substantiated by EPFs at the level of functional group.

Remotely sensed tree canopy cover-based indicators for monitoring global sustainability and environmental initiatives,"With the intensifying challenges of global environmental change, sustainability, and biodiversity conservation, the monitoring of the world's remaining forests has become more important than ever. Today, Earth observation technologies, particularly remote sensing, are at the forefront of forest cover monitoring worldwide. Given the current conceptual understanding of what a forest is, canopy cover threshold values are used to map forest cover from remote sensing imagery and produce categorical data products such as forest/non-forest (F/NF) maps. However, multi-temporal categorical map products have important limitations because they inadequately represent the actual status of forest landscapes and the trajectories of forest cover changes as a result of the thresholding effect. Here, we examined the potential of using remotely sensed tree canopy cover (TCC) datasets, which are continuous data products, to complement F/NF maps for forest cover monitoring. We developed a conceptual analytical framework for forest cover monitoring using both types of data products and applied it to the forests of Southeast Asia. We conclude that TCC datasets and the statistics derived from them can be used to complement the information provided by categorical F/NF maps. TCC-based indicators (i.e. losses, gains, and net changes) can help in monitoring not only deforestation but also forest degradation and forest cover enhancement, all of which are highly relevant to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other global forest cover monitoring-related initiatives. We recommend that future research should focus on the production, application, and evaluation of TCC datasets to advance the current understanding of how accurately these products can capture changes in forest landscapes across space and time. © 2021 The Author(s).

Transcriptome profiling of barley in response to mineral and organic fertilizers,"BackgroundNitrogen is very important for crop yield and quality. Crop producers face the challenge of reducing the use of mineral nitrogen while maintaining food security and other ecosystem services. The first step towards understanding the metabolic responses that could be used to improve nitrogen use efficiency is to identify the genes that are up- or downregulated under treatment with different forms and rates of nitrogen. We conducted a transcriptome analysis of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Anni grown in a field experiment in 2019. The objective was to compare the effects of organic (cattle manure) and mineral nitrogen (NH4NO3; 0, 40, 80 kg N ha(-1)) fertilizers on gene activity at anthesis (BBCH60) and to associate the genes that were differentially expressed between treatment groups with metabolic pathways and biological functions.ResultsThe highest number of differentially expressed genes (8071) was found for the treatment with the highest mineral nitrogen rate. This number was 2.6 times higher than that for the group treated with a low nitrogen rate. The lowest number (500) was for the manure treatment group. Upregulated pathways in the mineral fertilizer treatment groups included biosynthesis of amino acids and ribosomal pathways. Downregulated pathways included starch and sucrose metabolism when mineral nitrogen was supplied at lower rates and carotenoid biosynthesis and phosphatidylinositol signaling at higher mineral nitrogen rates. The organic treatment group had the highest number of downregulated genes, with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis being the most significantly enriched pathway for these genes. Genes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism and plant-pathogen interaction pathways were enriched in the organic treatment group compared with the control treatment group receiving no nitrogen input.ConclusionThese findings indicate stronger responses of genes to mineral fertilizers, probably because the slow and gradual decomposition of organic fertilizers means that less nitrogen is provided. These data contribute to our understanding of the genetic regulation of barley growth under field conditions. Identification of pathways affected by different nitrogen rates and forms under field conditions could help in the development of more sustainable cropping practices and guide breeders to create varieties with low nitrogen input requirements.",Not About Sufficiency

The actual active patient scan energy that produces the images is only about 1.6% of this total life cycle energy. This large multiplier to get total CT energy is a previously undocumented environmental response to the direct radiology order for a patient CT scan. The CT in-hospital energy related to idle periods, where the machine is on but no patients are being scanned and is 14–30-fold higher than the energy used for the CT image. The in-hospital electrical energy of a CT scan makes up only about 25% of the total energy footprint. The rest is generated outside the hospital: 54–62% for generation and transmission of the electricity, while 13–22% is for all the energy to make the consumables. Different CT scanners have some influences on the results and could help guide purchase of CT equipment. Conclusions: The transparent, detailed life cycle approach allows the data from this study to be used by radiologists to examine details of both direct and of unseen energy impacts of CT scans. The public health (outside-the-hospital) impact (including the patients receiving a CT) needs to be measured and included. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Not About Sufficiency

Large-scale deployment of grass in crop rotations as a multifunctional climate mitigation strategy,"The agriculture sector can contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing its own greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, sequestering carbon in vegetation and soils, and providing biomass to substitute for fossil fuels and other GHG-intensive products. The sector also needs to address water, soil, and biodiversity impacts caused by historic and current practices. Emerging EU policies create incentives for cultivation of perennial plants that provide biomass along with environmental benefits. One such option, common in northern Europe, is to include grass in rotations with annual crops to provide biomass while remediating soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and other environmental impacts. Here, we apply a spatially explicit model on >81,000 sub-watersheds in EU27 + UK (Europe) to explore the effects of widespread deployment of such systems. Based on current accumulated SOC losses in individual sub-watersheds, the model identifies and quantifies suitable areas for increased grass cultivation and corresponding biomass- and protein supply, SOC sequestration, and reductions in nitrogen emissions to water as well as wind and water erosion. The model also provides information about possible flood mitigation. The results indicate a substantial climate mitigation potential, with combined annual GHG savings from soil-carbon sequestration and displacement of natural gas with biogas from grass-based biorefineries, equivalent to 13%–48% of current GHG emissions from agriculture in Europe. The environmental co-benefits are also notable, in some cases exceeding the estimated mitigation needs. Yield increases for annual crops in modified rotations mitigate the displacement effect of increasing grass cultivation. If the grass is used as feedstock in lieu of annual crops, the displacement effect can even be negative, that is, a reduced need for annual crop production elsewhere. Incentivizing widespread deployment will require supportive policy measures as well as new uses of grass biomass, for example, as feedstock for green biorefineries producing protein concentrate, biofuels, and other bio-based products. © 2022 The Authors.

Environmental Sustainability in Orthopaedic Surgery,"Climate change has been increasingly recognized in the healthcare sector over recent years, with global implications in infrastructure, economics, and public health. As a result, a growing field of study examines the role of healthcare in contributing to environmental sustainability. These analyses commonly focus on the environmental impact of the operating room, due to extensive energy and resource utilization in surgery. While much of this literature has arisen from other surgical specialties, several environmental sustainability studies have begun appearing in the field of orthopaedic surgery, consisting mostly of waste audits and, less frequently, more comprehensive environmental life cycle assessments. The present study aims to review this limited evidence. The results suggest that methods to reduce the environmental impact of the operating room include proper selection of anesthetic techniques that have a smaller carbon footprint, minimization of single use instruments, use of minimalist custom-design surgical packs, proper separation of waste, and continuation or implementation of recycling protocols. Future directions of research include higher-level studies, such as comprehensive life cycle assessments, to identify more opportunities to decrease the environmental impact of orthopaedic surgery.

"“Coal is in our food, coal is in our blood”: everyday environmental injustices of rural community gardening in Central Appalachia","Central Appalachia's historical dependence on natural resource extraction industries has contributed to a long history of under- and uneven development, including trends of persistent poverty, cycles of unemployment, weakened local governance, environmental degradation, and severe social inequalities relative to the rest of the nation. Though these trends have been well documented at structural and community-levels, scholarship is more limited in assessing how the conditions of natural resource dependency may shape the everyday experiences of those who live in such regions and how those everyday experiences may illuminate challenges for future development. Employing an embedded case study design, this study examines how everyday environmental injustices may be experienced via community gardening activities, a sustainable development-oriented activity celebrated in urban locations but largely unexplored in rural environments. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with 43 gardening programme coordinators and participants, the findings demonstrate that everyday environmental injustices are experienced across four distinct, yet overlapping and mutually reinforcing, dimensions: natural, built, human health, and socioeconomic environments. These factors in turn constrain programme participation and beneficial programme outcomes, particularly for more disadvantaged households that are affected by chronic illness, geographic isolation, and environmental hazards. Although the interviewees viewed many of these challenges as further justification for pursuing grassroots initiatives like community gardening programmes, these constraints also interacted in a way that limited the success of these locally-oriented sustainable development efforts, particularly for individuals who are the most socially, economically, and environmentally marginalised. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
"Nanotechnological approaches for enhanced microbial activities, sustainable agriculture, and the environment","The quest to enhance food security for all continuously drives the need for the massive use of agrochemicals, which has resulted in a severe influence on biodiversity, human health and several environmental challenges. However, to overcome the aforementioned challenges and many more, nanotechnology has come in handy to ensure sustainable agriculture. Nanotechnology produces nanomaterials that are natural polymers ranging in size between 10 and 100 nm with a high surface area-tovolume ratio and a wide range of applications. They are considered environmentally friendly, with lots of prospects, particularly in the area of green nanotechnology. The types of nanoparticles discussed include lipid, polymeric, ceramic, semiconductor, and metal nanoparticles. Nanotechnology has found applications in the detection and remediation of environmental pollutants, water and soil remediation, energy generation, crop improvement, and plant pathology. The use of nanotechnology products like biofertilizers, bioherbicides, and biopesticides serves as suitable replacement for agrochemicals. Nanomaterials help to regulate nutrient uptake, ensure the quality of water and pesticides, enhance disease resistance, and facilitate bioremediation by enhancing microbes responsible for heavy metal biodegradation. This chapter finally concludes that nanotechnology is useful in improving microbial activities, promoting long-term food security, and protecting the environment by improving soil health, plant growth, and food safety. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

For Tanzania, this integrated assessment showed that a projected increase in the demand and production of foods of livestock origin with optimistic economic growth between 2010 and 2030 leads to an improvement in food security. However, resulting transitions in land use impact negatively on the future provisioning of ecosystem services, increasing phosphorus, nitrogen, and sediment in runoff and reducing water quality in areas downstream of the agricultural expansion. Losses in ecosystem services are lowest when diversified farming practices are adopted in areas of agricultural land expansion.

"Towards the vision of going green: The role of different energy research and development investments, urbanization and income in load capacity factor","Environmental sustainability, one of the agendas of the 21st century, is an essential step in the transition to a low-carbon economy in developing countries. The motivation of this study is to investigate the impact of fossil energy research and development investments on environmental quality within the framework of the load capacity curve hypothesis, and urbanization is also added to the model to avoid omitted variable bias. To this end, the Augmented ARDL analysis examines the relationship between economic growth and ecological well-being in Turkiye from 1986 to 2022. The results from the empirical analysis support the accuracy of the load capacity curve hypothesis. Furthermore, it is observed that renewable energy research and development investments, which are the main component of the study, improve environmental quality. On the other hand, it has been found that research and development investments in fossil fuels and urbanization reduce the load capacity factor. Based on the study's findings, the Turkish government should allocate more research and development budget to transition to a low-carbon economy. Considering Turkiye's intense fossil resource consumption, the government should plan research and development budget arrangements supported by law regarding energy efficiency. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Actinobacteria-Enhanced Straw Recycling for Crop Yield, Soil Fertility, and Aquatic Ecosystem Protection","The burning of paddy straw is linked to significant resource waste, environmental pollution, and adverse health effects. Additionally, the release of toxic pollutants from straw burning contaminates aquatic ecosystems, disrupting water quality and biodiversity. This study explored eco-friendly alternatives to straw burning depending on the lignocellulolytic activity of actinobacterial strains. It was hypothesized that specific actinobacterial isolates could effectively degrade lignocellulosic materials, thereby enhancing soil fertility. Semi-solid fermentation was conducted with the promising candidate, Streptomyces coelicolor strain W21.24, followed by a greenhouse experiment comparing soil properties in control pots versus those treated with residual straw from the fermentation process. Significant improvements in soil properties were observed for the treated group, including pH increase from 5.1 to 5.7 (P< 0.001), phosphorus from 0.681% to 0.729% (P= 0.021), potassium from 0.438% to 0.8% (P< 0.001), nitrogen from 3.58% to 0.4% (P= 0.005), and carbon content from 41.63% to 44.22% (P< 0.001), indicating enhanced soil quality. Additionally, the growth of Vigna unguiculata L. Walp was significantly improved, with average shoot heights of 114.15cm in the treated group versus 84.15cm in the control (P= 0.044). The fruit count showed a 55.7% increase (P= 0.002), while the flower count increased by 47.3% (P= 0.041). These results demonstrated positive effects on the above-ground growth. These findings show the benefits of returning organic matter to the soil and introduce an innovative method for utilizing actinobacteria in sustainable agriculture. © 2024, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

The Relationship between Entrepreneurship and Sustainable Development in Saudi Arabia: A Comprehensive Perspective,"This study examines the relationship between entrepreneurship and sustainable development in Saudi Arabia from 2006 to 2022, focusing on the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, the research investigates both short-run and long-run dynamics to understand how entrepreneurial activities influence sustainable development within the framework of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 initiative. The findings indicate that entrepreneurship significantly contributes to economic growth through job creation and innovation, thereby aiding in the diversification of the economy away from oil dependency. Socially, entrepreneurial initiatives have a positive impact on gender equality and social inclusion by empowering women and integrating youth into the labor market. Environmentally, entrepreneurship helps reduce carbon emissions and promotes sustainable business practices. Despite these positive outcomes, challenges such as regulatory barriers, limited access to finance, and the need for a supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem remain. Recommendations include enhancing entrepreneurial education, providing financial incentives, and streamlining regulatory processes to better support start-ups and SMEs. This study highlights the necessity of addressing these challenges to fully realize the potential of entrepreneurship for sustainable development in Saudi Arabia. By providing empirical evidence on the significant role of entrepreneurship in driving sustainable development, this research offers actionable insights for policymakers aiming to foster a more resilient and diversified economy in line with Vision 2030. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

A bottom-up approach to map land covers as potential green infrastructure hubs for human well-being in rural settings: A case study from Sweden,"Green infrastructure (GI) policy encourages the spatial planning of natural and semi-natural areas to deliver biodiversity conservation and a wide range of ecosystem services (ES) important to human well-being. Much of the current literature relies on expert-led and top-down processes to investigate connections between landscapes' different land covers and ES. Little is known regarding the preferences of residents, and how they connect land covers with the delivery of ES important for their well-being. The aim of this study is to identify and locate such land cover types as GI that provide multiple ES important for human well-being in rural settings. First, we interviewed 400 urban and rural residents to identify ES important for personal well-being and the land covers that deliver multiple ES in three counties that best represent the existing rural-urban gradient in Sweden. Second, to support the inclusion of GI in spatial planning, we identified and located spatial concentrations of individual land covers providing multiple ES (GI hubs) and significant clusters of such land covers (GI hotspots). The majority of urban and rural respondents associated their well-being with lakes, mountains above the tree line, old-growth forests, wooded-pastures, mature pine forests and rural farmsteads. The areal proportion of each type of hub was low, on average 3.5%. At least three land management strategies are needed to sustain GI hubs: maintenance of the composition, structure and function of natural ecosystems in protected areas; support for traditional agroforestry and villages as social-ecological systems; and diversification of the current intensive forest management approach.",Not About Sufficiency

The Role of the Energy Use in Buildings in Front of Climate Change: Reviewing a System's Challenging Future,"Energy keeps the global economy alive, while also being extensively exposed to various climate change impacts. In this context, severe business competition (e.g., the building sector) and the unwise use of natural resources and ecosystem services (e.g., fossil fuel energy sources) seem to sharpen the relevant effects of climate change. Indicatively, contemporary issues at the interface of building energy performance and environmental quality levels include consequences from global warming, the increasing release of carbon dioxide to peak electrical loads, power grids, and building planning, and energy demand and supply issues. In light of such concerns, the present review paper attempts to disclose the multifaceted and multidisciplinary character of building energy use at the interface of the economy, the environment, and society against climate change. This review highlights energy efficiency concepts, production, distribution, consumption patterns, and relevant technological improvements. Interestingly, the reviewed contributions in the relevant literature reveal the need and necessity to alter the energy mix and relevant energy use issues. These include developments in climate-proof and effective systems regarding climate change impacts and shocks. Practical implications indicate that the sustainable development goals for clean energy and climate action should be followed if we wish to bring a sustainable future closer and faster to our reality.",Not About Sufficiency
Phytoremediation and phytostabilization: The current scenario and future prospects,"The upsurge of living standards and life expectancy has given rise to a multitude of industries that alter the soil, water, and air by adding hazardous materials in a direct or indirect manner. Most of these chemicals are resistant to natural degradation processes, allowing them to persist in the environment for decades, disrupting natural biogeochemical cycles and threatening human health. Therefore, waste management containing various hazardous chemicals must remain a top priority. Physicochemical treatment methods such as activated carbon, membrane filtration, photochemical and electrochemical destruction, irradiation, and ion exchange are expensive, produce secondary pollution, and have limited applicability. As a result, the development of cost-effective, efficient, and environmentally friendly remediation technologies is critical. Phytoremediation, the use of plants and/or their associated microflora for the treatment of contaminants, is a growing concern to remove pollutants or reduce their bioavailability in the environment. It is an aesthetically pleasing, low-cost, easily monitored technique that preserves topsoil, reduces erosion, and pollution leaching. Plants and endophytes have the ability to uptake pollutants from contaminated soil or liquid media at low concentrations and then degrade, transform, or immobilize the pollutants through various mechanisms such as phytodegradation, rhyzodegradation, phytostabilization, phytoextraction, and phytovolatilization. Even though phytoremediation has a long history in contaminated sites, the current concern and approach have been to find novel and developed enzyme-based phytoremediation pathways to overcome limitations such as the need for a long incubation time plant necrosis due to toxicity, and so on. Understanding the basic physiological and biochemical processes in plants that underpin different phytoremediation processes is a promising way to improve plants' practical applicability in phytoremediation. As a result, this chapter will focus on phytoremediation of pollutants, specifically its applications, remediation mechanisms, plant associated endophytes, synergistic strategies, enzymes, benefits, limitations, and future directions. © 2023 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Gardener Well-Being along Social and Biophysical Landscape Gradients,"Increasing human populations are challenging cities to grow sustainably while maintaining green spaces that deliver ecosystem services and well-being benefits. Community gardens are green spaces that provide food, community, and health benefits, but gardens often are non-permanent due to development and green space loss. Thus, investigating their significance and benefit across urban regions is critical for research and policy alike. This study investigated the role of community gardens in providing human well-being benefits across three counties in the California Central Coasta region undergoing massive urban transformation in the last century. We measured how multiple aspects of self-reported gardener well-being varied in relation to the social opportunities of surrounding neighborhoods and the biophysical features of the landscapes in which the gardens were embedded. The results document improvements in gardener well-being through gardening across social and biophysical gradients. Gardeners are motivated by diverse reasons, varying from gardening in order to connect to nature, to gardening for improved food access, or to enhance time spent with family. Community gardens are therefore important for supporting many well-being benefits.

Climate change mitigation: Potential benefits and pitfalls of enhanced rock weathering in tropical agriculture,"Restricting future global temperature increase to 2°C or less requires the adoption of negative emissions technologies for carbon capture and storage. We review the potential for deployment of enhanced weathering (EW), via the application of crushed reactive silicate rocks (such as basalt), on over 680 million hectares of tropical agricultural and tree plantations to offset fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Warm tropical climates and productive crops will substantially enhance weathering rates, with potential co-benefits including decreased soil acidification and increased phosphorus supply promoting higher crop yields sparing forest for conservation, and reduced cultural eutrophication. Potential pitfalls include the impacts of mining operations on deforestation, producing the energy to crush and transport silicates and the erosion of silicates into rivers and coral reefs that increases inorganic turbidity, sedimentation and pH, with unknown impacts for biodiversity. We identify nine priority research areas for untapping the potential of EW in the tropics, including effectiveness of tropical agriculture at EW for major crops in relation to particle sizes and soil types, impacts on human health, and effects on farmland, adjacent forest and stream-water biodiversity. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

"Tectona grandis L.f. mediated restoration of marginal lands in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, North India","Tectona grandis L.f. has considerable potential to restore marginal and degraded lands as it offers multiple co-benefits during the restoration venture. It provides good quality wood for multipurpose use, including biomass for bioenergy and noninvasive traits. For this, aboveground biomass (AGB) was assessed along with testing the critical soil properties (soil physicochemical and biological properties) across different plantation sites during a 4-year study period (2015–2018). The study suggested that the soil properties like bulk density, moisture content, pH, organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium have shown significant mean improvement in all planted sites collectively. These were improved by −0.21 g cm−3, 0.68%, −0.68, 0.27%, 13.69 mg kg−1, 11.77 mg kg−1, 95.20 mg kg−1, respectively, in an arid area (Mirzapur, i.e., M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and M6 sites, representing a warm and tropical dry climate) from the unplanted control (CM1) during 2015–2018. Moreover, the microbial biomass carbon and dehydrogenase activity were significantly improved by 56.71 mg kg−1 and 6.92 μg TPF g−1 hr−1, respectively, from CM1. Similar results were also observed in the semiarid areas of Varanasi, representing a humid subtropical climatic pattern (i.e., V4 and V5 sites) compared to the unplanted control in the (CV1). Furthermore, the AGB was found between 12.56 and 229.13 kg tree−1, representing 5 and 30 years of plantation, respectively, in 2018. Reference sites (V1, V2, and V3) were also considered that reflect a planted control, which helped assess the comparison between variable sites and the sites under restoration. Therefore, the study further suggested that this tree species has the tremendous potential to restore marginal and degraded lands in the arid and semiarid areas of North India with a significant biomass supply as an additional benefit. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Bioenergy crop production potential and carbon mitigation from marginal and degraded lands of India,"Bioenergy production from marginal and degraded lands is getting worldwide attention due to its potential for renewable energy, land restoration, soil carbon sequestration and also for meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, majority of the literature reported the bioenergy production prospect based on a single bioenergy crop production system. Therefore, the present article utilizes a multi-criteria analysis to identify India's potential marginal and degraded lands (P-ml) and their suitability for bioenergy crop production based on a polyculture zonation technique (PZT) with the projections for bioenergy and carbon mitigation potentials. Ten multipurpose bioenergy crops have been studied, out of which seven hardwood tree species were further selected based on ecological and climate suitability. Results suggested that India accounted for 45.13 million ha (Mha) of P-ml, and it could produce 96.82 Mt y(-1)& nbsp;of biomass and 6.16 Mt y(-1)& nbsp;of biofuel, considering half utilization of the plantation areas. Such productions represent 2.22 EJ y(-1) (equivalent to 618 TW h y(-1)) of bioenergy potential. Around 64 Mt C y(-1 & nbsp;)can also be sequestered by these plantations and additionally help in meeting carbon sequestration over 2800 MtCO(2) by 2030, corresponding to India's nationally determined contribution.

Need of transdisciplinary research for accelerating land restoration during the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration,"The United Nations has declared 2021–2030 as the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration to gear up the restoration of degraded ecosystems worldwide and thereby facilitating the timely realization of the UN-SDGs and post-2020 biodiversity targets. The UN Decade will also further the targets of the Bonn Challenge and several other ongoing restoration initiatives. While restoration is often viewed as a branch of applied ecology, transdisciplinarity is essential for implementing restoration on the ground successfully. The present article is therefore aimed to propose a transdisciplinary framework consisting of three defined phases -such as (1) the problem identification phase, (2) its analysis, and (3) finally the integration and application of transdisciplinary approaches for effective land restoration. This integrated framework would help in drawing strategic measures by crossing various disciplinary boundaries to accelerate land restoration efforts globally while deriving co-benefits during restoration for maintaining the continuity of the restoration drive. We conclude that the implementation of the proposed framework along with due consideration of the regional and location-specific attributes, management strategies as well as the successful involvement of various stakeholders will lead to a successful restoration Decade. © 2021 Society for Ecological Restoration.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability Analysis of Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC Based Restoration of Degraded Land in North India,"Restoration of marginal and degraded lands is essential for regaining biodiversity and ecosystems services, and thereby attaining UN-Sustainable Development Goals. During the last few decades, many fast growing and hardy trees have been introduced worldwide to restore the marginal and degraded lands for ecosystem stability. Unfortunately, most of these introduced species have become invasive and invaded the nearby productive systems, leading to significant biodiversity loss and land degradation. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct a sustainability analysis of the introduced species for necessary course correction and also for preventing the future utilisation of such species for land restoration. With this backdrop, the present study was conducted to analyse the socio-ecological impacts of a widely used species, i.e., Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC based restoration of degraded land of Lucknow, North India. For this, ecological (soil quality and plant biodiversity) and social (livelihood) indicators have been studied over a period of two years (2015-16) through direct field sampling and questionnaire-based surveys. While there was a positive difference (p < 0.01) in the key physico-chemical properties of the P. juliflora-invaded soil than the non-invaded site, the belowground microbial load was significantly lower (19.46 x 10(6) g(-1) of soil) in invaded land as compared to the non-invaded one (31.01 x 10(6) g(-1)). Additionally, the invasion of P. juliflora had significantly reduced the biodiversity by displacing the local flora such as Achyranthes aspera L., Amaranthus spinosus L., Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers, Euphorbia hirta L., etc. The invaded area had only eight plant species having an effective number of species (ENS) of 7.2, whereas the non-invaded area had the presence of 26 plant species with an ENS of 23.8. Although the local people utilised P. juliflora as fuelwood mostly during summer and winter seasons, the invasion resulted in a fodder deficit of 419.97 kg household(-1) y(-1) leading to resource scarcity in the invaded area in comparison to the non-invaded area. Ecodistribution mapping clearly showed that P. juliflora is already found in most of the tropical and subtropical countries (103) including in India and has become invasive in many countries. Therefore, we recommend that P. juliflora must be wisely used for the land restoration programs targeted during the United Nations Decade of Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030) as this species has invasive traits and thereby reduces the ecosystem sustainability of the invaded areas.",Not About Sufficiency
"Mediterranean lifestyle to promote physical, mental, and environmental health: The case of Chile","Chile is currently experiencing a progressive epidemiological transition towards chronic diseases. In this country, >50% of annual deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease and cancer. Moreover, health surveys have shown high prevalence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cardiovascular disease risk. In addition, mental health issues are also frequent among Chilean adults. On the other hand, the agri-food system contributes to 21–37% of greenhouse gases emissions worldwide. Overall, current health and food chain situation calls out for design and implementation of evidence-based feasible and effective nutritional interventions needed to promote physical and mental health along with addressing food sustainability in Chile. Nowadays, the Mediterranean diet is recognized as one of the healthiest dietary patterns based on observational and interventional studies linked to a wide variety of health outcomes. However, a Mediterranean lifestyle goes well beyond food intake: it includes promotion of psychosocial resources, community life as well as cultural traditions. Indeed, Mediterranean lifestyle is a true modus vivendi that integrally promotes physical, mental, and social well-being. In addition, the Mediterranean diet stands out for its environmental sustainability because it is characterized mainly as a plant-based dietary pattern with low carbon and water footprints. Remarkably, Central Chile has a Mediterranean-like setting with plant and animal food production and availability patterns comparable to those present in countries located around the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, this article reviews how promotion of Mediterranean lifestyle adherence in Chile offers great potential for management of the ongoing epidemiological transition to chronic diseases as well to promote psychological well-being within a unique food system and dietary sustainability vision for this Latin American country. © 2020 by the authors.

"Approaches to energy transitions: Carbon pricing, managed decline, and/or green new deal?","The need for wholescale energy transitions across the globe is now clear, but there is still much debate about how best to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Carbon-pricing has so far been unable to avert the coming climate catastrophe. Instead supply-side, managed decline of the fossil fuel sector and proposals for Green New Deals, or Just Transition are gaining steam among academics, policy communities, and movements and even entering mainstream politics. In this article, I review three main approaches to energy transition and highlight their underlying goals and assumptions. I argue that movements for energy transition must center social and economic justice in their struggles if they want to gain broad-based appeal. © 2021 The Authors.

Recent advances on the removal of dyes from wastewater using various adsorbents: A critical review,"The rapid increase in toxic dye wastewater generated from various industries remains a severe public health issue and prime environmental protection concern, posing a major challenge to existing conventional water treatment systems. Consequently, various physicochemical and biological treatment processes have been studied, which exhibit varying removal abilities depending on their experimental constraints. Among them, adsorption is considered to be the most efficient due to its high removal efficiency, easy operation, cost-effectiveness, and recyclability of the adsorbents. Considering this, the present review article focused on presenting a comprehensive summary of the various types of adsorbents such as commercial activated carbon, metal oxide-based, carbon-based, metal-organic framework, and polymer-based adsorbents used in dye remediation of contaminated water. The effects of several critical factors such as initial dye concentration, solution pH, temperature, and adsorbent dose on the dye adsorption performance are also described. In addition, the adsorption mechanisms responsible for dye removal are explained based on electrostatic attraction, ion exchange, surface complexation, and p-p interactions. Finally, critiques, future perspectives, and a summary of the present article are given. Various adsorbents such as carbon-based materials, metal oxides, bio-adsorbents, and polymer-based materials, have been shown to be efficient for the removal of dye pollutants from wastewater. Thus, it is anticipated that dye removal by adsorption can provide a feasible solution for the treatment of dye-laden water. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Not About Sufficiency
"Let the dust settle: Impact of enhanced rock weathering on soil biological, physical, and geochemical fertility","Terrestrial enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a promising carbon dioxide removal technology that consists in applying ground silicate rock such as basalt on agricultural soils. On top of carbon sequestration, ERW has the potential to raise the soil pH and release nutrients, thereby improving soil fertility. Despite these possible co-benefits, concerns such as heavy metal pollution or soil structure damage have also been raised. To our knowledge, these contrasted potential effects of ERW on soil fertility have not yet been simultaneously investigated. This field trial aimed at assessing the impact of ERW on biological, physical, and chemical soil properties in a temperate agricultural context. To do so, three vineyard fields in Switzerland were selected for their distinct geochemical properties and were amended with basaltic rock powder at a dose of 20 tons per hectare (2 kg.m−2). On each field, basaltic rock powder was either applied one year before the sampling campaign, one month before the sampling campaign, or not applied (control) for a total of 27 plots with 9 repetitions of each level. Overall, basaltic rock powder addition had a predominantly positive to neutral effect on soil fertility. Most soil properties showed no significant change either 1 month or 1 year post application. Nevertheless, our study highlighted a significant increase in earthworm abundance (+71 % on average), soil respiration (+50 %) and extractable sodium concentration (+23 %) as early as 1 month post application. The higher soil respiration raises the question of CO2 losses from organic matter mineralization that could limit ERW's efficiency. The increase in sodium raises concerns about a sodification risk potentially damaging soil fertility. These elements now require further investigation before enhanced rock weathering can be considered a viable and secure carbon dioxide removal technology. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Toward land restoration transitions: elevating regional voices and the provenance of co-benefits in Queensland rangelands,"Land management changes are and will continue to play a substantial role in national and global strategies towards decarbonisation goals. Yet, roles for land managers and their communities to co-create opportunities for just transitions are not well represented or accounted for in policy instruments or markets, including those for carbon offsets. Understanding regional context is critical to identify strategies for land management changes to underpin just transitions. We outline a mixed-methods approach involving an analysis of socio-economic data and a critical review of regional plans to identify the benefit aspirations that communities have articulated, and the drivers of transitions already at play to understand how land sector carbon abatement projects could support regional transitions. This approach is demonstrated using a case study region in Queensland, Australia. The case study region hosts land sector carbon abatement projects under a national policy that incentivises least cost abatement and under a state policy that incentivises land sector carbon abatement with bundled environmental and social co-benefits. The results show that across sectors and locations, communities are seeking economic, cultural, and social outcomes that can be delivered as co-benefits of land management changes for carbon abatement. Our analysis shows that the value of multiple co-benefits is place-specific and dependent on the provenance of land management changes and broader regional conditions. By understanding regional contexts and aspirations, it is possible to identify how and where land sector carbon abatement investments can be negotiated between investors and communities to support just transitions to low-carbon futures. © 2024 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).",Not About Sufficiency
ADVANCING THE PHILIPPINES' CLIMATE CHANGE RESPONSE THROUGH DOST-ASTI'S SARWAIS PROJECT,"Spaceborne data has always been vital in disaster risk reduction and management efforts especially in disaster-prone areas. Since 2016, the Department of Science and Technology - Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI) of the Philippines have used data from satellites to monitor disasters that are increasingly worsening because of climate change. In 2018, the Institute implemented the SARwAIS Project that acquired a 10% share on image tasking of NovaSAR-1, a low-cost S-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite developed and launched by UK's SSTL. This satellite is generally utilized to monitor the country's maritime domain. It has also been tasked to acquire images that are used to map potentially flooded areas, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change; and to map and monitor aquaculture structures, which, if left unregulated, may adversely affect blue carbon ecosystems. This project also allowed the country to gain free access to the satellite images of partner international space agencies, which are then used in monitoring areas in the country that are potentially prone to the effects of climate change. These efforts have substantially contributed to the achievement of Goal 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals which focuses on combating the effects of climate change. © 2023 ACRS.

Bending the curve of global freshwater biodiversity loss: what are the prospects?,"Freshwater biodiversity conservation has received substantial attention in the scientific literature and is finally being recognized in policy frameworks such as the Global Biodiversity Framework and its associated targets for 2030. This is important progress. Nonetheless, freshwater species continue to be confronted with high levels of imperilment and widespread ecosystem degradation. An Emergency Recovery Plan (ERP) proposed in 2020 comprises six measures intended to “bend the curve” of freshwater biodiversity loss, if they are widely adopted and adequately supported. We review evidence suggesting that the combined intensity of persistent and emerging threats to freshwater biodiversity has become so serious that current and projected efforts to preserve, protect and restore inland-water ecosystems may be insufficient to avert substantial biodiversity losses in the coming decades. In particular, climate change, with its complex and harmful impacts, will frustrate attempts to prevent biodiversity losses from freshwater ecosystems already affected by multiple threats. Interactions among these threats will limit recovery of populations and exacerbate declines resulting in local or even global extinctions, especially among low-viability populations in degraded or fragmented ecosystems. In addition to impediments represented by climate change, we identify several other areas where the absolute scarcity of fresh water, inadequate scientific information or predictive capacity, and a widespread failure to mitigate anthropogenic stressors, are liable to set limits on the recovery of freshwater biodiversity. Implementation of the ERP rapidly and at scale through many widely dispersed local actions focused on regions of high freshwater biodiversity and intense threat, together with an intensification of ex-situ conservation efforts, will be necessary to preserve native freshwater biodiversity during an increasingly uncertain climatic future in which poorly understood, emergent and interacting threats have become more influential. But implementation of the ERP must be accompanied by measures that will improve water, energy and food security for humans – without further compromising the condition of freshwater ecosystems. Unfortunately, the inadequate political implementation of policies to arrest widely recognized environmental challenges such as climate change do not inspire confidence about the possible success of the ERP. In many parts of the world, the Anthropocene future seems certain to include extended periods with an absolute scarcity of uncontaminated surface runoff that will inevitably be appropriated by humans. Unless there is a step-change in societal awareness of – and commitment to – the conservation of freshwater biodiversity, together with necessary actions to arrest climate change, implementation of established methods for protecting freshwater biodiversity may not bend the curve enough to prevent continued ecosystem degradation and species loss. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Double transplantation as a climate resilient and sustainable resource management strategy for rice production in eastern Uttar Pradesh, north India","-Enhancing the productivity of rainfed crops, especially rice, while coping with climate adversities and saving critical natural resources is essential for ensuring the food and nutrition security of a growing population. With this context, the present study was undertaken to validate promising farm innovation and adaptation practices used by small-medium landholding farmers for rice cultivation in eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP), north India, as well as to examine the sustainability of innovative practices for large-scale adoption. For this, a 3-year study comprising extensive field surveys and experiments was undertaken to compare single transplantation (ST) and double transplantation (DT) in rice along with organic addition (farm-yard manure, FYM) on crop growth, yield, climate resilience, soil quality, and overall sustainability i.e., social (women involvements and labour productivity), environmental (water productivity and nutrient use efficiency), and economic (benefit:cost ratio) dimensions of sustainability. Field experiments were conducted in triplicate using two local rice varieties (MotiNP-360 and Sampurna Kaveri) in two agroclimatic zones, namely the middle Gangetic plains and the Vindhyan zone, in the Mirzapur district of eastern Uttar Pradesh. The DT practices of rice with and without farm yard manure (FYM) (replacing at a dose of 25% NPK) were evaluated over conventional methods of rice cultivation (i.e., ST, as control) and analysis was done periodically. The DT practice improved growth (p < 0.05), percent fertile tiller and grain (p < 0.05), and rice yield (15–20% higher than ST), while also improving soil quality, yield indices, water and labour productivity, and the benefit-cost ratio. The DT practice also resulted in early maturity (10–15 days earlier than ST), created more labour days for women, decreased lodging and pest/disease incidence, as well as a subsequent reduction in the use of synthetic chemical pesticides and associated environmental costs. Importantly, the residual effects of FYM application significantly improved (p < 0.05) the grain yield in subsequent years of cropping. Optimizing DT cultivation practices, preferably with FYM input for various agro-climatic regions, is essential for large-scale sustainable rice production under changing climatic conditions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Women’s autonomy and its impact on environmental sustainability agenda,"Women’s autonomy remains under pressure from male dominancy in corporate business and household affairs. Women possess natural, analytical, social, political, and economic autonomy that acknowledges the United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDG-5) to empower women and girls in inclusive business. The study analyzes different aspects of women’s autonomy in corporate business and the natural environment, leading to sustainable business outcomes in China between 1975 and 2019. In practice, Chinese women’s political power in the decision-making process is minimal. It needs to restructure its socio-political autonomy to move toward the SDG-5 agenda. The results show that women have the political wisdom to handle corporate sustainability affairs, manage matters of corporate environmental responsibility, and increase their participation in the workforce, enabling them to sustain their lives as knowledge workers. Corporate women hold more stewardship values than men, enabling them to handle corporate sustainability matters. © 2021 Newcastle University.",Not About Sufficiency
Sequestration of organic carbon in West African soils by Aménagement en Courbes de Niveau,"A recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) report concludes that global warming, while already a global crisis, is likely to become even more devastating. The scientific consensus is that global warming is caused by increases in greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide. The Sahel of West Africa seems to be more adversely affected by such climate changes, leading to reduced and more sporadic rainfall. In addition, food security in the region is tenuous and fragile, due to adverse climate change, but also due to the historical mining of nutrients and carbon. With the adoption of the Kyoto accords, at least by some countries, sequestered carbon (C) has become a tradable commodity. This provides a double incentive to increase soil organic carbon in the C-depleted and degraded soils of West Africa - return C to improve soil quality and assist in removing CO from the atmosphere to assist in mitigating climate change. A challenge, however, remains to determine which agricultural systems can actually sequester C. The technology called Aménagement en courbes de niveau (ACN), which can be roughly translated as 'Ridge-tillage', has given crop yield increases of 30 to 50%. To date, there has only been anecdotal evidence suggesting that Aménagement en courbes de niveau leads to increased soil organic C. The objectives of the study reported here were to determine whether the technology has the potential to sequester C in West African soils, and, if so, how much. In this study, soil organic C was measured by combustion methods in soils sampled at 0-20 and 20-40 cm depths in a series of experiments in Mali, Senegal and The Gambia. Soil organic C was measured in three very different types of experiments, all including Aménagement en courbes de niveau technology, resulting in three methods of measuring C sequestration. Our results indicate that the Aménagement en courbes de niveau technology significantly increased maize yields by 24% by weight in the Gambia experiment while soil organic C was increased by 26% in The Gambia, by 12% in Siguidolo, Mali, and by 14% in peanut systems of Nioro, Senegal. These increases in soil organic C are likely due to three factors: (1) reduced erosion and movement of soil, (2) increased crop growth resulting from the greater capture of rainfall, and (3) increased growth and density of shrubs and trees resulting from the increased subsoil water, resulting in turn from the increased capture of rainfall, and reduced runoff. Measuring soil C on fields that were successively placed under Aménagement en courbes de niveau management and the use of replicated experimental plots appear to be the best methods to quantify the C sequestration potential of the practice. These results indicate that this soil and water conservation technology not only harvests water and increases food production, but also increases soil organic carbon. This technology thus is a successful technique to sequester C in soils and if carried out in a large region may both offset CO emissions and help mitigate climate change. © 2008 INRA EDP Sciences.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental Sustainability and AI in Radiology: A Double-Edged Sword,"According to the World Health Organization, climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity. The global health care system, including medical imaging, must manage the health effects of climate change while at the same time addressing the large amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated in the delivery of care. Data centers and computational efforts are increasingly large contributors to GHG emissions in radiology. This is due to the explosive increase in big data and artificial intelligence (AI) applications that have resulted in large energy requirements for developing and deploying AI models. However, AI also has the potential to improve environmental sustainability in medical imaging. For example, use of AI can shorten MRI scan times with accelerated acquisition times, improve the scheduling efficiency of scanners, and optimize the use of decision-support tools to reduce low-value imaging. The purpose of this Radiology in Focus article is to discuss this duality at the intersection of environmental sustainability and AI in radiology. Further discussed are strategies and opportunities to decrease AI-related emissions and to leverage AI to improve sustainability in radiology, with a focus on health equity. Co-benefits of these strategies are explored, including lower cost and improved patient outcomes.

Provincial equity and enhanced health are key drivers for China's 2060 carbon neutrality,"China's ambitious 2060 carbon neutrality target necessitates innovative strategies to address the country's status as the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. This study employs the Global Change Analysis Model to develop a provincial-differentiated control strategy (EQU scenario) that not only aims to meet the national carbon neutrality goal but also enhances population health and environmental equity. The EQU scenario forecasts substantial reductions in average population weighted PM2.5 and O3 concentrations to 7 μg/m3 and 34 ppb, respectively, by 2060. In comparison to a baseline scenario (NEU), the EQU scenario offers more equitable air quality improvements and significant health benefits, potentially preventing 39 thousand PM2.5-related and 10 thousand O3-related premature deaths, with minimal additional cost. The Gini coefficient, indicating CO2 emission distribution inequality among provinces, is projected to decrease from 0.58 in NEU to 0.37 in EQU. This scenario anticipates about one-third of provinces achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, with a harmonized provincial carbon neutrality capacity. The study highlights the critical importance of integrating provincially differentiated controls within national decarbonization strategies, advancing equitable deep decarbonization and reinforcing environmental justice in China. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Ensuring that nature-based solutions for climate mitigation address multiple global challenges,"The protection, restoration, management, and sustainable use of natural and modified ecosystems to address climate change mitigation have received much global attention in recent years. Those types of actions are, however, often not designed to also address other global challenges, and so they miss an opportunity to provide important non-mitigation benefits and compromise their mitigation potential. Here, we highlight the importance of planning Nature-based Solutions for mitigation while considering the suite of global challenges that societies face, and we propose a set of considerations to ensure that those types of solutions also provide climate adaptation, biodiversity, and/or human well-being benefits. Planning Nature-based Solutions for climate mitigation that can also address other global challenges is very timely because every nature-based effort should grasp the opportunity to address a variety of pressing issues in order to allow for the continued delivery of mitigation and other benefits in this critical decade.",Not About Sufficiency

"Estimating growth, loss and potential carbon sequestration of farmed kelp: a case study of Saccharina latissima at Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland","Many governments are evaluating marine carbon sequestration processes for their capacity to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change. This includes the cultivation of macroalgae to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which requires accurate estimates from the field. This study estimated the potential rates of carbon sequestration of cultivated macroalgae by quantifying the amount of biomass released into the environment from a kelp, Saccharina latissima, farm in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland (54.4° N, 5.58° W). We estimated that a mean of 41% of net primary productivity (NPP) of the cultivated kelp was lost prior to harvest following blade fall-off, equivalent to a mean of 7.4 kg of carbon sequestered per 100 m longline at the site during the cultivation period. Coarse estimates requiring verification predicted that a further 43.2% of NPP may have been lost through chronic erosion and exudation of organic carbon. This rate of sequestration is similar to that of several government-funded agroforestry schemes. There is potential, therefore, that this quantified ecosystem service could be subsidized to incentivize the sustainable development of the macroalgae industry. These findings are essential for those promoting the sustainable development of the macroalgae cultivation industry and are highly relevant for implementation of UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate action) and Goal 14 (Life below water: “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development”). © 2022 The Author(s).

Hydrologic variability in dryland regions: Impacts on ecosystem dynamics and food security,"Research on ecosystem and societal response to global environmental change typically considers the effects of shifts in mean climate conditions. There is, however, some evidence of ongoing changes also in the variance of hydrologic and climate fluctuations. A relatively high interannual variability is a distinctive feature of the hydrologic regime of dryland regions, particularly at the desert margins. Hydrologic variability has an important impact on ecosystem dynamics, food security and societal reliance on ecosystem services in water-limited environments. Here, we investigate some of the current patterns of hydrologic variability in drylands around the world and review the major effects of hydrologic fluctuations on ecosystem resilience, maintenance of biodiversity and food security. We show that random hydrologic fluctuations may enhance the resilience of dryland ecosystems by obliterating bistable deterministic behaviours and threshold-like responses to external drivers. Moreover, by increasing biodiversity and the associated ecosystem redundancy, hydrologic variability can indirectly enhance post-disturbance recovery, i.e. ecosystem resilience. © 2012 The Royal Society.",Not About Sufficiency
Impacts of innovative forestry land use on rural livelihood in a bimodal agricultural system in irrigated drylands,"The conversion of marginal croplands to tree plantations, as an option to address climate change, land degradation, and irrigation water scarcity, as well as to improve the welfare of local population requires prior analysis. This study analyzed the impacts of afforestation of marginal croplands, including potential benefits in the form of carbon sequestration rewards via the Clean Development Mechanism, on the livelihood of commercial farms and rural households by considering their interdependencies via wage-labor relations in irrigated agricultural regions of the lower reaches of the Amu Darya River, Central Asia. A dynamic nonlinear programming model was developed that jointly maximizes profit of farm and net incomes of rural households over a 15-year horizon under conditions of decreasing irrigation water availability and forestry plantations with a single seven-year rotation period. The results showed that the introduction of short-rotation plantation forestry in degraded irrigated croplands can help mitigate the repercussions of water shortages on rural livelihood, while sustaining energy needs, income, and food security. Although income and food consumption of rural households may decline from year two to six after afforestation, the subsequent increase in farm profit following the harvest of tree plantations would be transmitted to rural households through existing wage-labor payment arrangements. The incorporation of fuelwood into labor payment schemes would substitute the use of fossil fuels by rural households and thus substantially decrease their energy expenses and CO2 emissions. Furthermore, given the low irrigation water demand of trees, afforestation would increase irrigation water availability for more productive croplands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecosystem service tradeoff between grazing intensity and other services - A case study in Karei-Deshe experimental cattle range in northern Israel,"Grasslands cover around 25% of the earth's land surface and provide many essential Ecosystem Services (ES) to human well-being. Changes in grazing intensity have led to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, resulting in loss of some of these ES. This emphasizes the need for grassland management schemes that aim to maximize economic returns from grasslands while maintaining ecosystem functioning, but tools to assess the tradeoffs between economic benefits and Ecosystem Services are, for the most part, lacking. This study is aimed at economically valuing multiple ecosystem services, and the tradeoffs between them and species richness, across different management alternatives (control, light, moderate and heavy grazing) in the Karei-Deshe experimental farm and Long Term Ecosystem Research (LTER) site. Ecological data from previous research in Karei-Deshe was valuated using the Replacement Cost Method and a Contingent Valuation survey, which valued the farm's landscape. Grazing intensity was inversely related to the delivery of ES studied and positively related to species richness, except for heavy grazing, which resulted in lower species richness. Only heavy grazing was found to be an inefficient management alternative. This research demonstrates a fairly simple path for providing land managers an ecological-data-based tool for comparing management alternatives.",Not About Sufficiency
Woody encroachment: social-ecological impacts and sustainable management,"Woody plants are encroaching across terrestrial ecosystems globally, and this has dramatic effects on how these systems function and the livelihoods of producers who rely on the land to support livestock production. Consequently, the removal of woody plants is promoted widely in the belief that it will reinstate former grasslands or open savanna. Despite this popular management approach to encroachment, we still have a relatively poor understanding of the effects of removal on society, and of alternative management practices that could balance the competing needs of pastoral production, biodiversity conservation and cultural values. This information is essential for maintaining both ecological and societal benefits in encroached systems under predicted future climate changes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the social-ecological perspectives of woody encroachment based on recent studies and global meta-analyses by assessing the ecological impacts of encroachment and its effects on sustainable development goals (SDGs) when woody plants are retained and when they are removed. We propose a working definition of woody encroachment based on species- and community-level characteristics; such a definition is needed to evaluate accurately the effects of encroachment. We show that encroachment is a natural process of succession rather than a sign of degradation, with encroachment resulting in an overall 8% increase in ecosystem multifunctionality. Removing woody plants can increase herbaceous plant richness, biomass and cover, but at the expense of biocrust cover. The effectiveness of woody plant removal depends on plant identity, and where, when and how they are removed. Under current management practices, either removal or retention of woody plants can induce trade-offs among ecosystem services, with no management practice maximising all SDGs [e.g. SDG2 (end hunger), SDG13 (climate change), SDG 15 (combat desertification)]. Given that encroachment of woody plants is likely to increase under future predicted hotter and drier climates, alternative management options such as carbon farming and ecotourism could be effective land uses for areas affected by encroachment.",Not About Sufficiency
"Modeling the links between biodiversity, ecosystem services and human wellbeing in the context of climate change: Results from an econometric analysis of the European forest ecosystems","This paper constitutes a first attempt to model the relationship between climate change, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, with a specific emphasis on European forests. Firstly, we construct a composite biodiversity indicator that integrates quantitative and qualitative changes of biodiversity projected to 2050 for the EU-17 under future IPCC scenarios. Secondly, this indicator is integrated into two simultaneous equation models to capture the marginal impacts of changes in biodiversity on the value of ecosystem goods and services (EGS) due to climate change.Our estimation results confirm the role of biodiversity as a nature-based policy solution for climate change mitigation, shedding light on the policy actions that generate co-benefits by enhancing ecosystems' capacity to mitigate climate change impacts, while conserving biodiversity and sustaining the flows of EGS for human livelihoods. Especially, nature-based mitigation policies are more cost-effective and better at coping with the ethic and inequality issues associated with distributional impacts of the policy actions, compared to the pure technical solutions to improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions. However, the strength of biodiversity as a nature-based policy option for climate change mitigation depends on both the nature of the EGS and the geographical area under consideration. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

The threatened species were further categorized as per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List in the IGP as vulnerable (21 species), endangered (16 species), and critically endangered (four species). This systematic review suggests integration of the native and naturalized UEFS in afforestation and reforestation programs to aid in various ecosystem services. Calamus inermis, Corypha taliera, Licuala peltata, and Saurauia punduana are examples of multipurpose species that require immediate sustainable conservation and cultivation initiatives to save them from extinction in the near future. Multipurpose species such as Aegle marmelos, Buchanania lanzan, Manilkara hexandra, Syzygium cuminii, Tamarindus indica are immensely constructive and climate-smart by surviving in harsh agroclimatic conditions and have great potential for establishment on marginal and wastelands throughout the IGP region. These resilient fruit species enhance biodiversity, ecosystems, and landscapes in addition to providing food for humans. It progressively advances India’s commitment to LDN, combating climate change, and achieving the UN-SDGs, which call for reducing hunger and raising FS by 2030. As a result, the study will offer baseline data for the next investigations and be helpful to policymakers in creating sustainable and scientific policies for the IGP. © TÜBİTAK.",Not About Sufficiency
"Protection and management of species, habitats, ecosystems and landscapes: Current trends and global needs","Human well-being and the prerequisite sustainable environmental management are currently at stake, reaching a bottleneck when trying to cope with (i) the ever-growing world population, (ii) the constantly increasing need for natural resources (and the subsequent overexploitation of species, habitats, ecosystems, and landscapes) and (iii) the documented and on-going impacts of climate change. In developed societies, the concern about environmental protection is set high in the public dialogue, as well as to management and policy agendas. The recently constituted Intergovernmental Science—Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) urges transformative changes for technological, economic, and social factors aiming to tackle both direct and indirect drivers of biodiversity loss. By this, the role of conservation and management practices for the environment is characterized as a crucial and top issue and should deal with (a) promoting best practices from the local to the global level, (b) identifying spatial and temporal knowledge gaps, (c) multidisciplinary aspects for sustainable management practices, (d) identifying and interpreting the role of stakeholders and socio-economic parameters in the decision-making process, and (e) methods and practices to integrate the concept of ecosystem services into natural capital assessment and accounting, conservation and management strategies. Modern literature highlights that land-use change and prioritization, restoration of natural areas, cultural landscape identification and maintenance, should be considered to the top of the scientific and policy agenda, as well as to the epicenter of novel awareness-raising strategies for the environment in the near future. © 2020 by the authors.

Towards a green future for Sub-Saharan Africa: do electricity access and public debt drive environmental progress?,"The combination of rising debt levels, poor electricity access, and environmental deterioration could threaten the attainment of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Hence, this inquiry examined the implications of public borrowing and access to electricity on environmental sustainability (proxied by ecological footprint (ECOL) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), largely overlooked in the literature. In addition to pre-estimation, diagnostic, and robustness checks utilized in the study, the instrumental variable generalized method of moment (IV-GMM) approach is employed to examine annual data from 39 SSA economies between 2005 and 2018. The key findings indicate that public debt negatively influences environmental sustainability in the region at a certain level of threshold, while access to electricity has the potential to trigger environmental sustainability but remain below the expected threshold to mitigate environmental damage in SSA. The study provides recommendations for SSA policymakers to significantly reduce pollution and protect the environment which is vital for sustainable development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Conservation Agriculture and Ecosystem Services,"Conservation agriculture has many agricultural and food security benefits. In addition, conservation agriculture has potential on- and off-site ecosystem service benefits that are the focus of this paper. Ecosystem services provided by conservation agriculture fall into three main categories: provisioning services such as increased food production; regulating services such as carbon sequestration and climate regulation, reducing losses of soil, pesticides, nutrients and other potential contaminants in surface and subsurface water flows, and water cycle improvements; and supporting services such as nutrient and storage and cycling. This paper focuses on the regulating service benefits of conservation agriculture: erosion control, reduced losses of pesticides and nutrients, and particularly water cycle benefits including increased water productivity (more crop per drop), infiltration, percolation, plant available water storage, groundwater recharge, plant available water, and stream baseflow and decreases in peak stream flows and downstream flooding.",Not About Sufficiency
Linking consumers to sustainability: Incorporating science into eco-friendly certification,"Efforts to counter ecological and socio-economic degradation have put coffee at the forefront of a new sustainability movement to reform negative globalization trends. This paper focuses on the possibilities of and challenges to sustainable certification efforts with particular focus on biodiversity conservation concerns. It presents the potential contributions from scientists in the certification processes, particularly to ensure that concern actually translates into measurable progress toward conservation goals. The benefits of unifying the three main certifications (organic, Fair Trade, and eco-friendly or shade grown), or triple-certified coffee, are explored. In general, benefits for biodiversity conservation and social justice from sustainable coffee certification can only be enhanced by greater cooperation among the current market-based efforts and scientists researching this unique response to globalization. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
Achieving Net Zero Carbon Performance in a French Apartment Building?,"Containing global warming to 1.5 °C implies staying on a given carbon budget and therefore being able to design net zero carbon buildings by 2050. A case study corresponding to a French residential building is used to assess the feasibility of achieving this target. Starting from an actual construction built in 2016, various improvement measures are studied: lowering heating energy needs, implementing bio-sourced materials and renewable energy systems (geothermal heat pump, solar domestic hot water production, and photovoltaic electricity production). Dynamic thermal simulation is used to evaluate energy consumption and overheating risk in hot periods. Greenhouse gas emissions are quantified using a consequential life cycle assessment approach, considering that during a transition period, exporting electricity avoids impacts corresponding to marginal production on the grid. Avoided impacts decrease and become zero when the grid is ultimately “decarbonized”. From this point, the building should be net zero emissions, but there remain unavoidable emissions. Residual GhG (greenhouse gas) emissions account for 5.6 kgCO2 eq/m2 annually. The possibility of offsetting these emissions is investigated, considering sequestration in forests or vegetation systems. A net zero emission level can be achieved, but on a national level, it would require that the whole sequestration potential of forest growth be devoted to offset emissions of new construction. A circular economy for construction products and equipment and considering water use will be needed to further decrease environmental impacts. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Low Carbon Mobility for Future Cities,"Urban Transport energy efficiency and environmental sustainability continue to present big challenges for city leaders and policy think tanks. As the share of the world's population living in cities grows to nearly 70 per cent between now and 2050, urban transport energy consumption is forecast to double to meet the travel demand in the world's future cities. This urban growth will also dramatically change the scale and nature of our communities, and put a tremendous strain on the built environment and infrastructure that delivers vital services like transport. This book presents a cohesive body of work on the policy principles and practical applications to drive sustainable mobility services in tomorrow's smart cities. Topics covered include policy principles for low carbon mobility; low carbon mobility and reducing automobile dependence; integrated land-use and transport planning for future cities; decarbonising suburban mobility; public transport for the urban millennium; impacts on public health; active transport, health and wellbeing; mobility and the sharing economy; autonomous shared mobility; gamification and sustainable mobility; and digital innovations and disruptive mobility. Low Carbon Mobility for Future Cities will be essential reading for researchers and practitioners in transport engineering, urban planning, transport planning and strategy, government employees in charge of sustainable practices, higher degree students, and the industries involved in offering mobility as a service.

The expansion of wheat thermal suitability of Russia in response to climate change,"The emergence of Russia as a major grain exporter is not only crucial for the world commercial agriculture and food security, but also for the country's economy. Here we examine the past-to-future thermal suitability for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum, L. 1753) cultivation over Russia and compare it with the recent trends of wheat yields and harvested area. The analyses use a multi-model ensemble median of the most updated bias-corrected outputs from five CMIP5 Earth System Models (1950-2099) under two representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and the Era-Interim dataset (1979-2016). Our results show that the thermal suitability has increased by similar to 10 Mha per decade since 1980. Consistently, winter wheat yields and harvested area have also increased over the last decade by similar to 0.5 t/ha and similar to 4 Mha, respectively. Moreover, a potential for the Russian wheat sector may still be exploited if we consider the abandoned land (similar to 27 Mha) after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Our results also show that the increase in heat availability and the reduction of the frost constraint will likely move the thermal suitability toward the north-western and the Far East regions. Conversely, increases of extreme heat events are projected in the southern regions of Russia, which currently represent the most productive and intensively managed wheat cultivation area. Our findings imply both opportunities and risks for the Russian wheat sector that calls for sustainable and farsighted land management strategies to comprehensively face the consequences of global warming.",Not About Sufficiency

"Tropical forest-transition landscapes: a portfolio for studying people, tree crops and agro-ecological change in context","Nudging the development trajectory of tropical landscapes towards sustainability requires a global commitment and policies that take diverse contexts and forest transitions into account. Out-scaling and upscaling landscape-level actions to achieve sustainable development goals globally need to be based on understanding of extrapolation domains and interconnectivity of products and services. We evaluated three portfolios of tropical landscape observatories and quantified extrapolation domains across ecological zones, stages of forest transition, human development index (HDI), population density and potential prominence of four dominant tropical tree crops (arabica coffee, cacao, rubber and oil palm). The ASB Partnership for Tropical Forest Margins portfolio was focussed on active humid forest margins and the Poverty and Environment Network on early stages of forest transition. The portfolio of sentinel landscapes of the Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (FTA) research programme provides a 5% sample of pantropical area, 8% of people, 9% of tree cover and 10–12% of potential tree crop presence, with quantified biases across zones, transition stages and HDI. In the ‘water tower’ configuration, relatively high population density coincides with biodiversity, coffee expansion and contested ecosystem services. The extrapolation domain of the FTA portfolio includes trade-off (tree loss) and synergy (restoration) phases of tropical forest transition. © 2017 The Author(s).

Carbon Sequestration and Animal-Agriculture: Relevance and Strategies to Cope with Climate Change,"Carbon sequestration is an important pathway to stabilize the environment with minimum effects of climate change. Farming systems provide a non-compensated service to society by removing atmospheric carbon generated from fossil fuel combustion, feed production, land restoration, deforestation, biomass burning and drainage of wetlands. The resultant increase in the global emissions of carbon is calculated at 270 Gt, and increasing at the rate of 4 billion tonnes year(-1). Strategies to maximize carbon sequestration through enhanced farming practices, particularly in crop-animal systems, are thus an important priority to reduce global warming. These pathways also respond to agricultural productivity in the multifaceted, less favoured rainfed environments. Sustainable animal-agriculture requires an understanding of crop-animal interactions and integrated natural resource management (NRM), demonstrated in the development of underestimated silvo-pastoral systems (tree crops and ruminants).

Good agronomic practices potentially enhance carbon sinks and soil organic matter through leguminous trees (e.g. Leucaena), integrated nutrient management, regulation of grazing pressure and use of animal manure. These interventions significantly increase ecosystem services, crop and animal productivity, reduce CH4 emissions and mitigate N2O emissions and ammonia volatilization. Research and development (R&D) efforts on the characterization of forages and research on heat stress and economic animal productivity are urgently needed.

The search for efficiency in the management of natural resources,"There is an urgent need to regenerate agriculture to increase productivity, support economic development and address concerns regarding food security. The fundamental question is whether the more efficient use of natural resources can help to reduce malnutrition and food insecurity while providing adequate food supplies to feed a burgeoning population in an environmentally sustainable way. In this paper, three pathways are considered: expanding existing arable land to include crop-animal systems; intensifying existing land use; and expanding production in less favoured areas (LFAs). Silvo-pastoral systems, common in rainfed areas, are often underestimated with regard to their capacity for carbon sequestration, value addition and increased productivity. Animals can also support improved livelihoods and can be used as an entry point for the development of LFAs. However, the varied and complex issues related to such development require an interdisciplinary approach that addresses demographics, socioeconomics, resource allocation, value chains, trade and marketing. Combined with effective development policy, the goals of sustainable food production and environmental protection are achievable.

A systematic review of empirical studies on green manufacturing: eight propositions and a research framework for digitalized sustainable manufacturing,"Manufacturers are facing increasing pressures to adapt their operations to meet sustainability goals. Research and developments on industrial digitalization (aka Industry 4.0) present new opportunities to create and capture value in ever-more complex and connected industrial systems. However, digitalization does not always align with sustainability, and case studies combining these two topics are still scarce. To address these gaps, we adopted a bottom-up approach to (1) identify existing environmental solutions and their implemen\tation challenges by reviewing 208 empirical studies, and (2) formulate eight propositions to guide further work so that digitalization supports environmental improvements more systematically. Finally, a framework for Digitalized Sustainable Manufacturing consisting of four research themes is proposed, pointing to future research needed to align industrial development with sustainable development goals. The propositions and framework aim to structure and focus future research by targeting specifically the challenges encountered when implementing environmental solutions in manufacturing. © 2022 The Author(s).

"Identifying a sustainable rice-based cropping system via on-farm evaluation of grain yield, carbon sequestration capacity and carbon footprints in Central China","Context: Rice-based cropping system is a major anthropogenic source of direct greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, agricultural inputs also produces numerous indirect GHG emissions and environmental problems. Identification of rice cropping systems with lower GHG emissions and higher grain yields is of great significance to ensure food security while minimizing agricultural carbon footprint (CF). Objective: This study aimed to identify the optimal rice-based cropping system with lower greenhouse effects and comparable annual yield in central China. Methods: Used life cycle assessment, a two-year field experiment was performed to evaluate the direct and indirect GHG emissions, CF, and carbon sequestration capacity in the six rice-based cropping systems widely used in central China, which consisted of fallow-early rice-late rice, rapeseed-early rice-late rice, fallow-ratoon rice, rapeseed-ratoon rice (RRaR), fallow-middle rice, and rapeseed-middle rice. Results: The results showed that compared with the three systems with fallow season, the three systems with rapeseed had lower annual CH4 emissions. The two systems with ratoon rice had lower annual indirect and direct GHG emissions than the two systems with double rice. The three systems with rapeseed had higher annual biomass, grain yields, and fixed carbon in biomass and significantly lower CF than the three systems with fallow season, and RRaR had the highest value of fixed carbon in biomass. The systems with ratoon rice had lower average CF than those systems with double rice. CH4 emissions from paddy fields were the primary source of total annual GHG and the main component of CF. Compared with the three systems with fallow season, the three systems with rapeseed had significantly higher annual carbon sequestration capacity based on net ecosystem production (NEP). Ratoon rice systems had higher average NEP than double- and middle-rice systems. RRaR had the lowest CF per unit yield and highest NEP among all the six systems. Conclusions: The results indicated that appropriate rice-based cropping systems may alleviate the greenhouse effect via reducing GHG emissions and enhancing paddy NEP, RRaR could achieve relatively higher annual grain yield and carbon sequestration capacity as well as lower CF. Significance: This study highlight conversion of double rice and middle rice systems to RRaR may help improve grain yield and mitigate greenhouse effect. The findings may provide a theoretical basis for selection of sustainable development of rice based cropping systems in central China. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Managing fragmented croplands for environmental and economic benefits in China,"Cropland fragmentation contributes to low productivity and high abandonment risk. Using spatial statistics on a detailed land use map, we show that 10% of Chinese croplands have no potential to be consolidated for large-scale farming (>10 ha) owing to spatial constraints. These fragmented croplands contribute only 8% of total crop production while using 15% of nitrogen fertilizers, leading to 12% of fertilizer loss in China. Optimizing the cropping structure of fragmented croplands to meet animal food demand in China can increase animal food supply by 19%, equivalent to increasing cropland proportionally. This crop-switching approach would lead to a 10% and 101% reduction in nitrogen and greenhouse gas emissions, respectively, resulting in a net benefit of US$ 7 billion yr−1. If these fragmented croplands were relocated to generate large-scale farming units, livestock, vegetable and fruit production would be increased by 8%, 3% and 14%, respectively, and reactive nitrogen and greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by 16% and 5%, respectively, resulting in a net benefit of US$ 44 billion yr−1. Both solutions could be used to achieve synergies between food security, economic benefits and environmental protection through increased agricultural productivity, without expanding the overall cropland area. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Building soil to reduce climate change impacts on global crop yield,"Improving soil health and resilience is fundamental for sustainable food production, however the role of soil in maintaining or improving global crop productivity under climate warming is not well identified and quantified. Here, we examined the impact of soil on yield response to climate warming for four major crops (i.e., maize, wheat, rice and soybean), using global-scale datasets and random forest method. We found that each °C of warming reduced global yields of maize by 3.4%, wheat by 2.4%, rice by 0.3% and soybean by 5.0%, which were spatially heterogeneous with possible positive impacts. The random forest modeling analyses further showed that soil organic carbon (SOC), as an indicator of soil quality, dominantly explained the spatial heterogeneity of yield responses to warming and would regulate the negative warming responses. Improving SOC under the medium SOC sequestration scenario would reduce the warming-induced yield loss of maize, wheat, rice and soybean to 0.1% °C−1, 2.7% °C−1, 3.4% °C−1 and − 0.6% °C−1, respectively, avoiding an average of 3%–5% °C−1 of global yield loss. These yield benefits would occur on 53.2%, 67.8%, 51.8% and 71.6% of maize, wheat, rice and soybean planting areas, respectively, with particularly pronounced benefits in the regions with negative warming responses. With improved soil carbon, food systems are predicted to provide additional 20 to over 130 million tonnes of food that would otherwise lose due to future warming. Our findings highlight the critical role of soil in alleviating negative warming impacts on food security, especially for developing regions, given that sustainable actions on soil improvement could be taken broadly. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Paying for green: A scoping review of alternative financing models for nature-based solutions,"Nature-based solutions (NBS) are widely regarded as cost-effective responses to climate change and environmental degradation that also provide numerous co-benefits. However, despite significant policy attention, NBS plans often fail to materialize due to public budget shortfalls. Alongside traditional public finance, the international debate increasingly urges the mobilization of private capital for NBS through alternative financing (AF) techniques. In this scoping review, we examine the literature on a) the AF models connected to NBS and b) the drivers and barriers associated with these AF models in terms of their financial technicity and their embeddedness in the political, economic, social, technological, legal/institutional, and environmental/spatial (“PESTLE”) context. Although many models are discussed, the results indicate that none can be considered full substitutes for traditional public finance. Barriers and drivers converge around seven overarching tensions: new revenue and risk distribution vs. uncertainty, budgetary and legal pressure vs. political willingness and risk aversion, market demand vs. market failures, private sector engagement vs. social acceptance and risks, legal and institutional conduciveness vs. inertia, and upscaling potential vs. environmental risks and land use. Future research should focus on a) how to further integrate NBS monitoring, quantification, valuation, and monetization into AF models, b) systemic and empirical approaches to improve the understanding of the applicability and transferability of AF models, and c) an exploration of the potential qualities and social risks of AF models in NBS governance arrangements. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Barriers and Strategies to Boost Soil Carbon Sequestration in Agriculture,"The Paris Agreement calls for limiting global warming below 2°C.

We conducted participatory multi-stakeholder workshops in France and Senegal to collect knowledge and perception of farmers, NGOs, agro-industries, administrations, donors and researchers on barriers and coping strategies for 4 per 1,000 innovations. Results in both countries reveal the predominance of social and economic barriers such as lack of knowledge or training, increased difficulties of fieldwork, workload, risk handling, funding and social pressure.

Resources time footprint indicator extension for evaluating human interventions in provisioning ecosystem services supply,"The growing emphasis on ecosystem services (ES) has enhanced evaluation of their capacity. However, intensive human intervention in the provisioning ecosystem service (P-ES) supply driven by widening spatial gaps between supply sources and demand locations, compromises the long-term ES supply potential. The Resources Time Footprint (RTF) indicator provides numerical insights into these impacts in the form of occupancy rates by comparing resource utilization to allocated capacities over a person's lifespan. Nonetheless, its applicability to major P-ES is currently restricted due to the lack of water and water pollutant occupancy rates concepts. This study attempts to broaden the scope and robustness of RTF by introducing these missing aspects for enhanced P-ES management. Furthermore, by evaluating changes in RTF value around technological and social dynamics, resources requiring management interventions are identified. The extended RTF's potential is finally demonstrated through case studies involving consumable rice, water flow utilized for generating electricity via hydropower (HP), and sugarcane yielding consumable sugar and molasses with bagasse used to generate electricity. Based on prevailing resource conditions, all cases exhibited resource utilization within the allocated capacity. However, potential strain on specific resources such as land and water use in rice (24.63 and 18.69 years), copper in HP (8.46 years), and land and phosphate-potash minerals use in bagasse (22.66 and 23.56 years) highlights the need for interventions to ensure sustained benefits. The precise influence of water and water pollutants is inherently case and location specific; however, this study emphasized the necessity of integrating water use and availability factors into rice and HP supply-flow assessments. Overall, the enhanced RTF proved to be replicable across P-ESs, quantifying pressures, and guiding management strategies to maintain nature's regenerative capacity while meeting human needs. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Lack of functional redundancy in the relationship between microbial diversity and ecosystem functioning,"Biodiversity is declining world-wide with detrimental effects on ecosystems. However, we lack a quantitative understanding of the shape of the relationship between microbial biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF). This limits our understanding of how microbial diversity depletion can impact key functions for human well-being, including pollutant detoxification. Three independent microcosm experiments were conducted to evaluate the direction (i.e. positive, negative or null) and the shape of the relationships between bacterial diversity and both broad (i.e. microbial respiration) and specialized (i.e. toxin degradation) functions in five Australian and two UK freshwater ecosystems using next-generation sequencing platforms. Reduced bacterial diversity, even after accounting for biomass, caused a decrease in broad (i.e. cumulative microbial respiration) and specialized (biodegradation of two important toxins) functions in all cases. Unlike the positive but decelerating BEF relationship observed most frequently in plants and animals, most evaluated functional measurements were related to bacterial diversity in a non-redundant fashion (e.g. exponentially and/or linearly).Synthesis. Our results suggest that there is a lack of functional redundancy in the relationship between bacterial diversity and ecosystem functioning; thus, the consequences of declining microbial diversity on ecosystem functioning and human welfare have likely been considerably underestimated.",Not About Sufficiency
Unearthing the myths of global sustainable forest governance,"Non-technical summary Despite efforts to address the global forest crisis, deforestation and degradation continue, so we need to urgently revisit possible solutions. A failure to halt the global forest crisis contributes to climate change and biodiversity loss and will continue to result in inequalities in access to, and benefits from, forest resources. In this paper, we unpack a series of powerful myths about forests and their management. By exposing and better understanding these myths and what makes them so persistent, we have the basis to make the social and political changes needed to better manage and protect forests globally. Technical summary There is increasing recognition in the scientific community that environmental problems such as climate change are not just technological or engineering problems, but part of an ideational crisis. One particularly dominant idea is that sustainability problems can be solved by treating them as predominantly economic problems to be solved by market-based instruments or by mobilizing enough financial resources. In this article, we suggest that ideas like these are not only challenged by available scientific evidence about the best way to tackle the global forest crisis, but also produce socio-institutional lock-ins. We examine various myths underlying these lock-ins and show how they create barriers to transformations towards global forest sustainability. In the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we ask why we are stuck with seemingly ineffective and inequitable approaches to global forest governance. We examine deforestation and some of the currently discussed policy solutions such as carbon forestry, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and private forest governance. We aim to unearth these myths and explore their consequences, warning that, in many contexts, their prevalence may preclude other solutions that might be more effective. Finally, we consider the transformative changes that are needed to unlock these lock-ins through a combination of 'counteractions' for sustainable forest governance.

"Juxtaposing the role of effective capital, energy efficiency and technological innovations on environmental sustainability in the EU countries","Purpose: The United Nations through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for instance, the SDG 13 calls for climate action and SDG 11 calls for the development of smart and clean cities and communities. Empirical findings on this subject show the importance of clean fuels in fostering environmental sustainability. Literature shows a dearth on the studies examining on how “effective capital” affects the quality of the surroundings. “Effective capital” is fundamental because of its ability to cater for the complementarity of capital and energy. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses the ecological footprint index to represent environmental damage, diverting from past studies that have extensively used carbon emission. The data of the European Union nations during the time 1990 to 2019 is utilized in data analysis. The contemporary method of data analysis, the Methods of Moments Quantile Regression, is employed; hence, reliable results are obtained in the presence of heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence in the indicators and model. Findings: The study findings show that effective capital is detrimental to environmental sustainability because of fossil fuel inclusion in this index. This calls for a transition by nations to clean fuels and technologies. Energy efficiency, research and development and renewable energy reduce ecological footprint. Research and development and renewable energy reduce ecological footprint in the upper quantiles, while energy efficiency reduces it in the lower and middle quantiles. Originality/value: This study is presented to foster the growing body of knowledge on the influence of effective capital on the quality of the surroundings. The research presents essential policies on how environmental sustainability is achieved through energy transition and efficient use of energy. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Heat-induced changes in the abundance of wheat Rubisco activase isoforms,"The Triticum aestivum (wheat) genome encodes three isoforms of Rubisco activase (Rca) differing in thermostability, which could be exploited to improve the resilience of this crop to global warming. We hypothesized that elevated temperatures would cause an increase in the relative abundance of heat-stable Rca1β. Wheat plants were grown at 25° C : 18°C (day : night) and exposed to heat stress (38° C : 22°C) for up to 5 d at pre-anthesis. Carbon (C) assimilation, Rubisco activity, CA1Pase activity, transcripts of Rca1β, Rca2β, and Rca2α, and the quantities of the corresponding protein products were measured during and after heat stress. The transcript of Rca1β increased 40-fold in 4 h at elevated temperatures and returned to the original level after 4 h upon return of plants to control temperatures. Rca1β comprised up to 2% of the total Rca protein in unstressed leaves but increased three-fold in leaves exposed to elevated temperatures for 5 d and remained high at 4 h after heat stress. These results show that elevated temperatures cause rapid changes in Rca gene expression and adaptive changes in Rca isoform abundance. The improved understanding of the regulation of C assimilation under heat stress will inform efforts to improve wheat productivity and climate resilience. © 2020 The Authors New Phytologist © 2020 New Phytologist Foundation",Not About Sufficiency
Agricultural ecosystems and their services: the vanguard of sustainability?,"Sustainable Development Goals offer an opportunity to improve human well-being while conserving natural resources. Ecosystem services highlight human well-being benefits ecosystems, including agricultural ecosystems, provides. Whereas agricultural systems produce the majority of our food, they drive significant environmental degradation. This tension between development and environmental conservation objectives is not an immutable outcome as agricultural systems are simultaneously dependents, and providers of ecosystem services. Recognizing this duality allows integration of environmental and development objectives and leverages agricultural ecosystem services for achieving sustainability targets. We propose a framework to operationalize ecosystem services and resilience-based interventions in agricultural landscapes and call for renewed efforts to apply resilience-based approaches to landscape management challenges and for refocusing ecosystem service research on human well-being outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Estimation of net primary productivity: An introduction to different approaches,"The net primary productivity (NPP) is defined as the net carbon gain by plants in natural and agricultural ecosystems, which is computed by subtracting the autotrophic respiration from the gross photosynthetic carbon uptake by the ecosystems. It acts as the indicators of carbon sequestration, ecosystem health, and agricultural yield which are important in the context of climate change, its impact and mitigation, and food security. The NPP can be estimated in multiple ways including the direct and indirect measurements and modelling. The various direct NPP measurements are ground-based in situ observations of ecosystem-atmosphere carbon flux such as the micrometeorological flux-gradient method, eddy covariance, flux chamber measurements etc. The indirect measurements of NPP include the satellite-derived NPP estimates which are computed from the directly measured spectral reflectances, using different biophysical relations such as the light use efficiency model etc. However the accuracy of these products varies geospatially and largely depends on the retrieval of input parameters and representativeness of underlying model parameterization. There are two major modelling approaches to estimate the NPP namely bottom-up and top-down estimates. The bottom-up models compute the NPP from the directly recorded variables such as temperature, precipitation, radiation, wind, atmospheric CO2 concentration etc. using the biome-specific functional relations due to which these are also known as the process-based models. The top-down or inverse models use the matrix inversion method to predict the sources and sinks of CO2 emission in a region from the directly measured concentrations by the surface stations and/or satellites and thus the NPP of that region. The NPP estimates from measurements and models are used to calculate the carbon budgets at different scales from ecosystem-level to global scale. However significant uncertainties exist in such estimates due to insufficient surface measurements, under-representation of several regions and ecosystems, imperfect boundary conditions and parameterizations in models. While the direct measurements provide more accurate estimates of NPP, these require to be carried over for long duration using multiple different instruments which are prone to errors and data-loss whereas the models can provide large-scale estimates of NPP but need to be validated against realistic in situ measurements across an wide array of ecosystems. The aforementioned aspects of NPP estimation are discussed in detail in the present chapter. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Local and regional-scale effects of hedgerows on grassland- and forest-associated bird populations within agroecosystems,"Linear woody features (LWFs), like hedgerows along field edges, provide wildlife habitat and support biodiversity in agroecosystems. Assessments of LWFs usually focus on community-level indices, such as species richness. However, effective conservation actions need to balance the contrasting habitat preferences of different wildlife species, necessitating a focus on population-level effects in working landscapes. We assessed associations between LWFs and abundance for 45 bird species within an intensive agroecosystem in eastern Ontario, Canada. We used distance- and removal-sampling methods across 4 years (2016–2019) to estimate local bird abundance in habitats representing a range of LWF densities. We also predicted abundance across a subset of the study region with and without LWFs to understand their contribution to regional population density. Associations between local bird abundance and LWFs were variable among species, but overall community effects were clearly positive, particularly for forest and shrubland species. At the site level, 20/45 species (44%) had higher densities associated with greater LWF presence on average, compared to 5/45 (11%) with negative associations. At the regional scale, LWFs had predicted benefits on total abundance for 31 species (69%), contributing to an estimated 20% increase on average. Positive effects were most pronounced in areas with greater agricultural land use (primarily field crops), suggesting LWFs may provide crucial habitat in heavily modified landscapes but have little to no additional benefit for the avian community in areas with greater existing heterogeneity and habitat retention. Species that responded negatively tended to be at risk with strong habitat preferences for intact forests or large, open grasslands and, thus, greater sensitivity to potential edge effects. With rapidly declining songbird populations and a global need for food security, conservation strategies that amplify biodiversity and enhance agricultural productivity through ecosystem services such as pest control, pollination, and water regulation are vital. We demonstrate the benefits of habitat heterogeneity in agroecosystems on songbird densities and highlight the need to integrate local and landscape-level assessments in conservation planning. An effective, balanced strategy includes concentrating LWFs in areas of extensive arable crops, with habitat retention patches where possible, while maintaining heterogeneity through mixtures of natural habitats and pastoral farming in less intensive regions. © 2024 The Authors.

Invasive vertebrate eradications on islands as a tool for implementing global Sustainable Development Goals,"The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development sets a framework of universal Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to address challenges to society and the planet. Island invasive species eradications have well-documented benefits that clearly align with biodiversity conservation-related SDGs, yet the value of this conservation action for socioeconomic benefits is less clear. We examine the potential for island invasive vertebrate eradications to have ecological and socioeconomic benefits. Specifically, we examine: (1) how SDGs may have been achieved through past eradications; and (2) how planned future eradications align with SDGs and associated targets. We found invasive vertebrate eradication to align with 13 SDGs and 42 associated targets encompassing marine and terrestrial biodiversity conservation, promotion of local and global partnerships, economic development, climate change mitigation, human health and sanitation and sustainable production and consumption. Past eradications on 794 islands aligned with a median of 17 targets (range 13-38) by island. Potential future eradications on 292 highly biodiverse islands could align with a median of 25 SDG targets (range 15-39) by island. This analysis enables the global community to explicitly describe the contributions that invasive vertebrate management on islands can make towards implementing the global sustainable development agenda.",Not About Sufficiency

The response of plant functional traits to aridity in a tropical dry forest,"Drylands are experiencing an overall increase in aridity that is predicted to intensify in the future due to climate change. This may cause changes in the structure and functioning of dryland ecosystems, affecting ecosystem services and human well-being. Therefore, detecting early signs of ecosystem change before irreversible damage takes place is important. Thus, here we used a space-for-time substitution approach to study the response of the plant community to aridity in a Tropical dry forest (Caatinga, Brazil), and infer potential consequences of climate change. We assessed plant functional structure using the community weighted mean (CWM) and functional diversity, measured through functional dispersion (FDis), along a 700 km climatic gradient. We studied 13 functional traits, reflecting strategies associated with establishment, defense, regeneration, and dispersal of the most abundant 48 plant species in 113 sampling sites. Spearman correlations were used to test the relation between aridity and single-trait functional metrics. Aridity was a major environmental filter of the plant community functional structure. We found a higher abundance of species with deciduous leaves, zoochorous dispersal, fleshy fruits, chemical defense exudation and spinescence, and crassulacean acid metabolism towards more arid sites, at the expense of species with evergreen and thicker leaves, autochory dispersal, and shrub growth-form. The FDis of leaf type and thickness decreased with aridity, whereas FDis of fruit type, photosynthetic pathway, and defense strategies increased. Our findings provide functional indicators to early detect climate change impacts on Caatinga structure and functioning, to timely adopt preventive measures (e.g. conservation of forest remnants) and restoration actions (e.g. introduction of species with specific functional traits) in this threatened and unique ecosystem. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Case studies in America on carbon management and sequestration in agriculture,"Agriculture, energy, and the environment are interdependent dimensions essential for agro-ecosystem sustainability. This chapter focuses on biomass carbon (C)-based practices as the primary pathway to develop resilient, regenerative, proftable, and environmentally friendly production systems. It includes case studies on C balance with biomass-C inputs across production systems in South and North America. The case studies include no-till production systems in Brazil, diverse cropping practices in the western United States, and long-term crop rotation systems experiments in Uruguay. Adopting, expanding, and consolidating C management practices will be the most prominent challenge farmers will face in the coming years worldwide. These case studies provide the consistent message that C management and soil health-oriented practices are central to implementing transitions of farming systems to become both sustainable and carbon-neutral. Cutting-edge technologies enhancing C capture and greenhouse gas sequestration, providing ecosystem services, and maximizing soil-water storage contribute to climate change mitigation and improved food security. © CAB International 2024.

From functional diversity to human well-being: A conceptual framework for agroecosystem sustainability,"CONTEXT: Agricultural intensification contributes to global food security and well-being by supplying the food demand of a growing human population. However, ongoing land-use change and intensification seriously affect the abundance, diversity and distribution of species, besides many other impacts, thereby threatening the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. Despite the accumulating evidence that the current agricultural model is unsustainable, we are far from understanding the consequences of functional diversity loss for functioning and ecosystem service supply and the potential long-term threats to food security and human well-being.OBJECTIVE: In this review, we propose a conceptual framework to understand the relationships between func-tional diversity and human well-being that also considers agroecosystem health. To this end, we identify the most commonly assumed relationships linking functional diversity to regulating and provisioning agroecosystem services and their importance for human well-being, emphasising the most serious knowledge gaps in the in-dividual pathways of the conceptual framework.METHODS: A consortium formed by an international panel of experts from different disciplines including functional diversity, ecosystem services and human health compiled 275 articles. Members of the consortium proposed literature to exemplify each specific aspect of the conceptual framework in the text, in accordance with his/her field of expertise. The guideline for all experts was to focus mostly in current literature (38% of the references are from the last 5 years and 66% from the last decade), with special interest in reviews and synthesis articles (42% of the references), as well as meta-analyses and global studies (10% of the references).RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The factors that influence agroecosystem health are extremely complex, involving both services and disservices related to land-use management and environmental conditions. The global human population needs sustainable and resilient agroecosystems and a concerted effort is needed to fundamentally redesign agricultural practices to feed the growing human population without further jeopardising the quality of life for future generations. We highlight the potential effects of land-use change and ecological intensification on the functional diversity of plant and animal communities, and the resulting consequences for ecosystem services and ultimately human health. SIGNIFICANCE: The resulting conceptual model is developed for researchers as well as policy makers high-lighting the need for a holistic approach to understand diversity impacts on human well-being. Finally, we document a major knowledge gap due to the lack of any studies focusing on the full pathway from diversity to human well-being.",Not About Sufficiency
"Protected areas as tools to strengthen the connections between science, management and society","Protected areas are the most tried and tested tools for biodiversity conservation, although biodiversity continues to decline worldwide. Their original concept has evolved to incorporate territorial, social and economic aspects into the original conservation objectives. Global change is accelerating the need for a more holistic and innovative approach to their planning and management. The transfer of scientific knowledge to decision making and the involvement of society are crucial. This article reviews the current needs to improve the multiple objectives of protected areas taking as a framework the ""Society and Protected Areas Programme: protected areas for human well-being"" promoted by EUROPARC-Spain and the Fernando Gonzalez Bernaldez Foundation. The eight strategic lines in which this Program is developed (Integration of protected areas in the territory. Ecosystem services for human well-being. Transfer of scientific knowledge to management. Strategic communication to increase social and political support. Diversification of governance models. Diversification of financing models. Greening of sectoral policies. Global responsibility and international cooperation) have as a link of union the territorial integration without which the functions of conservation of the intrinsic values of nature are very difficult to achieve.

LAND-USE INTENSIFICATION TRENDS IN THE RIO DE LA PLATA REGION OF SOUTH AMERICA: TOWARD SPECIALIZATION OR RECOUPLING CROP AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION,"The Rio de la Plata region comprises central Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil. Modern agriculture developed around 1900 with recent decades being characterized by the advance of cropping areas over native grasslands. Highly specialized agriculture has decoupled crop and livestock production but has succeeded in intensifying yields. However, significant losses of ecosystem services have been reported. Thus, questions have been raised on the sustainability of this pathway. A glance at world regions that have experienced similar trends suggests that an urgent course correction is needed. A major concern has been the lack of diversity in regions with highly specialized agriculture, promoting renewed interest in integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS), not only because ICLS are more diverse than specialized systems, but also because they are rare examples of reconciliation between agroecosystem intensification and environmental quality. Consequently, this paper discusses alternatives to redesign multifunctional landscapes based on ICLS. Recent data provide evidence that recoupling crop and animal production increases the resilience of nutrient cycling functions and economic indicators to external stressors, enabling these systems to face climate-market uncertainty and reconcile food production with the provision of diverse ecosystem services. Finally, these concepts are exemplified in case studies where this perspective has been successfully applied.",Not About Sufficiency
"Long-term effects of crop succession, soil tillage and climate on wheat yield and soil properties","Climate change is increasing crop losses and yield variability with impacts for global food security. In this context, conservation agriculture appears as a potential solution to maintain crop productivity, soil fertility and environmental sustainability. Therefore, understanding the combined effects of soil tillage and crop succession over a long period is of primary interest. In this study, we analyzed data from a 50 year long-term field experiment to assess (i) the change of climatic parameters, wheat yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) content; (ii) the combined effects of crop succession (monoculture vs. crop rotation) and soil tillage system (minimum tillage vs. plough) on wheat yield, SOC content and other soil properties at three soil depths (0–10, 10–20 and 20–50 cm); and (iii) the relative contributions of climatic parameters, wheat phenology and agricultural practices on wheat yield variability. Wheat yield was 16% higher in crop rotation compared to monoculture, while soil tillage system had no significant effect on wheat yield during the period 1977–2016. Despite a SOC content decline over time, which was especially marked during the first ten years of the study, SOC content was 7% higher in the minimum tillage treatment compared to the plough treatment, while crop rotation had no significant effect. In 2016, after 50 years of experimentation, both crop succession and soil tillage systems influenced soil properties. Over the 50-year period, the climatic conditions around the heading phase explained 22% of yield variability, while 18% of this variability was explained by crop succession and 6% by the growing degree days until heading stage. In a context of conservation agriculture promotion, our long-term field experiment provides key evidence that the combination of both minimum soil tillage and crop rotation improves soil fertility and crop productivity. © 2019 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Applying the ecosystem services concept to poverty alleviation: the need to disaggregate human well-being,"The concept of ecosystem services (ES), the benefits humans derive from ecosystems, is increasingly applied to environmental conservation, human wellbeing and poverty alleviation, and to inform the development of interventions. Payments for ecosystem services (PES) implicitly recognize the unequal distribution of the costs and benefits of maintaining ES, through monetary compensation from 'winners' to 'losers'. Some research into PES has examined how such schemes affect poverty, while other literature addresses trade-offs between different ES. However, much evolving ES literature adopts an aggregated perspective of humans and their well-being, which can disregard critical issues for poverty alleviation. This paper identifies four issues with examples from coastal ES in developing countries. First, different groups derive well-being benefits from different ES, creating winners and losers as ES, change. Second, dynamic mechanisms of access determine who can benefit. Third, individuals' contexts and needs determine how ES contribute to well-being. Fourth, aggregated analyses may neglect crucial poverty alleviation mechanisms such as cash-based livelihoods. To inform the development of ES interventions that contribute to poverty alleviation, disaggregated analysis is needed that focuses on who derives which benefits from ecosystems, and how such benefits contribute to the well-being of the poor. These issues present challenges in data availability and selection of how and at which scales to disaggregate. Disaggregation can be applied spatially, but should also include social groupings, such as gender, age and ethnicity, and is most important where inequality is greatest. Existing tools, such as stakeholder analysis and equity weights, can improve the relevance of ES research to poverty alleviation.",Not About Sufficiency
Linking soil health and ecological resilience to achieve agricultural sustainability,"Healthy soil is critical for global food security and other essential ecosystem services but is threatened by processes of soil degradation, with at least 33% of global croplands estimated to be moderately or highly degraded. Current soil health assessments provide insight into soil functional performance but often lack diagnostic criteria that assess management effects on soil function over time. We propose integrating soil health assessments with ecological resilience theory, which includes attributes of latitude, resistance, and precariousness, to provide a conceptual framework for understanding management impacts on soil function and agricultural sustainability. Here we explore this conceptual framework using the Palouse River watershed of the US Pacific Northwest as a working example, as the soil degradation problems of erosion, organic matter loss, and acidification experienced in this region have worldwide relevance. We demonstrate how increasing agroecological management options, or adaptive capacity, can help reverse soil degradation and minimize the effects of climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
"Bioenergy from ""surplus"" land: Environmental and socio-economic implications","The increasing demand for biomass for the production of bioenergy is generating land-use conflicts. These conflicts might be solved through spatial segregation of food/feed and energy producing areas by continuing producing food on established and productive agricultural land while growing dedicated energy crops on so called ""surplus"" land. Ambiguity in the definition and characterization of surplus land as well as uncertainty in assessments of land availability and of future bioenergy potentials is causing confusion about the prospects and the environmental and socio-economic implications of bioenergy development in those areas. The high level of uncertainty is due to environmental, economic and social constraints not yet taken into account and to the potentials offered by those novel crops and their production methods not being fully exploited. This paper provides a scientific background in support of a reassessment of land available for bioenergy production by clarifying the terminology, identifying constraints and options for an efficient bioenergy-use of surplus land and providing policy recommendations for resolving conflicting land-use demands. A serious approach to factoring in the constraints, combined with creativity in utilizing the options provided, in our opinion, would lead to a more sustainable and efficient development of the bioenergy sector. Unless the sustainability challenge is mastered, the interdependent policy objectives of mitigating climate change, obtaining independence from fossil fuels, feeding and fuelling a growing human world population and maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services will not be met. Despite the advanced developments of bioenergy, we still see regional solutions for designing and establishing sustainable bioenergy production systems with optimized production resulting in social, economic and ecological benefits. Where bioenergy production has been identified as the most suitable option to overcome the given problems of energy security and climate change mitigation, we need to determine which bioenergy cultivation systems are most suitable for the respective types of surplus land, by taking into account issues such as yields, inputs and costs, as well as potential environmental and socio-economic impacts. © Jens Dauber et al.",Not About Sufficiency
"Environmental cost of natural resources, globalization, and economic policy uncertainty in the G-7 bloc: do human capital and renewable energy matter?","The panel of G-7 economies is considered one of the most prosperous economies, endowed with abundant natural and renewable energy resources. Due to their richness in these resources, most economic development and activities, including environmental and economic aspects, depend on and are determined by energy consumption and natural resource rents. However, the increasing dependence of G-7 economies on energy consumption and natural resources raises questions about their long-term growth and ecological policies towards achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Therefore, the main objective of this study is to examine the influence of natural resources, renewable energy, economic policy uncertainty, human capital, and globalization on the ecological footprint in the panel of G-7 economies from 1990 to 2020. After confirming the cross-sectional dependence issue, this study applied second-generation panel data approaches to estimate robust and reliable outcomes. The estimated evidence from this study discovered that natural resources, globalization processes, and economic policy uncertainty significantly increase the level of ecological footprint in the region. In contrast, renewable energy and human capital provide feasible solutions for ecological improvement in the study area. Likewise, the interactive role of renewable energy with economic policy uncertainty significantly protects the environmental quality in the study area. Based on the estimated findings, this study recommends various achievable policy options for policymakers and the governments of these economies to ensure environmental sustainability. © 2023.

North East (NE) India is blessed as a biodiversity hotspot, being also home to around 150 ethnic tribes with diverse ethical, cultural and traditional beliefs, endorsing the region as a cultural paradise rich in natural resources and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). Conversely, the severely constrained nature of TEK, has juxtaposed TEK practices and sustainable natural resources management (NRM) in this review. Deliberating on the broader perspectives of TEK and ensuing practices, we have identified twelve sustainable development goals (SDGs) which are directly correlated to the TEK and practices of NE region. This review has meticulously detailed TEK and practices that can help in achieving various sustainable development targets of different SDGs in a more comprehensive and eco-friendly manner. Houde’s manifestation to differentiate each element of TEK and practices present in the NE region of the country, such as traditional farming and irrigation systems, sacred groves, and cultural belief systems of different tribes, have been systematically analyzed and documented for each of the eight states of this region. The benefits accrued modern practices related to NRM are correlated with TEK, or adaptive empirical knowledge system. Indigenous agricultural systems, watershed management, biodiversity conservation, and ethnomedicinal therapeutic systems in NE India formed a vital part of the review. However, rapid urbanization, industrialization, and deforestation warrant an urgent need to systematically collate, document, analyze, and conserve the TEK of the indigenous communities of NE India. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency

Scale dependency of trade-offs/synergies analysis of ecosystem services based on Bayesian Belief Networks: A case of the Yellow River Basin,"In recent years, climate change and human activities have reduced various ecosystem services (ESs). Analyzing trade-offs/synergies among ESs is crucial for ecosystem sustainability and human well-being. Many studies overlook potential scale effects by focusing on a single scale. We addressed this by evaluating ESs - grain production (GP), habitat quality (HQ), carbon sequestration (CS), soil conservation (SC), and water yield (WY) - in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) from 1990 to 2020, using Bayesian belief networks to analyze their drivers and relationships across scales. The study revealed a steady increase in GP, while both CS and SC exhibited fluctuating upward trends, and HQ and WY experienced downward trends. Significant spatial heterogeneity was observed, with GP decreasing from east to west, and WY, CS, and SC decreasing from northeast to southwest. HQ values were generally high but lower in specific downstream and upstream locations. Key factors influencing these ESs included land use, slope, population, evapotranspiration, NDVI, and precipitation. As the spatial scale expanded, the influence of these factors diminished. The relationships among ESs primarily reflected synergies. However, with the spatial scale increased, trade-offs/synergies among ESs weakened, and several relationships transitioned between trade-offs and synergies.

The conservation objectives of protected areas have shifted from a narrow emphasis on biodiversity to encompass broader considerations such as ecosystem stability, community resilience to climate change, and enhancement of human well-being. Given these multifaceted objectives, it is imperative to judiciously allocate resources to effectively conserve biodiversity by identifying strategically significant areas for conservation, particularly for mountainous areas. In this study, we evaluated the representativeness of the protected area network in the Qinling Mountains concerning species diversity, ecosystem services, climate stability and ecological stability. The results indicate that some of the ecological indicators are spatially correlated with topographic gradient effects. The conservation priority areas predominantly lie in the northern foothills, the southeastern, and southwestern parts of the Qinling Mountain with areas concentrated at altitudes between 1,500–2,000 m and slopes between 40°–50° as hotspots. The conservation priority areas identified through the framework of inclusive conservation optimization account for 22.9 % of the Qinling Mountain. Existing protected areas comprise only 6.1 % of the Qinling Mountain and 13.18 % of the conservation priority areas. This will play an important role in achieving sustainable development in the region and in meeting the post-2020 biodiversity target. The framework can advance the different objectives of achieving a quadruple win and can also be extended to other regions. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
What Personal and Environmental Factors Determine Frequency of Urban Greenspace Use?,"For many people, urban greenspaces are the only places where they encounter the natural world. This is concerning as there is growing evidence demonstrating that human well-being is enhanced by exposure to nature. There is, therefore, a compelling argument to increase how frequently people use urban greenspaces. This may be achieved in two complementary ways by encouraging: (I) non-users to start visiting urban greenspaces; (II) existing users to visit more often. Here we examine the factors that influence frequency of greenspace visitation in the city of Sheffield, England. We demonstrate that people who visit a site least frequently state lower self-reported psychological well-being. We hypothesised that a combination of socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, and the biophysical attributes of the greenspaces that they were visiting, would be important in influencing visit frequency. However, socio-demographic characteristics (income, age, gender) were not found to be predictors. In contrast, some biophysical attributes of greenspaces were significantly related to use frequency. Frequent use was more likely when the time taken to reach a greenspace was shorter and for sites with a higher index of greenspace neglect, but were unrelated to tree cover or bird species richness. We related these results to the motivations that people provide for their visits. Infrequent users were more likely to state motivations associated with the quality of the space, while frequent users gave motivations pertaining to physical, repeated activities. This suggests that there may be no simple way to manage greenspaces to maximise their use across user cohorts as the motivations for visits are very different.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards Effective Multilevel Environmental and Sustainability Governance for Shared Ecological Risks,"Climate change; the collapse of biodiversity and ecosystem services; multiple forms of pollution, including plastic; and other environmental pressures on the planetary ecosystem are combining into an existential risk to human well-being and even survival on this planet. It is obvious that the gap in effective global environmental governance to remain within planetary boundaries is part of the problem, and there are proposals to address this, including the creation of a Global Environment Agency. National action also needs to be reinforced against the pressure of economic actors intent on short-term profit from resource exploitation and pollution. Then more needs to be done to empower local communities with the capacity and knowledge to manage their own environmental resources sustainably. Mechanisms should be created to build coherence across these levels. Beyond this, the present measures of progress in financial terms, including gross domestic product (GDP), must be replaced by science-based non-financial integrated accounting for the climate system, sustainable energy supplies, biosphere integrity, pollution reduction, a regenerative food system, the integration of nature and culture, and the comprehensive use of human capacities in healthy communities. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Augusto Lopez-Claros; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change vis-a-vis saline agriculture: Impact and adaptation strategies,"During the last two decades, the world has recognized that the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases (GHGs), namely, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), have increased markedly as a result of human activities. During pre-industrial era (1750 AD), their concentrations were 280 ppm, 715 ppb and 270 ppb, respectively, and these values have increased to 385 ppm, 1797 ppb and 322 ppb, respectively, in 2008. Increase in atmospheric CO2 promotes growth and productivity of plants with C3 photosynthetic pathway, but the increase in temperature, on the other hand, can reduce crop duration, increase crop respiration rates, affect the survival and distribution of pest populations and may hasten nutrient mineralization in soil, decrease fertilizer use efficiency and increase evapotranspiration and soil salinity. The water resources which are already scarce may come under enhanced stress. In the scenario of sea-level rise due to climate change, the inundated area with sea water will increase influencing the crop production due to higher salinity. Thus, the impact of climate change is likely to have a significant influence on agriculture and eventually on the food security and livelihoods of a large section of the rural population. There are evidences of negative impacts on yield of crops with variable magnitude in diverse ecologies including soil salinity and waterlogging particularly in the developing countries. Adaptation strategies and mitigation through perennial cropping systems such as agroforestry can be the main approach in handling climate change and salinity-related problems. Upscaling of modern technologies such as conservation and smart agriculture, judicious utilization of available water (including poorquality water) for agriculture through micro-irrigation and water-saving technologies, developing multiple stress-tolerant crops through molecular biological tools, restoration of degraded soils and waters, promoting carbon sequestration preferably through efficient agroforestry practices and conservation of biodiversity should be promoted at regional and country level. We need to formulate both short-term and long-term policies for improvement, sustenance and protection of natural resources. There is a need of capacity building and international collaboration in developing database for efficient weather forecasting and handling salinity-related problems and preparing contingency plans for vulnerable areas. The objectives of this paper are to summarize the information available on the mitigation options and adaptation strategies for climate change and rehabilitation of saline and waterlogged habitats to meet the food security especially in India. © Springer India 2016.",Not About Sufficiency
Serviços Ecossistêmicos e a Potencialidade da Flora do Cerrado,"Ecosystem services (ES), or environmental services, are considered the goods and services that we obtain from ecosystems directly or indirectly, being essential for human well-being. This is useful for evaluating the relationship between man and nature, and also their ability to conserve natural resources. Among the benefits offered by SEs are cultural, support, regulation and provision services, highlighting the medicinal resources provided by flora for the latter. The objective of this study was to carry out a theoretical approach to the conceptualization and classification of ES, highlighting the potential of the Cerrado flora in providing these services. The methodology used in this study was a systematic bibliographic review of the quantitative and qualitative production on the topic over the last twenty years. When considering the potential of the biodiversity of Brazilian biomes, mainly the Cerrado biome, it is clear that it is capable of providing environmental goods and services from its ES, among which the important service of providing plant species, including those already cataloged and those potentially useful for medicinal purposes, however, the loss of Cerrado biodiversity, due to the continuous process of occupation of this biome, has direct consequences for its degradation and, consequently, the disappearance of several ecosystem services © 2021 by the authors.

"Natural woodlands hold more diverse, abundant, and unique biota than novel anthropogenic forests: a multi-group assessment","Biodiversity sustained by natural ecosystems, particularly forests, provides ecosystem services essential to human well-being. However, many forests have been severely transformed, notably via monospecific plantations and the spread of invasive species. Given the extension of these novel anthropogenic forests (plantations and invasive copses), it is critical to know how they can support forest biodiversity, particularly in highly humanized biodiversity hotspots as the southwest Mediterranean Europe. Because the effects likely vary across taxonomic groups, such assessments require an integrative multi-group approach. Here, we evaluated the abundance, richness, and composition of shrubs, herbs, macrofungi, ground and flying arthropods, birds, small mammals, carnivores, and bats across the four most common forest types in Central Portugal, namely: natural oak woodlands (dominated by Quercus faginea Lam.) and anthropogenic forests, invasive Acacia dealbata Link copses, Pinus pinaster Aiton plantations (native), and Eucalyptus globulus Labill. plantations (exotic). Oak woodlands sustained higher abundance, diversity, and a unique species composition compared to the other forests, especially those dominated by exotic species. The greatest changes in biodiversity occurred in herbs and birds. Contrary to our expectations, species richness and composition of macrofungi and carnivores in acacia copses were similar to those of oak woodlands, revealing that groups respond differently to forest changes. The large-scale replacement of natural forests by novel anthropogenic forests has significant negative impacts in most, but not all groups, which should be actively considered for integrative conservation strategies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency

How stakeholder interactions can reduce space for moral considerations in decision making: A contested CCS project in the Netherlands,"We analyse the dynamics of a decision-making process on a contested carbon capture and storage project in The Netherlands by investigating the interactions between the involved stakeholders and how these reinforced, or were shaped by, a meta-frame. Our analysis suggests that from the start of the project, the interactions between stakeholders were shaped by, and reinforced, a goal-rational meta-frame. This frame, and the respective interactions, did not function well in aligning project proponents and the local community. For the latter group, issues were at stake that could not be addressed within the goalrational frame, such as moral considerations of procedural and distributive justice. Yet it was a very powerful frame that remained dominant and kept being reproduced throughout the process. Our analysis suggests that policy processes on projects like this should create interactions that leave open the opportunity for divergent, latent frames to become articulated. We identify three challenges for policy and planning of low-carbon technologies concerning the need for frame reflexivity in planning and decision making, the articulation of divergent stakeholder views and the design of stakeholder interactions. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",Not About Sufficiency
Agriculture Growth and Environmental Degradation in Vietnam: Do Natural Resources Play a Vital Role in this Regard,"The growth of agriculture in Vietnam has significantly transformed the country’s socio-economic landscape, enhancing food security and boosting agricultural exports. However, this growth has also emerged as a leading contributor to environmental degradation. Additionally, Vietnam’s rich natural resources, while facilitating economic development, have similarly played a pivotal role in environmental challenges. Therefore, it is essential to re-evaluate the interplay between agricultural growth, natural resource exploitation, and environmental degradation. To address this, the current study employs the conventional STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) framework to analyse the effects of agricultural growth and natural resources on environmental degradation, operationalized through CO2 emissions in Vietnam from 1990 to 2020. The research not only aims to estimate the direct impacts of these variables but also investigates the moderating influence of natural resources on the relationship between agricultural growth and environmental degradation. The methodology employed is the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Bound Test approach, which allows for an assessment of both short-term and long-term relationships among the variables. The findings indicate that agricultural growth exerts a positive and significant impact on CO2 emissions in both the short and long term. Conversely, the influence of natural resources on CO2 emissions is found to be statistically significant and positive only in the short term. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that the moderating effect of natural resources on the relationship between agricultural growth and CO2 emissions is negative but statistically insignificant in both the short and long term. In light of these findings, the study suggests several policy recommendations aimed at achieving environmental sustainability in Vietnam. These policies are designed to balance agricultural development with environmental conservation, ensuring that the benefits of economic growth do not come at the expense of ecological health. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of how agricultural practices and natural resource management impact environmental outcomes in Vietnam, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches to promote sustainable development. © 2024 AgBioForum",Not About Sufficiency
Lifecycle implications and mechanical properties of carbonated biomass ashes as carbon-storing supplementary cementitious materials,"Methods to sequester and store atmospheric CO2 are critical to combat climate change. Alkaline-rich bioashes are potential carbon fixing materials. This work investigates potential co-benefits from mineralizing carbon in biomass ashes and partially replacing high embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) Portland cement (PC) in cement-based materials with these ashes. Specifically, rice hull ash (RHA), wheat straw ash (WSA), and sugarcane bagasse ash (SBA) were treated to mineralize carbon, and their experimental carbon content was compared to modeled potential carbonation. To understand changes in the cement-based storage materials, mortars made with CO2-treated WSA and RHA were experimentally compared to PC-only mortars and mortars made with ashes without prior CO2 treatment. Life cycle assessment methodology was applied to understand potential reductions in GHG emissions. The modeled carbonation was ∼18 g-CO2/kg-RHA and ∼180 g-CO2/kg-WSA. Ashes oxidized at 500 °C had the largest measured carbon content (5.4 g-carbon/kg-RHA and 35.3 g-carbon/kg-WSA). This carbon appeared to be predominantly residual from the biomass. Isothermal calorimetry showed RHA-PC pastes had similar heat of hydration to PC-pastes, while WSA-PC pastes exhibited an early (at ∼1.5 min) endothermic dip. Mortars with 5 % and 15 % RHA replacement had 1–12 % higher compressive strength at 28 days than PC-only mortars, and milled WSA mortars with 5 % replacement had 3 % higher strength. A loss in strength was noted for the milled 15 % WSA, the CO2-treated 5 %, and the 15 % WSA mortars. Modeled reductions in GHG emissions from CO2-treated ashes were, however, marginal (<1 %) relative to the untreated ashes. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Building just and sustainable cities through government housing developments,"While government housing can raise living standards for the urban poor, it has environmental impacts and contributes to urban resource consumption. In Gauteng Province, South Africa, government housing aims to improve quality of life, reduce poverty and inequality, and transform unsustainable urban forms. This paper draws on survey and interview data to explore the social justice and environmental sustainability outcomes of Gauteng’s government housing programmes. The data reveal improved access to basic services and amenities. However, the developments tend to be poorly located with regard to economic opportunities, and residents are forced to explore other income generation opportunities. This paper highlights the complex interplay between justice and sustainability, where the outcomes are aligned in some instances and conflictual in others. It points to the need to move beyond linear, reductionist relationships between justice and sustainability to further the conceptual understanding of their interlinkages. © 2020 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).",Not About Sufficiency
Between vision and implementation: the exclusionary disjuncture of domestic heat decarbonisation in Greater Manchester,"Decarbonising heat is critical for achieving climate change targets and reducing CO2 emissions. The U.K. Government has outlined actions to support the decarbonisation of heat, emphasising the importance of a place-based approach and undertaking action at localised scales. This paper focuses on Greater Manchester, a city region in North West England, with a strategic vision of achieving carbon neutrality by 2038. To support the achievement of this vision, Local Area Energy Plans (LAEPs) have been developed for the city region’s 10 local authorities with this providing a useful case study for understanding the challenges of implementing localised, place-based domestic heat decarbonisation actions. Drawing upon 34 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders associated with Greater Manchester’s low-carbon agenda, this paper discusses the disjuncture between Greater Manchester’s vision for domestic heat decarbonisation and the implementation of the actions outlined. Three sites have been identified where the disjuncture between the strategic vision and its implementation materialises. Each of these sites of disjuncture–priorities and needs, procurement, and shifting heating expectations and practices–are discussed in turn. The disjuncture present is shown to exclude certain members of society from engaging in decarbonisation practices, and acts as a barrier to the achievement of Greater Manchester’s vision for domestic heat decarbonisation. This paper advances understandings on the barriers to achieving place-based decarbonisation visions, and furthers the conceptualisation of ‘just transitions’. The identification of sites of disjuncture can be applied to other strategic visions and their implementation. © 2023 The Author(s).

Disentangling trade-offs and synergies around ecosystem services with the influence network framework: Illustration from a consultative process over the French Alps,"An important aspect of sustainability is to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functioning while improving human well-being. For this, the ecosystem service (ES) approach has the potential to bridge the still existing gap between ecological management and social development, especially by focusing on trade-offs and synergies between ES and between their beneficiaries. Several frameworks have been proposed to account for trade-offs and synergies between ES, and between ES and other components of socialecological systems. However, to date, insufficient explicit attention has been paid to the three facets encompassed in the ES concept, namely potential supply, demand, and use, leading to incomplete descriptions of ES interactions. We expand on previous frameworks by proposing a new influence network framework (INF) based on an explicit consideration of influence relationships between these three ES facets, biodiversity, and external driving variables. We tested its ability to provide a comprehensive view of complex socialecological interactions around ES through a consultative process focused on environmental management in the French Alps. We synthetized the interactions mentioned during this consultative process and grouped variables according to their overall propensity to influence or be influenced by the system. The resulting directed sequence of influences distinguished between: (1) mostly influential variables (dynamic social variables and ecological state variables), (2) target variables (provisioning and cultural services), and (3) mostly impacted variables (regulating services and biodiversity parameters). We discussed possible reasons for the discrepancies between actual and perceived influences and proposed options to overcome them. We demonstrated that the INF holds the potential to deliver collective assessments of ES relations by: (1) including ecological as well as social aspects, (2) providing opportunities for colearning processes between stakeholder groups, and (3) supporting communication about complex social-ecological systems and consequences for environmental management. © 2016 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Geophysical controls on metabolic cycling in three Patagonian fjords,"Biogeochemical cycling in fjords underpins crucial environmental and economic functions including carbon sequestration and food security, and a fundamental understanding of the controls on these cycles is essential for sustainable management of fjords that are facing increasing climate and anthropogenic stressors. However, the interaction of external forcing and local geomorphology in fjords leads to complex coupling that is challenging to measure using traditional methods, particularly in a connected coastal system like the Chiloe Inland Sea (CIS) in northern Patagonia. This study resolves key functional differences between the three major fjords (Reloncavi, Comau and Ren & SIM;ihue) in the CIS using high-resolution sampling of surface waters integrated with regional oceanographic and meteorological observations, models and historic data. The dominant geophysical control varied among the three fjords: river input in Reloncavi Fjord, synoptic winds in Comau Fjord and tidal forcing in Ren & SIM;ihue Fjord. Variable geomorphic characteristics, e.g., orientation and the location of the riverine input, resulted in contrasting physical-metabolic responses between fjords to otherwise similar meteorological and oceanic forcing conditions. Each fjord's relative location and degree of connectivity to the CIS influenced its internal metabolic balance over synoptic to seasonal scales. In Comau Fjord, the salt fingering form of double diffusive mixing was linked to vertical density structure and wind forcing in the northern CIS; consistent trends in historical data suggest that salt fingering may be an important mechanism for delivery of nutrients to the euphotic zone. The highest metabolic rates in the study region occurred in Ren & SIM;ihue Fjord and were linked to vertical mixing of nutrient-rich waters to the surface in the central CIS. Climate change is predicted to result in decreasing river discharge and weakening zonal winds in northern Patagonia. Therefore, the functional re-lationships observed in this study imply-two key impacts of these altered forcing conditions in coming decades: 1) a lateral shift in the transfer of planktonic carbon to coastal sediments, i.e., moving landward from the CIS into fjords, and 2) greater biogeochemical variability in fjord surface waters, which will present greater management challenges for aquaculture.",Not About Sufficiency
How the Nitrogen Economy of a Perennial Cereal-Legume Intercrop Affects Productivity: Can Synchrony Be Achieved?,"The UN's Sustainable Development goal of Zero Hunger encompasses a holistic set of targets that range from ending hunger by 2030, to increasing environmental sustainability and resilience of food production. Securing and managing soil nutrients remains one of the most basic challenges to growing adequate food while simultaneously protecting biodiversity and the integrity of ecosystems. To achieve these objectives, it is increasingly clear that the management of ecological processes will need to supplant reliance on non-renewable and environmentally damaging inputs. In recent years, progress has been made in developing perennial grain crops that show promise to improve on a range of ecological functions such as efficient nitrogen cycling and soil carbon accretion that tend to be well-developed in natural ecosystems but become compromised following land conversion to row crop agriculture. Here we report on a multi-faceted, 5-year experiment in which intermediate wheatgrass (IWG) (Thinopyrum intermedium), a perennial relative of wheat that is bred to produce the grain Kernza®, was intercropped in alternating rows with the perennial legume alfalfa (Medicago sativa). The performance of the unfertilized intercrop was compared to monocropped IWG treatments, with and without urea-N applications, planted at two row densities such that the intercrop could be interpreted as either an addition or substitution design. Comparisons of relative IWG yields (RYs) in the intercrop with unfertilized monocrops suggest net competitive interactions between alfalfa and IWG in the establishment year, followed by increasing degrees of facilitation over the next 4 years. Evidence from N fertilizer responsiveness, SPAD readings, net N mineralization assays, and N balance calculations suggest that alfalfa contributed to an aggrading pool of soil organic nitrogen over the course of the experiment. Comparisons of grain RYs of intercropped IWG and fertilized IWG monocultures suggest N-limitation in the first half of the experiment, and N sufficiency in the second half. Grain yields in the intercrop did not decline significantly over 5 years in contrast to all IWG monocrop treatments that did significantly decline. This study contributes to a growing literature on approaches to ecological nutrient management that incorporate diversity and perenniality to increase food security and resilience.

Representing crop rotations in life cycle assessment: a review of legume LCA studies,"Purpose: There is an imperative to accurately assess the environmental sustainability of crop system interventions in the context of food security and climate change. Previous studies have indicated that the incorporation of legumes into cereal rotations could reduce overall environmental burdens from cropping systems. However, most life cycle assessment (LCA) studies focus on individual crops and miss environmental consequences of inter-annual crop sequence and nutrient cycling effects. This review investigates state-of-the-art representation of inter-crop rotation effects within legume LCA studies. Methods: A literature review was undertaken, starting with a search for all peer-reviewed articles with combinations of ‘LCA’, ‘legumes’ and ‘rotations’ or synonyms thereof. In total, 3180 articles were obtained. Articles were screened for compliance with all of the following requirements: (i) reporting results based on LCA or life cycle inventory methodology; (ii) inclusion of (a) legume(s); (iii) the legume(s) is/are analysed within the context of a wider cropping system (i.e. rotation or intercropping). Seventy articles satisfying these requirements were analysed. Results and discussion: We identified three broad approaches to legume LCA. Most studies involved simple attributional LCA disregarding important interactions across years and crops in rotations. N-fertilizer reduction through legume residue N carryover is either disregarded or the benefit is attributed to the following crop in such studies, whilst N leaching burdens from residues are usually attributed to the legume crop. Some studies applied robust allocation approaches and/or complex functional units to enable analysis of entire rotation sequences, accounting for nutrient cycling and break crop effects. Finally, a few studies applied consequential LCA to identify downstream substitution effects, though these studies did not simultaneously account for agronomic effects of rotational sequence changes. Conclusions: We recommend that LCA studies for legume cropping systems should (i) evaluate entire rotations; (ii) represent nitrogen and ideally carbon cycling; (iii) for attributional studies, define at least two functional units, where one should encompass the multifunctional outputs of an entire rotation and the other should enable product footprints to be calculated; (iv) for CLCA studies, account for both agronomic changes in rotations and markets effects; (v) include impact categories that reflect hotspots for agricultural production. © 2020, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Going beyond Gross Domestic Product as an indicator to bring coherence to the Sustainable Development Goals,"The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) comprise an important policy achievement towards identifying shared goals for addressing global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss. Though policy coherence for sustainable development ultimately depends on coherence among the SDGs – as progress toward one goal should not hamper progress toward others – synergies and trade-offs are emerging among the metrics (indicators) used to measure progress towards the various targets of the SDGs. In this context, the choice of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita as an indicator for SDG 8 (“Decent Work and Economic Growth”) contradicts the evidence that limitless economic growth is not possible on a planet with finite resources. Here, we highlight how pursuing unconditional GDP growth risks failing to achieve the SDGs overall. We show how, in the European Union, GDP is unrelated to other measures of economic performance such as levels of employment, and relates inversely to indicators of environmental sustainability and broader measures of wellbeing. Pursuing SDG 8 through a continuous increase in GDP will therefore hinder the achievement of environmental goals and goals on reducing inequalities. We propose guidelines for selecting alternative indicators for SDG 8 with the aim of improving coherence among all of the SDGs, as well as between the SDGs and other policy initiatives for sustainability. This will inform a better monitoring of SDG 8 and the definition of post-2030 Agendas for sustainable development. © 2019 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
A polarising issue: Wild animals as food,"Using wild animals as food is controversial, but remains a widespread practice globally, and in some places wild meat is fundamental for food security. Hunting wild animals for food is widely unsustainable and in many places is driving alarming declines, particularly of large mammals. In general this occurs under governance regimes that fail to provide any practical incentives to users to limit their exploitation and develop sustainable management. However, use of wild species for food alongside other values can underpin successful models of robust and sustainable management - these depend on developing both clear incentives and adequate capacity to enable sustainable use. Even where such management regimes are in place, however, these can fall hostage to the vagaries of international animal protection campaigning efforts.

DNA (meta)barcoding of biological invasions: a powerful tool to elucidate invasion processes and help managing aliens,"Biological invasions are a major threat to the world’s biodiversity with consequences on ecosystem structure and functioning, species evolution, and human well-being (through ecosystem services). Conservation of biological diversity and management of biological resources require multi-level management strategies on non-native species, in order to (1) prevent biological introductions, (2) detect non-native species at an early stage of the introduction, and (3) eradicate or maintain at a low level of population density non-native species that were successfully introduced. A pre-requisite to any control measures on non-native species is the ability to rapidly and accurately identify the putative threatening alien species. DNA barcoding, and its recent extension, DNA metabarcoding are complementary tools that have proved their value in the identification of living beings. Here we review their use in the identification of non-native species at several steps of the introduction processes, and how they can be applied in the control and management of biological introductions. Through examples covering various taxa and ecosystems (terrestrial, freshwater, marine), we highlight the strengths and weaknesses of approaches that we foresee as crucial in the implementation of early warning strategies. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency

Monitoring and assessing of sustainable development in the urban area of Ouagadougou based on SDG 11.3.1 indicator and the city biodiversity index,"Urban growth can induce changes in the use and transformation of urban land. In the context of rapid urbanization, monitoring key indicators of sustainable development is essential. The aim of this study was to monitor and assess the level of sustainable development in the city of Ouagadougou between 2002 and 2022, based on global indicators such as Sustainable Development Goal 11.3.1 indicator and the Singapore City Biodiversity Index. A remote sensing and Geographic Information System approach was used to acquire and analyze open-source geospatial data. The results show an increasing inefficiency in land use, with excessive consumption to population growth until 2013. Between 2013 and 2022, this trend declined, but urban biodiversity nevertheless decreased significantly, with a 40% loss of natural areas between 2002 and 2022. Fragmentation of natural areas, due to infrastructure development, has amplified this degradation, posing ecological risks to the city. This study underlines the importance of strengthening the ecological connectivity of urban spaces to improve their sustainability and resilience. It also recommends reorienting urban strategies by integrating nature-based solutions and placing biodiversity preservation at the heart of sustainable urban development policies. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysis of the environmental and economic performance of common agricultural policy eco-schemes in soil organic carbon sequestration,"The Andalusian olive grove in South Spain is employed as a case study to assess the environmental and economic effects of the green architecture (eco-schemes) of the Common Agricultural Policy in relation to low carbon agriculture under different soil management policy scenarios to support more efficient agri-environmental policy making. To do so, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach in which we used: (i) an integrated modelling framework comprising geographic information systems (GIS); (ii) the RothC model; and (iii) a cost-benefit analysis. Results show that eco-schemes provide a significant increase of soil organic carbon (SOC) relative to cross-compliance. Practices involving vegetation covers are more efficient than using pruning residues as mulching. SOC accumulation increases rapidly in the first five-ten years to slow down afterwards. The cost-benefit ratios of eco-schemes policy implementation are higher than one when only SOC is considered. Nonetheless, the inclusion of additional co-benefits has the potential to invert this scenario and enhance policy efficacy. Various insights on optimizing the design and application of eco-scheme efficiency are provided. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Indigenous microorganisms as potential bioremediators for environments contaminated with heavy metals,"Heavy metal pollution is one the most serious environmental problems facing our planet today, and immediate solutions are needed. Heavy metals such as copper (Cu) and chromium (Cr) play an important role as trace elements in biochemical reactions, but these metals are toxic at higher concentrations. In our region, mining and industrial activities have led to large-scale copper contamination in the environment. All organisms have homeostasis mechanisms for this metal, but when these controls fail or are exceeded several toxicological processes can develop.Problems involving Cr contamination are related to the fact that Argentina is an important world producer of leather. A chromium compound is used as a tanning agent, which has resulted in severe contamination near tanneries, with a mix of Cr(III) and Cr(VI). At present, the conventional technologies used to remove heavy metals from the environment involve physicochemical processes, which are costly and require large amounts of energy and specialized equipment.

The legislation was negotiated at the behest of lower-income, biodiverse countries to ensure that benefits derived from research and development of genetic resources from within their jurisdictions were equitably returned and could thereby incentivize conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Despite good intentions, however, rapid adoption of access and benefit-sharing measures at the national level, often without participatory strategic planning, has hampered noncommercial, international collaborative genetic research with counterproductive consequences for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use. We outline how current implementation of the Convention of Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol affect noncommercial research, such as that conducted in many disciplines in biology, including mammalogy. We use a case study from Brazil, an early adopter, to illustrate some current challenges and highlight downstream consequences for emerging pathogen research and public health. Most emerging pathogens colonize or jump to humans from nonhuman mammals, but noncommercial research in zoonotic diseases is complicated by potential commercial applications. Last, we identify proactive ways for the mammalogical community to engage with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol, through sharing of nonmonetary benefits and working with local natural history collections. Leveraging international scientific societies to collectively communicate the needs of biodiversity science to policy makers will be critical to ensuring that appropriate accommodations are negotiated for noncommercial research. © 2023 The Author(s).

Core principles for successfully implementing and upscaling Nature-based Solutions,"Despite substantial increases in the scope and magnitude of biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration, there remains ongoing degradation of natural resources that adversely affects both biodiversity and human well-being. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) can be an effective framework for reversing this trend, by increasing the alignment between conservation and sustainable development objectives. However, unless there is clarity on its evolution, definition and principles, and relationship with related approaches, it will not be possible to develop evidence-based standards and guidelines, or to implement, assess, improve and upscale NbS interventions globally. In order to address this gap, we present the definition and principles underpinning the NbS framework, recently adopted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and compare it to (1) the Ecosystem Approach that was the foundation for developing the NbS definitional framework, and (2) four specific ecosystem-based approaches (Forest Landscape Restoration, Ecosystem-based Adaptation, Ecological Restoration and Protected Areas) that can be considered as falling under the NbS framework. Although we found substantial alignment between NbS principles and the principles of the other frameworks, three of the eight NbS principles stand out from other approaches: NbS can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions; NbS should be applied at a landscape scale; and, NbS are integral to the overall design of policies, measures and actions, to address societal challenges. Reversely, concepts such as adaptive management/governance, effectiveness, uncertainty, multi-stakeholder participation, and temporal scale are present in other frameworks but not captured at all or detailed enough in the NbS principles. This critical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the NbS principles can inform the review and revision of principles supporting specific types of NbS (such as the approaches reviewed here), as well as serve as the foundation for the development of standards for the successful implementation of NbS.",Not About Sufficiency
Food vs. biofuel: An optimization approach to the spatio-temporal analysis of land-use competition and environmental impacts,"Biofuel production from food crops leads to debates about the increase in food prices and security of the food supply. On the other hand, biofuels derived from cellulosic (energy) crops offer positive environmental impacts. In this study, we develop a multi-objective mixed-integer optimization model to investigate the trade-offs and competition between biofuel and food production using switchgrass and corn. This model maximizes total economic and environmental benefits and provides optimal decisions regarding land allocations to food and energy crops, seeding time, harvesting time and amount, and budget allocations to farm operations. A piecewise linear lower approximation is developed to linearize the nonlinear revenue curve of corn grain sales. Spatio-temporal environmental impacts such as soil erosion prevention, carbon sequestration and emissions, and nitrogen pollution are included in the model. The application of the model in Kansas indicates that switchgrass is more profitable than corn in cropland, while it requires Conservation Research Program (CRP) incentives for production on marginal land unless priority is given to the environment. In order to ensure food security, our study advises managers and policy makers to provide CRP incentives or to adjust the sustainability factor, which restricts cropland availability for biofuel production. Our spatio-temporal optimization model can also be adapted to different regions with alternative energy and food crops under various management scenarios.

A sustainable approach to urban agriculture: Edible landscape,"In recent years, Edible Landscape (EL) within the urban area has become a topic of intense study in the field of landscape research worldwide. EL is the use of plant species which are of both aesthetic value and nutritious food value as a design feature in landscape without the aim of providing economic gain. EL, which integrates food-producing plants into ornamental plants and traditional designs, has also been proposed as an efficient alternative to landscape. EL provides sustainable practices that maximize water and energy efficiency, promote wildlife, and reduce the use of chemicals in landscaping. Instead of traditional landscapes, EL offers more sustainable benefits. The aim of this study, a theoretical framework has been established for the concept of EL. The examples of edible cities in the world, which develop nature-based solutions in urban areas and establish the necessary infrastructure in sustainable cities, are examined separately. As a result of the integration of edible landscape, one of the Continuous Productive Urban Landscapes (CPUL), to urban planning and design, self-sustaining Edible City Solutions (ECS) emerged. ECS focus on urban productive landscapes. ECS provide nature-based solutions such as heat island mitigation, reduced environmental pollution, enhanced biodiversity, water cycling, public health, environmental education, participation, local identity and commitment, green jobs, saving resources, reduced food miles, and reduced health. © Peter Lang AG 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
Disentangling the deforestation-environmental crime nexus in Latin America,"Deforestation and natural resource extraction are well-known threats to biodiversity conservation, environmental justice, livelihoods, ecosystem services and can even result in crimes to, and harassment of, environmental defenders. Such punitive actions against environmental defenders can influence both economic development and forest conservation efforts. Yet, little is known about this nexus and the complex relationships between environmental impacts, such as deforestation, and environmental crimes across space and time in many regions such as Latin America. We explored these complex relationships using a database of environmental crimes, threats, and harassment (ECTH) affecting environmental defenders, as well as forest loss data, and municipal-level socioeconomic indicators for nine Latin American countries over a period of eleven years. We found that as deforestation increased, there was a large increase in ECTH episodes related to agricultural activity, while in highly populated municipalities there were more ECTH episodes related to energy production, transportation, and urbanization activities. Overall, the percentage of annual deforestation had a strong influence, which varied according to municipal wealth, population density (PD), and geographical context. Statistically significant increases in violent crimes were found with increasing deforestation, but only in Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico, and in municipalities with lower population densities. Conversely, higher income, more populated municipalities were characterized by judicial harassment, as opposed to violent crimes, indicating a type of Environmental Crime Kuznets Curve relationship. A structural equation model where deforestation was driven by the number of ECTHs, as well as percent forest area, PD, latitude, and country showed that the number of ECTH events and country were significant drivers of deforestation. Understanding these complex social-ecological dynamics shows the profound effects that deforestation and unsustainable, and unjust, environmental impacts and conflicts can have across forests and ecosystems of the Global South in terms of social justice and conservation, and thus merits increased protection of environmental defenders in Latin America. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Is sustainable development bad for global biodiversity conservation?,"Non-technical summary Global biodiversity is in dramatic decline. The general public appears to equate sustainable development with biodiversity conservation and environmental protection, whereas the international policy discourse treats sustainable development as little more than traditional economic development. This gap between public perception of what sustainable development entails and its translation into formal policy goals is an important barrier to mobilizing the public and critical financial support for meeting global biodiversity conservation objectives. This contribution argues that the goal of nature and biodiversity conservation must be much more clearly distinguished from the 2015 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) than is currently the case. Technical summary The term 'sustainable development' has become widely used since it was popularized through the 1992 Rio UN Conference on Environment and Development. The UN SDGs adopted in 2015 further reinforce the normative centrality of the concept. Yet, the extent to which sustainable development covers nature and biodiversity conservation depends on how it is defined. A better understanding of how the public in different countries assesses the value of local and global biodiversity is crucial for building support for financing the vision to live 'in harmony with nature by 2050' currently under negotiation in the Convention on Biodiversity. This review essay discusses four distinct definitions of sustainable development, and considers how these different conceptualizations are used by political actors to serve particular interests. It then describes how this discourse has unfolded in international agreements related to sustainable development and biodiversity. The analysis shows that the prevalent economic cost-benefit approach used to value ecosystem services to make a case for conservation cannot resolve trade-off decisions between short-term economic and long-term societal interests. What is needed is a broad discourse about the ethical and cultural dimensions of biodiversity as a global heritage at the highest political level.

Nitrogen-induced terrestrial eutrophication: Cascading effects and impacts on ecosystem services,"Human activity has significantly increased the deposition of nitrogen (N) on terrestrial ecosystems over pre-industrial levels leading to a multitude of effects including losses of biodiversity, changes in ecosystem functioning, and impacts on human well-being. It is challenging to explicitly link the level of deposition on an ecosystem to the cascade of ecological effects triggered and ecosystem services affected, because of the multitude of possible pathways in the N cascade. To address this challenge, we report on the activities of an expert workshop to synthesize information on N-induced terrestrial eutrophication from the published literature and to link critical load exceedances with human beneficiaries by using the STressor–Ecological Production function–final ecosystem Services Framework and the Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System (FEGS-CS). We found 21 N critical loads were triggered by N deposition (ranging from 2 to 39 kg Nha1yr1), which cascaded to distinct beneficiary types through 582 individual pathways in the five ecoregions examined (Eastern Temperate Forests, Marine West Coast Forests, Northwestern Forested Mountains, North American Deserts, Mediterranean California). These exceedances ultimately affected 66 FEGS across a range of final ecosystem service categories (21 categories, e.g., changes in timber production, fire regimes, and native plant and animal communities) and 198 regional human beneficiaries of different types. Several different biological indicators were triggered in different ecosystems, including grasses and/or forbs (33% of all pathways), mycorrhizal communities (22%), tree species (21%), and lichen biodiversity (11%). Ecoregions with higher deposition rates for longer periods tended to have more numerous and varied ecological impacts (e.g., Eastern Temperate Forests, eight biological indicators) as opposed to other ecoregions (e.g., North American Deserts and Marine West Coast Forests each with one biological indicator). Nonetheless, although ecoregions differed by ecological effects from terrestrial eutrophication, the number of FEGS and beneficiaries impacted was similar across ecoregions. We found that terrestrial eutrophication affected all ecosystems examined, demonstrating the widespread nature of terrestrial eutrophication nationally. These results highlight which people and ecosystems are most affected according to present knowledge, and identify key uncertainties and knowledge gaps to be filled by future research. © 2017 Clark et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate justice or inequality lock-in? Analysis of U.S. incarceration in a changing climate,"The concept of carbon lock-in has been applied to the infrastructure, institutions, and discourses that lock society into carbon technologies, and simultaneously lock out lower-carbon alternatives. However, climate transitions have implications that extend beyond carbon and related environmental considerations. Systems of social inequality are also inextricably linked to and impacted by climate change governance and related actions. This article develops a framework to analyze inequality lock-in and disruption as part of climate transitions in particular sectors or industries. We conceptualize four distinct forms of climate transitions in relation to inequality: decarbonization lock-in, adaptation lock-in, decarbonization disruption, and adaptation disruption. Moreover, the framework conceptualizes the material mechanisms through which inequality is locked-in, or alternatively, disrupted by climate actions. Applying this framework to analyze the case of incarceration in the United States suggests that decarbonization and climate adaptation policies and practices are currently weighted toward further locking-in inequality in carceral systems. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Blue Carbon as a Nature-Based Mitigation Solution in Temperate Zones,"Concern for the future requires local steward-led cooperation between natural and social scientists and decision-makers to develop informed and policy-relevant nature-based mitigation solutions, including blue carbon (BC), which can help secure the future. Salt marshes, kelp forests, and seagrass meadows (and to a lesser extent mangroves) are significant BC ecosystems in temperate areas. We discuss the concept of blue carbon stocks and the scientific approaches to building BC stocks considering the variability in local conditions and the co-benefits of blue carbon ecosystems to improve climate change mitigation and adaptation mechanisms. The study examines (1) methods to assess the potential of BC ecosystems and the impact of disturbances, while (2) building relevant policy based on socio-economic assessments of impacted communities. We highlight economic and social approaches to rebuilding BC using financial tools such as blue bonds, development plans, cost-benefit analyses, cross-ecosystem restoration projects, AI and blockchain, and economic accounts of coastal ecosystems, while emphasizing that cutting carbon emissions is more important than (re)building BC stocks. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Toxic layering and compound extremes: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure in rural, environmental justice copper mining communities","Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are pervasive environmental pollutants with significant impacts on ecosystems and public health. This study aimed to characterize PFAS concentrations in an environmental justice community impacted by active/legacy copper mining, compounded by wildfires and flash floods. Additionally, the study explored the (re)mobilization of PFAS and co-occurrence with metal(loid)s following these events. Twenty-eight PFAS compounds in 35 residential and 8 control surface soil samples were analyzed via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS). The maximum total PFAS concentration observed in the residential samples was 96.40 μg kg−1, compared to 1.69 μgkg−1 in the control samples. Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) had a maximum concentration of 61 μg kg−1 in residential samples, while Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) had the highest concentration in the control samples at 0.92 μg kg−1. Long-chain PFAS were most dominant in this study. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (58 % of the samples), Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (35 %), and Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) (72 %) exceeded the U.S. EPA Soil-to-Groundwater Risk-Based Screening Levels, highlighting the potential risk of contaminants migrating from soil to groundwater, which could ultimately impact groundwater quality. Co-occurrence analysis showed that increases in PFAS concentrations were positively associated with Zn (β = 1.25, p = 0.0034) and Ba (β = 1.23, p = 0.0284) but negatively associated with Pb (β = −0.83, p = 0.0115) and Co (β = −1.38, p = 0.04671). In general, a spatial distribution map indicated that greater PFAS concentrations were observed near potential sources i.e., active mines. This evidence combined with select metal co-occurrence highlights the potential role of mining activities on PFAS concentration. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Macrophysiology for a changing world,"The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) has identified climate change, habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation and pollution as the major drivers of biodiversity loss and sources of concern for human well-being. Understanding how these drivers operate and interact and how they might be mitigated are among the most pressing questions facing humanity. Here, we show how macrophysiology-the investigation of variation in physiological traits over large geographical, temporal and phylogenetic scales-can contribute significantly to answering these questions. We do so by demonstrating, for each of the MA drivers, how a macrophysiological approach can or has helped elucidate the impacts of these drivers and their interactions. Moreover, we illustrate that a large-scale physiological perspective can provide insights into previously unrecognized threats to diversity, such as the erosion of physiological variation and stress tolerance, which are a consequence of the removal of large species and individuals from the biosphere. In so doing we demonstrate that environmental physiologists have much to offer the scientific quest to resolve major environmental problems. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Not About Sufficiency
"Biomass to biofuel: Impacts and mitigation of environmental, health, and socioeconomic challenges","Biomass-derived biofuels hold immense potential to address global energy demands sustainably while mitigating climate change. However, its environmental, health, and socioeconomic implications present significant challenges that must be addressed comprehensively. This paper bridges existing gaps by providing a holistic review of the impacts and mitigation strategies associated with biofuel production. It presents key concerns, including land-use changes, water depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and health risks. The findings reveal that biomass sources such as wood waste, food waste, microalgae, and energy crops are viable feedstocks, yet their production is constrained by trade-offs like resource competition, water scarcity, and land displacement. Technological advancements, including gasification, pyrolysis, and fermentation, enhance biofuel scalability but require sustainable practices to minimize environmental impact. Socioeconomic dimensions, such as rural employment, poverty reduction, and gender disparities, underscore the need for equitable policies to ensure biofuel initiatives uplift vulnerable communities without aggravating inequalities. The paper also emphasizes the alignment of biofuels with several sustainable development goals (SDGs), notably SDG 7 and SDG 13, while identifying trade-offs impacting SDG 2 and SDG 15. Mitigation strategies emphasize integrated land-use planning, biodiversity-friendly practices, and advanced technologies to balance energy production with ecological preservation. The significance of robust policies and local initiatives in building sustainable biofuel systems is highlighted, as biofuels play a vital role in achieving global sustainability goals while addressing associated benefits and challenges.",Not About Sufficiency
Therapeutic use of plants by local communities in and around Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary: Implications for protected area management in Bangladesh,"Traditional systems of medicine have become a topic of global importance recently. Increased commercialization of economically important medicinal plants has resulted in overharvesting, threatening their survival. The present study was carried out to document the indigenous uses of medicinal plants by the local communities in and around Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary, Bangladesh. Data collection was predominantly qualitative recording the species use, identifying their relative importance (RI) and assessing the informants' consensus factor (Fic) on associated knowledge. We interviewed 140 households of the local community and 5 local herbal practitioners. A total of 44 plant species were in use to treat 33 ailments under 10 broad disease categories. Five species were found to have high use versatility (RI > 1), Emblica officinale L. being the most versatile. Respiratory problems scored the highest Fic value (0.56) involving the use of 30% of the species recorded. Terminalia bellerica Roxb., Sterculia villosa Roxb., Dillenia pentagyna Roxb. and Terminalia arjuna Bedd. were being harvested commercially. Use by the community, particularly for subsistence consumption, seemed to be sustainable, but commercial extraction of some species appeared unsustainable. Buffer zone-based commercial farming of medicinal plants with a commercial value could serve a dual purpose of assuring sustainable alternative income generation for local communities as well as conserving the natural resources in protected areas. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Perspectives on global biodiversity scenarios and environmental services in the 21st century,"Quantitative models are increasingly being used to assess the impact of socioeconomic development pathways on biodiversity and environmental services. Regardless of the scenario, the decline of biodiversity will continue throughout the 21st century. Land-use changes drive biodiversity changes in terrestrial systems, while overfishing drives changes in marine systems, and climate change affects all realms. The loss of habitats will lead to local population decreases, and global extinctions will occur at unpredictable rates due to the lag between environmental changes and their effects. To address this, we need to focus more on the relationship between the decline of ecosystem services and the position of species responsible for that function in the trophic hierarchy. Perspectives on Global Biodiversity Scenarios and Environmental Services in the 21st Century makes biodiversity scenarios understandable, relevant, and valuable to stakeholders by using effective language and focused communication techniques. Instead of merely showing the potential effects of global change on biodiversity, scenarios should consider the feedback connecting environmental forces. Biodiversity provides numerous essential environmental services crucial to human well-being both now and in the future. The climate is a critical component of ecosystem functioning and directly and indirectly affects human health.

"Non-volcanic CO2 Earth degassing: Case of Mefite d'Ansanto (southern Apennines), Italy","Mefite d'Ansanto, southern Apennines, Italy is the largest natural emission of low temperature CO2 rich gases, from non-volcanic environment, ever measured in the Earth. The emission is fed by a buried reservoir, made up of permeable limestones and covered by clayey sediments. We estimated a total gas flux of ∼2000 tons per day. Under low wind conditions, the gas flows along a narrow natural channel producing a persistent gas river which has killed over a period of time people and animals. The application of a physical numerical model allowed us to define the zones which potentially can be affected by dangerous CO2 concentration at breathing height for humans. The geometry of the Mefite gas reservoir is similar to those designed for sequestering CO2 in geological storage projects where huge amounts of CO2 should be injected in order to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentration. The approach which we have used at Mefite to define hazardous zones for the human health can be applied also in case of large CO2 leakages from storage sites, a phenomena which, even if improbable, can not be ruled out.

Quantifying Biodiversity's Present and Future: Current Potentials and SSP-RCP-Driven Land Use Impacts,"Biodiversity, vital for ecosystem stability and human well-being, faces threats from land use and climate change. Accurately predicting these effects is crucial for effective conservation. High emission development scenario is commonly viewed as the most detrimental to biodiversity. However, recent researches suggest a more complex relationship between development paths and biodiversity outcomes. Our study addresses this by using an emergy-based approach to estimate current provincial-level biodiversity potential and project future species richness losses (amphibians, mammals, and birds) across climate zones and provincial divisions under various SSP-RCP scenarios for 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2090. The results revealed significant regional variations in China's biodiversity potential, with the highest in southwestern provinces. Future land use trends indicate increased construction land and barren alongside a decline in grasslands, leading to considerable habitat loss and fragmentation under various scenarios, stressing conservation needs. Future biodiversity loss follows the Hu line and climate zones, with significant decreases in the south and humid regions. Land-use changes could reduce species richness by 1-6 per 10 km grid cell. High-emission scenario SSP585 do not necessarily have the most detrimental effects on biodiversity and different scenarios require targeted focus on specific climatic zones and provinces. These findings underscore that different scenarios require targeted conservation efforts in specific regions sensitive to biodiversity loss. Our study provides a scientific foundation for these targeted efforts, ensuring that regions are prioritized under various future scenarios. This approach aids in developing effective conservation strategies amidst the complex interplay of land use dynamics and climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
Wheat straw pyrochar more efficiently decreased enantioselective uptake of dinotefuran by lettuce and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes than pyrochar in an agricultural soil,"Remediation of soils pollution caused by dinotefuran, a chiral pesticide, is indispensable for ensuring human food security. In comparison with pyrochar, the effect of hydrochar on enantioselective fate of dinotefuran, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) profiles in the contaminated soils remain poorly understood. Therefore, wheat straw hydrochar (SHC) and pyrochar (SPC) were prepared at 220 and 500 °C, respectively, to investigate their effects and underlying mechanisms on enantioselective fate of dinotefuran enantiomers and metabolites, and soil ARG abundance in soil-plant ecosystems using a 30-day pot experiment planted with lettuce. SPC showed a greater reduction effect on the accumulation of R- and S-dinotefuran and metabolites in lettuce shoots than SHC. This was mainly resulted from the lowered soil bioavailability of R- and S-dinotefuran due to adsorption/immobilization by chars, together with the char-enhanced pesticide-degrading bacteria resulted from increased soil pH and organic matter content. Both SPC and SHC efficiently reduced ARG levels in soils, owing to lowered abundance of ARG-carrying bacteria and declined horizontal gene transfer induced by decreased dinotefuran bioavailability. The above results provide new insights for optimizing char-based sustainable technologies to mitigate pollution of dinotefuran and spread of ARGs in agroecosystems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon tax and energy innovation at crossroads of carbon neutrality: Designing a sustainable decarbonization policy,"Decarbonation has been a primary policy prerogative for Sweden, and carbon tax has been a primary policy instrument in this pursuit, and the revenue generated out of carbon tax has been a driver for energy innovation. However, the benefits of energy innovation have not been experienced across various sectors in Swedish economy, and it might be anticipated that the potential aim of achieving carbon neutrality might not be accomplished to the fullest. Hence, being faced with the need of policy realignment for Sweden, this study has made an attempt to discover the dynamics between carbon tax revenue and energy innovation over a period of 1990-2019, following Quantile-on-Quantile Regression framework. The results obtained from the study show that the impact of carbon tax revenue on energy innovation might turn out to be ineffective beyond a certain threshold limit. A similar pattern has also been observed for the impact of energy innovation on carbon tax revenue.

Interactive Optimization of Day-ahead Market Trading Considering Coupling of Carbon-green Certificate-renewable Electricity Consumption Market,"With the goal of “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality”, the process of carbon reduction in the power industry has been accelerated. The carbon emissions trading, the green certificate trading and the excessive renewable electricity consumption trading have become important market instruments to reduce carbon emissions and promote the development of new power systems. First of all, based on the bilateral centralized bidding, this paper establishes a power energy market trading mechanism considering the coupling of the carbon-green certificate–renewable electricity consumption market with the participation of thermal power, wind power, photovoltaic enterprises and power users. Secondly, a hierarchical iterative interactive transaction optimization model is constructed by taking into account the optimal goals of the market members' benefits and the social welfare of the electricity markets. Finally, the alternating direction multiplier method is used for iterative solution and the impact of the carbon quota benchmark, the green certificate ratio and the renewable electricity consumption trading prices on the electricity market clearing results and the proceeds from generators and users’ costs are analyzed on the IEEE-30 node system. The results show that the power energy market trading mechanism considering the coupling of carbon-green certificate–renewable electricity consumption market is able to significantly reduce the carbon emissions of the thermal power companies compared with the single energy market trading mechanisms. Meanwhile, the mechanism can improve the wind power and photovoltaic enterprises to win the power bids, incentivize users to track the new energy output of the system and mitigate systematic wind and light abandonment. © 2024 Power System Technology Press.

Characterizing leaf-deposited particles: Single-particle mass spectral analysis and comparison with naturally fallen particles,"The size and composition of particulate matter (PM) are pivotal in determining its adverse health effects. It is important to understand PM's retention by plants to facilitate its atmospheric removal. However, the distinctions between the size and composition of naturally fallen PM (NFPM) and leaf-deposited PM (LDPM) are not well-documented. Here we utilize a single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer, coupled with a PM resuspension chamber, to analyze these differences. We find that LDPM particles are 6.8–97.3 % larger than NFPM. Employing a neural network algorithm based on adaptive resonance theory, we have identified distinct compositional profiles: NFPM predominantly consists of organic carbon (OC; 31.2 %) and potassium-rich components (19.1 %), whereas LDPM are largely composed of crustal species (53.9–60.6 %). Interestingly, coniferous species retain higher OC content (11.5–13.7 %) compared to broad-leaved species (0.5–1.2 %), while the levoglucosan content exhibit an opposite trend. Our study highlights the active role of tree leaves in modifying PM composition beyond mere passive capture, advocating for a strategic approach to species selection in urban greening initiatives to enhance PM mitigation. These insights provide guidance for urban planners and environmentalists in implementing nature-based solutions to improve urban air quality. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Spatial and Temporal Changes of Habitat Quality and Its Influential Factors in China Based on the InVEST Model,"The loss of biodiversity is one of the three global crises today. How to reduce habitat destruction and overexploitation to protect biodiversity is an urgent issue to be addressed. This study aims to explore the influential factors and driving mechanisms of habitat quality to find ways to reduce the interference of human activities on habitat quality. This paper evaluates the habitat quality in 30 provinces of China from 2010 to 2020 using the InVEST model and studies its geospatial differences by spatial auto-correlation. Then it investigates the influencing factors and driving mechanisms based on Geodetector and proposes strategies to improve habitat quality for different regions. The study shows that first, habitat quality is not distributed homogeneously in Chinese provinces, and habitat quality varies widely among different regions in the structure. Second, factors have different influences on habitat quality, which can be grouped into “key factors” and “auxiliary factors”. Its driving forces vary greatly over time, with per capita water resources, nighttime light index, area of afforested land, forest area, and destructed forest area as key factors in both 2010 and 2020. Third, the factor pairs are all bifactor or non-linear enhanced, showing that two factors have a stronger combined effect on habitat quality than a single factor. In particular, factors such as per capita water resources and area of afforested land in very strong interactions with others. Fourth, corresponding strategies are proposed for different regions in China to improve habitat quality according to the analysis of the spatial inequality of habitat quality and its driving mechanism, providing a reference for relevant regions abroad. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Collaborative Routing Optimization Model for Reverse Logistics of Construction and Demolition Waste from Sustainable Perspective,"The construction industry is developing rapidly along with the acceleration of urbanization but accompanied by an increased amount of construction and demolition waste (CDW). From the perspective of sustainability, the existing research has mainly focused on CDW treatment or landfill disposal, but the challenge of reverse logistics of CDW recycling that provides overall CDW route planning for multiple participants and coordinates the transportation process between multiple participants is still unclear. This paper develops an optimization model for multi-depot vehicle routing problems with time windows (MDVRPTW) for CDW transportation that is capable of coordinating involved CDW participants and suggesting a cost-effective, environment-friendly, and resource-saving transportation plan. Firstly, economic cost, environmental pollution, and social impact are discussed to establish this optimization-oriented decision model for MDVRPTW. Then, a method combined with a large neighborhood search algorithm and a local search algorithm is developed to plan the transportation route for CDW reverse logistics process. With the numerical experiments, the computational results illustrate the better performance of this proposed method than those traditional methods such as adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm or adaptive genetic algorithm. Finally, a sensitivity analysis considering time window, vehicle capacity, and carbon tax rate is conducted respectively, which provides management implications to support the decisionmaking of resource utilization maximization for enterprises and carbon emission management for the government. © 2022 by the authors.

Construction of a System of Indices for Determining the Contribution of Biodiversity to Human Well-Being in the Sanjiangyuan Area: A Spatiotemporal Distribution Study,"The contribution of biodiversity to human well-being is key to exploring the relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem services (ES), and human well-being. In this work, a composite index, termed the human well-being index (HWI), was constructed for evaluating the contribution of biodiversity to human well-being in the Sanjiangyuan area. This index consists of material, ecological regulation, and spiritual and cultural contributions, represented by the material index (MI), the ecological regulation index (ERI), and the spiritual and cultural index (SCI), respectively. The system was further used to evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution of human well-being at the county level in 2000, 2010, and 2020. HWI increased steadily across Sanjiangyuan over the study period, especially in the western and northeastern counties; its center of gravity shifted in the northward direction. The MI increased (decreased) in the west and northeast (southeast); its center of gravity shifted in the northeast direction. All counties showing changes in the ERI were located in the eastern part of Sanjiangyuan. The center of gravity of ERI did not change significantly. The SCI increased steadily across the study area, but was high in the west and low in the east; the center of gravity shifted in the northwest direction. The study findings can contribute toward quantifying biodiversity contributions to human well-being and the formulation of biodiversity conservation policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Nitrogen removal performance and microbial community of an enhanced multistage A/O biofilm reactor treating low-strength domestic wastewater,"The low-strength domestic wastewater (LSDW) treatment with low chemical oxygen demand (COD) has drawn extensive attention for the poor total nitrogen (TN) removal performance. In the present study, an enhanced multistage anoxic/oxic (A/O) biofilm reactor was designed to improve the TN removal performance of the LSDW treatment. Efficient nitrifying and denitrifying biofilm carriers were cultivated and then filled into the enhanced biofilm reactor as the sole microbial source. Step-feed strategy and internal recycle were adopted to optimize the substrate distribution and the organics utilization. Key operational parameters were optimized to obtain the best nitrogen and organics removal efficiencies. A hydraulic retention time of 8 h, an influent distribution ratio of 2:1 and an internal recycle ratio of 200% were tested as the optimum parameters. The ammonium, TN and COD removal efficiencies under the optimal operational parameters separately achieved 99.75 ± 0.21, 59.51 ± 1.95 and 85.06 ± 0.79% with an organic loading rate at around 0.36 kg COD/m3 d. The high-throughput sequencing technology confirmed that nitrifying and denitrifying biofilm could maintain functional bacteria in the system during long-period operation. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in all the nitrifying and denitrifying biofilm samples. Nitrosomonadaceae_uncultured and Nitrospira sp. stably existed in nitrifying biofilm as the main nitrifiers, while several heterotrophic genera, such as Thauera sp. and Flavobacterium sp., acted as potential genera responsible for TN removal in denitrifying biofilm. These findings suggested that the enhanced biofilm reactor could be a promising route for the treatment of LSDW with a low COD level. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
"Towards sustainable integrated watershed ecosystem management: A case study in dingxi on the loess plateau, China","The Chinese government initiated a massive conservation program called ""Grain-for-Green"" in 1999 to reduce soil erosion and improve ecosystem function. Implementing practical sustainable development in the loess plateau still remains problematic, particularly in its eco-fragile areas. Here we discussed an approach for sustainable development at the watershed scale by integrating land use suitability, ecosystem services and public participation in the loess hilly area. We linked land use scenario analysis and economic modeling to compare the outcomes of three scenarios, CLU (Current Land Use), GOLU (Grain-production Oriented Land Use) and PSLU (Potential Sustainable Land Use). The results indicated that compared to PSLU, GOLU may provide a higher economic productivity in the short-term, but not in the long-term. CLU ranked lowest in terms of economic benefits and did not meet the daily needs of the local farmers. To reconcile the land use adjustments with farmers' basic needs, a labor-saving land use strategy is necessary. Since the PSLU scenario assumes that slope cropland should be converted to pastures or orchards, more time may be available for off-farm work and for more public participation in integrated ecosystem management. Financial support to the local farmers for environmental conservation should be modulated in function of their positive contribution to ecosystem management. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency

Insights Into Earthworms and Fungi: Pioneering Roles in Mitigating Global Food Scarcity and Combatting Land Degradation,"Climate change significantly impacts terrestrial ecosystems by altering soil moisture, temperature regimes, rainfall patterns, and frequency of extreme weather events. These disruptions lead to shifts in soil community structures, accelerates land degradation processes, which in turn exacerbate the global food crisis. This review explores the roles of earthworms and fungi in improving soil health and mitigating food insecurity through their contributions to nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and plant growth. Earthworms and fungi recognized as key biological agents in nutrient cycling, soil structures enhancement, and carbon sequestration. They play crucial roles in heavy metal remediation, soil quality, fostering sustainable agricultural practices such as organic farming. The review emphasizes the influence of earthworms on nutrient dynamics, particularly in response to organic residues management, soil characteristics, and field conditions. Earthworm activity positively affects soil microbial communities, which in turn impacts plant growth, even under stress factors like soil contamination and temperature extremes. Review identifies key research gaps in the understanding of earthworm and fungi distribution, performance, and their capacity for soil remediation in varied agro-ecological contexts. In addition to biotic factors, present review also examines alternative food habits and superfoods as strategies to address zero hunger, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for zero hunger, poverty eradication, improved health, and overall well-being. By incorporating earthworms and fungi into agricultural systems and addressing critical research needs, there is significant potential to mitigate land degradation and contribute to the alleviation of global food crises. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Food sovereignty: An alternative paradigm for poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation in Latin America,"Strong feedback between global biodiversity loss and persistent, extreme rural poverty are major challenges in the face of concurrent food, energy, and environmental crises. This paper examines the role of industrial agricultural intensification and market integration as exogenous socio-ecological drivers of biodiversity loss and poverty traps in Latin America. We then analyze the potential of a food sovereignty framework, based on protecting the viability of a diverse agroecological matrix while supporting rural livelihoods and global food production. We review several successful examples of this approach, including ecological land reform in Brazil, agroforestry, milpa, and the uses of wild varieties in smallholder systems in Mexico and Central America. We highlight emergent research directions that will be necessary to assess the potential of the food sovereignty model to promote both biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction. © 2013 Chappell MJ et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil Carbon Stock and Soil Properties under Different Land Use Types of Agriculture,"Agriculture soils play a crucial role in carbon storage and food security. However, uncertainty remains about soil carbon stocks due to spatial variability. This study estimated soil carbon stocks in agricultural land and examined the impact of land use and soil properties on soil organic carbon in Ratchaburi Province, Thailand. Soil samples were collected at three depths (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) within five different land use types: cassava, coconut, paddy fields, pineapple, and sugarcane. The results revealed that soil organic carbon decreased with increasing depth. Significant differences in soil carbon and soil properties were observed among land uses. The carbon stocks at 0-30 cm depth were as follows: coconut (35.87 mg C/ha), paddy fields (31.17 mg C/ha), sugarcane (28.02 mg C/ha), pineapple (21.79 mg C/ha), and cassava (16.12 mg C/ha). The carbon stocks were significantly correlated with sand, density, clay, silt, and pH. This study highlights the impact of land use types on carbon stocks in agricultural soils and emphasizes the role of soil properties, particularly soil texture, in influencing carbon storage variability. Furthermore, the study highlights the carbon storage potential in agricultural areas, which could guide the formulation of policies to utilize agricultural land to offset CO2 emissions from other sectors. © 2023, Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies,Mahidol University.

Enhancing crop yield and carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission mitigation through different organic matter input in the Bohai Rim region: An estimation based on the DNDC-RF framework,"Context: Comprehending the intricacies of crop growth and its impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is crucial for food security and agricultural resilience to climate change. Research question: Agroecosystem models are instrumental in this endeavor, yet their regional applicability remains constrained. Methods: In our study, we conducted a rigorous verification of the DNDC (DeNitrification-DeComposition) model across eight representative sites in the Bohai Rim region and determined its efficacy in accurately simulating crop yield, soil organic carbon (SOC), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. We developed a coupled framework, DNDC-RF (DeNitrification-DeComposition-Random Forest), using the RF algorithm in conjunction with DNDC simulation results across fertilization and climate scenarios. Employing the DNDC-RF, we quantitatively evaluated the impact of diverse fertilization strategies on yield and net GHG (including SOC and N2O emissions) under future climate scenarios, spanning the period from 2008 to 2100. Results: The DNDC-RF framework accurately predicts SOC, yield, and N2O with high R2 and LCCC, lower RMSE and MAE. Under the RCP4.5 scenario, spring maize yields exhibited a reduction under conventional fertilization measures. However, with organic matters input could achieve the yield increase, particularly additional manure input (9.6 kg C ha−1 yr−1). Summer maize yields were projected to increase under future climate change, with the fastest increase occurring under the RCP8.5 scenario with additional manure input (26 kg C ha−1 yr−1). Wheat yields also increased under future climate change, with the highest growth rate observed with straw return under the RCP8.5 (17.1 kg C ha−1 yr−1). Under different fertilization practices, spring maize fields exhibited a net GHG sink. The best performance was observed with additional manure input and straw return under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. In contrast, conventional fertilization in winter wheat-summer maize fields resulted in a net GHG source under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. However, the application of organic matter mitigated the net GHG emissions, with additional manure input resulting in the largest increase rate of the net GHG sink. Conclusions: DNDC-RF framework can quickly and effectively solve the difficulties of DNDC model in regional scale prediction (such as complex parameter setting, difficult to accurately and quickly simulate at regional scale and time series), and can accurately simulate regional crop yield, SOC change and N2O emission. With the input of organic matter, the projected yields of maize and wheat are expected to increase, and the field's ability to act as a net GHG sink could be enhanced. Significance: Our findings have important scientific significance and practical value for promoting the sustainable development of regional agriculture and formulating effective regional agricultural management measures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Consortium of Management Practices in Long-Run Improves Soil Fertility and Carbon Sequestration in Drylands of Semi-Arid Tropics,"A continuously declining carbon in soils of drylands has increasingly become a source of concern and needs integrated solutions to achieve global food security and sustainability goals. This study analysed the impact and sustainability of management practices for climate change mitigation and food security in dryland tropics using long-term field trials. We compared a consortium of interventions, comprised four treatments, viz. traditional farming, improved practice, and regenerative treatments. Additionally, we presented the results of regeneration practices aimed at maintaining the soil macro and micro-aggregates. Results showed significantly higher soil organic carbon (SOC) in the topsoil layer (0–15 cm) of regeneration areas compared to the precision farming area. Our long-term experiments with a consortium of interventions resulted in a promising increase in soil carbon and crop yields. We selected shared socioeconomic pathways for scenarios in future climates and simulated the effect of improved practices in the near and distant future. Our simulation results revealed that adopting improved practices enhanced soil carbon at the rate of 0.7% per year and provided additional income from the yield of pulses in the 2-year rotation. Similarly, we observed an increasing trend in SOC building for improved practices in all future climate scenarios. However, the traditional practice showed a clear decline (0.20–0.15%) in SOC stock for all shared-socio-economic pathways. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Levers and leverage points for pathways to sustainability,"Humanity is on a deeply unsustainable trajectory. We are exceeding planetary boundaries and unlikely to meet many international sustainable development goals and global environmental targets. Until recently, there was no broadly accepted framework of interventions that could ignite the transformations needed to achieve these desired targets and goals. As a component of the IPBES Global Assessment, we conducted an iterative expert deliberation process with an extensive review of scenarios and pathways to sustainability, including the broader literature on indirect drivers, social change and sustainability transformation. We asked, what are the most important elements of pathways to sustainability? Applying a social–ecological systems lens, we identified eight priority points for intervention (leverage points) and five overarching strategic actions and priority interventions (levers), which appear to be key to societal transformation. The eight leverage points are: (1) Visions of a good life, (2) Total consumption and waste, (3) Latent values of responsibility, (4) Inequalities, (5) Justice and inclusion in conservation, (6) Externalities from trade and other telecouplings, (7) Responsible technology, innovation and investment, and (8) Education and knowledge generation and sharing. The five intertwined levers can be applied across the eight leverage points and more broadly. These include: (A) Incentives and capacity building, (B) Coordination across sectors and jurisdictions, (C) Pre-emptive action, (D) Adaptive decision-making and (E) Environmental law and implementation. The levers and leverage points are all non-substitutable, and each enables others, likely leading to synergistic benefits. Transformative change towards sustainable pathways requires more than a simple scaling-up of sustainability initiatives—it entails addressing these levers and leverage points to change the fabric of legal, political, economic and other social systems. These levers and leverage points build upon those approved within the Global Assessment's Summary for Policymakers, with the aim of enabling leaders in government, business, civil society and academia to spark transformative changes towards a more just and sustainable world.

We evaluated the increment of carbon stock (aboveground biomass, necromass, and soil) and standing litter nutrients in AFS and compared with natural succession. Treatments were established in 30 × 30 m plots with six repetitions (randomized block design) on a very degraded soil at UEMA School farm, in Eastern Amazon. In AFS, the 17 planted tree species of local interest (for fruit, timber, N-fixing) were associated with agricultural species and fertilized according to local standards. Carbon stock was measured in 2012 before the experiment setup (baseline) and in 2018. Aboveground carbon increment (Mg ha−1) was higher in AFS (26.79 ± 23.41) than in natural succession (1.13 ± 1.5), because of tree and shrub cover as a result of planting efforts.

Integration of remote-sensing based metrics and econometric models to assess the socio-economic contributions of carbon sequestration in unmanaged tropical dry forests,"Carbon sequestration by forests is one of the vital ecosystem services regulating the global climate. Equally important are the socio-economic co-benefits of carbon sequestration, given their implications for designing policies focused on conservation or restoration of tropical forests. Much debate has been around how to account for, and maximize, the co-benefits of carbon sequestration. Prior research suggests that a better understanding of the spatial relationship between carbon sequestration potential and forest types and dynamics - as a function of geographical context and time - is needed to better estimate their socio-economic benefits. Hence, this paper uses the Tropical Dry Forests of Central and South America to propose a new approach to quantify carbon sequestration of this biome, and its efficiency, using time series of the Terra-MODIS satellite. Our estimations of carbon sequestration are then coupled with a benefit transfer approach to infer carbon sequestration's monetary cost. Results reveal that these tropical forests sequester an annual average of 22.3 +/- 3.3 tCO(2) ha(-1) yr(-1) or in total, 1.16 GtCO(2). The associated social cost of carbon, calculated using three econometric models, ranges from USD 489 ha(-1) yr(-1) to USD 2828 ha(-1) yr(-1). These results can open new perspectives regarding the benefits of carbon sequestration against the costs of the negative impacts of climate change for national welfare accounts, their relevance for environmental policy-making, and the implementation or monitoring of carbon-based incentive programs (e.g., WAVES).",Not About Sufficiency
Innovative Solution for Invasive Species and Water Pollution: Hydrochar Synthesis from Pleco Fish Biomass,"In recent years, the invasive pleco fish has emerged as a global concern due to its adverse effects on ecosystems and economic activities, particularly in various water bodies in Mexico. This study introduces an innovative solution, employing microwave-assisted hydrothermal carbonization (MHTC) to synthesize hydrochar from pleco fish biomass. The research aimed to optimize synthesis conditions to enhance hydrochar yield, calorific value, and adsorption capacities for fluoride and cadmium in water. MHTC, characterized by low energy consumption, high reaction rates, and a simple design, was employed as a thermochemical process for hydrochar production. Key findings revealed that through response surface analysis, the study identified the optimal synthesis conditions for hydrochar production, maximizing yield and adsorption capacities while minimizing energy consumption. Physicochemical characterization demonstrated that hydrochars derived from pleco fish biomass exhibited mesoporous structures with fragmented surfaces, resembling hydroxyapatite, a major component of bone. Hydrochars derived from pleco fish biomass exhibited promising adsorption capacities for fluoride and cadmium in water, with hydrochar from Exp. 1 (90 min, 160 °C) showing the highest adsorption capacity for fluoride (4.16 mg/g), while Exp. 5 (90 min, 180 °C) demonstrated superior adsorption capacity for cadmium (98.5 mg/g). Furthermore, the utilization of pleco fish biomass for hydrochar production not only offers an eco-friendly disposal method for invasive species but also addresses fluoride and cadmium contamination issues, contributing to sustainable waste management and water treatment solutions. The resulting hydrochar, rich in solid fuel content with low pollutant emissions, presents a promising approach for waste management and carbon sequestration. Moreover, the optimized synthesis conditions pave the way for sustainable applications in energy production, addressing critical environmental and public health concerns. This research provides valuable insights into the potential of microwave-assisted hydrothermal carbonization for transforming invasive species into valuable resources, thereby mitigating environmental challenges and promoting sustainable development. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Multi-scale modelling of ecosystem services - An iterative approach,"Ecosystems are dependent upon the interactions between the natural environment and human factors. Each different ecosystem service is also associated with varying spatial scales related to their functioning and human benefits. Thus, key requirements for an ecosystem-based approach (EBA) are i) multiple scales, especially landscape scale, ii) flexible method for adaptive response and iii) stakeholders participation. Understanding complex inter-relationships between ecosystem functions and their services requires tools to handle change and uncertainty, notably scenarios and sensitivity analysis. We propose an iterative approach, which is multi-scale and user-focused based upon the LandSFACTS toolkit to generate a suite of land use change scenarios. The complexity of the scenarios and knowledge of the ecosystem is evaluated and built up through an iterative procedure with stakeholders using spatio-temporal constraints on land use. This method has been used to link climate change impacts (direct and indirect) with climate change responses (adaptation and mitigation). An example of evaluating alternative scenarios of land use changes through EBA (e.g. for food security, carbon sequestration, woodland habitat network) is presented in this paper at two scales (Tarland sub-catchment and Dee catchment in Scotland, UK).",Not About Sufficiency

Considering the actual COVID-19 sanitary crisis and its horizontal impacts over all the society and economy spheres, along with the relevance of rural tourism over the regional development, the current paper explores the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic over the Azores Region’s Touristic Companies. Thus, through direct testing tools, such as questionnaires and site analysis, the present article enabled us to provide more insights into the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic over the Azores Region’s touristic companies. The sample comprises 506 business managers of establishments of the touristic sector of the Azores, an outermost region of Portugal.

Most respondents consider that COVID-19 has a strong negative impact on their companies and expect a drop in turnover in 2020/2021. Our results suggest that government support is essential to offset the effects of the pandemic on companies of the tourism sector and show that the seal “Clean & Safe Azores” is an asset for companies operating in this region. Therefore, the results of this study could be used as a practical application for the Regional Authorities for the measurement of the impacts caused by the recent health crisis on the economy of the Azores. © 2021 by the authors.

"A cost-effective method to map mangrove forest extent, composition, and condition in small islands based on Sentinel-2 data: Implications for management","Despite their ecological, economic, and social importance, mangrove ecosystems suffer from high levels of degradation caused by a combination of anthropogenic stressors and the effects of climate change. Their degradation inevitably reduces the provision of ecosystem services and ultimately impacts human well-being, especially in coastal communities of Small Islands Developing States (SIDS). To timely identify and manage stressors causing local mangrove degradation, in situ monitoring is required. However, the financial means and human capacity to do so are often limited in SIDS, hampering adequate management of their mangrove forests. In search of a cost-effective alternative, we evaluated the use of Sentinel-2 satellites to monitor mangrove extent and species distribution in Lac Bay, a bay located on the small tropical island of Bonaire (Caribbean Netherlands). We also evaluated the mangrove's ecological condition through two biophysical variables 1) Effective Leaf Area Index (LAIe) and 2) Net Primary Productivity (NPP). Our results showed that Sentinel-2 data are a valuable tool for mapping the extent of mangrove forests in Bonaire and species composition (mean overall accuracy > 95 %). Using five Sentinel-2 images from 2021 and 2022, the extent of mangrove forests in Lac Bay was estimated to be on average 222.3 ha, of which 136.0 ha were classified as Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) and 77.1 ha as Avicennia germinans (black mangrove). Mean values for predicted LAIe ranged from 3.37 to 3.85 for Lac Bay, with significantly higher values in the wet season (3.82 ± 0.57) compared to the dry season (3.40 ± 0.56). The generic Simplified Level-2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) underestimated the LAIe values in Lac Bay, with moderate differences between SL2P values and in situ data (BDE = 0.41, RMSE = 1.09). Mean NPP values were estimated to be 8.82 ± 1.46 (g Cm−2 d -1). LAIe and NPP maps showed a zonal distribution, with highest values in the mid-West and East on the seaward side, and lowest values in the northern landward part of Lac Bay. The method developed in this study provides a cost-effective way to monitor the extent, composition, and ecological condition of mangrove forests, which can be used by small island states to make informed decisions about the management and protection of mangrove ecosystems. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems as a nature-based solution for sustainable agriculture,"We propose integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems (ICLF) as a nature-based solution (NbS) to address the challenges of modern agriculture. NbS are defined as approaches that integrate natural processes and ecosystem services into various aspects of agriculture, providing environmental, social, and economic benefits. Therefore, we discuss how ICLF, which combines crop, animal and forestry production, aligns with NbS principles. Initially, we underscore how conventional agricultural practices have contributed to biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, emphasizing the need to reconnect agriculture with nature for long-term sustainability. Subsequently, we show how the reintegration of grazing livestock into agricultural landscapes can restore biogeochemical cycles disrupted by specialization and reintroduce the multifunctionality found in NbS. To this end, we develop a conceptual model of the factors that influence the mimicry of soil functions in natural ecosystems within a system integrating crop, livestock, and forestry. Additionally, we discuss the role of plant diversity and the strategic inclusion of trees and shrubs in integrated crop-livestock, emphasizing their potential for carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and diversified agricultural yields. ICLF promote sustainability by emulating the trophic levels, processes, and nutrient flows typically found in nature. However, different spatiotemporal designs determine the system's level of complexity and potential for mimicking nature. Resource competition is a challenge within more complex integrated systems, demanding effective, regionally appropriate management to maximize complementarity. ICLF not only promotes food security but also contributes to the preservation of natural ecosystems, even in the face of mounting global challenges.",Not About Sufficiency
Natural and within-farmland biodiversity enhances crop productivity,"P>Ongoing expansion of large-scale agriculture critically threatens natural habitats and the pollination services they offer. Creating patches with high plant diversity within farmland is commonly suggested as a measure to benefit pollinators. However, farmers rarely adopt such practice, instead removing naturally occurring plants (weeds). By combining pollinator exclusion experiments with analysis of honeybee behaviour and flower-visitation webs, we found that the presence of weeds allowed pollinators to persist within sunflower fields, maximizing the benefits of the remaining patches of natural habitat to productivity of this large-scale crop. Weed diversity increased flower visitor diversity, hence ameliorating the measured negative effects of isolation from natural habitat. Although honeybees were the most abundant visitors, diversity of flower visitors enhanced honeybee movement, being the main factor influencing productivity. Conservation of natural patches combined with promoting flowering plants within crops can maximize productivity and, therefore, reduce the need for cropland expansion, contributing towards sustainable agriculture.",Not About Sufficiency
The global land-water-climate nexus of drought-tolerant succulent plants for bioenergy in abandoned croplands and arid marginal lands,"Bioenergy is considered among the main mitigation strategies to meet a green-growth development paradigm of 1.5 degrees C. However, climate change has been dramatically restructuring agriculture and damaging crops, threatening the achievement of global food security and bioenergy goals. Studies have shown that succulent plants through their water efficient and highly temperature-drought-tolerant Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) pathway, could be a key opportunity to meet future energy demands under global change scenarios. However, specific bioenergy potentials under alternative management conditions, irrigation, and land availability that minimize resource conflicts with food production, biodiversity transgressions, or water withdrawals in water scarce regions, remain unclear. Here, we estimate under a bottom-up approach the global bioenergy potentials of four relevant CAM species on recently abandoned croplands and arid marginal lands, unravelling the interdependencies between land availability, water requirements and climatic conditions at the global scale. We identify a potential of 16-36 Ej yr- 1 (27-62% of current bioenergy demand) in abandoned croplands depending on local and management factors. Rainfed CAM potentials (16 Ej yr- 1) are comparable with the potentials of bioenergy crops such as miscanthus (19 Ej yr- 1) under similar environmental conditions. However, the water requirement of CAM species to reach this potential is 24-30% of what is expected for C3 and C4 bioenergy crops. Additionally, we identify a carbon sequestration potential via plant growth of -3.09 Pg C yr- 1 between 1960 and 2020, which reveals an underestimated opportunity in arid marginal lands. We highlight the remarkable contribution of the CAM pathway as a nature-based solution under global change scenarios.",Not About Sufficiency
Toward Regenerative Hospitality Business Models: The Case of “Hortel”,"Due to the ecologically unfavorable state of the living world, any formal commitment made by the accommodation sector for the practical implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies needs to be followed up by a credible plan, courageous action, and an attentive monitoring and reporting phase. Only in this way can high-end hotels in cities emerge as regenerative sustainability (RS) hubs and better amalgamate whole life-cycle thinking and economic performance in their day-to-day activities. This paper provides a detailed literature review of the ongoing transformation of the hospitality sector toward the RS paradigm, which is a concept that underpins Hortel’s business model. Hortel is then contextualized as the first example of an eco-innovative turnkey business-to-business (B2B) service for a high-end hotel with an annexed restaurant. Hortel implemented nature-based solutions adapted to the hospitality sector in order to contribute to local urban biodiversity and bring hotel clients closer to nature through biophilic tactics. Services like Hortel can support, with today’s resources and competences, hotels that are putting at the core of their business model planetary health and societal well-being. It also includes the description of the prototype built at Four Points by Sheraton Catania, the monitoring phase that lasted between 2016 and 2017, and other strategic business-related initiatives. This paper also contributes to the advancement of the literature discussing regenerative business models, which to date has been a largely unexplored aspect of hospitality. © 2023 by the author.",Not About Sufficiency
Can agroforestry option values improve the functioning of drivers of agricultural intensification in Africa?,"Agricultural commodity production in a changing climate scenario is undergoing sustainability challenges due to degradation of soil fertility, water and biodiversity resources. In Africa, yields for important cereals (e.g., maize) have stagnated at 1 t ha(-1) due to land degradation, low fertilizer use and water stress. Resource-conserving options such as agroforestry promote integrated management systems that relate livelihoods and ecosystem service functions to agricultural production. Low input practices including improved fallows using legumes in rotations or intercrops can restore soil nutrients, improve soil carbon and reduce reliance on fertilizer use by 50%. We review how agroforestry can sustain agricultural intensification in Africa by regulating ecosystem functions such as nutrient recycling, water use, species diversity and agrochemical pollution.",Not About Sufficiency
"Design and Implementation of a Web-Based Residential Energy Assessment Platform: A Case Study in Cuenca, Ecuador","Population confinement caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in household energy consumption. Electricity consumption in the residential sector in Latin America and the Caribbean increased by 20% during 2020 compared to 2019. Due to the sanitary emergency declaration in Ecuador, an upsurge in electricity consumption was observed at the residential level between March and August of 2020. In this context, residential customers of Cuenca have increased their consumption by around 13% during May 2020 compared to the same month of the previous year. Adopting energy efficiency and sufficiency measures could counteract this increase in energy and contribute to managing the demand in the residential sector. The present work aims to evaluate energy savings and emission reduction in the residential sector in Cuenca through the design and implementation of a web-based platform for estimating electricity power savings. To develop the platform, information was gathered through surveys on the average household’s energy consumption. Power consumption of appliances was obtained from various sources, mainly from a database provided by a local appliance retailer. Energy-saving strategies for electrical and electronic devices were taken from technical guidelines and academic sources. The functional and visual specifications of the platform were designed with specialized tools. The platform allows for calculating household electrical energy consumption and potential savings in energy, economic, and environmental terms in a simple and visually attractive manner. The study shows that a four-member family household consumes an average of 182 kWh/month, equivalent to 17.1 USD, and an annual environmental footprint of 1068.9 kg of CO2. From this energy consumption, 57% is consumed by household appliances, 31% corresponds to technology and entertainment, and 12% represents lighting. Nevertheless, it is possible to reduce monthly energy consumption by 45% if consumers apply energy sufficiency and efficiency measures. This reduction will produce a monthly saving of 7.9 USD and an annual reduction of 485 kg of emissions. By implementing this web-based tool, nonspecialized users can analyze and decide the best way to reduce energy consumption, creating an appropriate energy culture that positively impacts the household economy and promotes environmental sustainability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Five challenges to reconcile agricultural land use and forest ecosystem services in Southeast Asia,"Southeast Asia possesses the highest rates of tropical deforestation globally and exceptional levels of species richness and endemism. Many countries in the region are also recognized for their food insecurity and poverty, making the reconciliation of agricultural production and forest conservation a particular priority. This reconciliation requires recognition of the trade-offs between competing land-use values and the subsequent incorporation of this information into policy making. To date, such reconciliation has been relatively unsuccessful across much of Southeast Asia. We propose an ecosystem services (ES) value-internalization framework that identifies the key challenges to such reconciliation. These challenges include lack of accessible ES valuation techniques; limited knowledge of the links between forests, food security, and human well-being; weak demand and political will for the integration of ES in economic activities and environmental regulation; a disconnect between decision makers and ES valuation; and lack of transparent discussion platforms where stakeholders can work toward consensus on negotiated land-use management decisions. Key research priorities to overcome these challenges are developing easy-to-use ES valuation techniques; quantifying links between forests and well-being that go beyond economic values; understanding factors that prevent the incorporation of ES into markets, regulations, and environmental certification schemes; understanding how to integrate ES valuation into policy making processes, and determining how to reduce corruption and power plays in land-use planning processes. Cinco Obstaculos para Reconciliar el Uso de Suelo Agricola y los Servicios Ambientales del Bosque en el Sureste Asiatico El sureste asiatico posee la tasa mas alta de deforestacion tropical a nivel mundial y niveles excepcionales de riqueza de especies y endemismos. Muchos paises de la region tambien son reconocidos por su inseguridad alimenticia y pobreza, lo que hace que la reconciliacion entre la produccion agricola y la conservacion del bosque sea una prioridad particular. Esta reconciliacion requiere del reconocimiento de las compensaciones entre los valores de uso de suelo en competencia y la incorporacion subsecuente de esta informacion a la realizacion de politicas. A la fecha, dicha reconciliacion ha sido relativamente infructuosa en casi todo el sureste asiatico. Proponemos un marco de trabajo de internalizacion de valores de los servicios ambientales (SA) que identifique los obstaculos clave para dicha reconciliacion. Estos obstaculos incluyen la carencia de tecnicas accesibles de valoracion de SA; el conocimiento limitado de las conexiones entre los bosques, la seguridad alimenticia y el bienestar humano; la baja demanda y la poca voluntad politica por integrar los SA a las actividades economicas y a la regulacion ambiental; una desconexion entre quienes toman las decisiones y la valoracion de los SA; y la falta de plataformas de discusion transparente en las que los accionistas puedan trabajar en obtener un consenso sobre las decisiones de manejo del uso de suelo negociado. Las prioridades clave de la investigacion para sobreponerse a estos obstaculos son el desarrollo de tecnicas de valoracion de SA que sean faciles de usar; cuantificar las conexiones entre los bosques y el bienestar que van mas alla de los valores economicos: entender los factores que previenen la incorporacion de los SA a los mercados, las regulaciones y los esquemas de certificacion ambiental; entender como integrar la valoracion de los SA a los procesos de elaboracion de politicas; y determinar como reducir la corrupcion y los juegos de poder en los procesos de planificacion del uso de suelo.

Scenarios for ecosystem services: An overview,"The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment ( MA) scenarios address changes in ecosystem services and their implications for human well-being. Ecological changes pose special challenges for long-term thinking, because of the possibility of regime shifts that occur rapidly yet alter the availability of ecosystem services for generations. Moreover, ecological feedbacks can intensify human modification of ecosystems, creating a spiral of poverty and ecosystem degradation. Such complex dynamics were evaluated by a mixture of qualitative and quantitative analyses in the MA scenarios. Collectively, the scenarios explore problems such as the connections of poverty reduction and ecosystem services, and trade-offs among ecosystem services. Several promising approaches are considered by the scenarios, including uses of biodiversity to build resilience of ecosystem services, actively adaptive management, and green technology. Although the scenarios do not prescribe an optimal path, they illuminate the consequences of different policies toward ecosystem services.",Not About Sufficiency
Between a rock and a hard place: The burdens of uncontrolled fire for smallholders across the tropics,"Once fire-resistant rainforests are becoming fire prone. Uncontrolled fires reflect new ecologies of the Anthropocene, driven by interactions of multiple actors and sectors across scales. They threaten the ecological integrity of tropical forests, impact global climate regimes and importantly cause considerable social and economic burdens. Numerous smallholder farming communities throughout the forested tropics experience the immediate place-based damages of uncontrolled fires and increasingly flammable landscapes. However, these burdens remain largely 'invisible' as leading narratives concentrate on losses accrued at aggregate scales, including to climate and biodiversity. Rather, smallholder farmers are often cast as culprits of contagion rooted in colonial condemnation of their customary fire-based agricultural practices. We use an environmental justice lens, notably the dimensions of recognition and distribution, to reveal the distributional burdens of uncontrolled fires for these land managers. We use empirical data from four case studies in three countries: Brazil, Madagascar and the Philippines, to explore the i) burdens of uncontrolled fire, ii) changing risks, iii) drivers and iv) responses to uncontrolled fire, and finally, the v) level of smallholder dependence on intentional fire. We show that place-based burdens of uncontrolled landscape fire are significant, including in landscapes where fire frequency is low. Burdens are both material and non-material and include infringements on food security, health, livelihoods, social relations and the burden of prohibitive fire policy itself. Equitable responses to uncontrolled fires must be sensitive to the distinctions between fire types. Further, we suggest that through bringing visibility to the place-based burdens of uncontrolled fires, we can begin to co-design resilient responses that avoid placing the final burden of risk reduction on to marginalized smallholder farming communities.

Global marine fishing across space and time,"Human health and livelihoods are threatened by declining marine fisheries catches, causing substantial interest in the sources and dynamics of fishing. Catch analyses in individual exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and the high seas are abundant, and research across multiple EEZs is growing. However, no previous studies have systematically compared catches, intranational versus international fish flows, and fishing nations within all of the world's EEZs and across adjacent and distant EEZs and the high seas to inform ""metacoupled"" fisheries management. We use the metacoupling framework-a new approach for evaluating human-nature interactions within and across adjacent and distant systems (metacouplings)-to illustrate how fisheries catches were locally, regionally, and globally interconnected in 1950-2014, totaling 5.8 billion metric tons and increasing by 298% (tonnage) and 431% (monetary value) over this time period. Catches by nations in their own EEZs (largest in Peru) and adjacent EEZs (largest in Indonesia) constituted 86% of worldwide catches, growing in 1950-1996 but declining in 1997-2014. In contrast, catches in distant EEZs and the high seas-largest in Morocco, Mauritania, and Canada-peaked in 1973 and have since represented 9-21% of annual catches. Our 65-year, local-regional-global analysis illustrates how metacoupled fisheries governance-holistic management of multiscalar catches, flows, and tradeoffs within and among fisheries-can improve food and nutrition security, livelihood resilience, and biodiversity conservation across the world. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Community involvement and tourism revenue sharing as contributing factors to the UN Sustainable Development Goals in Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park and Biosphere Reserve, Zanzibar","Communities surrounding protected areas (PAs) in developing countries bear disproportionate costs of nature conservation, challenging PA managers to apply participatory approaches, deliver benefits and provide alternative livelihoods. This analysis explores in-depth the roles that nature-based tourism can play in this context. Revenues from visitors to Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park (NP) in Zanzibar are shared equally between regional government and local communities, enabling PA operations, and providing both individual and collective benefits to residents of the larger UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (BR) surrounding the NP. Findings indicate that the structures and processes qualify as good governance. Locals identified many tangible and intangible benefits from the PA to their communities, ranging from direct employment, social capital development to ecosystem services. Nature conservation, mainly through shared tourism revenues, contributes to all 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in multiple ways. Benefit sharing mitigated land use conflicts, increased residents' acceptance of nature conservation and reduced pressures on ecosystems. The study demonstrates the complexity of revenue sharing arrangements necessary for success, and how to harness sustainable tourism, providing benefits beyond the generation of revenues in which community involvement and the institutional interplay between NP and BR governing stakeholders are key factors.",Not About Sufficiency
Species richness increases income in agroforestry systems of eastern Amazonia,"Biodiversity is believed to reduce risks (resistance and resilience against perturbations), to increase productivity via niche expansion, and possibly also to improve resource efficiency via mutually benefic species interactions. Agroforestry has been postulated as an ideal pathway of maintaining or restoring biodiversity in a socioeconomically sustainable manner. This study tests the relevance of agroforestry species diversity and richness on socioeconomic performance in a wide range of agroforestry systems in 38 farms aggregated in four clusters of sites in eastern Amazonia. We cover both commercial and subsistence agroforestry, ranging from simply structured plantations to diverse systems (enriched fallows, multi-strata home gardens), as well as pastures and shifting cultivation for comparisons. We quantify (i) all cultivated species, classifying them economically into species with commercial value, primarily subsistence purpose species or ‘non-productive’ species, and (ii) socioeconomic system variables (costs, monetary/non-monetary income, degree of satisfaction). Land-use intensity (per-hectare costs and income) was highest in commercial agroforestry and subsistence home gardens, and lowest in enriched fallows and pastures. All agroforestry systems resulted in higher income:cost ratios and greater satisfaction than pastures and shifting cultivation. Net income, non-monetary income and income:cost ratio were maximum in home gardens. Total species richness was negatively related with costs and monetary income, but not with non-monetary income, due to occupation of space by ‘non-productive’ species (juveniles or species providing ecosystem services). By contrast, productive (combining commercial and subsistence) species richness was positively related with (mainly non-monetary) income, net income and income:cost ratio. According to GLM, both productive species richness and Shannon–Wiener diversity positively affected net income. Future efforts for food security and poverty reduction need to focus more on species-rich agroforestry systems, both in terms of applied research and of extension service programs. Notably, the ubiquitous and successful home gardens merit far more attention. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem Services in the Service-Dominant Logic Framework,"The ecosystem services concept has become the predominant lens through which researchers and decision-makers view the relationship between natural ecosystems and human well-being. Over the past decades, a number of widely accepted classification systems, analytical methods, and a rich vocabulary around ecosystem services have evolved in the literature. Although there is widespread recognition that many ecosystem services are not exchanged in markets as commodities, many of these ecosystem service concepts and tools were built upon a theoretical foundation derived from neoclassical economics in which ecosystems are seen as passive production systems. Unfortunately, this perspective carries the potential to blind one to the complex interactions by which ecosystems, beneficiaries, and myriad other social actors interact to manage ecosystems and create human value. The service-dominant logic (S-D logic) framework, which views all value as being co-created by multiple actors engaged in the exchange of service, offers a valuable perspective by which the ecosystem services concept may be recast. Similarly, the ecosystem services lexicon can make important contributions to S-D logic by providing a means to describe and quantify the universal importance of natural ecosystems to human service systems. In this chapter, we briefly describe the ecosystem service concept and introduce the means for incorporating ecosystem services (as potential service offerings) into the S-D logic framework. We then use this modified framework to explore two case studies, recreation on U.S. family forests and a biodiversity market in Finland.",Not About Sufficiency
Restoring pre-industrial CO2 levels while achieving sustainable development goals,"Unless humanity achieves United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and restores the relatively stable climate of pre-industrial CO2 levels (as early as 2140), species extinctions, starvation, drought/floods, and violence will exacerbate mass migrations. This paper presents conceptual designs and techno-economic analyses to calculate sustainable limits for growing high-protein seafood and macroalgae-for-biofuel. We review the availability of wet solid waste and outline the mass balance of carbon and plant nutrients passing through a hydrothermal liquefaction process. The paper reviews the availability of dry solid waste and dry biomass for bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS) while generating Allam Cycle electricity. Sufficient wet-waste biomass supports quickly building hydrothermal liquefaction facilities. Macroalgae-for-biofuel technology can be developed and straightforwardly implemented on SDG-achieving high protein seafood infrastructure. The analyses indicate a potential for (1) 0.5 billion tonnes/yr of seafood; (2) 20 million barrels/day of biofuel from solid waste; (3) more biocrude oil from macroalgae than current fossil oil; and (4) sequestration of 28 to 38 billion tonnes/yr of bio-CO2. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) costs are between 25–33% of those for BECCS with pre-2019 technology or the projected cost of air-capture CDR. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Coordinating climate mitigation and pollution control policies: Insights from China's SO2 reduction mandates,"Understanding the interaction of pollution control and carbon mitigation is crucial for addressing both air pollution and climate change This paper investigates the carbon-mitigation spillovers of pollution control policies and the underlying firm-level reduction strategies, leveraging prefecture-level variations in policy intensity under China's Eleventh Five-Year Plan. To address endogeneity concerns, the critical sulfur loads—an exogenous-given measure of environmental capacity—are employed as an instrumental variable. The results suggest that stricter SO2 emission constraints generate significant carbon-mitigation spillovers, primarily through firms' source control strategies. These spillovers exhibit a non-linear pattern, intensifying as emission constraints become more stringent. By offering a micro-level and dynamic perspective, the study contributes to the literature on the indirect climate benefits of pollution control and underscores the value of integrating these co-benefits into both local policy design and international climate frameworks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Digital carbon neutrality: a new way explored by industrial internet,"This study explored the role of the Industrial internet, as the core technology in the Industry 4.0 period, in reducing carbon emissions. We employed the spatial panel data model to investigate the interaction mechanism between industrial internet application and industrial carbon reduction. The results of the empirical study showed that the Industrial internet has significantly contributed to reducing industrial carbon emissions. The causal pathway analysis showed that the Industrial internet will reduce industrial carbon emission through upgrading of manufactural structure. Meanwhile, the Industrial internet has strengthened impact on manufactural structure upgrading in application scenarios of industrial carbon reduction. Further, the indirect effects of the Industrial internet reveals that the carbon-reduction effect of the Industrial internet will spill over into less developed regions from provinces with smart manufacturing. The application of the Industrial internet has promoted manufacturing upgrading and boosted the digital and green transformation of manufacturing enterprises to accelerate the process of reducing industrial carbon emissions. The empirical results are supported by the STIRPAT model, which underlines the positive impacts of technologies on the environment.

Carbon Footprint Analysis of Tourism Life Cycle: The Case of Guilin from 2011 to 2022,"Low-carbon tourism is an important way for the tourism industry to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. In order to promote the development of Guilin as a world-class tourism city and ensure the sustainable development of the tourism industry in Guilin, this paper combines the concept of carbon footprint and the theory of life cycle to build a tourists' carbon footprint life cycle analysis model of Guilin. Taking tourists in Guilin as an example, the composition and changes of tourists' carbon footprint are dynamically analyzed. The research shows that: (1) The overall tourism carbon footprint of Guilin showed an upward trend during 2011-2019. From 2020 to 2022, due to the impact of COVID-19, Guilin's tourism carbon footprint has decreased significantly. The per capita carbon footprint of tourism in Guilin showed a downward trend from 2011 to 2022; (2) The order of the size of Guilin's tourism carbon footprint is tourism transportation > tourism catering > tourism accommodation > tourism activities; (3) From 2011 to 2022, the carbon footprint of tourism transportation in Guilin showed an obvious narrowing state, while the carbon footprint of tourism accommodation, tourism activities, and tourism catering showed an obvious expanding trend. Based on the characteristics of the carbon footprint of Guilin's tourism and the current situation of the development of Guilin's tourism, this paper puts forward suggestions on reducing carbon emissions, forms a new tool for evaluating and constructing low-carbon tourism, and provides a scientific basis and practical reference significance for the sustainable development of low-carbon tourism in Guilin.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysis of Electricity Market Deregulation Effect on Chinese Economic Development Towards Carbon Neutrality: A Socioeconomic Perspective,"In this paper, we study the electricity price, as the most important production factor, for its external effort on societal economic development with qualitative analysis of its role in the expansion and re-allocation of overall social welfare.

Integrating landscape ecology and the assessment of ecosystem services in the study of karst areas,"Context: A landscape is defined as a “system of ecosystems” and this is a model in which karst areas can easily be integrated. In karst areas, much of the connectivity between the units of the landscape is underground, with aquifers and caves forming a continuous layered tissue. However, underground environments are among the least studied landscapes on Earth because of limited accessibility and the difficulty of performing surveys. Objectives: The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework for applying principles of landscape ecology to research on karst environments. Methods: By adapting the standard patch-corridor-matrix model to a 3d model, the main issues that need to be addressed were identified. These include identifying the main morphological (surface and underground) karst features; determining the landscape structure through its features, composition, and configuration; and developing adequate indices. Results: The landscape spatial structure of different karst areas influences fundamental ecological functions and biodiversity patterns. Determining how structure, biodiversity, and functions relate reveals important insights into the functioning of karst systems. Emphasizing the provisioning of ecosystem services is essential in supporting the concept that karst regions are vital for human well-being because they host valuable resources and fundamental ecosystem processes. The paper discusses how this framework helps address anthropogenic impacts and conservation issues on karst. Conclusions: The potential of applying a landscape approach to karst systems lies in developing models that provide ecological information relevant to understanding karst systems and understanding their implications for natural resources management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Migrant health in Italy: A better health status difficult to maintain - Country of origin and assimilation effects studied from the Italian risk factor surveillance data,"Background: Many studies on migrant health have focused on aspects of morbidity and mortality, but very few approach the relevant issues of migrants' health considering behavioral risk factors. Previous studies have often been limited methodologically because of sample size or lack of information on migrant country of origin. Information about risk factors is fundamental to direct any intervention, particularly with regard to non-communicable diseases that are leading causes of death and disease. Thus, the main focus of our analysis is the influence of country of origin and the assimilation process. Method: Utilizing a surveillance system that has been collecting over 30,000 interviews a year in Italy since 2008, we have studied migrants' attitudes and behaviors by country of origin and by length of stay. Given 6 years of observation, we have obtained and analyzed 228,201 interviews of which over 9000 were migrants. Results: While migrants overall present similar conditions to native-born Italians, major differences appear when country of origin or length of stay is considered. Subgroups of migrants present substantially different behaviors, some much better than native-born Italians, some worse. However, integration processes generally produce a convergence towards the behavioral prevalence observed for native-born Italians. Conclusions: Health programs should consider the diversity of the growing migrant population: data and analyses are needed to support appropriate policies. Many migrants' subgroups arrive with healthier behaviors than those of their adopted country. However, they are likely to have a less favorable social position in their destination countries that could lead to a change towards less healthy behaviors. Interventions capable of identifying this tendency could produce significant better health for this important part of the future (multicultural) populations. © 2019 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Fostering a Wildlife-Friendly Program for Sustainable Coffee Farming: The Case of Small-Holder Farmers in Indonesia,"There is an urgent need for a global transition to sustainable and wildlife-friendly farming systems that provide social and economic equity and protect ecosystem services on which agriculture depends. Java is home to 60% of Indonesia's population and harbors many endemic species; thus, managing agriculture alongside human well-being and biodiversity is vital. Within a community of similar to 400 coffee farmers in the province of West Java, we assessed the steps to develop a wildlife-friendly program until reaching certification between February 2019 and October 2020. We adopted an adaptive management approach that included developing common objectives through a process of stakeholder consultation and co-learning. We firstly investigated via interviews the expectations and the issues encountered by 25 farmers who converted to organic production in 2016. Their main expectations were an increase in income and an increase in coffee quality, while they had issues mainly in finding high quality fertilizers, reducing pests, and increasing productivity. We used this information to establish a problem-solving plan for the transition to community-wide wildlife-friendly practices. As part of the adaptive evaluation, we assessed the quality of coffee plantations before and after the implementation of coproduced actions. The quality of coffee significantly improved after our interventions to reduce the coffee berry borer, especially in the fields that started as inorganic and converted to organic. We uncovered additional issues to meet the standards for certification, including banning hunting and trapping activities and increasing coffee quality for international export. We describe the coproduced actions (agroforestry, conservation education, local law, organic alternatives) and phases of the program and discuss the potential barriers. We provide novel evidence of adaptive management framework successfully used to implement management actions and reach shared goals.",Not About Sufficiency
Linking the bioeconomy to the 2030 sustainable development agenda: Can SDG indicators be used to monitor progress towards a sustainable bioeconomy?,"Bioeconomy has been proposed as a strategy to overcome many global and national challenges, from climate action to income diversification in rural areas. Therefore, the ultimate goal is not to measure the bioeconomy per se, but its sustainability. One way to ensure sustainability of bioeconomy strategies would be by linking its reporting with internationally-agreed targets of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. Although there are case studies, scientific articles and technical reports in the literature of bioeconomy and other related strategies (e.g. green economy, circular economy) and their links to SDGs, the complete picture on this heterogeneous literature is missing. The objective of this work is to lay out the opportunities to couple monitoring and evaluation of bioeconomy and bioeconomy-related concepts to aid the countries to report their status on attaining SDGs. This study is the first to review and harmonize the results through meta-analysis of the available literature and technical reports on linking bioeconomy and SDGs. The results suggest that bioeconomy monitoring and evaluation can provide opportunities in terms of SDG reporting, in all three dimensions of sustainability. Bioeconomy strategies and practices were found to have strong potential in coupled reporting with several SDGs related to economic development, access to basic services, and sustainable consumption, followed by biodiversity conservation, waste re-use, equality, gender equality, inclusiveness and international cooperation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying opportunities and risks from green hydrogen: a framework and insights from a developing region in Brazil,"Green hydrogen is often considered as an opportunity for developing countries to advance their economies while contributing to the global goal of climate change mitigation. Many international cooperation initiatives are being established to promote green hydrogen projects in developing countries. However, the extent to which the benefits would be localized in developing countries remains uncertain. Additionally, the risks of a massive expansion of a green hydrogen industry, including potential trade-offs with other societal goals, have been largely overlooked. To address these gaps, this study proposes an analytical framework to assess the risks, opportunities, synergies and trade-offs from international initiatives, both regarding goals and across geographical scales. The study then applies the framework to an empirical case study of the green hydrogen hub in the Brazilian state of Ceará, where a green corridor is being created with Europe. The analysis is based on triangulation of data collected via in-depth semi-structured interviews, field work, industry reports, as well as official documents and communications. This framework shows that opportunities and risks, including global distributional impacts, will depend on the interplay between technology-, project-, and context-specific factors that span multiple geographical scales. Findings suggest that a global green hydrogen economy could bring negative distributive effects and trade-offs, especially in the short-term. Benefits like decarbonization of end-use sectors and increased industrial output would be primarily mobilized by developed countries who import the green hydrogen and export the technologies, while risks regarding delaying the local energy transition and increased external dependency would be borne by developing countries. Longer-term opportunities related to learning and diversification are both more uncertain and more challenging to realize in places with lower capabilities due to path-dependencies in economic and technological trajectories. Promoting both economic development and sustainability transitions would require local governments to implement strategic policy approaches, international cooperation to build local capabilities and help establish governance mechanisms, and developed country importers of green hydrogen to more systematically address such risks in their own policy making and investment strategies. © 2024 The Author(s).

Potential of indoor room 3D ratio in reducing carbon emissions by prefabricated decoration in chain hotel buildings via multidimensional algorithm models for robot in-situ 3D printing,"Chain hotels accounted for 85 % of the total number of hotels in China, and their indoor room decorations were replaced every 2–5 years. The potential for reducing carbon emissions in chain hotel rooms through prefabricated decoration has garnered increasing attention in the context of SDGs 7.3/8.0/9.4/11.3 & 6/12.5. By performing spatial carbon emission intensity (SCEI) calculations on different room types in hotels and then using multidisciplinary design optimization algorithms and model-driven decision support systems (MDOA-MDSS) got the target optimal threshold ratio model: (1) the fitting value of RL/RW and SCEI is 51.731, (2) the fitting value of RH and SCEI is 51.731, and (3) when RL/RW is constant, H should not be greater than 2.125 times of RL/RW. On the contrary, when RH is determined, RL/RW should not be greater than 0.471 times RH. The indoor room 3D ratio significantly enhances the carbon reduction capacity of hotel secondary decoration solutions and lower costs, while the coupled building indoor 3D ratio with robot in-situ 3D printing, guided by multidimensional bio-inspired algorithms with MDSS, can bring about a revolutionary transformation in the global hotel interior renovation industry in the future, offering a scalable solution for the hospitality industry's shift towards carbon neutrality. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Theoretical framework and differentiated policies for national park zoning management: A Baishanzu case study in China,"Human activities are contributing to a global decline in biodiversity and ecosystem services. While national parks, rooted in sustainable development principles, aim to counteract this trend and have been successful in developed nations, their direct applicability to developing countries is debatable. In light of the challenges associated with coordinating environmental, social, economic, and cultural objectives, we have formulated a theoretical framework centered on the concept of ""risk-value""for managing national park zoning in developing nations. This framework is designed to promote co-prosperity by simultaneously addressing biodiversity conservation, equity, and human well-being concerns. Our framework, when applied to China's Baishanzu National Park, entailed subdividing the park into four distinct zones, each managed by specific and tailored policies. Our research provides insights into the theoretical underpinnings of implementing the national park concept in developing countries and showcases effective strategies for enhancing ecological conservation in these regions.",Not About Sufficiency
Renewable Wind Energy Implementation in South America: A Comprehensive Review and Sustainable Prospects,"South America is a region that stands out worldwide for its biodiversity of ecosystems, cultural heritage, and potential considering natural resources linked to renewable energies. In the global crisis due to climate change, South American countries have implemented actions to carry out a progressive energy transition from fossil energies to renewable energies and contribute to the planet’s sustainability. In this context, South American countries are implementing green strategies and investment projects linked to wind farms to move towards achieving the sustainable development goals for the year 2030 of the UN agenda and achieving low-carbon economies for the year 2050. This article studies the advances in wind energy implementation in South America, highlighting progress and experiences in these issues through a review of the scientific literature considering the year 2023. The methodology applied in this article was carried out through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the generation of scientific maps. As a result, this article presents the main developments, lessons learned/gaps, and future sustainable prospects on the road to 2050. According to the results, renewable wind energy infrastructure was applied in South America during the global climate change crisis era. Different levels of development in on-shore wind farms have been reached in each country. Also, a promising future exists for off-shore wind energy considering the highest potential. Finally, this article concludes that implementing emerging technologies like the production of green hydrogen and synthetic e-fuels looks like a synergetic clean energy solution combined with wind energy, which may transform the region into a world-class sustainable territory. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Plant diversity and ecosystem services in Amazonian homegardens of Ecuador,"Homegardens (HG) can play a key role in the conservation of plant diversity and at the same time provide ecosystem services that have a direct and positive impact on human welfare. The relationships among plant diversity, ecosystem services, and the factors that influence them formed the subject of study in tropical HG in Sangay, Ecuador. We compiled information from 138 HG in 11 localities and found 484 plant species associated with 20 ecosystem services, the most important of which, according to interviews with the gardeners, provide food, medicine and ornamentation. Influential physical factors on plant diversity in the HG were altitude, precipitation and temperature, while socioeconomic factors, including ethnicity, gender, income and education, were perhaps more important determinants of HG diversity. Three groups of HG were identified by Hierarchical Ascendant Correspondence Analysis: ""small HG of recent origin,"" having the fewest species and ecosystem services, ""large, transitional HG,"" having a wide range of services, and ""medium, established HG,"" mainly supplying food, medicine, ornamentation, shade and fencing. Ethnicity may be a stronger determinant of differences in HG composition: for Shuar people, HG were a main source of food, critical to their subsistence in rural areas; in total, Shuar gardeners cultivated on the whole more plant species. On the other hand, HG belonging to mestizos were more diverse, have more exotic plant species, and provide mainly cultural and regulatory services. HG in more urban settings mainly provided ornamentation, fencing and shade. This information can be applied by policy makers to the design of strategies for biodiversity conservation and food security. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Exploring the relationships between biodiversity use, rural poverty alleviation and ecotourism in Surama, Guyana","This article explores the relationships between rural poverty, biodiversity and ecotourism in the community of Surama, located in the Northern Rupuni in Guyana. Using a mixed methods approach, questionnaire survey data from 50 households together with other field data were analyzed. The objectives were to examine the extent to which consumptive and non-consumptive resources are used by households within the community to evaluate the contributions of biodiversity use to the economic and social welfare of households, and highlight possible threats local resource use presents to biodiversity conservation and management. Qualitative and quantitative data support the view that rural households depend on local ecosystems for both subsistence and income generation, as food supply sources, building materials for homes, medicines, and especially for ecotourism. Biodiversity use is central to livelihoods of Surama households and ecotourism is the main income generating activity. Households were clearly aware of the importance of otherecosystem services. Biodiversity is perceived as natural capital to support livelihoods and improve welfare. © 2018 University of the West Indies. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Stakeholder perceptions of ecosystem service declines in Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea: Is human population a more critical driver than climate change?","Milne Bay Province (MBP) in Papua New Guinea is a priority seascape in the Coral Triangle marine biodiversity hotspot. Goal 4 of the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security promotes adaptation planning for small island ecosystems and communities threatened by climate change, but information to identify vulnerable islands and priority interventions is limited. This study adapted the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) framework in MBP with regional stakeholders to project trends in harvested or cultivated 'provisioning' ecosystem goods and services (EGS), human wellbeing, drivers of change and necessary management strategies, based on their tacit knowledge. In 2010 five island subregions which are susceptible to food insecurity were assessed. Workshop participants identified freshwater, garden food crops, coral, beche-de-mer, reef fish and sharks as the most important EGS in all subregions. Terrestrial EGS contributed 43% of aggregated ecosystem-derived well-being, and marine EGS 57%. By 2030 the overall condition of EGS was projected to decline by > 50%. The primary driver in all subregions was human population growth, and climate change impacts were predicted in only two subregions. Improved garden and agricultural productivity and population control were the highest ranked management strategies. Population relocation was also prioritised for two subregions where human carrying capacities may soon be exceeded. Although none of the strategies addressed climate change directly, all could yield climate adaptation and marine conservation co-benefits by enhancing ecosystem-based adaptation and community adaptive capacity. It is suggested that there is a 20-30 year 'adaptation window' in which to address population growth, which otherwise will continue to erode the capacity of communities and ecosystems to cope with potentially extreme climate impacts after mid-century.

Optimising forest rehabilitation and restoration through remote sensing and machine learning: Mapping natural forests in the eThekwini Municipality,"Forests are crucial in delivering ecosystem services that underpin human well-being and biodiversity conservation. However, these vital ecosystems are threatened by forest degradation and rapid urbanisation. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a comprehensive framework for mapping natural forests at the municipal scale. The framework integrates remote sensing techniques with machine learning algorithms to provide valuable insights into the extent of natural forests within the eThekwini Municipality. The study utilised Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Landsat 9 satellite imagery to analyse and map the historical and current distribution of natural forests. Five spectral indices, namely, Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Chlorophyll Index Green (CIG), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index-2 (EVI-2), which were calculated from Landsat bands, were employed in the analysis. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms were used to model forest distribution. Accuracy was assessed through confusion matrices, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and the F1 scores. LightGBM achieved the highest overall accuracy (90.76%), followed by CatBoost (89.56%) and XGBoost (84.34%). LightGBM also obtained the best F1 score (90.76%). These findings highlight LightGBM's effectiveness in classifying natural forests, making it the preferred model for mapping the historical extent of natural forests in the eThekwini Municipality. However, classifications based on Landsat 7 significantly underestimated the extent of natural forests within the study area, whereas Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 data revealed an increase in natural forests from 2015 to 2023. These findings will guide effective and targeted forest rehabilitation and restoration efforts, ensuring the preservation and enhancement of forest ecosystem services. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Ecological restoration as a strategy for mitigating and adapting to climate change: lessons and challenges from Brazil,"Climate change is a global phenomenon that affects biophysical systems and human well-being. The Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 2016 with the objective of strengthening the global response to climate change by keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 °C. The agreement requires all Parties to submit their “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is an important strategy for mitigating climate change, particularly in developing countries with large forests. Extensive tropical forest loss and degradation have increased awareness at the international level of the need to undertake large-scale ecological restoration, highlighting the need to identify cases in which restoration strategies can contribute to mitigation and adaptation. Here we consider Brazil as a case study to evaluate the benefits and challenges of implementing large-scale restoration programs in developing countries. The Brazilian NDC included the target of restoring and reforesting 12 million hectares of forests for multiple uses by 2030. Restoration of native vegetation is one of the foundations of sustainable rural development in Brazil and should consider multiple purposes, from biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation to social and economic development. However, ecological restoration still presents substantial challenges for tropical and mega-diverse countries, including the need to develop plans that are technically and financially feasible, as well as public policies and monitoring instruments that can assess effectiveness. The planning, execution, and monitoring of restoration efforts strongly depend on the context and the diagnosis of the area with respect to reference ecosystems (e.g., forests, savannas, grasslands, wetlands). In addition, poor integration of climate change policies at the national and subnational levels and with other sectorial policies constrains the large-scale implementation of restoration programs. The case of Brazil shows that slowing deforestation is possible; however, this analysis highlights the need for increased national commitment and international support for actions that require large-scale transformations of the forest sector regarding ecosystem restoration efforts. Scaling up the ambitions and actions of the Paris Agreement implies the need for a global framework that recognizes landscape restoration as a cost-effective nature-based solution and that supports countries in addressing their remaining needs, challenges, and barriers. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Food, nutrition and energy security of small and marginal farmers through integrated agriculture","Food security and environmental sustainability are threa-tened by the degradation of natural resources in India’s rice-based agricultural systems. On-farm and on-station experiments on the integrated farming system (IFS) were carried out at ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, to develop a productive, profita-ble and long-term resource-conserving alternative agri-cultural system that secures the food, nutrition and energy requirements of small farmers. IFS helped in making the farming system sustainable through dif-ferent cropping, biodiversity and ecosystem services. It provided food and nutrition security to the farmer family through the production of diversified food commodi-ties such as cereal, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, fruits, eggs, milk, fish, meat, etc. Dairy-biogas integration of-fered a promising win-win opportunity to improve crop production while, at the same time, meeting the fuel needs of the farmer families. Field application of slurry reduced fertilizer burden on the farmers, besides im-proving the sustainability of their fields. Ecosystem services such as pollination of crops, run-off water har-vesting, prevention of soil erosion, carbon sequestration by plants and soil, cultural services, etc. are vital for the sustainable supply of food and fibre. The experiment was conducted for three consecutive years (2015-18), and was observed that the IFS model generated net re-turns of INR 378,784 and employment of 628 mandays which are more than the conventional rice-wheat sys-tem. In the Indo-Gangetic Plains, IFS leads to sustain-able intensification besides food security and poverty alleviation. © (2023). All Rights Reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem Approach in Agrivoltaic Parks Design An Innovative Integral Methodology for the Implementation and Design of Agrivoltaic Fields,"The approach to strategic landscape design faces today two challenges: a) the reduction of biodiversity loss b) the mitigation of the negative impact that anthropic activities have on ecosystems. As these are subject to a continuous transformation process, it is essential that the design methodology considers its underlying properties. Hence, arises the need of a profound paradigm shift: integrate better the human landscape into the natural one. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to understand first landscape dynamics as well as the mechanisms that facilitate its resilience and functionality in ecological terms. This is possible thanks to the strategic framework of the Ecological Infrastructure. The landscape proposal must evaluate then the sequence of actions to be carried out, the measures necessary for the improvement of the recognised systems, and its possible evolution over time. Then, according to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agreed by the EU 2030 biodiversity strategies, the proposal must demonstrate: How biodiversity will improve and how it will be preserved - How ecological processes linked to biodiversity will be upgraded - How cultural and social processes linked to the site will be enhanced - How agricultural and energy production will increase land efficiency - How disturbances will be modulated and controlled. This methodology carried out in Spain aims to demonstrate that the implementation of agrivoltaic fields create an optimal synergy to ensure food security and mitigate the effects of climate change, but also provide the chance to make the landscape more sustainable, efficient, and beautiful.",Not About Sufficiency
Human health outcomes of a restored ecological balance in African agro-landscapes,"Biodiversity loss and invasive species are exacting negative economic, environmental and societal impacts. While the monetary aspects of species invasion have been well-assessed, their impacts on human and social livelihood outcomes routinely remain obscure. Here, we empirically demonstrate several important human health and de-mographic consequences of a 1970s invasive pest species of cassava across sub-Saharan Africa. Pest-induced crop loss in 18 African countries relying heavily on cassava as a staple inflicted cascading effects on human birth rate (-6%) and adult mortality (+4%) over the span of a decade. The 1981 scientifically-guided release of the special-ist parasitic wasp Anagyrus lopezi restored cassava yields, thus reconstituting food security in these agricultural systems and enabling parallel improvements in human health indices. Our analysis shows how agricultural per-formance can influence health and demographic outcomes, and accentuates how deliberate efforts to safeguard agro-ecological functions and resilience could be important during times of global environmental change.

A community-based evaluation of population growth and agro-pastoralist resilience in Sub-Saharan drylands,"Human population growth is considered together with climate warming as major driver of change in Sub-Saharan Africa. Research on the implications of increased population densities often utilises community knowledge but without incorporating the view of local stakeholders. In this study, we applied a community centred approach to assess direct and indirect consequences of population growth in drylands of north-western Kenya. Combined social, agricultural and geo-spatial analyses allowed us to identify major system transitions, determine their linkage to population growth and deduce consequences for local livelihoods and community resilience. Community-members reported positive and negative consequences of fourfold population growth since 1974 but evaluated its overall effect as clearly beneficial. This overall positive effect was based on both, positive developments and the successful mitigation of potential system stressors. First, food security was maintained despite high growth rates because a shift from migratory pastoralism to a more labour-intensive agro-pastoralist system helped to increase agricultural productivity. Additionally, land-use changes were linked to land privatisation and improved erosion protection on private land, decoupling population growth from environmental degradation. We detected, however also early warning signs of reduced community resilience as households were unable to fully recover livestock densities after catastrophic events. A population-growth driven reduction in household land-sizes and the decreased monetary value of agricultural production were identified as drivers of this development. The extrapolation of our results to establish a general relationship between population densities, land-use and household resilience in Sub-Saharan drylands suggest that further system transformations will be required to ensure regional food-security.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the convergence of natural flows for the generation of natural capital stocks in marine ecosystems,"Marine ecosystems are open, complex, adaptive, and hierarchical systems highly integrated through the exchange of matter and energy flows. This flows exchange allows marine ecosystems to operate at different scales acting as dissipative structures, building natural capital stocks capable of generating several ecosystem services vital for human well-being. Humans derive a wide range of goods and services from marine ecosystems while, at the same time, generate several impacts causing biodiversity loss and seriously affecting their capacity to provide benefits to humans. Effective management strategies are crucial to conserve healthy and diverse marine and coastal ecosystems, maintain the valuable functions and services they provide, and allow for sustainable human activities. In recent years, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been increasingly acknowledged worldwide as important tools to conserve biodiversity and achieve human well-being and sustainable development goals. Assessing the value of natural capital and ecosystem services is crucial to raise awareness on their importance, support conservation strategies, and ensure the sustainable management of marine ecosystems. This study aimed at calculating biomass and emergy-based indicators to assess the value of natural capital stocks in a Mediterranean MPA. The assessment was performed through a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model fed with field biomass data collected through ad hoc sampling campaigns performed in the MPA. Four main macro-habitats were investigated: sciaphilic hard bottom (coralligenous bioconstructions), photophilic hard bottom, soft bottom, and Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds. The biomass density of the main autotrophic and heterotrophic taxonomic groups identified in the four macro-habitats of the MPA was evaluated. Based on this biomass matrix, the emergy value of natural capital stocks was assessed. The Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds habitat showed the highest biophysical value (2.32·1019 sej) at MPA scale, while coralligenous bioconstructions resulted the habitat with the highest biophysical value per unit area (2.72·1012 sej m−2). In addition, to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective, the emergy-based indicators were converted into monetary units. The total value of natural capital of the whole MPA resulted in about 46 M€. The results of this study can support local managers and policy makers in the development of management strategies to ensure nature conservation and sustainable human activities. They can be also used as a benchmark for the assessment of natural capital value at larger scales in support of a proper consideration and inclusion of nature value into processes of policy making. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
"Social benefit cost analysis of ecosystem-based climate change adaptations: a community-level case study in Tanna Island, Vanuatu","Small island developing states are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including more intense and frequent extreme weather, warming temperatures, coastal erosion, inundation, and coral bleaching. Locally-specific natural resource threats, associated with population growth and tourism, exacerbate these systemic risks, which are particularly acute where community well-being is subsistence-based and directly reliant on ecosystem services. Garden productivity is falling as the cropping/fallow cycle intensifies and culturally and there is loss of observance of traditional resource taboos, eroding the effectiveness of customary management. Ecosystem based adaptations (EbA) provide a fruitful range of interventions and are beginning to attract development funding. We undertook a social benefit cost analysis for a suite of interconnecting EbAs for Tanna in Vanuatu. We found that funds targeted at increasing the productivity of the gardens returns significant social benefit. This also reduces pressure on natural resource threats and can potentially be adopted by all households on Tanna. In addition, increasing the community's capacity to balance formal forest and reef conservation with customary management can provide small, but nevertheless important complimentary benefits.

"Fairness, effectiveness, and needs satisfaction: New options for designing climate policies","Financial compensations are often proposed to address regressive distributional impacts of carbon taxes. While financial compensations have shown to benefit vulnerable groups distributionally, little is known about their impacts on emission reduction or needs satisfaction. A potential problem with cash compensations is that if households spend this money back into the economy while no additional decarbonisation policies are implemented, emission reductions that arose from the tax may at least partly be reversed. In this letter, we compare the emission savings and impacts on fuel and transport poverty of two compensation options for carbon taxes in 27 European countries. The first option consists of equal per capita rebates for home energy and motor fuel taxes. The second option is the provision of universal green vouchers for renewable electricity and public transport, supported by additional investments in green infrastructures to meet increased demand for such green consumption. Results show that the first option of tax rebates only supports small emission reductions. In contrast, universal green vouchers with expanded green infrastructures would reduce home energy emissions by 92.3 MtCO2e or 13.4%, and motor fuel emissions by 177.5 MtCO2e or 23.8%. If green vouchers and infrastructure were provided without a prior tax, emission savings would be slightly lower compared to the 'tax and voucher' scheme, but fuel and transport poverty would drop by 4.1 and 2.2 percentage points, respectively. In contrast, taxes with rebates would increase fuel and transport poverty by 4.1 and 1.8 percentage points. These findings demonstrate that it is important to take environmental and energy poverty impacts of compensations for unfair distributional impacts of climate policies into account at the design stage. Such compensation measures can achieve higher emission reductions and reduce energy poverty if they involve an expansion of the provision of green goods and services, and if everyone is given fair access to these goods and services. © 2021 The Author(s).

Shaping Land Use Change and Ecosystem Restoration in a Water-Stressed Agricultural Landscape to Achieve Multiple Benefits,"Irrigated agriculture has grown rapidly over the last 50 years, helping food production keep pace with population growth, but also leading to significant habitat and biodiversity loss globally. Now, in some regions, land degradation and overtaxed water resources mean historical production levels may need to be reduced. We demonstrate how analytically supported planning for habitat restoration in stressed agricultural landscapes can recover biodiversity and create co-benefits during transitions to sustainability. We apply our approach in California's San Joaquin Valley where groundwater regulations are driving significant land use change. We link agricultural-economic and land use change models to generate plausible landscapes with different cropping patterns, including temporary fallowing and permanent retirement. We find that a large fraction of the reduced cultivation is met through temporary fallowing, but still estimate over 86,000 hectares of permanent retirement. We then apply systematic conservation planning to identify optimized restoration solutions that secure at least 10,000 hectares of high quality habitat for each of five representative endangered species, accounting for spatially varying opportunity costs specific to each plausible future landscape. The analyses identified consolidated areas common to all land use scenarios where restoration could be targeted to enhance habitat by utilizing land likely to be retired anyway, and by shifting some retirement from regions with low habitat value to regions with high habitat value. We also show potential co-benefits of retirement (derived from avoided nitrogen loadings and soil carbon sequestration), though these require careful consideration of additionality. Our approach provides a generalizable means to inform multi-benefit adaptation planning in response to agricultural stressors. © Copyright © 2020 Bryant, Kelsey, Vogl, Wolny, MacEwan, Selmants, Biswas and Butterfield.",Not About Sufficiency
An assessment of future rewilding potential in the United Kingdom,"Restoring ecosystems is an imperative for addressing biodiversity loss and climate change, and achieving the targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. One form of restoration, rewilding, may have particular promise but may also be precluded by requirements for other forms of land use now or in the future. This opportunity space is critical but challenging to assess. We explored the potential area available for rewilding in Great Britain until the year 2080 with a multisectoral land-use model with several distinct climatic and socioeconomic scenarios. By 2080, areas from 5000 to 7000 km(2) were either unmanaged or managed in ways that could be consistent with rewilding across scenarios without conflicting with the provision of ecosystem services. Beyond these areas, another 24,000-42,000 km(2) of extensive upland management could provide additional areas for rewilding if current patterns of implementation hold in the future. None of these areas, however, coincided reliably with ecosystems of priority for conservation: peatlands, ancient woodlands, or wetlands. Repeatedly, these ecosystems were found to be vulnerable to conversion. Our results are not based on an assumption of support for or benefits from rewilding and do not account for disadvantages, such as potential losses of cultural landscapes or traditional forms of management, that were beyond the modeled ecosystem services. Nevertheless, potential areas for rewilding emerge in a variety of ways, from intensification elsewhere having a substantial but inadvertent land-sparing effect, popular demand for environmental restoration, or a desire for exclusive recreation among the wealthy elite. Our findings therefore imply substantial opportunities for rewilding in the United Kingdom but also a need for interventions to shape the nature and extent of that rewilding to maintain priority conservation areas and societal objectives.",Not About Sufficiency
Defining marine rewilding can help guide theory and practice in marine conservation,"Public concern over global climate change and biodiversity loss has accelerated international efforts to restore natural ecosystems through nature-based solutions. Rewilding is a growing conservation approach encompassing the recovery of ecological and trophic complexity through interventions such as habitat restoration and/or species reintroduction. Here we explore the nascent efforts of marine rewilding using a systems thinking methodology to inform a systematic review and iterative thematic analysis. Marine rewilding involves a diverse range of interventions, showing similarities in ecological principles with terrestrial rewilding, yet it diverges from terrestrial rewilding in the scale of initiatives, predictability of outcomes, and the prominence of social inclusion. To make progress in offering unifying concepts, we propose a definition for marine rewilding: a systemic process requiring deliberate human intervention that involves community participation and ocean stewardship to regenerate degraded marine ecosystems.",Not About Sufficiency
Facilitation and sustainable agriculture: a mechanistic approach to reconciling crop production and conservation,"1. Food security is currently considered a major global problem. However, increasing intensity of food production in agricultural systems has driven reductions in farmland biodiversity. A major challenge is to enable biodiversity conservation whilst addressing the problem of food security. 2. Here we describe how facilitative plant-plant interactions in crop systems could be used to help strike this balance. An obvious example is that of intercropping systems, where combinations of crop species can - under some circumstances - deliver reduced inputs of agrochemicals (fertilizers, pesticides) per unit yield, with potential knock-on benefits for biodiversity conservation. 3. Other facilitative processes can also play a role in biodiversity conservation. Increased intraspecific crop genetic diversity can help protect crops from pests and diseases. Although overlooked in facilitation research, we argue that the mechanisms operate in a manner which is directly analogous to associational defence against herbivores, a process well recognized in the facilitation literature. As with intercropping, the benefits to nature conservation arise from reduced pesticide use per unit harvested crop. 4. Crops may have facilitative effects on some arable weed species, particularly those that are currently considered rare in intensive farming systems. Work is in its early stages to understand the underlying mechanisms, but it appears that crops might create niche space to which some weed species are adapted. Increasing plant species diversity through niche space creation may then have cascading benefits for other components of farmland biodiversity. 5. Our new understanding of facilitative processes arising from work on crop systems has lessons for the study of facilitative interactions in natural and semi-natural communities. We argue that, although easier to identify and quantify in crop systems, some of these facilitative processes have to date been overlooked in studies of non-crop systems and certainly deserve further consideration. 6. Finally, we discuss what steps may be needed to move from our understanding of the role of facilitation to the development of new agricultural practice. In some cases the challenge may be one of the encouraging uptake of existing practices, and in others more research is needed to understand how new ecological understanding might deliver more sustainable agricultural practice.",Not About Sufficiency
Wild food collection and nutrition under commercial agriculture expansion in agriculture-forest landscapes,"Wild food constitutes a substantial part of household food consumption around the world, but rapid land use changes influence the availability of wild foods, which has implications for smallholders’ food and nutrient intake. With increasing commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation efforts in forested tropical regions, many shifting cultivation systems are being intensified and their extent restricted. Studies examining the consequences of such pressures commonly overlook the diminishing role of wild food. Using a combination of collection diaries, participant observation, remote sensing, and interviews, we examined the role of agriculture-forest landscapes in the provision of wild food in rapidly transforming shifting cultivation communities in northern Laos. We found that wild food contributed less to human diets in areas where pressure on land from commercial agriculture and conservation efforts was more intense. Our results demonstrate that increasing pressure on land creates changes in the shifting cultivation landscape and people's use thereof with negative effects on the quality of nutrition, including protein deficiency, especially in communities adjacent to core conservation areas. Our study shows the importance of adopting a more nutrition-sensitive approach to the linkages between commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation (and the policies that promote them), wild food provisioning, and food security. © 2016 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Investigating the environmental sustainability of a seabass and seabream aquaculture system in Portugal based on life cycle and nexus approaches,"Aquaculture plays an essential role in supplying animal-source food and protein worldwide, in this way contributing to several sustainable development goals. Notwithstanding this, the aquaculture sector's long-term environmental sustainability is a major concern due to overall environmental impacts. To date, and to the best of the authors' knowledge, assessments of aquaculture systems in Portugal from an environmental perspective, and the nexus between resource consumption and nutrition issues, are still lacking. This study bridges this gap by analysing an aquaculture system in Portugal in a comprehensive manner by applying and combining life cycle assessment and resources–protein nexus approaches. The overall results highlight feed as the main factor responsible for the total impact in all impact categories selected, ranging from 74 % to 98 %. Climate change impact results in 2.88 kg CO2-eq per kg of medium-size fish (functional unit). The resources–protein nexus shows that 504.1 MJex is needed to obtain 1 kg of edible protein, with a high dependency on non-renewable resources (59 %), mainly oil by-product fuels used in feed production. After identifying environmental hotspots, potential strategies to be adopted such as resource consumption reduction, eco-certification and ecosystem-based management are suggested, in this way ensuring long-term aquaculture production and environmental sustainability. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Implementing SDG 15: Can large-scale public programs help deliver biodiversity conservation, restoration and management, while assisting human development?","Among the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the proposed SDG 15 promotes activities that, inter alia, Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. An important potential contribution in achieving SDG 15 is through public programmes designed to jointly promote human development through poverty alleviation and improvement of human livelihoods and biodiversity conservation/management/restoration. An analysis of twenty public programmes with such joint objectives yielded twelve lessons learned. In addition to financial commitments, government and intergovernmental agency input for such public programmes includes ensuring political will and appropriate legal frameworks. Local communities and civil society provide input through traditional and indigenous ecological knowledge and stewardship. Appropriate shared inputs in development and the implementation of such public programmes, with communication between local community, broader civil society, the scientific community and governments will result in: better use and management of biodiversity; alleviation of poverty; security of livelihoods and better governance systems. The Ecosystem Approach of the Convention on Biological Diversity provides an ideal framework when planning and implementing new programmes. Application of the lessons learned to new public programmes will ensure that the answer to the question posed in the title is an emphatic Yes, and assist with the achievement of SDG 15.",Not About Sufficiency
The Potential Impact of Climate Change on Soil Properties and Processes and Corresponding Influence on Food Security,"According to the IPCC, global temperatures are expected to increase between 1.1 and 6.4 degrees C during the 21st century and precipitation patterns will be altered. Soils are intricately linked to the atmospheric/climate system through the carbon, nitrogen, and hydrologic cycles. Because of this, altered climate will have an effect on soil processes and properties. Recent studies indicate at least some soils may become net sources of atmospheric C, lowering soil organic matter levels. Soil erosion by wind and water is also likely to increase. However, there are many things we need to know more about. How climate change will affect the N cycle and, in turn, how that will affect C storage in soils is a major research need, as is a better understanding of how erosion processes will be influenced by changes in climate. The response of plants to elevated atmospheric CO2 given limitations in nutrients like N and P, and how that will influence soil organic matter levels, is another critical research need. How soil organic matter levels react to changes in the C and N cycles will influence the ability of soils to support crop growth, which has significant ramifications for food security. Therefore, further study of soil-climate interactions in a changing world is critical to addressing future food security concerns.",Not About Sufficiency
DIVECOSYS: Bringing together researchers to design ecologically-based pest management for small-scale farming systems in West Africa,"Crop pests are a major constraint to the intensification of agricultural production in the tropics, with novel issues related to global change (climate, land use, biological invasions, etc.), food security and preservation of natural resources and biodiversity. A research, extension and education network called DIVECOSYS (Diversity of cropping systems and ecologically-based pest management in West Africa) was launched in 2010 to synergize applied research actions in response to growing concerns on the vulnerability of agricultural systems to pest management in West Africa. This scientific network brings together research and academic institutions, with expertise spanning a multidisciplinary perspective from biology and ecology to remote sensing, agronomy and integrated pest management. Its main scientific objective is to explore the potential of biodiversity and ecological processes such as pest regulation, enabling novel ecologically-based models for productive systems, reduction of pesticide use, and adaptation or resilience of farming systems in the face of environmental disruptions. From Northern Senegal to Southern Benin, the research group explores a wide range of ecoregions and socio-ecological contexts, including stakeholders and their objectives, land use and agricultural practices, and management of biodiversity for enhancing biological control. Main challenges to be turned into opportunities include (i) encouraging collaborations amongst researchers from different scientific fields, (ii) fostering interactive research and synergies among research institutions and among countries, and (iii) developing an ecological engineering approach for the design of sustainable agricultural systems for smallholder farmers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
From integrated to system-wide pest management: Challenges for sustainable agriculture,"Insect pests and vectors of animal and plant diseases are a major constraint to the improvement of agricultural productivity, and a continuous threat to food security and livelihoods, particularly in less developed countries. The excessive reliance on broad-spectrum insecticides as the prevailing strategy to control pest outbreaks for over 50 years worldwide has showed some limitations with the increasing number of documented cases of field-evolved resistance and re-emergence of pests or vector-borne diseases that had been previously placed under control. More widely, agriculture intensification has contributed to the erosion of crop and livestock genetic diversity and fragmentation or suppression of natural habitats supporting biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services such as insect pest regulation. These concerns are being exacerbated in a context of global change, including population growth, global warming, transboundary trade, on-farm loss of biodiversity, and societal demand for a safer environment and residue-free food, which foster increasingly stringent pesticide use in agriculture and livestock farming. Integrated pest management (IPM) is an ecosystem approach to crop production and protection that combines different management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and minimize the use of pesticides. IPM thus requires science-based knowledge of the life cycle of pests and their interactions with the environment, including natural enemies and habitats. Field realities, however, show that IPM is often used in a reactive manner and at a local scale, as a simple toolbox. A fundamental shift to a system-wide approach is needed to achieve preventive and effective pest control, while enhancing crop yields, and reducing farmers' reliance on pesticide use and the associated environmental impacts. This shift should at least consider: (i) the functional area of the target pest populations; (ii) the complexity of ecological processes driving regulation; and (iii) the intelligent combination of pest control technologies. Area-wide integrated pest management is a promising way to improve conventional pest control by targeting pest populations within their functional area. This approach requires a better knowledge of target pests, especially regarding their life system (spatial distribution, habitats, dispersal ability over time and space, genetic structure, metapopulation dynamics and gene flow), ecological processes driving regulation (food web networks and natural enemy assemblages), and responses to farming practices at a field and landscape scale. In addition, the success of such an approach relies on a strong cooperation amongst stakeholders for the design, implementation and compliance of pest management programs, and requires farmer education and external coordination, either from governmental bodies or farmers associations. © 2014 Research Information Ltd.

Soil and water conservation measures to adapt cropping systems to climate change facilitated water stresses in Africa,"Complex controls and non-linear responses of the climate system to global warming make it difficult to have clear-cut predictions of future precipitation amounts and timelines. It is, however, evident from current observations that some predictions of unusually high rates of flooding and droughts are occurring and threatening food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The impact of climate change is immense on SSA though it contributes the least to climate change globally. Crops face lots of growth challenges which reduce their productivity under drought and flood conditions. SSA must prepare agricultural soils for the anticipated climate variabilities, to ensure sustainable food availability. The effort to adapt soils to climate change must be a concerted one, using technologies from various facets of science. Stakeholders must adopt water-smart strategies that maintain proper soil-water balance. They should focus on manageable inherent soil properties that control the susceptibility/adaptability of cropping systems to climate change. Conservation agriculture techniques that target improving soil organic matter and maintaining soil life; protecting the soil from compaction and erosion; reducing soil disturbance; enhancing soil infiltration and groundwater recharge capacity, must be applied to our soils. A number of these techniques equip the soils to be better sinks of excess water in flood-prone areas and improve water-holding capacities in drought-prone ones. Governments, farmers, and all stakeholders must also invest in both simple and complex water harvesting/ re-directing infrastructure which conserve water for future use. Water-efficient irrigation systems must be employed by farmers during water scarcity. Most importantly, gaps between research, industry, farmers, and governments must be bridged to for easy flow of information on improved technologies and quick adoption of climate change mitigation strategies.

Opportunities and Strategies to Incorporate Ecosystem Services Knowledge and Decision Support Tools into Planning and Decision Making in Hawai'i,"Incorporating ecosystem services into management decisions is a promising means to link conservation and human well-being. Nonetheless, planning and management in Hawai'i, a state with highly valued natural capital, has yet to broadly utilize an ecosystem service approach. We conducted a stakeholder assessment, based on semi-structured interviews, with terrestrial (n = 26) and marine (n = 27) natural resource managers across the State of Hawai'i to understand the current use of ecosystem services (ES) knowledge and decision support tools and whether, how, and under what contexts, further development would potentially be useful. We found that ES knowledge and tools customized to Hawai'i could be useful for communication and outreach, justifying management decisions, and spatial planning. Greater incorporation of this approach is clearly desired and has a strong potential to contribute to more sustainable decision making and planning in Hawai'i and other oceanic island systems. However, the unique biophysical, socio-economic, and cultural context of Hawai'i, and other island systems, will require substantial adaptation of existing ES tools. Based on our findings, we identified four key opportunities for the use of ES knowledge and tools in Hawai'i: (1) linking native forest protection to watershed health; (2) supporting sustainable agriculture; (3) facilitating ridge-to-reef management; and (4) supporting statewide terrestrial and marine spatial planning. Given the interest expressed by natural resource managers, we envision broad adoption of ES knowledge and decision support tools if knowledge and tools are tailored to the Hawaiian context and coupled with adequate outreach and training.",Not About Sufficiency

We aim to evaluate the benefits of RS to monitor spatio-temporal variations of ES by assessing several ES in Switzerland between 2004 and 2014. We coupled mechanistic ES models and RS data to estimate time series of three regulating (i.e. carbon dioxide regulation (CO2R), soil erosion prevention (SEP), and air quality regulation (AQR)) and one cultural ES (recreational hiking (RH)).

Resulting ES trends showed diverse spatial patterns across Switzerlind with largest changes in CO2R and AQR. ES interactions revealed a scale and elevation dependency. We identified weak to strong synergies between all ES combinations except for trade-offs between CO2R AQR and AQR RH at Swiss scale. Spatially, all ES interactions revealed a heterogeneous mix of synergies and trade-offs within Switzerland.

"Food security, climate change, and sustainable land management. A review","Agriculture production in developing countries must be increased to meet food demand for a growing population. Earlier literature suggests that sustainable land management could increase food production without degrading soil and water resources. Improved agronomic practices include organic fertilization, minimum soil disturbance, and incorporation of residues, terraces, water harvesting and conservation, and agroforestry. These practices can also deliver co-benefits in the form of reduced greenhouse gas emissions and enhanced carbon storage in soils and biomass. Here, we review 160 studies reporting original field data on the yield effects of sustainable land management practices sequestering soil carbon. The major points are: (1) sustainable land management generally leads to increased yields, although the magnitude and variability of results varies by specific practice and agro-climatic conditions. For instance, yield effects are in some cases negative for improved fallows, terraces, minimum tillage, and live fences. Whereas, positive yield effects are observed consistently for cover crops, organic fertilizer, mulching, and water harvesting. Yields are also generally higher in areas of low and variable rainfall. (2) Isolating the yield effects of individual practices is complicated by the adoption of combinations or ""packages"" of sustainable land management options. (3) Sustainable land management generally increases soil carbon sequestration. Agroforestry increases aboveground C sequestration and organic fertilization reduces CO 2 emissions. (4) Rainfall distribution is a key determinant of the mitigation effects of adopting specific sustainable land management practices. Mitigation effects of adopting sustainable land management are higher in higher rainfall areas, with the exception of water management. © 2013 INRA and Springer-Verlag France.",Not About Sufficiency
Economic microbiology: exploring microbes as agents in economic systems,"Microbial communities exhibit striking parallels with economic markets, resembling intricate ecosystems where microorganisms engage in resource exchange akin to human market transactions. This dynamic network of resource swapping mirrors economic trade in human markets, with microbes specializing in metabolic functions much like businesses specializing in goods and services. Cooperation and competition are central dynamics in microbial communities, with alliances forming for mutual benefit and species vying for dominance, similar to businesses seeking market share. The human microbiome, comprising trillions of microorganisms within and on our bodies, is not only a marker of socioeconomic status but also a critical factor contributing to persistent health inequalities. Social and economic factors shape the composition of the gut microbiota, impacting healthcare access and quality of life. Moreover, these microbes exert indirect influence over human decisions by affecting neurotransmitter production, influencing mood, behavior, and choices related to diet and emotions. Human activities significantly impact microbial communities, from dietary choices and antibiotic use to environmental changes, disrupting these ecosystems. Beyond their natural roles, humans harness microbial communities for various applications, manipulating their interactions and resource exchanges to achieve specific goals in fields like medicine, agriculture, and environmental science. In conclusion, the concept of microbial communities as biological markets offers valuable insights into their intricate functioning and adaptability. It underscores the profound interplay between microbial ecosystems and human health and behavior, with far-reaching implications for multiple disciplines.

Modeling the dynamics of the integrated earth system and the value of global ecosystem services using the GUMBO model,"A global unified metamodel of the biosphere (GUMBO) was developed to simulate the integrated earth system and assess the dynamics and values of ecosystem services. It is a 'metamodel' in that it represents a synthesis and a simplification of several existing dynamic global models in both the natural and social sciences at an intermediate level of complexity. The current version of the model contains 234 state variables, 930 variables total, and 1715 parameters. GUMBO is the first global model to include the dynamic feedbacks among human technology, economic production and welfare, and ecosystem goods and services within the dynamic earth system. GUMBO includes modules to simulate carbon, water, and nutrient fluxes through the Atmosphere, Lithosphere, Hydrosphere, and Biosphere of the global system. Social and economic dynamics are simulated within the Anthroposphere. GUMBO links these five spheres across eleven biomes, which together encompass the entire surface of the planet. The dynamics of eleven major ecosystem goods and services for each of the biomes are simulated and evaluated. Historical calibrations from 1900 to 2000 for 14 key variables for which quantitative time-series data was available produced an average R2 of 0.922. A range of future scenarios representing different assumptions about future technological change, investment strategies and other factors have been simulated. The relative value of ecosystem services in terms of their contribution to supporting both conventional economic production and human well-being more broadly defined were estimated under each scenario, and preliminary conclusions drawn. The value of global ecosystem services was estimated to be about 4.5 times the value of Gross World Product (GWP) in the year 2000 using this approach. The model can be downloaded and run on the average PC to allow users to explore for themselves the complex dynamics of the system and the full range of policy assumptions and scenarios. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Soil security in sustainable development,"The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide an excellent channel to demonstrate the significance of soils when considering e.g., food production, water availability, climate mitigation and biodiversity preservation. For environmental sciences, including soil science, the SDGs provide “a point at the horizon” for future research. Progress to achieve the SDGs by 2030 will bureaucratically be monitored by targets and indicators but questions as to how effective research should be organized remain unanswered so far. The soil security concept, based on the five Cs (capability, condition, capital, connectivity and codification) can provide a clear guideline for soil science research, defining soil functions contributing to interdisciplinary ecosystem services that, in turn, can define measures to reach SDGs. A “storyline” is proposed linking the five Cs, emphasizing connectivity that becomes increasingly important in our modern “fact-free” world. The traditional linear research model does not apply when characterizing SDGs because of many conflicting interests that don’t allow definition of specific “solutions”. But different action-perspectives can be defined as a basis for decision making, creating much needed transparency in the decision process. Soil contributions are most effective when framed in the context of soil-water-atmosphere-plant models. Proper codification, including clear and candid communication with stakeholders, is essential to link science with society, a link that needs improvement. © 2019 by the author.

Facing policy challenges with inter- and transdisciplinary soil research focused on the UN Sustainable Development Goals,"Our current information society, populated by increasingly well-informed and critical stakeholders, presents a challenge to both the policy and science arenas. The introduction of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offers a unique and welcome opportunity to direct joint activities towards these goals. Soil science, even though it is not mentioned as such, plays an important role in realizing a number of SDGs focusing on food, water, climate, health, biodiversity, and sustainable land use. A plea is made for a systems approach to land use studies, to be initiated by soil scientists, in which these land-related SDGs are considered in an integrated manner. To connect with policy makers and stakeholders, two approaches are functional. The first of these is the policy cycle when planning and executing research, which includes signaling, design, decision making, implementation, and evaluation. Many current research projects spend little time on signaling, which may lead to disengagement of stakeholders. Also, implementation is often seen as the responsibility of others, while it is crucial to demonstrate - if successful - the relevance of soil science. The second approach is the DPSIR approach when following the policy cycle in land-related research, distinguishing external drivers, pressures, impact, and responses to land use change that affect the state of the land in the past, present, and future. Soil science cannot by itself realize SDGs, and interdisciplinary studies on ecosystem services (ESs) provide an appropriate channel to define contributions of soil science in terms of the seven soil functions. ESs, in turn, can contribute to addressing the six SDGs (2, 3, 6, 12, 13, and 15) with an environmental, land-related character. SDGs have a societal focus and future soil science research can only be successful if stakeholders are part of the research effort in transdisciplinary projects, based on the principle of time-consuming ""joint learning"".

"Microplastics removal from a hospital laundry wastewater combining ceramic membranes and a photocatalytic membrane reactor: Fouling mitigation, water reuse, and cost estimation","The release of microplastics (MPs) through industrial laundry wastewater accounts for 35 % of global MPs emissions into the environment and it is a significant environmental problem, especially because MPs can absorb contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from garments. This study is the first to evaluate and perform a cost estimation of the MP removal from hospital laundry wastewater (HLWW) using a combination of ceramic membranes and a pilot-scale photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR) as a fouling mitigation strategy. The HLWW, from a hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark, contained a total organic carbon (TOC) of 345 mg L⁻1 and 1.4 × 106 MP L−1, mainly of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) ranging between 100 and 200 μm in size. The pre-treatment with an ultrafiltration (UF) ZrO₂ membrane successfully removed 96 % of MPs and over 98 % of suspended solids and turbidity at an estimated cost of 0.45 US$ per m3 of permeate. In the PMR stage, ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LED) irradiation reduced irreversible fouling, improving permeate flow and minimizing the need for chemical cleaning. The Ce–Y–ZrO2/TiO2 photocatalytic membrane achieved over 99 % removal of turbidity, colour, and suspended solids, as well as 99.9 % removal of MPs, allowing the potential effluent reuse within the hospital laundry. Additionally, the retentate from the PMR process had lower TOC, easing the discharge of this concentrated stream. The cost estimation demonstrated that the photocatalytic degradation combined with traditional techniques, i.e. backflush and chemical cleaning, is more economical than using these techniques separately. Therefore, the total treatment cost was 1.09 US$ per m3 of permeate, which is lower than the cost of fresh water in Denmark. In conclusion, this innovative treatment strategy offers a sustainable and cost-effective solution for HLWW management, not only reducing water consumption by enabling water reuse in the hospital laundry but also advances towards achieving net-zero liquid discharge and contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals for clean water (Goal 6) and climate action (Goal 13). © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Achieving sustainable development in rural areas in Colombia: Future scenarios for biodiversity conservation under land use change,"Agricultural expansion is a complex land use change phenomenon with deep environmental and socio-economic consequences, especially across tropical countries where most of this expansion is occurring. Here we use scenario and network analysis combined with sustainability assessment to understand the drivers of landscape change and their effects on sustainable development in Colombia's rural areas, using the Central Magdalena region as a case study, and ultimately informing strategies to reconcile agricultural expansion with biodiversity conservation and rural development. Using this approach we investigated three environmental and agricultural policy scenarios: the Business as Usual scenario, enforcing a stronger regulatory framework, and adopting incentives. Our analysis show that the Business as Usual scenario is not supported by stakeholders and negatively affects most sustainability objectives with the predominant agricultural sectors in the region (cattle ranching and oil palm) not improving social inequality, and threatening biodiversity, natural resources, and food security. Both alternative scenarios improve overall sustainability, including biodiversity. Therefore to reconcile agricultural expansion, biodiversity and sustainable development, it is important to adopt a stronger regulatory and enforcement framework at different administrative levels, as well as incentive schemes focusing on small holders. Our study also shows that history cannot be ignored when thinking about the future and sustainability especially in areas with legacies of strong inequalities caused by armed conflict. Finally, we suggest that combining scenario analysis, network analysis, and sustainability assessment is a useful methodology for studying land use changes holistically, exploring complex systems at different scales, and informing locally-relevant strategies and recommendations, ultimately enabling science to be proactive. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Modern Aspects of the Complex Interactions between Biodiversity and the Main Neuropsychiatric Disorders,"The high incidence of psychopathologies recorded in today's human society, correlated with the high percentages of biodiversity loss, point to the need for an interdisciplinary approach of the scientific fields under study-neuroscience and biodiversity conservation. Thus, our approach here presents, in a synergistic manner, the significant correlation between mental health and the increased values of biodiversity in the ecosystems located in the immediate vicinity, especially those located in the middle of cities. Our approach aims to emphasize the importance of biodiversity conservation in the context of preserving mental health and general well-being. There are a series of recent experimental demonstrations that outline the influence of natural elements on the human psyche and, implicitly, the effects of nature in the prevention and reduction of stress, anxiety, and depression. And beyond the cognitive barriers of humanity in relating to the surrounding biodiversity must lie the desire to know the values of biodiversity and the absolute importance of its conservation. The sustainable relationship between humans and living nature, seen as a complex of biodiversity, is dealt with by a branch of science called human ecology. Therefore, this study emphasizes the crucial need to know and respect the connection between man and nature, based, since time immemorial, on biophilia.

Insecticide exposure can increase burrow network production and alter burrow network structure in soil dwelling insects (Agriotes spp.),"Insecticide treated seeds are commonly used to reduce yield losses from burrowing insect damage such as wireworms. Using temporal X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) of soil-filled bioassays, we aimed to quantify changes in burrow network production and structure as a measure of wireworm behavioural change in response to three types of insecticide treated maize seed; compound X (R&D product in field trial stage of development); tefluthrin and thiamethoxam. A biopesticide alternative treatment (neem), untreated maize seed and bare soil were also investigated. Insect health outcomes were also monitored to provide toxicity/mortality data. Wireworms exposed to compound X produced greater burrow networks than untreated maize and neem treatments, similar to that in volume of those produced in bare soil. Compound X exposure also elicited the production of more complex burrow structures, a function of the number of vertices, edges and faces of a shape (V-E+F) related to the number of interconnected branches, compared to any other treatments. Compound X, tefluthrin and thiamethoxam induced mortality at greater rates than neem or untreated, suggesting all three could have potential to manage wireworm populations and reduce yield loss, but only compound X modified burrowing behaviour. With soil biopores playing an important role in soil productivity and carbon sequestration, the wider implications of this increase in burrowing activity for food security and climate change warrants further exploration. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

Nourishing sustainability: Clinical nutrition's impact on climate change,"Introduction: Preserving our planet's delicate balance is not merely a choice but a responsibility we owe to future generations, ensuring equitable, and sustainable world. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations (UN) member states in 2015, offers a collective vision for global peace and prosperity. Central to this agenda are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which call for unified action from all nations, irrespective of their developmental status, under a global partnership. Method: This paper examines the SDGs' framework and its applicability to clinical nutrition (CN). We provide a comprehensive narrative review relating to the integration of SDGs in CN practices. Whilst recognising the importance of the SDG framework we elected to focus specifically upon the environmental aspects of CN care. Results: The analysis revealed that the SDGs provide a robust framework for promoting sustainability in clinical nutrition. Key findings highlight the interconnection between health improvement and other SDGs, such as poverty reduction and climate action. Effective CN practices contribute to broader sustainable development by ensuring better health outcomes, which in turn support economic growth and reduce inequalities. Additionally, strategies in CN that focus on reducing waste and improving resource efficiency align with environmental sustainability goals. Conclusion: The 17 SDGs offer a comprehensive guide for advancing sustainability across various fields, including clinical nutrition. By adopting these goals, healthcare providers can implement holistic strategies that not only improve health outcomes but also support broader efforts to achieve global sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism",Not About Sufficiency
Taking an environmental ethics perspective to understand what we should expect from EIA in terms of biodiversity protection,"As a globally mandated decision-support tool, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has the potential to contribute to the protection of biodiversity, which is increasingly under threat because of human activities. Concern over its ability to do this, however, has led to the addition of trade-off rules, Ecosystem Services Assessment (ESA), and biodiversity offsets. But given that EIA is set in a political decision-making context, what is reasonable to expect of EIA? In this paper we seek to explore what level of biodiversity protection we can expect EIA to support (and therefore whether these additions are worthwhile). Our point of departure is that EIA supports its political context and associated societal goals, and those goals typically (explicitly or implicitly) reflect some form of sustainable development. Given that the appropriate level of biodiversity protection is a moral consideration, we take an environmental ethics perspective to explain how different levels of protection are associated with different ethical positions on a spectrum from anthropocentrism (where only humans have intrinsic rights) through to ecocentrism (where all individuals of all species have intrinsic rights). We then investigate how different sustainable development discourses, one economic (on a spectrum from weak to strong sustainability) and one ecological (on a spectrum from shallow to deep ecology) map against the environmental ethics spectrum. We find that the economic discourse on sustainable development, which tends to prevail in political decision-making, is heavily anthropocentric, whereas an ecological discourse has some potential to deliver ecocentrism, but only where a deep ecology interpretation is adopted. We then show that the practise of EIA (with or without the addition of other approaches) maps against, and is bounded by, an economic discourse on sustainable development. The reality is, therefore, that EIA can do no more than contribute to delaying incremental biodiversity loss. If EIA were legislated to protect biodiversity using a deep ecology discourse, then only brownfield development would be possible. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency

The Importance of Protected Areas in Mitigating Climate Change and Conserving Ecosystems in Latin America and the Caribbean,"Biodiversity conservation in a world under climate change is a significant challenge for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), which holds 60% of global terrestrial life. Six of the ten most biodiverse countries (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela) are in LAC, and biodiversity hotspots are well-represented along the region’s coasts and mainland. The region has the most significant areas of tropical forest and large portions of subtropical forests, temperate steppe, and subantarctic Patagonia. Protected areas offer opportunities to conserve unique biodiversity, provide ecosystem services, and mitigate climate change effects. LAC’s contribution to carbon capture, by protecting extensive forests and other natural ecosystems, is potentially opening tremendous economic opportunities under the green economy paradigm. This chapter describes the current status of protected areas in LAC and explains how this conservation mechanism should play a mitigation role. LAC’s protected areas cover almost all types of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and their number is increasing in the region. Although protected areas mitigate the effects of climate change on biodiversity, climate change and traditional environmental problems like deforestation, mining, and agriculture affect the viability of protected areas. Thus, their expansion and connectivity throughout the region are crucial to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. Nature is also essential to the region’s biocultural diversity, including a miriad of complex cosmovisions and traditions.

Instead, external inputs have been used to boost yields, while exacting costs on public goods. Ecological intensification capitalizes on ecosystem services to enhance and stabilize production and reduce the need for external inputs, while sparing the environment. Of particular relevance are biodiversity-based ES connected to soil fertility, pest control and pollination. Ecological intensification is applicable in all regions, but for food security purposes, particular attention should be dedicated to implement it as ecological enhancement in regions with wide yield gaps, coinciding with poor food security. Diversified cropping system show promise to create win-win situations. Knowledge on ecology and socio-economy of ES will be needed, and agricultural research and innovation need to heed to resource use efficiency, production stability, minimal environmental impact, buffering of extreme events and adaptation to local conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Changing Arctic snow cover: A review of recent developments and assessment of future needs for observations, modelling, and impacts","Snow is a critically important and rapidly changing feature of the Arctic. However, snow-cover and snowpack conditions change through time pose challenges for measuring and prediction of snow. Plausible scenarios of how Arctic snow cover will respond to changing Arctic climate are important for impact assessments and adaptation strategies. Although much progress has been made in understanding and predicting snow-cover changes and their multiple consequences, many uncertainties remain. In this paper, we review advances in snow monitoring and modelling, and the impact of snow changes on ecosystems and society in Arctic regions. Interdisciplinary activities are required to resolve the current limitations on measuring and modelling snow characteristics through the cold season and at different spatial scales to assure human well-being, economic stability, and improve the ability to predict manage and adapt to natural hazards in the Arctic region. © 2016, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Corporate responsibility and biodiversity conservation: challenges and opportunities for companies participating in China's Belt and Road Initiative,"China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), designed to build critical infrastructure and coordinate economic growth, is the most significant development initiative in modern history. The BRI has a documented vision for sustainability, including environmental impact assessments and responsibility tenets. Despite this, a growing body of literature has found adverse effects of BRI projects on protected land and species. To understand corporate responsibility and regulations for companies participating in the BRI, we gathered information on 260 BRI companies using the Refinitiv Eikon BRI Connect database and the China Global Investment Tracker. The results revealed a significant gap in corporate responsibility reporting for biodiversity impacts, environmental restoration, environmental project financing and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 14 'Life below Water' and 15 'Life on Land'. The modest fraction of companies that we found to report biodiversity accountability highlights the need to restructure and incentivize the reporting of environmental and biodiversity risks. The current evidence of limited adherence to responsibility measures highlights a clear opportunity to align BRI development with the BRI's vision for sustainability, and to strengthen links for policy engagement within Chinese regulatory frameworks and international obligations at the United Nations within its SDG framework. © The Author(s), 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Technoscience and Biodiversity Conservation,"The discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 has opened new avenues in gene editing. This system, usually considered as molecular scissors, permits the cutting of the DNA at a targeted site allowing the introduction of new genes or the removal or the modification of existing ones. The genome-editing, involving gene drive or not, is then considered with a strong interest in a variety of fields ranging from agriculture to public health and conservation biology. Given its controversial aspects, it is then no surprise that actors in biodiversity conservation do express conflicting views on this emerging and disruptive technology. The positions are ranging from a request for a moratorium to the will to test and deploy it in strategies aiming at eradicating invasive species of mammals on islands. Reviewing some of its recent developments brings light on the conflicts of interest, the financial support, and lobbying currently occurring in this growing field of biotechnology. While an optimistic view on the use of gene drive for ecosystem conservation was first promoted by several molecular biologists, the risks and uncertainties associated have now led to some reservations. Overall, the eventual use of this novel approach for conservation raises concerns related to the engagement of the public, the communication between scientists, and the public and the risk of a manufactured consent. There are also a series of essential ethical and philosophical questions on the relations we have with Nature that needs to be answered. © 2018, National University of Singapore and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
THE COLLAPSE OF THE GLOBAL CONSUMPTION MODEL: IN SEARCH OF SUSTAINABILITY,"New “climate change reality” is transforming the goals that were the most important two or three years ago. During the last few years, the EU, U.S., China, Japan and many other countries established new plans to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050–2060s. These new goals and plans towards achieving carbon neutrality and greening national economies require a fundamental change in consumption patterns. The growth in demand leads to an increase in consumption, which, in turn, stimulates an increase in production and the volume of resources involved (energy, minerals, land, water, etc.). One of the most important indicators of the global consumption model is decoupling, which means the growth of the economy without corresponding rise of environmental pressure and resource consumption. Although there were some signs of the decoupling effect in the developed countries during the previous two decades, it was not achieved on the global scale during that period. Moreover, by 2060s, the resource consumption of the world economy may escalate significantly. At the global level, the growth of consumption in developed countries can lead to an overall increase in the impact on the planet’s biosphere. This impact relates to the “export” of environmental costs from developed countries to developing ones, which can be clearly observed on the example of the greenhouse gas emissions indicator. The same pattern manifests itself as an increase in the UN Planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index. The general trend is: the higher the level of human development – the greater the index of the planetary pressure. Finally, the transition of mankind to sustainable development requires a profound transformation of consumption patterns due to the impossibility to maintain high environmentally intensive consumption standards for the next generations, based on the accomplished technological level, traditional economic model and established institutions. © 2022, Russian Academy of Sciences.

"Changes in food access by mestizo communities associated with deforestation and agrobiodiversity loss in Ucayali, Peruvian Amazon","Few longitudinal studies link agricultural biodiversity, land use and food access in rural landscapes. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that, in a context of economic change, cash crop expansion is associated with deforestation, reduced agrobiodiversity and changes in food access. For this purpose, we analysed data collected from the same 53 upland and floodplain mestizo households in Ucayali, Peru, in 2000 and 2015. We found an emerging transition towards less diversified food access coupled with loss of forest cover and reduced agricultural biodiversity. In 2015, diets appeared to rely on fewer food groups, fewer food items, and on products increasingly purchased in the market compared to 2000. Wild fruits and plants were mentioned, but rarely consumed. Agricultural production systems became more specialised with a shift towards commercial crops. Peak deforestation years in the 15-year period appeared linked with incentives for agricultural expansion. Our results suggest an overall trend from diversified productive and “extractive” systems and more diverse food access, towards specialized productive systems, with less diverse food access and stronger market orientation (both in production and consumption). The assumption in the food and agricultural sciences that increased income and market-orientation is linked to improved food security, is challenged by our integrated analyses of food access, agrobiodiversity, land use and forest cover. Our results highlight the importance of longitudinal, multidimensional, systemic analyses, with major implications for land use, food and health policies. The potential risks of parallel homogenisation of diets and agricultural production systems require interdisciplinary research and policies that promote integrated landscape approaches for sustainable and inclusive food systems. © 2020, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"What specific plant traits support ecosystem services such as pollination, bio-control and water quality protection in temperate climates? A systematic map protocol","Background: Agricultural intensification has increased diffuse source pollution within water catchments, reduced heterogeneity within the landscape and caused major declines in farmland wildlife, including birds, mammals, invertebrates and wildflowers. This increase in pollution and wildlife decline, has effected three vital ecosystem services, pollination, biological pest control and water quality protection. The morphological traits of plant species, such as floral display size and leaf area, provide support to these services and vegetative strips can be established with plants that have these desirable traits. Vegetative strips are widely used across Europe and integrated into government environmental schemes such as The Common Agricultural Policy and The Water Framework Directive. However, issues of land availability and food security require a sustainable intensification of current agricultural practices. One component of this process is to sow vegetative strips that are designed to support multiple ecosystem services. To do this, combinations of plant species that will support specific ecosystem services, have been designed. However, to enable a fully-informed design process, evidence must be collated on which specific plant traits provide the support to the target ecosystem services. We propose to systematically map all evidence on which specific plant traits provide support for three of the most vital ecosystem services, pollination, bio-control and water quality protection. Information from this map could inform future decisions on which plant species are suitable for inclusion within a multifunctional vegetative strip that aims to provide the target ecosystem services. The aim of this systematic map is to create a searchable database of studies that demonstrate evidence of plant traits and how they support the named ecosystem services. Methods: Seven bibliographic databases, 25 organisational websites and 2 search engines, will be systematically searched with predefined and tested key search terms. All searches will be undertaken in English and only those undertaken in a temperate climate zone will be considered. Studies found will be screened at title, abstract and full text levels, recording the number of excluded articles. Following full text assessment, the meta-data of included studies will be incorporated into a systematic map database in Microsoft Access. A report will summarise the evidence, highlight any knowledge gaps, and provide recommendations for future research.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change and marine fisheries: Least developed countries top global index of vulnerability,"Future impacts of climate change on marine fisheries have the potential to negatively influence a wide range of socio-economic factors, including food security, livelihoods and public health, and even to reshape development trajectories and spark transboundary conflict. Yet there is considerable variability in the vulnerability of countries around the world to these effects. We calculate a vulnerability index of 147 countries by drawing on the most recent data related to the impacts of climate change on marine fisheries. Building on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change framework for vulnerability, we first construct aggregate indices for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity using 12 primary variables. Seven out of the ten most vulnerable countries on the resulting index are Small Island Developing States, and the top quartile of the index includes countries located in Africa (17), Asia (7), North America and the Caribbean (4) and Oceania (8). More than 87% of least developed countries are found within the top half of the vulnerability index, while the bottom half includes all but one of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member states. This is primarily due to the tremendous variation in countries’ adaptive capacity, as no such trends are evident from the exposure or sensitivity indices. A negative correlation exists between vulnerability and per capita carbon emissions, and the clustering of states at different levels of development across the vulnerability index suggests growing barriers to meeting global commitments to reducing inequality, promoting human well-being and ensuring sustainable cities and communities. The index provides a useful tool for prioritizing the allocation of climate finance, as well as activities aimed at capacity building and the transfer of marine technology. © 2017 Blasiak et al.

"Peasant family farming multifunctionality index (Pffmi): Case study, municipality of calpan, puebla","Peasant farming systems are multifunctional, since their culture-based structure generates different environmental, social and economic functions. However, agricultural modernization and the change from agricultural to urban zones have caused the loss of multifunctionality in these systems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to generate a peasant family farming multifunctionality index for the municipality of Calpan, Puebla. A survey was conducted to gather information and the instrument was a questionnaire applied to a sample of 81 producers. A peasant family farming multifunctionality index (PFFMI) was generated, made up of four fields: Sociocultural, environmental, economic, and territorial; four general functions, 12 specific ones, and 17 indicators. The results show a PFFMI of 72.61, corresponding to category IV, medium high, with outstanding functions such as: Conservation of knowledge, maintenance of agricultural biodiversity, conservation of agroecological practices, consolidation of food security, promotion of job generation, support of landscapes configurations, and rootedness of the territory. The study concludes that peasant family farming maintains a high functionality. © 2024, Revista de Geografia Norte Grande. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency

Rapid assessment of ecosystem services provided by two mineral extraction sites restored for nature conservation in an agricultural landscape in eastern england,"Despite growing recognition that mineral sites restored for nature conservation can enhance local biodiversity, the wider societal benefits provided by this type of restoration relative to alternative options are not well understood. This study addresses this research gap by quantifying differences in ecosystem services provision under two common mineral site after-uses: nature conservation and agriculture. Using a combination of site-specific primary field data, benefits transfer and modelling, we show that for our sites restoration for nature conservation provides a more diverse array of ecosystem services than would be delivered under an agricultural restoration scenario. We also explore the effects of addressing different conservation targets, which we find alter the provision of ecosystem services on a service-specific basis. Highly species-focused intervention areas are associated with increased carbon storage and livestock grazing provision, whereas non-intervention areas are important for carbon sequestration, fishing, recreation and flood risk mitigation. The results of this study highlight the wider societal importance of restored mineral sites and may help conservation managers and planners to develop future restoration strategies that provide benefits for both biodiversity and human well-being. © 2015 Blaen et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Life Cycle Assessment of an Avocado: Grown in South Africa-Enjoyed in Europe,"Food production is known to have significant environmental impacts, with the main contributors residing in the farming and transportation life cycle phases. Of the various food products transported around the world, avocados have increasingly gained attention as a high-commodity superfood. Avocados require specific climatic and agricultural conditions for farming, with the most fertile land and conditions located outside Europe. Consequently, most avocados consumed in Europe are imported over vast geographical distances, with little information available to quantify the environmental impacts of this imported superfood. This paper aims to present the most detailed life cycle assessment results of an avocado cultivated, grown and harvested in the Limpopo Province of South Africa and exported to the European market for sale and consumption. A life cycle assessment was developed for the farming, harvesting, handling, packaging, ripening, transportation, and carbon sequestration potential of the avocado, and it was used to conduct a holistic life cycle assessment. Input data was obtained through an 18-month data collection campaign across the relevant stakeholders. A baseline 'business-as-usual' scenario is focused on throughout this study, and scope for optimisation is identified for each life cycle phase where applicable, accompanied by uncertainty analyses. Results show a total carbon input of 904.85 kg CO2e/tonne. Mitigating this, 521.88 kg CO2e/tonne is offset, resulting in a net carbon footprint of 382.97 kg CO2e/tonne with uncertainty ranges of -23.22 to +58.69 kg CO2e/tonne, normalised to 57.45 g CO2e/avocado grown in South Africa and sold in Europe. The environmental impacts of the avocado industry under consideration are largely mitigated by the ""nature first"" philosophy of the farming and logistics enterprises, which have made significant investments in reducing emissions. Sensitivity analyses indicate that implementing large-scale renewable energy, using alternative packaging instead of cardboard, and selling avocados unripened could further enable the farming enterprise to achieve Net Zero objectives. These measures could reduce baseline emissions from 382.97 kg CO2e/tonne to a theoretical -68.54 kg CO2e/tonne, representing a 117.9% decrease. Although this study does not quantify climate change impacts, qualitative analyses suggest that climate change will have a net negative effect on the avocado industry in South Africa. These regions, typically located in micro-climates, are projected to become wetter and warmer, adversely affecting crop phenology, pest control, road conditions, management complexity, farmer livelihoods, and food security. The study recommends large-scale implementation of the optimisation strategies identified to achieve Net Zero objectives and the development of proactive climate change mitigation strategies to enhance the resilience of avocado supply chains to future stressors. These insights are crucial for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and consumers aiming to promote sustainability in the avocado market.",Not About Sufficiency

Ecosystem services-current challenges and opportunities for ecological research,"The concept of ecosystem services was originally developed to illustrate the benefits that natural ecosystems generate for society and to raise awareness for biodiversity and ecosystem conservation. In this article we identify major challenges and opportunities for ecologists involved in empirical or modeling ecosystem service research. The first challenge arises from the fact that the ecosystem service concept has not been generated in the context of managed systems. Ecologists need to identify the effect of anthropogenic interventions in order to propose practices to benefit service-providing organisms and associated services. The second challenge arises from the need to evaluate relationships between indicators of ecosystem services that are collected in ecological studies while accounting for uncertainties of ecological processes that underlie these services. We suggest basing the assessment of ecosystem services on the utilization of sets of indicators that cover aspects of service-providing units, ecosystem management and landscape modification. The third challenge arises from the limited understanding of the nature of relationships between services and a lack of a general statistical framework to address these links. To manage ecosystem service provisioning, ecologists need to establish whether services respond to a shared driver or if services are directly linked to each other. Finally, studies relating biodiversity to ecosystem services often focus on services at small spatial or short temporal scales, but research on the protection of services is often directed toward services providing benefits at large spatial scales. Ecological research needs to address a range of spatial and temporal scales to provide a multifaceted understanding of how nature promotes human well-being. Addressing these challenges in the future offers a unique opportunity for ecologists to act as promoters for the understanding about how to conserve benefits gained from nature.",Not About Sufficiency

Ecosystem Services of Mangroves: A Systematic Review and Synthesis of Contemporary Scientific Literature,"The paper narrates a systematic literature review on ''mangrove ecosystem services'' to identify their typology, distribution, and utilization within the contemporary scientific literature. We performed a systematic review of 76 research articles derived from the Scopus database, and the dataset was scrutinized and classified against the four major categories of ecosystem services, namely provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services, as per the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). We attempted to determine the existing state of the interconnectedness of mangrove ecosystem services by mapping the potential synergies and trade-offs. Further, an attempt was made to understand the critical linkages between mangrove ecosystem services and their contribution to the localization/achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The results suggest disproportionate distribution of scientific literature, where nearly 56 of the studies were concentrated in Asia. The recognition of regulating the services of mangroves, particularly in carbon storage and disaster risk reduction, outnumbered the other types of ecosystem services. In particular, studies related to mangroves' cultural ecosystem services remain underrepresented. The results show a strong correlation in terms of synergies between the coastal protection ecosystem services and the high carbon sequestration ability of mangroves; and the trade-off between facilitating water transport services and the provision of fresh water. Of the 17 SDGs, three SDGs, namely, SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 14 and 15 (life below water and life on land) showed close interrelationships with the existing database. As such, the results are beneficial for coastal planners to better integrate and mainstream mangrove ecosystem services into coastal and regional planning, by maximizing synergies, encouraging the involvement of coastal communities as well as elaborating ameliorative adaptive measures.",Not About Sufficiency
Fine root production and decomposition of integrated plants under intensified farming systems in Brazil,"To ensure food security, foster agri-environmental sustainability, and prevent agricultural expansion into preserved areas, it is imperative to intensify plus diversify agriculture within integrated farming systems in the coming decades. Maximizing productivity and carbon sequestration through such systems demands understanding below-ground interactions and further research into plant root dynamics, which have often been neglected or overlooked. This study examined the effects of integrated farming systems, specifically crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forestry, on fine-root dynamics of crops and pastures (i.e., herbaceous plants). Using an extensive grazing pasture as a control, and intensification through crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forestry, we aimed to evaluate if integrated systems (i) enhance herbaceous root growth and necromass addition, and (ii) accelerate root turnover. We also investigated whether multiple linear regression modeling could predict root production and decomposition using the edaphoclimatic variables monitored in the areas. Herbaceous fine-root dynamics were observed over two years using the minirhizotron technique. Installation involved five 70 cm-deep acrylic tubes in extensive grazing and crop-livestock and fifteen in crop-livestock-forestry (1.9, 4.3, and 7.5m tree inter-row distances). In integrated systems, annual corn cropping was succeeded by grazing on a palisadegrass pasture. The trial measured eight additional soil and climatic parameters for a regression model using a stepwise selection procedure, including average soil temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, available soil water, soil bulk density, soil pH, available soil phosphorus, the sum of soil bases, and cation exchange capacity. Extensive grazing accumulated 124.8 m m(-2) of roots, constituting 48% of crop-livestock (259.7 m m(-2)) and 66% of crop-livestock-forestry (189.5 m m(-2)). Root growth near Eucalyptus trees was reduced by 51% compared to crop-livestock. Root turnover followed the order of extensive grazing < crop-livestock < crop-livestock-forestry. The peak daily root productivity was from 31 to 80 days of the crop cycle when corn was intercropped with palisade grass in the integrated systems. Multiple regression models were superior for predicting root decomposition, reaching adjusted R-2 values of 0.81 and 0.71 for crop and pasture cycles, but were ineffective for root growth (R-2 < 0.25). Therefore, additional parameters are needed to fit the root growth accurately. We conclude that integrated farming enhances fine-root production and root necromass accrual, accelerating root cycling compared to extensive pasture. However, as introducing Eucalyptus in crop-livestock impairs herbaceous root development near trees, we recommend adjusting tree density and inter-row spaces to alleviate these adverse effects, especially for annual crop cultivations.",Not About Sufficiency
"Beyond natural flow: Human-directed course change of the Kolong river in Nagaon, Assam, (India) and its socio-ecological implications","The Kolong, a significant distributary of the mighty river Brahmaputra in Assam, India, has experienced significant human-induced alterations aimed basically for flood mitigation. This study investigates the socio-ecological impacts of the course change of the Kolong River done by the local people of Kahargaon village in Nagaon district of Assam, India. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the research integrates field observations, stakeholder interviews, community forums, and secondary data analysis to assess the river's dynamics and its effects on local livelihoods and ecosystems. The findings reveal that while flood mitigation efforts have provided immediate relief, they have also led to ecological degradation and disrupted traditional livelihoods, particularly those dependent on the river's natural flow. The left-out channel, once rich in biodiversity, now suffers from reduced water levels and a diminished riverine ecological niche, compelling communities to adapt through alternative agricultural practices and grazing. This study emphasizes the need for integrated management strategies that balance flood control with ecological preservation and livelihood sustainability. Thus, the study promotes community-based conservation initiatives, restoring natural flow patterns, and developing adaptive livelihood strategies. The insights gained so far contribute to the broader understanding of human–river interactions and offer valuable lessons for sustainable river management in similar contexts globally. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Microplastics in freshwater systems: A review of classification, sources, and environmental impacts","The globally increasing contents of microplastics (MP) in ecosystems have become a serious environmental problem with far-reaching and at present unpredictable consequences for both aquatic life and human well-being. Until recently, most research on MP focused on marine ecosystems. Research on the occurrence of MP has lately started to focus on freshwater environments. This comprehensive and critical review examines the multifaceted problem of MP pollution in freshwater ecosystems, delving into its diverse sources, transport mechanisms, environmental impacts, detection methods, and mitigation strategies. The environmental impacts of MP pollution span a spectrum of impacts on aquatic life, food webs, and biodiversity in general. In addition, human health concerns have arisen due to potential exposures resulting from the consumption of contaminated freshwater and biological resources. The review summarizes analytical methods and technologies used to detect and quantify MP in freshwater samples, while recognizing the challenges and new innovations in this area. Mitigation and management strategies are explored, ranging from waste management and recycling initiatives to engineering solutions such as wastewater treatment and stormwater management. Legislative measures aimed at curbing MP pollution are also reviewed. Reviewed case studies highlight regional differences, and the unique challenges faced by different freshwater ecosystems. The review concludes by highlighting the urgent need for global awareness, further research, and coordinated action to address the growing problem of MP pollution in freshwater. As humanity faces this complex environmental challenge, interdisciplinary approaches, and international collaboration are essential for sustainable solutions and protection of freshwater ecosystems and health of the planet. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Aquatic biodiversity enhances multiple nutritional benefits to humans,"Humanity depends on biodiversity for health, well-being, and a stable environment. As biodiversity change accelerates, we are still discovering the full range of consequences for human health and well-being. Here, we test the hypothesis-derived from biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory-that species richness and ecological functional diversity allow seafood diets to fulfill multiple nutritional requirements, a condition necessary for human health. We analyzed a newly synthesized dataset of 7,245 observations of nutrient and contaminant concentrations in 801 aquatic animal taxa and found that species with different ecological traits have distinct and complementary micronutrient profiles but little difference in protein content. The same complementarity mechanisms that generate positive biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning in terrestrial ecosystems also operate in seafood assemblages, allowing more diverse diets to yield increased nutritional benefits independent of total biomass consumed. Notably, nutritional metrics that capture multiple micronutrients and fatty acids essential for human well-being depend more strongly on biodiversity than common ecological measures of function such as productivity, typically reported for grasslands and forests. Furthermore, we found that increasing species richness did not increase the amount of protein in seafood diets and also increased concentrations of toxic metal contaminants in the diet. Seafoodderived micronutrients and fatty acids are important for human health and are a pillar of global food and nutrition security. By drawing upon biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory, we demonstrate that ecological concepts of biodiversity can deepen our understanding of nature-s benefits to people and unite sustainability goals for biodiversity and human well-being.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental and biodiversity performance of a novel single cell protein for rainbow trout feed,"Seafood has an important role to play to achieve a sustainable food system that provides healthy food to a growing world population. Future seafood production will be increasingly reliant on aquaculture where feed innovation is essential to reduce environmental impacts and minimize feed and food competition. This study aimed to investigate whether a novel single cell protein feed ingredient based on Paecilomyces variotii grown on a side stream from the forest industry could improve environmental sustainability of farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by replacing the soy protein concentrate used today. A Life Cycle Assessment including commonly addressed impacts but also the rarely assessed biodiversity impacts was performed. Furthermore, feeding trials were included for potential effects on fish growth, i.e., an assessment of the environmental impacts for the functional unit ‘kg feed required to produce 1 kg live-weight rainbow trout’. Results showed that the best experimental diet containing P. variotii performed 16–73 % better than the control diet containing soy protein concentrate in all impact categories except for energy demand (21 % higher impact). The largest environmental benefits from replacing soy protein with P. variotii in rainbow trout diets was a 73 % reduction of impact on biodiversity and halved greenhouse gas emissions. The findings have high relevance for the aquaculture industry as the production scale and feed composition was comparable to commercial operations and because the effect on fish growth from inclusion of the novel ingredient in a complete diet was evaluated. The results on biodiversity loss from land use change and exploitation through fishing suggest that fishery can dominate impacts and exclusion thereof can greatly underestimate biodiversity impact. Finally, a novel feed ingredient grown on side streams from the forest industry has potential to add to food security through decreasing the dependence on increasingly scarce agricultural land resources. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
A Case Study of the Sustainable Mobility Problem-Solution Paradox: Motility and Access of Metrorail Commuters in the Western Cape,"Public transport in general and passenger trains in particular are often advertised as solutions to mobility challenges due to their relatively low carbon footprint, high commuter load, high public safety, and contribution to reduced road congestion. But, how do these advantages apply to contexts characterized by inequality, poverty, and exclusion, and where train infrastructure is underdeveloped and poorly maintained? In this study, we examine the imaginaries and their associated transport predispositions of Metrorail users in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Based on 31 interviews conducted with Metrorail users, we explored how they conceptualize access to and use of mobility. The conceptual framework for this is provided by the Motility concept as developed by Kaufmann, Bergman, and Joye. Findings show that the context and culture defining the daily lives of Metrorail users reflect a reality, which is far removed from the way we theorize sustainable mobility. The limitations of spatial and social inequality, which create the mobility boundaries of Motility for these commuters, reveal a significant gap between their lives and the policies aimed to foster our sustainable mobility future. Despite this, the commuters of our study are highly mobile, and we end this article with an attempt to align these conflicting domains of dysfunctional contexts, mobility practices, and sustainability ideals.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying changes in the drivers of ecosystem services: Socioeconomic changes underlie reduced provision of pollination service,"The impact of land use changes on ecosystem services (ES) or Nature's Contributions to People (NCP) is relatively well-known, but the influence of socioeconomic changes on ES remains less clear, especially at larger spatial scales. Multiple socioeconomic factors influence the demand for a service (i.e. higher economic income and human development can increase demand for ES) and the provision of such service (i.e. environmental policies and cultural relationships with nature may enhance access to ES). Such complex relationships require a multidimensional approach to understand the socioeconomic drivers of change of ES. We investigated how socioeconomic drivers affect demand, diversity and provision of crop pollination service. Our Brazil-wide assessment spans a decade (2006-17) and encompasses a period of rapid land use intensification and concentration of land ownership. Our results revealed that the replacement of small and diverse pollinator-dependent farming systems by large pollinator-dependent monocultures has led to deficits in crop pollination services, with demand increasing by 3.3% while diversity and provision have decreased by 16.1 and 22.5%, respectively. These changes are linked to increased wealth concentration and social inequality, as regions that presented concentrated land ownership and limited access to credit were associated with reduced pollination provision. Our study provided a country-wide quantitative assessment of socioeconomic drivers of change in ES to reveal an association between social inequality and reduced ES provision.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability governance of the Danish bioeconomy - The case of bioenergy and biomaterials from agriculture,"Background: The EU bioeconomy strategy aims to accelerate the European bioeconomy and its contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. National policies and strategies in many countries promote their bioeconomies. The importance of agricultural crops and residues as raw materials for the bioeconomy is increasingly recognised, but agricultural production also contributes to large impacts on nature and environment. With the aim of assessing the governance measures and their effectiveness in addressing the sustainability of bioenergy and biofuel production, the purpose of this study was to map the governance complex relevant to agricultural crop production in Denmark, and to identify the achievements, challenges and lessons learned. Methods: The analysis is based on a review and assessment of publicly available databases, inventory reports and scientific literature on governance measures and their effectiveness. Governance here includes a variety of legislation, agreements, conventions and standardisation. Environmental sustainability is represented by greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector, soil carbon, water quality and biodiversity. Results: The agricultural sector has a significant impact on Danish climate performance and on landscapes in the form of soil carbon losses, leaching of nutrients to water bodies and pressures on biodiversity. The governance complex addressing these issues is made up of a variety of state regulation and co-regulation between state and firms, state and NGOs, or NGOs and firms. Much regulation is adopted from EU directives and implemented nationally. Conclusions: The analysis found that greenhouse gas emission is a virtually unregulated field and additional regulation is required to live up to Denmark's 2030 emission reduction targets. The regulatory framework for soil carbon is criticised for its complexity, its competing instruments and its recognition procedures of voluntary co-regulation. For water quality governance measures in place have improved water quality, but it is still difficult to achieve the goals of the Water Framework Directive. It remains a challenge to protect biodiversity in agriculture. Biodiversity is mainly governed by national and supranational regulation, but co-regulating between state and firms and NGOs and firms have been initiated in the framework of the Agricultural Agreement. © 2019 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

Blue growth and blue justice: Ten risks and solutions for the ocean economy,"The oceans are increasingly viewed as a new frontier for economic development. Yet, as companies and governments race to capitalize on marine resources, substantial risks can arise for people and the environment. The dominant discourse that frames blue growth as beneficial for the economy, developing nations, and coastal communities risks downplaying the uneven distribution of benefits and potential harms. Civil society organizations and academics alike have been sounding the alarm about the social justice implications of rapid and unchecked ocean development. Here, we review existing literature to highlight ten social injustices that might be produced by blue growth: 1) dispossession, displacement and ocean grabbing; 2) environmental justice concerns from pollution and waste; 3) environmental degradation and reduction of ecosystem services; 4) livelihood impacts for small-scale fishers; 5) lost access to marine resources needed for food security and well-being; 6) inequitable distribution of economic benefits; 7) social and cultural impacts; 8) marginalization of women; 9) human and Indigenous rights abuses; and, 10) exclusion from governance. Through this critical review, we aim to stimulate a rigorous dialogue on future pathways to achieve a more just and inclusive ocean economy. We contend that a commitment to 'blue justice' must be central to the blue growth agenda, which requires greater attention to addressing the 10 risks that we have highlighted, and propose practical actions to incorporate recognitional, procedural, and distributional justice into the future ocean economy. However, achieving a truly just ocean economy may require a complete transformation of the blue growth paradigm.",Not About Sufficiency

"Ecosystem services and justice of protected areas: the case of Circeo National Park, Italy","Protected areas are key instruments for conserving biodiversity and landscapes. Yet, conservation initiatives are still often struggling to accommodate people's needs, provoking conflicts, and lacking support from local communities. Our study combines environmental justice and ecosystem services approaches to provide a critical understanding of trade-offs between people's interests and conservation goals in the case study of Circeo National Park (Italy). Applying a qualitative content analysis of different materials and using a survey of local residents, we focus on three main objectives: analysing the implementation of the ecosystem services framework in policy documents and exploring how different people value benefits from nature; investigating the decision-making process in terms of participation, information and communication strategies; and identifying how conservation policies generated different allocations of benefits, burdens and inequalities among social groups. The integrated approach applied in our study highlights ways to systematically uncover perceived injustices and identifies potential conflict lines. In the long run, this approach might help to increase the public acceptance of protected areas by fostering sustainability also in its often-overlooked social dimension.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability analysis of the production of early stages of the atlantic forest lambari (Deuterodon iguape) in a public hatchery at a rainforest conservation area,"Protected areas have been used worldwide to conserve natural resources. Nevertheless, economic activities to provide income for communities living within and surrounded by conservation areas remain an issue. This study aimed to assess the sustainability of a Deuterodon iguape hatchery, situated within an Atlantic Rainforest Park, to leverage grow-out farming of this small native fish, affording income and food security for local families. We have used a set of indicators of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. The initial investment is about US$ 40,000, which should see a return in ~2 years. The internal rate of return is close to 50%, including the externality costs, which is attractive for both public and private investors. The hatchery generated few direct jobs, but the workforce can be recruited from the community, and the hatchery can enable the establishment of several small grow-out farms, leveraging the development of indirect jobs and self-employment. The system had a low environmental impact, showing a minor release of pollutants, a low risk for biodiversity, and absorption of 18 g of CO2 equivalent per thousand post-larvae produced, contributing to the struggle against climate change. Therefore, the D. iguape hatchery demonstrates the potential of combining biodiversity conservation and income generation, meeting the Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030. © 2021 by the authors.

Mapping and Evaluating Marine Protected Areas and Ecosystem Services: A Transdisciplinary Delphi Forecasting Process Framework,"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are an important tool for management and conservation and play an increasingly recognised role in societal and human well-being. However, the assessment of MPAs often lacks a simultaneous consideration of ecological and socio-economic outcomes, and this can lead to misconceptions on the effectiveness of MPAs. In this perspective, we present a transdisciplinary approach based on the Delphi method for mapping and evaluating Marine Protected Areas for their ability to protect biodiversity while providing Ecosystem Services (ES) and related human well-being benefits - i.e., the ecosystem outputs from which people benefit. We highlight the need to include the human dimensions of marine protection in such assessments, given that the effectiveness of MPAs over time is conditional on the social, cultural and institutional contexts in which MPAs evolve. Our approach supports Ecosystem-Based Management and highlights the importance of MPAs in achieving restoration, conservation, and sustainable development objectives in relation to EU Directives such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive (MSPD), and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).",Not About Sufficiency

The issue of providing clean water to rural people is always a daunting yet challenging task wherein building a centralized water treatment system along with proper pipeline to connect dispersed population is not at all feasible. Amongst different water treatment technologies, sustainable nanozyme based materials have made an exceptional contribution towards providing contaminants free potable water to mankind due to its strong activity and sensitivity towards chemical substances thus facilitating use in advanced point-of-use (POU) system. In this article, we have briefly highlighted the way by which silica, carbon and MOF based nano support stabilizes the enzyme with its improved selectivity and sensitivity towards water decontamination. The strength of nanozymes and its potential use in POU devices has also been discussed for future research endeavor. Additionally, development of various nano-chemo-sensors with advanced machine learning approach is an added advantage towards detecting various contaminants from real samples with its implementation in POU devices.

"Managing the Food Security, Biodiversity, and Climate Nexus: Transformative Change as a Pathway","The current global climatic and environmental crises are closely interlinked and are the manifestation of the shift to the Anthropocene era, in which the anthropogenic activity has a dominant impact on planetary processes. In this broad context, food systems are increasingly regarded as a key driver of these crises. Not only food production is destroying ecosystems and biodiversity and emitting more greenhouse gas emissions, it also reduces the carbon sequestration capacity of forests, thus exacerbating climate change. To reverse such trends, we need to transform how food systems interact with both natural and climate systems. To this end, the quest for transformational change can be mediated by many ways, and available evidence shows that we do need a wide range of approaches and methods to tackle the challenges of sustainability and resilience. Building on this approach, this chapter attempts to understand the food-biodiversity-climate nexus, presents transformative change and its elements as a possible pathway to tackle the complexities of this nexus, identifies the various barriers with the potential to hinder the transformative change process, and demonstrates how such barriers, especially those linked to governance, can be eliminated or reduced for an effective transformation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
"Species Composition and Diversity of Plants along Human-Induced Disturbances in Tropical Moist Sal Forests of Eastern Ghats, India","Plant biodiversity data are prerequisites for the sustainable management of a forest. We used quantitative ecological tools to determine the species composition, diversity (richness and evenness), population structure, distribution patterns, and regeneration status of trees in a Tropical Moist Sal Forest of Eastern Ghats, India. For this purpose, a field inventory was conducted during 2020–2022 in sixteen 1.0 ha forest stands along a human-induced disturbance gradient. A total of 161 species (61 trees, 40 shrubs, 60 herbs) belonging to 77 families and 143 genera were recorded in the 16.0 ha of forest area. The results revealed a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in the tree and shrub species density, basal area, species richness, and diversity along the gradient of disturbance. However, in the case of herbs, the Shannon–Weiner diversity index increased significantly (p < 0.01) with increasing disturbance levels. Irrespective of forest types and disturbance levels, the tree diameter class (10–30 cm) accounted for the highest stem density in the forest. A mixed trend was found in the case of the basal area; the >41 cm diameter class constituted the highest basal area in the Pure Sal Forest while the 10–30 cm class was in the Moist Deciduous Forest without Sal. Tree species richness was found higher in lower diameter classes. Disturbances impacted the distribution pattern of trees; in the Pure Sal Forest, the contagious distribution of trees were 61.54%, 40%, and 12.5% in undisturbed, low-disturbed, and moderately disturbed sites, respectively. The percent of trees showing random and regular distribution increased with the increased level of disturbance in all forest types. The number of tree species having good regeneration decreased with the increased disturbance intensity in all forest types. Frequent grazing, repeated forest fires, and poor soil seed banks at the Moderately Disturbed site were the main reasons for the poor/no regeneration of Pterocarpus marsupium, Adina cordifolia, Terminalia bellerica, and some other economical species. Significant changes in structural attributes of the tree community revealed the impact of human-induced disturbances in the Moist Sal Forests of Eastern Ghats. The disturbance mosaics promoted the growth of many invasive weed species and lianas, depleting the number of valuable species in the forest. This study suggests the adaption of sustainable biodiversity conservation approaches through the active participation of the tribal so that the remnants the Moist Sal Forests of Eastern Ghats can be controlled to prevent further degradation. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Limited carbon and biodiversity co-benefits for tropical forest mammals and birds,"The conservation of tropical forest carbon stocks offers the opportunity to curb climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and simultaneously conserve biodiversity. However, there has been considerable debate about the extent to which carbon stock conservation will provide benefits to biodiversity in part because whether forests that contain high carbon density in their aboveground biomass also contain high animal diversity is unknown. Here, we empirically examined medium to large bodied ground-dwelling mammal and bird (hereafter ""wildlife"") diversity and carbon stock levels within the tropics using camera trap and vegetation data from a pantropical network of sites. Specifically, we tested whether tropical forests that stored more carbon contained higher wildlife species richness, taxonomic diversity, and trait diversity. We found that carbon stocks were not a significant predictor for any of these three measures of diversity, which suggests that benefits for wildlife diversity will not be maximized unless wildlife diversity is explicitly taken into account; prioritizing carbon stocks alone will not necessarily meet biodiversity conservation goals. We recommend conservation planning that considers both objectives because there is the potential for more wildlife diversity and carbon stock conservation to be achieved for the same total budget if both objectives are pursued in tandem rather than independently. Tropical forests with low elevation variability and low tree density supported significantly higher wildlife diversity. These tropical forest characteristics may provide more affordable proxies of wildlife diversity for future multi-objective conservation planning when fine scale data on wildlife are lacking. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.",Not About Sufficiency
"""Living a good life"": conceptualizations of well-being in a conservation context in Cambodia","Conservation practice has sometimes been criticized for relying on simplistic assumptions about social contexts in natural resource management. Despite recent advances conceptualizing the interface between human well-being and the environment, very few studies moving from theory to practice exist. We address this gap by providing one of the first careful examinations of local conceptualizations of well-being in a conservation context, using mixed methods to examine the multidimensionality and heterogeneity of well-being conceptualizations across three sites in northern Cambodia. Each site faced different levels of conservation activities and development pressures, the latter being mainly linked to the degree of impact from economic land concessions. Our results highlight village context as a key line of variation in individual well-being, rather than differences related to age, gender, or wealth. Our results suggest that conservation incentives that mirror people's aspirations can balance out negative trade-offs linked to compliance and can contribute to well-being. We show that multifaceted values are attached to well-being components, highlighting the importance of subjective indicators and perceptions to capture fully the social changes and impacts of conservation in complex contexts. We conclude that enquiries into subjective well-being should become an integral part of participatory assessments and adaptive management of conservation interventions.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil organic carbon and nitrogen in agroforestry systems in sub-Saharan Africa: A review,"Effective nutrient management is a key to sustainable agroforestry systems, chiefly in the current context of changing and variable climate along with increasing uncertainties of production systems to meet the needs for food security. The diversity of agroforestry systems throughout Sub-Saharan Africa results in a diverse nutrient management models with specific underlying mechanisms. Over the past decades several studies have been conducted on nutrient dynamics in agroforestry practices in various farming systems across a large range of agro-ecological conditions. We conducted a meta-analysis of the published data of four of these practices (alley cropping, improved fallow, mulching and parkland) for sub-Saharan region to examine their contribution to soil organic carbon and nitrogen content. The results of this analysis revealed an increase in both SOC and N contents of these practices over their corresponding treeless control plots. C to N ratios showed the higher values in the mulching and parkland practice as opposed to the alley cropping, which is nitrogen fixing species-based agroforestry technology. It has therefore been hypothesized that increase SOC may contribute to the provision of important supporting ecosystem services (nutrient inputs, the enhancement of internal flows, the decrease of nutrient losses, etc.). Therefore, agroforestry as a science hold promising solutions for alleviating soil fertility problems and achieving sustainable land management provided (1) resources sharing between components are better understood and (2) pathways for sustainable nutrient management are context-oriented and made available for users and policy makers. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Not About Sufficiency
Estimation of soil carbon gains upon improved management within croplands and grasslands of Africa,"Many agro(eco)systems in Africa have been degraded as a result of past disturbances, including deforestation, overgrazing, and over exploitation. These systems can be managed to reduce carbon emissions and increase carbon sinks in vegetation and soil. The scope for soil organic carbon gains from improved management and restoration within degraded and non-degraded croplands and grasslands in Africa is estimated at 20-43 Tg C year-1, assuming that 'best' management practices can be introduced on 20% of croplands and 10% of grasslands. Under the assumption that new steady state levels will be reached after 25 years of sustained management, this would correspond with a mitigation potential of 4-9% of annual CO2 emissions in Africa. The mechanisms that are being put in place to implement the Kyoto Protocol - through C emission trading - and prevailing agricultural policies will largely determine whether farmers can engage in activities that enhance C sequestration in Africa. Mitigation of climate change by increased carbon sequestration in the soil appears particularly useful when addressed in combination with other pressing regional challenges that affect the livelihood of the people, such as combating land degradation and ensuring food security, while at the same time curtailing global anthropogenic emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
A thorough assessment of various forest management planning initiatives and development of improvement strategies towards an ecosystem-based planning,"Management planning for forests in Turkey has undergone gradual evolution over the last century. Developing and implementing a comprehensive management planning framework present significant challenges. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of various forest management planning approaches implemented across the country over different time periods, with overarching planning principles. It formulates a robust planning framework and proposes improvements grounded in scientific advancements and international standards. The assessment indicated that the management plans were developed using reputable scientific methods and principles aimed at ensuring the sustainable management of forest resources with certain strengths and opportunities presented by SWOT analysis. All management plans shared a common planning concept primarily focused on maximizing wood production through the area-control harvest scheduling method (except for continuous cover forest, which employed the single tree selection method). Each management plan established its unique vision, targets, policies, objectives, and planning guidelines. Forest inventory data were gathered through a combination of ground surveys and remotely sensed data to characterize and stratify the landscape. A robust in-house management authority and governance system with appropriate technical capacity and guidelines were developed and implemented, fostering a sound common working culture and tools. However, some notable drawbacks were identified, including political pressure, biomass/carbon accounting, growth-yield modelling, economic analysis, limited characterization of the full range of ecosystem services, risk and uncertainty analysis, food security and, particularly, long-term sustainability and scenario analysis with the appropriate decision-making tools and methods. Despite a few strengths, these limitations may raise concerns about the far-sighted design and application, potentially jeopardizing the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. Proposed improvement strategies for an efficient forest ecosystem management planning system include characterization of ecosystem services, modelling their productivity, scenario analysis with a decision support system, stakeholder involvement, balancing utilization and conservation targets, conducting risk and uncertainty analysis and economic analysis of management actions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Space-time mapping of soil organic carbon through remote sensing and machine learning,"Pedosphere is the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical attribute for soil quality and crop productivity, being directly linked to climate change mitigation and food security. Brazil boasts a significant agricultural production area and substantial potential for carbon sequestration. Nevertheless, the spatial-temporal distribution of SOC across the country is poorly understood, hindering the implementation of low-carbon agriculture public policies. We aimed to map the spatio-temporal distribution of SOC at from 0.00 to 0.20 cm depth over two periods. We assessed the SOC variation over seven years, generating a time series with five periods, obtaining the average SOC values. The Cubist algorithm was used to calibrate two short period (two years) and a long period (seven years/all period) models for SOC spatial prediction. Remote sensing data and soil particle size distribution maps were used as environmental covariates. We found in validation R2 values of 0.47 and 0.25 for short period models, and 0.34 for the long period model. The SOC content decreased by 54.97 % in the area according to the mapping by short period models and 53.72 % according to mapping by the long-period model.

LCA- and nZER-based methodology for identifying optimal low environmental impact interventions for existing buildings,"Reducing the energy demand in the building sector appears to be the most important aspect to make them energy efficient. Opting for durable minor interventions results in further reduction of embodied carbon. This paper proposes a method which combines the evaluation of the environmental impact of interventions together with the visual preservation of buildings. A new indicator, the Embodied Impact of Intervention (EII), was defined to evaluate the overall environmental impact considering three indicators within the Life Cycle Assessment: Global Warning Potential (GWP), Primary Energy Non-Renewable (PE-NRe), and net-Fresh Water (FW) offering the stakeholders a holistic view for selecting the most sustainable solutions for interventions in existing buildings. The methodology has been tested to a benchmark, (i.e., masonry wall components), considering low, medium, and high visual impact scenarios, and a lifespan of 100 years. A direct proportionality is shown between GWP and PE-NRe, whereas FW does not have a singular relationship with the other indicators as it is mainly influenced by the material production. High GWP values occur in scenarios in which Nature Based Solutions (236.82 kgCO2eq) and Building-Integrated Photovoltaic panels are implemented (798.09 kgCO2eq), being approximate to 2.7 and approximate to 9 higher than the same High Visual Impact scenarios without mitigation solutions. It was found that the visual impact of the interventions may not align with the corresponding EII, resulting in dichotomous scenarios with medium visual impact and low EII, or high visual impact and medium EII. In Low-Income Countries, using recycled materials can minimize the production phase, reducing EII, energy efficiency, energy usage and waste, to accomplish the Sustainable Development Goal in the long-term.",Not About Sufficiency
Economic valuation of biodiversity: An interdisciplinary conceptual perspective,"While biodiversity loss is an ecological phenomenon, it also has further dimensions - political, social and, last but not least, economic. From the economic perspective, the rapid loss of biological diversity can be viewed in two ways. First, the consequence of this deterioration process is a loss of options and an increase in scarcity of the environmental 'good', biodiversity. Second, economic activity and the structure of global and local economic institutions have frequently been identified as the major drivers of biodiversity loss. In economic terms, this constitutes a market failure - market-based economic activities lead to processes which undermine the long-term stability of these very activities. This book provides an ecological economic perspective on the value of diversity in ecosystems. Combining insights from various sub-disciplines of ecology and environmental/ecological economics, the author constructs a conceptual framework which identifies the ways in which biodiversity influences human well-being and offers a novel, unifying perspective on the economic value of biodiversity. This framework demonstrates that biodiversity's economic value mainly results from uncertainty about the future, regarding both supply of and demand for ecosystem services, and interconnections between ecosystems. The book goes on to identify suitable methods for economic valuation of biodiversity and discusses the currently underdeveloped and underused approach of deliberative monetary valuation. Combining a strong theoretical framework with practical examples, this book will be of great interest to students and researchers of ecological economics, ecosystem services, environmental values and environmental and resource economics. © 2017 Bartosz Bartkowski.

Bio-cultural refugia-Safeguarding diversity of practices for food security and biodiversity,"Food security for a growing world population is high on the list of grand sustainability challenges, as is reducing the pace of biodiversity loss in landscapes of food production. Here we shed new insights on areas that harbor place specific social memories related to food security and stewardship of biodiversity. We call them bio-cultural refugia. Our goals are to illuminate how bio-cultural refugia store, revive and transmit memory of agricultural biodiversity and ecosystem services, and how such social memories are carried forward between people and across cohorts. We discuss the functions of such refugia for addressing the twin goals of food security and biodiversity conservation in landscapes of food production. The methodological approach is first of its kind in combining the discourses on food security, social memory and biodiversity management. We find that the rich biodiversity of many regionally distinct cultural landscapes has been maintained through a mosaic of management practices that have co-evolved in relation to local environmental fluctuations, and that such practices are carried forward by both biophysical and social features in bio-cultural refugia including; genotypes, artifacts, written accounts, as well as embodied rituals, art, oral traditions and self-organized systems of rules. Combined these structure a diverse portfolio of practices that result in genetic reservoirs-source areas-for the wide array of species, which in interplay produce vital ecosystem services, needed for future food security related to environmental uncertainties, volatile financial markets and large scale conflicts. In Europe, processes related to the large-scale industrialization of agriculture threaten such bio-cultural refugia. The paper highlights that the dual goals to reduce pressures from modern agriculture on biodiversity, while maintaining food security, entails more extensive collaboration with farmers oriented toward ecologically sound practices.

Ocean Literacy to Mainstream Ecosystem Services Concept in Formal and Informal Education: The Example of Coastal Ecosystems of Southern Portugal,"The concept of ecosystem services (ES) emerges as strategic to explain the influences that the ocean, and in particular coastal ecosystems, have on us and how we influence them back. Despite being a term coined several decades ago and being already widespread in the scientific community and among policy-makers, the ES concept still lacks recognition among citizens and educators. There is therefore a need to mainstream this concept in formal education and through Ocean Literacy resources. Although important developments in OL were done in the United States, particularly through the National Marine Educators Association (NMEA), this concept was only recently introduced in Europe. In Portugal, several informal OL education programs were developed in the last years, yet formal education on OL and, in particular, on ES is still very deficient. To address this limitation, the ""Environmental Education Network for Ecosystem Services"" (REASE), founded in 2017 in the Algarve region by a consortium of educational, environmental and scientific institutions, aims to increase OL through the dissemination of the perspective of how ES provided by coastal vegetation may contribute to the human well-being. The projects and activities implemented by REASE focus mostly on formal-education of school children and include: (1) capacity building for K-12 teachers, (2) educational programs to support and develop ES projects in schools, including a citizen science project to evaluate blue carbon stocks in the Algarve, (3) the publication of a children's book about the ES provided by the local Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, with a community-based participatory design (illustrations made by schoolchildren) and (4) a diverse array of informal education activities to raise awareness on the importance of coastal ecosystems on human well-being.

The interactive effects of excess reactive nitrogen and climate change on aquatic ecosystems and water resources of the United States,"Nearly all freshwaters and coastal zones of the US are degraded from inputs of excess reactive nitrogen (Nr), sources of which are runoff, atmospheric N deposition, and imported food and feed. Some major adverse effects include harmful algal blooms, hypoxia of fresh and coastal waters, ocean acidification, long-term harm to human health, and increased emissions of greenhouse gases. Nitrogen fluxes to coastal areas and emissions of nitrous oxide from waters have increased in response to N inputs. Denitrification and sedimentation of organic N to sediments are important processes that divert N from downstream transport. Aquatic ecosystems are particularly important denitrification hotspots. Carbon storage in sediments is enhanced by Nr, but whether carbon is permanently buried is unknown. The effect of climate change on N transport and processing in fresh and coastal waters will be felt most strongly through changes to the hydrologic cycle, whereas N loading is mostly climate-independent. Alterations in precipitation amount and dynamics will alter runoff, thereby influencing both rates of Nr inputs to aquatic ecosystems and groundwater and the water residence times that affect Nr removal within aquatic systems. Both infrastructure and climate change alter the landscape connectivity and hydrologic residence time that are essential to denitrification. While Nr inputs to and removal rates from aquatic systems are influenced by climate and management, reduction of N inputs from their source will be the most effective means to prevent or to minimize environmental and economic impacts of excess Nr to the nation's water resources. © 2012 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Biochar enhances carbon stability and regulates greenhouse gas flux under crop production systems,"Soil carbon is crucial for food security, ecosystem functioning, greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, and environmental sustainability in extreme climate vulnerabilities. The GHG emissions usually rise along with agronomic practices, anthropogenic activities, paddy cultivation, fertilizer use, and livestock. In this context, biochar, a rich carbon source, produced by the process of pyrolysis of biomass, is a stable form of carbon that enhances soil organic carbon sequestration. Due to the presence of carbon in an aromatic state, biochar is critical for carbon sequestration and resistant to microbial decomposition. Recently, surplus biomass or crop residues from various production systems have gained a lot of attention due to their serious implications for environmental sustainability. Instead of increasing ecological pollution by burning, surplus crop residues from various agricultural production systems can be converted to biochar by pyrolysis, which offers safe and sustainable disposal of excess crop residues of crop production systems along with GHG mitigation co-benefits. Thus, biochar application may provide a long-term solution to combating climate change with other benefits. However, there is limited knowledge available about the effect of biochar application on carbon stability and GHG emissions fluxes under crop production systems. © 2024 by Elsevier Inc.

"Future scenarios of land-use-cover effects on pollination supply and demand in Sao Paulo State, Brazil","Rapid land-use/land cover changes (LULCC) have led to habitat loss and fragmentation in the natural forest areas, which are mainly due to the intense and rapid expansion of urban areas and intense agricultural management. These processes are strongly threatening biodiversity maintenance and the ecosystem services provided by them. Among the ecosystem services under threat, pollination has been widely studied since this service is essential to promote food production and, therefore, human well-being. In a scenario of increasing LULCC it is crucial to understand the interplay between these changes, pollination demand by insect-dependent crops and pollinator availability to ensure these ecosystem services meet the increased demand for food production. In this study, we developed a conceptual model to disentangle the relationships between human-nature, especially LULCC, and its consequences, to the delivery of pollination service. We also presented a case study in the Brazilian Sao Paulo state, where we modeled the effects of predicted LULCC associated to agriculture expansion between the years 2012 and 2030 on pollinator demand by crops and pollinator supply, for fourteen economically important crops. Additionally, we systematized an expert-based Ecosystem Service matrix to estimate the influences of LULCC on the provision of pollination. Our results showed that by 2030, the demand for pollination will increase by 40% on average, while pollinator supply, estimated using suitability values for the different land-use/cover classes, will show, on average, a 3% decrease. Our results highlight the importance of considering the dialogue among stakeholders, governments, institutions, and scientists to find alternatives and strategies to promote pollinator-friendly practices and safeguard the provision of pollination services in a future under LULCC.",Not About Sufficiency
Agricultural biodiversity in southern Brazil: Integrating efforts for conservation and use of neglected and underutilized species,"Brazil is one of the most biodiversity rich countries in the world, including a wealth of agricultural biodiversity in both wild and cultivated forms. This is particularly noticeable in southern Brazil, home to a wide array of underutilized food species whose genetic diversity is maintained mostly by farmers through on-farm management practices. Farmers' contribution in safeguarding and keeping alive traditional knowledge (TK) essential for recognizing, cultivating, valorising and consuming these resources is critical to their conservation. Part of this diversity, a rich basket of native fruits and landraces of vegetables and grains, is also maintained through ex situ collections managed by Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) and its partners. This article discusses the integrated efforts for in situ/on-farm and ex situ conservation and use of agricultural biodiversity in southern Brazil. This diversity represents an important cultural heritage, since its use, cultivation and associated knowledge result from the dynamic history of the Brazilian population, including colonisation and immigration by several different ethnicities. Many of these species are sources of genes that convey tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, as a result of the combined action of natural selection and artificial selection by farmers in agricultural systems with low inputs and diverse environmental conditions. Due to their importance for food security, use in breeding programs, high nutritional value, and potential for income generation, Embrapa has taken responsibility for the ex situ conservation of these species. The genebanks that safeguard against the loss of these resources do also play an important role in the restoration of this germplasm to farming communities.",Not About Sufficiency
"Transitioning to inclusive and nature-based decarbonisaton through recreating tree-based artisanal industries in Kano City, Nigeria","Nigeria is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by halving its emissions by 2050. It has adopted nature-based solutions to implement its decarbonisation agenda. Nevertheless, as a highly urbanised country, the roles of Nigerian cities, where most emissions are concentrated, have not been clearly outlined. Besides, the one-size-fits-all strategy hardly works for all cities, given their spatial, demographic, economic, social, and ecological differences. Considering these differences, the aim of the article is to explore the potentials of design thinking in co-designing city-specific decarbonisation transition pathways, using the example of Kano City. The author draws on seed ideas co-developed by actors in urban economy, the arts, and environmental and social sciences through three workshops. The participants co-identified indigenous tree species that could support the material needs of tree-based artisan industries. At another level, they co-identified seed ideas to support transition to inclusive and equitable decarbonisation. The main finding is that transition to decarbonisation at city level is achievable through the promotion of tree-based artisanal production, ecosystem restoration, and conservation of indigenous trees. The author concludes that in the case of Kano multidimensional pathways identified could be a good step by the city to complement generic forms of country-level decarbonisation transition strategies. © 2023 Norwegian Geographical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
"Land, water, and forest degradation in artisanal and small-scale mining: Implications for environmental sustainability and community wellbeing","Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is increasingly damaging forest, land, and water resources, and this occurrence is rapidly gaining the attention of interest groups across the globe. Our paper contributes to the global discussion of this mining induced devastation with data from Ghana. Based on Landsat data, ASM degraded sites in seven administrative regions that have a long history of mining in the country are identified, mapped, and digitized. Results show that ASM has degraded more than 78,000 ha of forest and land with an attendant water pollution in the last two decades. The paper further explores the implications of this crucial finding for environmental sustainability and community wellbeing and introduces a conceptual model, ASM-Environmental Vulnerability Web, that describes the various means through which mining induced degradation affects environmental quality, livelihoods, food security, and community sustainability. The paper argues that the current trend of ASM exhibits attributes that are like those of the gold rush era in the 19th century, emphasizing that irresponsible mining practices have significant ramifications for the ecosystem and undermine sustainable development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Dynamic influence of remittances on energy poverty eradication in Pakistan: A moderation analysis through consumption and investment,"Energy poverty is a prevalent subject in Pakistan, and reducing it will accelerate the pace towards reaching targets of sustainable development goal 7 and carbon neutrality. Workers' remittances have proved to be a major income source in Pakistan, and it is not clear how they can be channeled to improve energy access and consumption to eradicate energy poverty. Therefore, this study is designed to investigate how remittances impact energy poverty in Pakistan, considering both weak (energy access and consumption) and strong (Multi-Dimensional Energy Poverty Index [MDEPI]) forms of energy poverty. Data from 1990 to 2020 were gathered and analyzed using dynamic-ARDL simulations to understand the empirical outcomes. The outcomes show that remittances effectively reduce MDEPI with a −0.056 coefficient. The results reveal that remittances reduce energy poverty through the consumption channel (−1.569); however, this relationship is ineffective in Pakistan. In the case of the weak form of energy poverty, the results supported the idea that remittances individually and through consumption and investment channels effectively alleviate energy poverty. Therefore, policies should be promoted to effectively and legally channel remittances to investment initiatives, which will build a vacuum for sustainable energy solutions and energy poverty eradication in Pakistan. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Estimation of greenhouse gas generation in wastewater treatment plants - Model development and application,"A comprehensive mathematical model has been developed to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) resulting from on-site and off-site activities. The contribution of individual processes to the production of GHGs in a typical hybrid treatment system for food processing wastewaters has been determined. The results show that the recovery of biogas and its reuse as fuel have a remarkable impact on GHG emissions and reduce the overall emissions by 1023 kg CO2e d-1 from a total of 7640 kg CO2e d-1 when treating a wastewater at 2000 kg BOD d-1. Furthermore, the recovery of biogas and its combustion may be used to cover the entire energy needs of the treatment plant for aeration, heating and electricity generation while creating emissions credit equal to 34 kg CO2e d-1. The off-site GHG emissions resulting from the manufacturing of material for on-site usage were identified as the major source of GHG generation in hybrid treatment systems. These emissions account for the generation of 4138 kg CO2e d-1, or 62% of the overall GHG emissions when biogas recovery is carried out. The inclusion of GHG emissions from nutrient removal as well as off-site processes in the overall GHG emissions of WWTPs increased the accuracy and completeness of this estimation, lending support to the novelty of the present study. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Tourism, urbanization and natural resources rents matter for environmental sustainability: The leading role of AI and ICT on sustainable development goals in the digital era","In the era of development, the world is facing severe challenges, and environmental degradation is one of them. However, the globe has tried to introduce several initiatives to fight for environmental sustainability, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. The leading role of the proposed goals is to balance development and environmental anxiety. Therefore, to these issues, artificial intelligence and technological advancements play a vital role in the natural resource economy in the digital age. Policy analysts are always looking for solutions and have come up with several viable remedies to this problem. Consequently, information & communication technology (ICT) plays a significant role in sustainability in the digital era. However, under the theme of natural resource sustainability, the effectiveness of ICT has a significant impact on sustainability. Accordingly, the current study investigates the long-run effect of income per capita, tourism, natural resources rents, urbanization, and ICT on environmental sustainability in 36 OECD economies from 2000 to 2018. The current research employs an Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and two-step GMM to investigate the study's objectives. Results show the positive contribution of urbanization, natural resources, and tourism to CO2 emissions, while ICT reduces emissions. Besides, an inverted EKC curve is also validated for selected economies. In addition, the moderate effect of ICT on urbanization, natural resources, and tourism shows a significant decline in CO2 emissions. In light of the findings, this study recommends several crucial measures for environmental sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Ecological services of agroforestry landscapes in selected watershed areas in the Philippines and Indonesia,"This article argues that the practice of agroforestry provides ecological contributions to the smallholder farmers cultivating in the watershed areas. Specifically, this farming system provides contribution to carbon sequestration potential of the woody perennials and the biodiversity conservation of the other components of the system. This argument is based on the research conducted in Molawin-Dampalit Sub-Watershed, Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve in the Philippines and Way Betung Watershed in Indonesia. The research involved an interview session of 106 and 261 smallholder farmers and an assessment of 27 and 14 agroforesty plots for carbon stock assessment and biodiversity assessment, respectively. Results indicated that the total carbon found among the crop components was 52.32 MgC/ha in Molawin-Dampalit Sub-Watershed and 244.26 MgC/ha in Way Betung Watershed, which suggested the high carbon sequestration potential of the woody perennials and understory crops in an agroforestry system. The farm lots being cultivated by the smallholder farmers were found to contribute to biodiversity conservation having a moderate biodiversity index of 2.59 and 2.53, respectively. With these findings, promotion of desired agroforestry systems in suitable portions of the watershed areas should be intensified and heightened to contribute to ecological balance across the landscape. Agroforestry should always be an integral part of all initiatives toward ecological restoration with the cultivators/smallholder farmers as potential partners. The agroforestry system should consider all the technical and socioeconomic considerations toward having diverse components and ensure food security among the smallholder farmers throughout the year.",Not About Sufficiency
Techno-Ecological Synergy: A Framework for Sustainable Engineering,"Even though the importance of ecosystems in sustaining all human activities is well-known, methods for sustainable engineering fail to fully account for this role of nature. Most methods account for the demand for ecosystem services, but almost none account for the supply. Incomplete accounting of the very foundation of human well-being can result in perverse outcomes from decisions meant to enhance sustainability and lost opportunities for benefiting from the ability of nature to satisfy human needs in an economically and environmentally superior manner. This paper develops a framework for understanding and designing synergies between technological and ecological systems to encourage greater harmony between human activities and nature. This framework considers technological systems ranging from individual processes to supply chains and life cycles, along with corresponding ecological systems at multiple spatial scales ranging from local to global. The demand for specific ecosystem services is determined from information about emissions and resource use, while the supply is obtained from information about the capacity of relevant ecosystems. Metrics calculate the sustainability of individual ecosystem services at multiple spatial scales and help define necessary but not sufficient conditions for local and global sustainability. Efforts to reduce ecological overshoot encourage enhancement of life cycle efficiency, development of industrial symbiosis, innovative designs and policies, and ecological restoration, thus combining the best features of many existing methods. Opportunities for theoretical and applied research to make this framework practical are also discussed.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of recultivation on soil organic carbon sequestration in abandoned coal mining sites: a meta-analysis,"Opencast coal mining results in high loss of soil organic carbon (SOC), which may be restored via recultivation. Common strategies include liming, topsoil application, and phytoremediation. It remains unclear, however, which parameters determine the effectiveness of these varying recultivation strategies especially regarding SOC sequestration. This meta-analysis analyses the effect of varying recultivation strategies on SOC sequestration under different climate and soil conditions (pH, texture, depth) as well as in relation to time, based on 404 data entries from 51 studies. All included climatic regions recorded increases in SOC stocks, with tropical soils showing the highest potential for relative gains at up to 637%. We demonstrate that loamy soils sequester twice as much newly introduced SOC than sand. Strategy-wise, the highest mean rate of SOC sequestration is achieved by forest after topsoil application (3.9 Mg ha(-1) a(-1)), agriculture after topsoil application (2.3 Mg ha(-1) a(-1)), and agriculture with topsoil and fertiliser application (1.9 Mg ha(-1) a(-1)) with a response ratio of 304%, 281%, and 218%, respectively. Soils analysed to less then 40 cm depth show higher SOC sequestration rates (< 10 cm: 0.6 Mg ha(-1) a(-1), < 20 cm: 1.0 Mg ha(-1) a(-1), and 20-40 cm: 0.4 Mg ha(-1) a(-1); response ratio of 123%, 68%, and 73%, respectively) than those analysed to a depth of 41-80 cm (0.1 Mg ha(-1) a(-1); response ratio of 6%). In terms of pH, strongly acidic soils (pH < 4.5) and alkaline conditions (pH > 7) offer the most beneficial environment for SOC sequestration at 0.4 Mg ha(-1) a(-1) and 0.8 Mg ha(-1) a(-1), respectively (185% and 273% response). Given comparable SOC sequestration potentials of forest after topsoil application, agriculture without amendments, and forest without amendments, we recommend to weigh these strategies against each other. Potentially decisive aspects are short- vs. long-term economic gains, food security concerns, and-in case of agriculture-the risk of overintensification leading to losses in SOC. Our data suggests that amendments exert considerable influence on SOC sequestration and need to be introduced under careful consideration.",Not About Sufficiency

However, there are limited studies examining the degree to which forest cover will change and the underlying assumptions driving these projections. Focusing on food and forest scenarios for the middle to the end of the current century, we review 63 main scenarios and 28 global modelling studies to address variations in land use projections and evaluate the potential outcomes on forest cover. Further, their potential impacts on greenhouse gases (GHG) emission/sequestration and global temperature are explored. A majority (59%) of scenarios expected a reduction in both forests and pasturelands to make way for agricultural expansion (particularly reference and no mitigation scenarios). In most scenarios, the extent of forest loss is proportional to that of crop gain, which is associated with higher GHG emission and global temperature, loss of carbon sequestration potential and increase in soil erosion. However, 32% of scenarios predicted that meeting food security objectives is possible without leading to further deforestation if there is a global reduction in the demand for energy intensive foods, and improvements in crop yields. Forest gain and lower rates of deforestation are needed to achieve ambitious climate targets over the next decade. Our analysis also highlights carbon taxes (prices), reforestation/afforestation and bioenergy as important variables that can contribute to maintaining or increasing global forest area in the future. © 2020 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency

Evaluating the Impacts of a Small-Grants Program on Sustainable Development and Biodiversity Conservation in Andean Forest Landscapes,"International sustainable development and conservation agendas can help regional decision makers to frame their own agendas. Agendas can guide programs and initiatives that drive funding and capacity development for research, and the research, in turn, provides knowledge, evidence, capacity building, and impetus for action. Deficits in research capacity, knowledge, and funding confound efforts on the impact pathway from agenda to outcome. Small-grants programs can play an important role in filling these gaps. In this paper, we evaluate a suite of impacts of a small-grants program linked to a regional research agenda for the Andean forest landscape. Using the concept of additionality, and analyzing the database of applications for the solicitation process and responses to a questionnaire by awardees, we evaluated the effects of the funding on research input, outputs and outcomes, and transformative application to sustainable development. We found that the solicitation process, which yielded 180 applications, fell short of its goal of attracting applicants well distributed among the Andean countries, applications from women, and applications for interdisciplinary transformative research projects. Nevertheless, the 15 projects that were funded did ultimately cross disciplinary lines, result in diverse outputs and outcomes, and help to advance work toward achieving sustainable development and biodiversity conservation in the Andean forest landscape. We recommend that small-grants programs that focus narrowly on a topic or region be supported and that they strive to elevate regional researchers and women in the community of practice. ©",Not About Sufficiency
Decarbonization and the future fuels,"The incessant warming of the globe due to the use of fossil fuels and many industrial activities that release carbon and other gases into the atmosphere is at its prime. These obnoxious gases must be adequately removed or controlled. Decarbonization means switching from the use of fossil fuels to carbon-free energy sources and low carbon-power generation fuels. Decarbonization aims to have a global economy with low carbon emissions, achieving carbon neutrality with zero carbon emissions. Different decarbonization approaches adopted to play important roles in reducing global climate change impacts include energy efficiency biofuels, carbon capture, utilization and storage, and industrial electrification. Many nations are already considering and picking a stand for a no-carbon economy and setting long-term zero net-carbon development goals. Renewable energy sources such as biofuels, the generation of electricity via solar energy, and wind power are clean and are less polluting low-carbon sources that could be exploited for future energy needs. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Towards sustainable palm oil production: The positive and negative impacts on ecosystem services and human wellbeing,"Palm oil is an important commodity contributing to livelihoods of many communities, GDP of governments and the achievement of several sustainable development goals (SDG) including no poverty, zero hunger, and decent work and economic growth. However, its cultivation and continuous expansion due to high and increasing demand has led to many negative effects and subsequent calls to make production sustainable. To this end, information is needed to understand the negative and positive impacts on both the environment and human wellbeing to respond appropriately. Sustainability in palm oil trade entails having a global supply chain based on environmentally friendly and socially acceptable production and sourcing. Much has been done in understanding and responding to impacts on the environment but not so much on social impacts partly due to a lack of information. The direct (socio-economic) and indirect (through ecosystem services) impacts of palm oil trade were reviewed using peer-reviewed literature and the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJA). Our results show that most of the 57 case studies were conducted in Indonesia and Malaysia where 85% of global production of palm oil occurs. The results show both negative (109) and positive (99) direct impacts on humans. Indirect impacts through ecosystems services were predominantly negative (116) as were the direct negative impacts. The most frequently studied direct negative impacts were conflicts (25%), housing conditions (18%) and land grabbing (16%) while the most frequently studied direct positive impacts were income generation (33%) and employment (19%). Ongoing initiatives to make the palm oil sector sustainable such as the RSPO are focused on the environment but need to pay more attention to (related) social impacts. To make palm oil production sustainable and to meet SDGs such as ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing as well as responsible consumption and production, negative social impacts of palm oil trade need to be addressed.

Building a sustainable laboratory culture: The power of awareness and strategic training programs,"Introduction: Climate change, driven by human activities, poses a critical threat to global ecosystems and public health. Healthcare facilities, responsible for 4.4% of global carbon emissions, must adopt sustainable practices to mitigate their environmental impact. Laboratories, as significant energy consumers within this sector, play a pivotal role in promoting sustainability. This study aimed to enhance sustainability awareness through a targeted training program focusing on climate change, carbon footprint reduction, and green chemistry. Method: A four-session training program covered topics such as energy efficiency, waste management, and eco-friendly laboratory practices. Delivered in both face-to-face and online formats, the program targeted diverse groups, including academicians, resident doctors, technicians, and administrative staff. Participants’ baseline knowledge was assessed using a pre-test, with training effectiveness evaluated through a post-test. A 14-question survey assessed knowledge gains, and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS. Results: Post-training assessments revealed significant knowledge and awareness improvements across all participants, particularly among resident doctors and technicians. Resident doctors excelled in both pre-test and post-test scores. The training format (face-to-face or online) did not significantly impact learning outcomes (p=0.137). Discussion: The program effectively increased sustainability awareness, demonstrating the value of structured educational interventions. These findings support integrating climate change education into healthcare curricula and highlight the equal effectiveness of flexible learning models. Conclusion: This initiative underscores the importance of education in advancing sustainable laboratory practices. Its success led to the Antalya Training and Research Hospital's Medical Biochemistry Laboratory receiving the Green and Sustainable Laboratory Certification from EFLM.

Factors Influencing Soil Nitrification Process and the Effect on Environment and Health,"To meet the global demand for food, several factors have been deployed by agriculturists to supply plants with nitrogen. These factors have been observed to influence the soil nitrification process. Understanding the aftermath effect on the environment and health would provoke efficient management. We review literature on these factors, their aftermath effect on the environment and suggest strategies for better management. Synthetic fertilizers and chemical nitrification inhibitors are the most emphasized factors that influence the nitrification process. The process ceases when pH is <5.0. The range of temperature suitable for the proliferation of ammonia oxidizing archaea is within 30 to 37oC while that of ammonia oxidizing bacteria is within 16 to 23oC. Some of the influencing factors excessively speed up the rate of the nitrification process. This leads to excess production of nitrate, accumulation of nitrite as a result of decoupling between nitritation process and nitratation process. The inhibition mechanism of chemical nitrification inhibitors either causes a reduction in the nitrifying micro-organisms or impedes the amoA gene's function. The effects on the environment are soil acidification, global warming, and eutrophication. Some of the health effects attributed to the influence are methemoglobinemia, neurotoxicity, phytotoxicity and cancer. Biomagnification of the chemicals along the food chain is also a major concern. The use of well-researched and scientifically formulated organic fertilizers consisting of microbial inoculum, well-treated organic manure and good soil conditioner are eco-friendly. They are encouraged to be used to efficiently manage the process. Urban agriculture could promote food production, but environmental sustainability should be ensured.

A path towards environmental sustainability: exploring the effects of technological innovation and investment freedom on load capacity factor,"This study examines the impact of investment freedom, technological innovation, renewable energy, and economic growth on load capacity factor (LCF) within the context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 and 13 for a group of high investment freedom countries (Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, United States of America, Belgium, Finland, Uruguay, Latvia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland). Furthermore, this research assesses the impacts of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. The data set covers the years between 1995 and 2019. Moreover, the validity of the load capacity curve (LCC) hypothesis is analyzed in all countries. Long-run coefficients are estimated using the Regularized Common Correlated Effects (rCCE) estimator, and the robustness analysis is performed using Common Correlated Effects (CCE) estimators. The overall assessment of the panel reveals that the LCC hypothesis is invalid in the selected nations, with the exception of Belgium. Other findings indicate that investment freedom reduces the LCF for New Zealand. However, investment freedom increases LCF, improving environmental quality in Latvia. Technological innovation decreases LCF for Singapore and increases it for Germany. Renewable energy increases LCF for the UK and Spain. Finally, policy implications for improving environmental quality are discussed. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring shared public perspectives on biodiversity attributes,"Researchers, practitioners and policymakers have widely documented the multifarious ways that nature influences human well-being. However, we still have only a limited understanding of how the public interact with, respond to and talk about attributes of biodiversity. We used image-based Q methodology to explore the shared and contrasting perspectives people hold for biodiversity. This approach is a powerful way of allowing people to articulate what is, or is not, important to them, free from constraints associated with statement-based stimuli. We used British woodlands as a study system, as they are accessible and well-visited by the public. The elements of biodiversity incorporated in the Q methodology represented vertebrates, invertebrates, trees and understorey plants and fungi. The shared public perspectives varied, and the reasons underpinning those perspectives were rich and diverse. People articulated reasons related to an array of biodiversity attributes (e.g. functions, behaviours, colours, smells, shapes). Many of the perspectives transcended specific species or taxonomic groups. Although woodlands were used as a study system, people referenced perceptions and experiences external to this habitat (e.g. within their gardens) and associated with their everyday lives. Cultural influences and memories linked to particular people and places were also prominent. Few of the shared perspectives map onto the objective measures and dimensions that researchers use to describe and categorise biodiversity (e.g. rarity, ecosystem service provision).

Biodiversity Areas under Threat: Overlap of Climate Change and Population Pressures on the World's Biodiversity Priorities,"Humans and the ecosystem services they depend on are threatened by climate change. Places with high or growing human population as well as increasing climate variability, have a reduced ability to provide ecosystem services just as the need for these services is most critical. A spiral of vulnerability and ecosystem degradation often ensues in such places. We apply different global conservation schemes as proxies to examine the spatial relation between wet season precipitation, population change over three decades, and natural resource conservation. We pose two research questions: 1) Where are biodiversity and ecosystem services vulnerable to the combined effects of climate change and population growth? 2) Where are human populations vulnerable to degraded ecosystem services? Results suggest that globally only about 20% of the area between 50 degrees latitude North and South has experienced significant change-largely wetting-in wet season precipitation. Approximately 40% of rangelands and 30% of rainfed agriculture lands have experienced significant precipitation changes, with important implications for food security. Over recent decades a number of critical conservation areas experienced high population growth concurrent with significant wetting or drying (e.g. the Horn of Africa, Himalaya, Western Ghats, and Sri Lanka), posing challenges not only for human adaptation but also to the protection and sustenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Identifying areas of climate and population risk and their overlap with conservation priorities can help to target activities and resources that promote biodiversity and ecosystem services while improving human well-being.",Not About Sufficiency
"Holding the ground. Alliances and defiances between scientists, policy-makers and civil society in the development of a voluntary initiative, the “4 per 1000: Soils for food security and climate”","The proliferation of multistakeholder initiatives is deemed to be a key vehicle for the implementation of international agreements for sustainable development. This is the case with the “4 per 1000: Soils for Food Security and Climate” initiative (4PM), launched in March 2015 by French Minister Stéphane Le Foll, whose aim is to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks worldwide, in order to simultaneously address climate change mitigation, adaptation, and food security issues. This paper explores the knowledge dynamics at play and the role scientists played in the early development of the initiative. It shows that the strong involvement of soil scientists in the design of 4 PM, as well as in the enrolment of other stakeholders, has had a dual consequence. On the one hand, it has reinforced the initiative's credibility by keeping most discussions at a mere technical level, considering soil organic carbon sequestration as the main (if not the sole) proxy for climate change mitigation, adaptation and food security. On the other hand, this technical approach has led the initiative to be hardly able to enrol representatives from peasant and familial agricultures, who have criticized the absence of clear definitions of the type of agricultural models the 4 PM intends to promote. We show that this has had detrimental consequences on the results of the 4 PM initiative, and we discuss the implications both for the framing of voluntary multistakeholder initiatives and for the engagement of scientists in such settings, notably in terms of their accountability. © 2020",Not About Sufficiency
A review of the knowledge structure and trends in research on the interlinkages between the rule of law and environmental sustainability,"The interplay between nature and human activities is important for both human well-being and the health of our planet. The rule of law is central to maintaining harmony between environmental needs and human endeavors. Since the early 1990s, particularly after the Earth Summit in 1992, there has been an increased interest in the relationship between environmental sustainability and legal frameworks. This has led to a significant expansion in the field, encompassing a wide array of research. Despite the field's growth, there is still a lack of review papers that explore its knowledge structure and evolution. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the literature by employing the Visualization of Similarities (VOS) viewer software. We identify key thematic areas within the field, highlight influential authors and journals, and specify major contributing countries and institutions. The findings show that the initial focus was on limited themes, which later gave way to an acknowledgment of the multidimensional nature of the subject. Certain themes, such as environmental emissions and governance, retain prominence. Among the focal themes, sustainability, climate change, and democracy are particularly influential in shaping the field's trajectory. Despite this evolution, certain aspects of both concepts, such as waste and water management, fundamental rights and justice system, and the importance of socio-economic factors, remain underrepresented. This study offers valuable insights into the linkage between the rule of law and environmental sustainability themes and the associated themes. © 2024 The Author(s).

Thermochemical transformation of biowaste for encapsulation technology and enabling a circular economy,"Background: Global warming, resource limitations, and rapid industrialization necessitate the development of renewable energy infrastructure. Upcycling waste biomass into high-value materials has also been pursued as a global agenda for environmental waste management and energy applications. Thermal energy storage based on phase-change materials (PCMs) possesses high energy storage capacity and contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the leakage of PCMs restricts their applications. This can be overcome by encapsulating PCMs in value-added materials with high energy efficiency, carbon neutrality, and which promotes circular economy. Scope and approach: This review systematically discusses the thermochemical conversion of biowaste into useable products and its application in encapsulation technologies. This study focused on the development of phasechange composites using biowaste-derived carbon and PCMs for high thermal-energy storage and help to reach the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Key findings and conclusions: Phase-change composites show high-energy storage capacity, and it is essential to prepare high-quality carbonaceous materials with large surface areas and morphologies. The encapsulation of PCMs and carbon materials upgraded the thermal and physicochemical properties but inescapably reduced the total thermal energy storage density of the composite. They are practically viable for ensuring a continuous energy supply, indoor temperature control, and environmental remediation.",Not About Sufficiency
Clean energy that safeguards ecosystems and livelihoods: Integrated assessments to unleash full sustainable potential for renewable energy,"In promoting renewable energy options, the environmental problem of GHG emissions should not be replaced with other environmental problems.

In this light, it is necessary to rethink current political strategies in order to build models that are adapted to the new challenges (global warming, COVID-19, armed conflicts, etc.) – and can overcome past failures. The objective of this chapter is to illustrate some of the multiple aspects of the crisis affecting forest biodiversity and related governance in the Congo Basin, with specific attention to Cameroon. The review of subregional and national policies and the in-depth analysis of the biodiversity conservation crisis in four protected forest landscapes in the Southwest region of Cameroon brought out the existence of a top-down and incoherent mode of governance, characterized by negative impacts on biodiversity, the rights of local communities, environmental justice and human wellbeing. Such a precarious situation is compounded by an armed conflict, since 2016, that aggravates socio-environmental injustices and the loss of biodiversity. It is therefore necessary to rebuild an alternative model of biodiversity conservation based on justice, local knowledge and culture. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Symphorien Ongolo and Max Krott; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
"TRADITIONAL USE OF WILD BIRDS BY AFRO-DESCENDANT COMMUNITIES IN THE LOW BASIN OF THE ATRATO RIVER, COLOMBIA","Background. The Afro-descendant communities inhabiting the lower portion of the Atrato River basin in Colombia maintain a close relationship with their environment's biological diversity and ecosystem. Although the wild birds in the basin have been studied for their richness and ecological value, there are no ethnobiological accounts, even though this resource has been traditionally used in these communities’ feeding. Even though most of such communities consist of fishers, farmer families, and wood merchants, they have a solid vocation for occasional hunting since the performance of their regular activities requires that they carry tools such as a shotgun for hunting the wild birds and mammals they come across in passing through the jungle or near a swamp. Objective. Know the traditional use of meat and wild bird by-products by two Afro-descendant communities in the lower basin of the Atrato River in northwestern Colombia. Methodology. Interviews were conducted with 21 key informants (local experts) as well as 173 household surveys. Mann-Whitney end Kruskal Wallis tests were performed to determine statistically significant differences using the R Software 4.1.2 and RStudio 1.4.1103 programs. Results. Wild bird diversity in the tropical rainforest provides a wide range of meat products for food security of the Afro-descendant communities that inhabit the lower portion of the Atrato River basin in Colombia. This assortment consists of at least 20 species, Galliformes foremost. Meat and viscera are generally consumed through preparations such as sancocho, stewed meat, fried meat, smoked meat, roasted meat, ground meat, or shredded meat, and no disease or discomfort for human health have thus far been associated with its consumption. Wild birds are consumed in all the households that were surveyed, and the most important for these communities are Cairina moschata sylvestris (mountain duck), Penelope ortoni (dusky-legged guan), Dendrocygna autumnalis (black-bellied whistling duck), Chauna chavaria (northern screamer), Colinus cristatus (crested bobwhite), Phalacrocorax brasilianus (crow duck) and Ortalis cinereiceps (little ground tyrant). Comparisons between the two communities showed that this resource becomes more critical the more isolated the territory. Implications. This study is an input to understand the importance of wild biological diversity for family feeding in human communities in tropical zones. Conclusions. The seven species indicated above constitute the basis for prioritizing wild birds for bioprospecting purposes in planning food and nutritional security for these communities, which also requires that the parties involved in biodiversity conservation pay particular attention to certain species being used for food.

"Navigating the inclusive and sustainable energy transitions in South Asia: Progress, priorities and stakeholder perspectives","To address the faced challenges – i.e. rapidly growing energy needs, depleting fossil fuel reserves, surging energy prices, risks to security of supplies, and climate change – the World is targeting a sustainable energy transition. This energy transition is primarily propelled by a global decarbonization drive. South Asia, a developing region housing over 23% of the global population, faces the additional challenge of serious energy deprivation. The subject of energy transition has not been explored in the South Asian context in terms of drivers, challenges, and prospects. This paper investigates the prospects of sustainable energy transition in South Asia in terms of resources, consumption trends, and challenges encountered by countries in the region, particularly India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. It also examines the sustainable and renewable energy options for the region. An original stakeholder survey provides salient behavioral insights into awareness, attitudes and opinions shaping societal response to energy transition. The findings of the study highlight the serious energy security issues faced by the region in terms of lack of access, inconsistent supplies, unreliable grids, and high energy prices. Renewables like solar energy, wind power, and hydropower have the potential to propel regional countries to energy and environmental sustainability. “Lack of consistent policies and regulations”, “lack of political will” and “lack of investment” are found to be the three most important challenges to the energy transition. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Nematode distribution in cultivated and undisturbed soils of Guinea Savannah and Semi-deciduous Forest zones of Ghana,"Climate change affects air temperature, sea levels as well as the soil and its ecosystem. The Guinea Savannah and Semi-deciduous Forest zones of Ghana are characterized by different climatic conditions and vegetative cover. Annual average temperature has been steadily increasing whilst annual total rainfall has been decreasing in both zones, and this has been causing a southward shift of the Savannah into the Forest zone. Soil organisms provide crucial ecosystem services which are required for sustainable agriculture and food production yet crop cultivation disturbs the soil ecosystem. The harsh conditions associated with the Savannah further expose the soil ecosystem to disturbance and loss of biodiversity which threatens food production and security. Soil nematodes are the most abundant animals in the soil and play a central and critical role in the soil food web complex. Studying the nematode community structure gives a reflection of the status of the entire soil ecosystem. Soil samples were taken from cultivated and natural landscapes in the Guinea Savannah and Semi-deciduous Forest agroecological zones to analyse the nematode community. Results from the study showed the Guinea Savannah zone recording warmer soil temperatures, lower organic matter percentage and lower nematode diversity (Genus Richness) as compared to the Semi-deciduous Forest zone. If the Savannah continues to shift southward, the Forest zone soil ecosystem risks disturbance and loss of biodiversity due to the harsh Savannah conditions. Our findings indicate that prevailing crop cultivation practices also disturb soil ecosystem in the two ecological zones which span across West Africa. A disturbed soil ecosystem endangers the future of food production and food security. (C) 2017, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

Production of eco-cement exclusively from municipal solid waste incineration residues,"Incineration is an effective way to reduce the volume of municipal solid waste (MSW) and recover energy as a co-benefit. The main challenge with this process lies in the management of the generated residues, namely, air pollution control (APC) lime, fly ash, and bottom ash. In this study, a novel approach is explored that could potentially allow using incineration energy and residues to produce an ecological cement (eco-cement) at a low synthesis temperature (1100 °C) with the ability to achieve structural binding strength when reacted with carbon dioxide. It was found that eco-cement made exclusively from residues (100%) had shown low early strength by carbonation activation and was more latent hydraulic. With 6% virgin additives, eco-cement could develop a strength of 55 MPa by 2 h carbonation, which was comparable to the performance of control ordinary Portland cement (OPC) hydrated for 28 days. Leaching tests validated the stability of the product, where concentrations of monitored heavy metals in the leachate solution were all well under regulatory limits. In the near future, eco-cement could possibly be produced within MSW incinerators by making use of abundantly generated heat for clinkering raw meals prepared from incineration residues. As a further step, concrete made from such cement could also be activated by carbon dioxide captured locally from emission stacks, thereby reducing an operation's carbon footprint and effectively diverting carbon emissions from the atmosphere. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimally clocking the low carbon energy mile to achieve the sustainable development goals: Evidence from dundee’s electric vehicle strategy,"Dundee City has been successful in installing green infrastructure for charging electric vehicles (EVs). This intervention matches the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of affordable clean energy (SDG 7), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) and climate action (SDG 13) of the United Nations General Assembly Agenda 2030 (Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development). Local authorities can align interventions with SDGs according to needs. The purpose of this paper is to consider whether Dundee’s EV strategy represents the most viable and equitable intervention that could be adopted given the city’s context. We adopt a positive review and value argumentation approach to determine the extent to which the strategy satisfies the criteria of “level of urgency”, “systemic impact” and “policy gaps”, which have been employed in the extant literature as the basis for a multi-criteria analysis (MCA). We eclectically review elements of the strategy against the city’s peculiar physical and socio-economic environment, as well as argue their fit against these criteria. We interpret these criteria based on the complementarity and benefits of the strategy from the lenses of SDG 7, SDG 11 and SDG 13. Additionally, we consider the alignment of the EV strategy with the other SDGs. The criteria also allow us to evaluate the strategy based on the localisation principles of equity, acceptability and affordability of the intervention. Our review shows that the EV strategy represents a sustainable and community life-enhancing intervention that aligns with some key SDGs. However, the outcome raises concerns about the equitability of the strategy. Smaller, similar or bigger cities could utilise this approach. However, we recommend the evaluation of local priorities to improve alignment with the SDGs and the provision of clear justifications for selecting an intervention from a range of responses. © 2021 by the authors.

Costs and benefits of protecting linear landscape elements: Applying systematic conservation planning on a case study in the Netherlands,"Protecting and increasing linear landscape elements (LLEs) in agricultural lands is regarded as a possible solution for a transition to a more biodiverse agricultural system. However, optimizing the spatial configuration of LLEs protected areas is challenging, especially given the demand for land for food production. Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) can address this challenge, by prioritizing cost-efficient protection areas. We used a SCP approach to look at the LLEs network in the Province of Noord-Brabant in the Netherlands, identifying the possible trade-off between optimizing species conservation, costs and the monetary values of ecosystem services (ES). For this we defined two scenarios. One scenario focuses on achieving species conservation targets at the minimum cost, and the other focuses on achieving targets while maximizing the benefits provided by ES. For each scenario, we further developed two land-management options, namely land-sharing and land-sparing. For each solution, we tested their cost-effectiveness by calculating implementation costs, economic benefits provided by ES, and cost/benefit ratios. First, our scenario analysis indicates that the economic benefits provided by ES always outweigh the implementation costs. Second, it shows that including ES as co-benefits in SCP (Maximize ES Scenario) yields more cost-efficient conservation solutions. Third, both land-sharing and land-sparing are possible cost-efficient approaches to achieve conservation targets. Our results are spatially explicit and identify crucial habitat areas for the conservation of the selected species, which represent 12–20% of the current unprotected network of LLEs. Our findings showcase net economic benefit of conserving species and LLEs, thus representing an additional reason for biodiversity conservation. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Transforming agroforestry in contested landscapes: A win-win solution to trade-offs in ecosystem services in Nepal,"Trade-offs in ecosystem services (ES) is increasingly becoming a pressing issue in sustainability science, to deal with supply constraints of landscape and divergence in demand from local and global stakeholders. Agroforestry is a well acknowledged and established management practice to minimize the trade-offs, and to sustainably manage the contested landscapes while satisfying the growing demands of both local and global ecosystem beneficiaries. However, various facets of agroforestry, its management modality, institutional arrangements, and implementation outcomes are inadequately understood. This paper aims to scrutinize major agroforestry practices through the methods of systematic review of literature, government policies, and project reports. Taking a case of Nepal, this paper presents agroforestry transition from forest-based agroforestry (i.e., shifting cultivation) to farm-based integrated approach to agroforestry in Nepal. This paper reveals that integrated agro-forestry approach is crucial in creating win-win scenarios among various stakeholders by minimizing trade-offs and maximizing synergies among ES, especially food, fibre, and other ES (i.e., biodiversity, soil functioning, water, and climate regulation). Analysing socio-economic, ecological, and institutional factors that are affecting agroforestry for the last fifty years, we further suggest an integrated model of agroforestry which is replicable in other countries with similar socio-economic status, practicing subsistence farming system. The findings of the paper are crucial in awakening scholars, policy makers and landscape managers for up-scaling and out-scaling of integrated approach to agroforestry for ecosystem management and attainment of various sustainable development goals such as, no poverty (#1), zero hunger (#2), climate action (#13), and life on land (#15).",Not About Sufficiency
Energy efficient green building design utlilising renewable energy and low-carbon development technologies,"The core issue these days is to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emission and prevent the hole in the ozone layer. Numerous emerging environmental crises successfully tackled by coordinated global efforts in the past few years. Despite this, the present climate emergency is a much more serious threat than anything we have ever encountered and requires much more action consequently. Today, more attention is paid on green buildings in the society, which will make use of the sustainable and energy-efficient buildings a necessity for future generations. Hence, this paper proposes a novel design model of an energy-efficient residential green building with low carbon emission to maintain the health and enhances the productivity and living standards of inhabitants. Green building technology is utilised to enhance energy efficiency and lower carbon emission. This design considers green, recyclable, and eco-friendly building materials, which are beneficial for human health and comply with relevant Indian standards and building codes. This building design proposes Renewable Energy Sources (RES) integrated with the power grid, although RES powers most of the load of the proposed green building. The suggested green building design shows effective results, i.e., building energy consumption has reduced by 50.54%, total energy consumption cost has reduced by 57.41%, and CO2 emission per month has reduced by 50.54%. In addition, stormwater-harvesting system is proposed to collect 54,322.23 L of rainwater annually, which helps in water conservation and contributes to improve the groundwater level. The proposed solid waste management plan has contributed to the achievement of regional and national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Trash Talk: A Review of Evolving Waste Management Paradigms,"This review traces the evolution of waste management, from basic disposal to advanced integrated systems that treat waste as a resource. It emphasizes the significance of waste management in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the shift toward integrated approaches that address environmental, economic, and social dimensions. A comparative analysis of centralized and decentralized waste management systems highlights the growing significance of community-driven models, particularly in developing countries, where localized solutions can better address socio-environmental challenges. The review also examines Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) and Integrated Sustainable Waste Management (ISWM) principles, focusing on their potential to reduce waste, conserve resources, and mitigate environmental degradation while creating green jobs. Challenges like technical gaps, financial constraints, and stakeholder coordination are also discussed, stressing the need for systemic reforms. The role of local self-governments, social capital, and community participation in decentralized waste management is highlighted, with emphasis on inclusivity, public health improvement, and environmental stewardship. Participatory governance, institutional support, and policy alignment are identified as key factors for scaling these systems. The review concludes by underscoring the need to incorporate sustainable waste management into broader development frameworks, positioning waste management as a cornerstone of sustainable urban and rural development. © IJCESEN.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing Ecosystem Services of Rice-Fish Co-Culture and Rice Monoculture in Thailand,"Increasing production costs for rice monoculture and concerns about farming households' food security have motivated farmers to adopt integrated rice-fish farming. To date, there has been little research that comparatively assesses the ecosystem services (ESVs) of both rice-fish co-culture and the rice monoculture system in Thailand. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the ESV values of these systems based on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. A total of 19 rice-fish co-culture farms were investigated, covering three regions of Thailand (northern, northeastern, and central regions) and consisting of 13 sub-districts, 13 districts, and 11 provinces. For a fair comparison, 19 conventional rice farms were selected as comparison sites. Rice-fish co-culture had a higher net ESV value of 48,450,968.4 THB ha(-1) year(-1) than rice monoculture with a net ESV value of 42,422,598.5 THB ha(-1) year Rice-fish co-culture generated average economic values 25.40% higher than in rice monoculture farming. The most positive change in ESV was found in the regulation of temperature and humidity, with 3,160,862.9 THB ha(-1) year(-1). Moreover, agrotourism can generate revenue and increase the ESV in rice-fish co-culture. Our findings showed that rice-fish co-culture gives more economic and ecological benefits compared to the rice monoculture system. Further studies are recommended to explore and analyze the potential advantages of the rice-fish system in more detail.",Not About Sufficiency
Natural habitat vs human in competition for breathing space: Need for restructuring clean energy infrastructure,"Environmental quality is frequently explored as indicator of welfare and its linkage with cleaner energy use to fuel economic expansion, but the natural habitat capital and its diversity is often ignored as an important ingredient to sustaining a standard of living. International organizations point towards balancing renewable energy infrastructure development and conserving biodiversity, which calls for a non-linear effects analysis. This study explores the non-linear clean energy effects on biodiversity to find U or inverted-U shaped interaction, using the robust distribution Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag model for 66 countries. Furthermore, the Quantilewise estimates indicate that the short-run and long-run effects vary across different quantiles of biodiversity distribution. The long-run estimates infer that urbanization and globalization increase significantly enhances the environmental performance at 76 percentiles and all percentiles, respectively. While, output growth has a negative effect at 25 and 50 percentiles, and above the 50 percentiles, it positively affects environmental performance. The outcomes showed that clean energy has an inverted U-shaped effect on environmental performance. The research has found the best levels of green energy to match up with different levels of diversity in a country. Eventually, it guides further studies on why rapid renewable energies infrastructure development may harm biodiversity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
A framework for advancing the science of environmental justice along the international wildlife trade pathway,"The international wildlife trade can be a significant driver of biodiversity loss, as well as a facilitator of zoonotic disease transmission with pandemic potential. Environmental justice has never been more relevant to the wildlife trade as it is today. Yet, environmental justice has not been sufficiently mainstreamed into conservation science, nor practice. Here, we propose a framework for advancing the transdisciplinary science of environmental justice in the international wildlife trade context. The framework is organized via three interrelated domains: a) social justice, b) wildlife species justice, c) ecological justice. Each of these domains is described in terms of transdisciplinary questions that are intended to foster the translation of science of environmental justice for wildlife trade and should be tailored to cultural and historical contexts. It is our hope that the framework stirs open, transparent, mutually respectful discussions about justice between conservation researchers, practitioners, and the vast array of wildlife trade stakeholders.

"Agricultural innovations for sustainability? Diverse pathways and plural perspectives on rice seeds in Odisha, India","We focus on alternative innovation pathways for addressing agricultural sustainability challenges in Odisha, India. The first pathway that we term as industrial, is focused on breeding new seed varieties in modern laboratories and test fields, ostensibly for climate resilience. It is driven by public scientific institutions and private corporations. The second pathway that we call agroecological, is grounded in saving and sharing of diverse local varieties, largely by Indigenous (Adivasi) smallholders and their allies in civil society. Using the pathways’ descriptions as bases, we present perspectives of different professional groups who appraise how effectively each pathway addresses a range of sustainability issues. While all participants appraise the agroecological pathway to be clearly better performing for addressing agricultural biodiversity and cultural uses of rice, appraisals for issues of the economy, seed accessibility, stress tolerance, and nutrition diverged from each other. An overall picture in support of one pathway did not emerge. Embracing such ambiguities and uncertainties associated with appraisals, we argue for balancing political support between diverse pathways. Greater support for structurally marginalised agroecological pathways may be crucial to meet sustainability goals. This support can include the restitution of lands and other socio-ecological resources for marginalised pathways as well as guaranteeing autonomy of Adivasi (Indigenous) communities among whom the pathways thrive. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

"Making protected areas effective for biodiversity, climate and food","The spatial extent of marine and terrestrial protected areas (PAs) was among the most intensely debated issues prior to the decision about the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Positive impacts of PAs on habitats, species diversity and abundance are well documented. Yet, biodiversity loss continues unabated despite efforts to protect 17% of land and 10% of the oceans by 2020. This casts doubt on whether extending PAs to 30%, the agreed target in the Kunming-Montreal GBF, will indeed achieve meaningful biodiversity benefits. Critically, the focus on area coverage obscures the importance of PA effectiveness and overlooks concerns about the impact of PAs on other sustainability objectives. We propose a simple means of assessing and visualising the complex relationships between PA area coverage and effectiveness and their effects on biodiversity conservation, nature-based climate mitigation and food production. Our analysis illustrates how achieving a 30% PA global target could be beneficial for biodiversity and climate. It also highlights important caveats: (i) achieving lofty area coverage objectives alone will be of little benefit without concomitant improvements in effectiveness, (ii) trade-offs with food production particularly for high levels of coverage and effectiveness are likely and (iii) important differences in terrestrial and marine systems need to be recognized when setting and implementing PA targets. The CBD's call for a significant increase in PA will need to be accompanied by clear PA effectiveness goals to reduce and revert dangerous anthropogenic impacts on socio-ecological systems and biodiversity. © 2023 The Authors.

Post-2020 biodiversity targets need to embrace climate change,"Recent assessment reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) have highlighted the risks to humanity arising from the unsustainable use of natural resources. Thus far, land, freshwater, and ocean exploitation have been the chief causes of biodiversity loss. Climate change is projected to be a rapidly increasing additional driver for biodiversity loss. Since climate change and biodiversity loss impact human societies everywhere, bold solutions are required that integrate environmental and societal objectives. As yet, most existing international biodiversity targets have overlooked climate change impacts. At the same time, climate change mitigation measures themselves may harm biodiversity directly. The Convention on Biological Diversity's post-2020 framework offers the important opportunity to address the interactions between climate change and biodiversity and revise biodiversity targets accordingly by better aligning these with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. We identify the considerable number of existing and proposed post 2020 biodiversity targets that risk being severely compromised due to climate change, even if other barriers to their achievement were removed. Our analysis suggests that the next set of biodiversity targets explicitly addresses climate change-related risks since many aspirational goals will not be feasible under even lower-end projections of future warming. Adopting more flexible and dynamic approaches to conservation, rather than static goals, would allow us to respond flexibly to changes in habitats, genetic resources, species composition, and ecosystem functioning and leverage biodiversity's capacity to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation.",Not About Sufficiency

"To what extent should we ensure the explicit inclusion of water quality within the WEF nexus? Discussion of ""Water quality: the missing dimension of water in the water-energy-food nexus""","We congratulate Heal et al. for initiating an important discussion on how to broaden the scope of the water-energy-food nexus. We agree that more explicit inclusion of water quality into the nexus is an important step forward. At the same time, water quality is itself an indicator of e.g. ecosystem services and biodiversity, and improvement of water quality comes with a cost in terms of resource consumption that is typically not included in models studying the water-energy-food nexus. We already see hesitation in using the nexus for policy development, and further complexity may be an additional barrier to its practical implementation. So, while the consideration of water quality is indeed important for the nexus, it also suggests that perhaps it is necessary to consider more local contexts than striving for one global framing for analysis of the water-energy-food nexus.",Not About Sufficiency
Coping with Pet Food Insecurity in Low-Income Communities,"To what extent, if at all, do low-income owners of dogs and/or cats worry about running out of pet food before being able to buy more? If this insecurity exists among these pet owners, what contributes to it besides the inability to afford pet food? And whatever the sources of pet food insecurity, how do owners cope with it? A non-random, snowball sample of clients (n = 40) at three pet food pantries operated in Charlotte, North Carolina, Washington, DC, and Hyannis, Massachusetts were interviewed to understand their perspective toward and experience with feeding their pets. Results indicate that respondents commonly experienced emotional distress because they worried about being able to feed their pets and resorted to a variety of coping strategies to lessen this insecurity. They used pet food pantries, stretched their available supply of pet food, saved to buy pet food, shared human food with pets, asked for or borrowed pet food or money, and/or made sacrifices to buy pet food. Using these strategies enabled respondents to not surrender or abandon their pets and to see themselves as responsible owners, even if what they did fell short of how they typically fed their pets or what they considered being best for them. The extent to which these strategies are effective and parallel to those used by people in or near poverty to cope with human food insecurity are discussed. © 2021 International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ).",Not About Sufficiency
Hospital wastewater (HWW) treatment in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review of microbial treatment efficacy,"Background: Proper treatment of hospital wastewater (HWW) is crucial to minimize the long-term effects on human health and aquatic ecosystems. However, the majority of HWW generated in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), is discharged without adequate treatment. This systematic review aims to fill the knowledge gap in LMICs by examining the efficacy of HWW treatment and the types of technologies used. Methods: Studies included in the review offered valuable insights into the current state of HWW management in LMICs. Between 2000 and 2022, only 36 research studies focused on hospital-based wastewater treatment within LMICs. Data were extracted on wastewater treatment technologies in hospitals or healthcare settings in LMICs. Data on sampling techniques, effectiveness, microorganisms and risk of bias of included studies were recorded. Results: A total of 36 articles met the eligibility criteria: mentioned about 1) hospitals 2) wastewater treatment 3) LMICs and 4) treatment efficacy. Twenty-two studies were conducted in Asia (22/36), 17 were conducted in countries with high Human Development Index. Constructed wetland, and activated sludge process were the most common technologies used in LMICs. A few studies utilized membrane bioreactors and ozone/UV treatment. Fourteen studies reported the concentration reduction to assess the microbial efficacy of the treatment process, 29/36 studies did not meet the national standards for effluent discharge. Reporting on sampling methods, wastewater treatment processes and efficacy of HWW treatment were at high risk of bias. Extreme heterogeneity in study methods and outcomes reporting precluded meta-analysis. Conclusions: The existing evidence indicates inadequate microbial treatment in low- and middle-income country hospitals, with this systematic review emphasizing the need for improvement in healthcare waste management. It underscores the importance of long-term studies using innovative treatment methods to better understand waste removal in LMIC hospitals and calls for further research to develop context-specific healthcare waste treatment approaches in these regions. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Termite footprints in restored versus degraded agrosystems in South West Niger,"One approach to achieving sustainable food security is to maintain or restore natural ecosystem services that diminish dependence on human inputs to agrosystems. More efficient use of agrosystem restoration practices can be achieved with the aid of termites' activities, which positively influence the physicochemical and hydraulic properties of soils in favor of productive soil. However, termites have a significant place in agrosystems, but it has remained under exploited and unrefined and needs to be restored to increase its yield. Here, we quantify the colonization rates of termites on marginal soils and in agrosystems with ongoing restoration efforts, as well as determine their footprints on soil characteristics over a 2-year period in semi-arid Niger. We used a rapid assessment protocol, a technic used to assess termites' population in semi-arid regions, adapted from an earlier studies. The results from various analyses showed that termite abundance, richness, and diversity were 15% to 45% higher in the restored agrosystems than in the degraded ones. The evenness did not augment in the restored habitats what might result from the changes in soil properties triggered by clearcutting. Moreover, organic compounds, particularly carbon, nitrogen, in some cases phosphorus, and exchangeable cations are more abundant in restored sites where termite activities are intense than in the controls. A higher termite diversity and abundance are important factors underlying positive changes in soil properties. This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of termite species in restoring degraded soil and in maintaining long-term soil fertility, thereby facilitating sustainable agriculture. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Navigating the definition of urban flooding: a conceptual and systematic review of the literature,"Urban flooding is a significant global challenge, posing risks to urban planners, policymakers, and communities. This paper reviews the literature to analyze how urban flooding is defined across scientific disciplines. Our objectives are to uncover the elements used to define urban flooding and evaluate how these elements can impact future research and practice. A key difficulty is the lack of a consistent, comprehensive definition that captures both physical and social dimensions of urban flooding. Current definitions often focus solely on physical aspects (e.g., rainfall, infrastructure) or social impacts, rarely integrating both. This fragmentation hinders effective flood risk management and interdisciplinary collaboration. Our contribution is a multifaceted definition incorporating spatial and social concerns, including water origins, built environment characteristics, and local community aspects. We introduce the ""Urban Water Transect"" concept to illustrate the continuum of flood risk across urban zones, addressing a gap in the literature. The analysis reveals that many papers discuss flooding causes without providing an explicit definition. Urban flooding is predominantly defined based on water source, imperviousness, and drainage infrastructure. Future research should adopt an interdisciplinary perspective considering both physical and social aspects, potentially transforming urban flood risk management.",Not About Sufficiency
Enhancing ecosystem function through conservation: threatened plants increase local carbon storage in tropical dry forests,"The role of plant diversity, particularly of rare species, in ecosystem functioning (e.g., carbon storage) has been mostly studied in temperate systems with little practical application to the conservation of tropical forests, where species rarity and species richness tend to be greater and more important for ecosystem functioning. We linked carbon storage pools with functional plant diversity, occurrence of rare species, and environmental (topographic) gradients in a species-rich seasonally dry tropical forest protected as a part of a Biosphere Reserve in northwestern Mexico. We estimated various functional diversity and carbon pool measures from in situ plant community and soil data. Soil and total ecosystem carbon storage decreased with slope steepness but increased with plant height. Above-ground carbon was negatively associated with elevation. Our data suggest that species identity matters to the functioning and productivity of seasonally dry tropical forests. Two long-lived and highly threatened rare plant species contributed considerably (10-20%) to the above-ground carbon storage pool. The functional roles of threatened plant species should be investigated and incorporated into the management plans of Biospheres Reserves and other closely coupled natural-human systems, where conservation plays a significant role in ecosystem functioning and human well-being.",Not About Sufficiency
Improving soil and water conservation and ecosystem services by sustainable soil management practices: From a global to an italian soil partnership,"The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) identify the need to restore degraded soils in order to improve productivity and the provision of ecosystem services. The aim is to support food production, store and supply clean water, conserve biodiversity, sequester carbon, and improve soil resilience in a context of climate change. Within this framework, in order to achieve the SDGs and to correct land management in the long-term, soil management is considered mandatory. The reduction of land degradation should be based on various sustainable soil management practices that improve and maintain soil organic matter levels, increase water infiltration, and improve soil water management. This technical review-a policy paper-summarizes the sustainable and territorial impact of soil degradation, including soil water erosion, from the global level to the European and National levels. Furthermore, with the aim of sharing ongoing soil and water management actions, instruments, and initiatives, we provide information on soil and water conservation activities and prospects in Italy. mm. © the Author(s), 2020 Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.",Not About Sufficiency
Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Uranium Recovery from Brine,"With the increase in world population and the associated increase in raw material, clean water and energy demands, seeking for innovative and sustainable methods to decrease human-made environmental footprint becomes a task of utmost importance to reduce emissions and waste generation. Uranium-based atomic energy generation has an enormous potential to efficiently supply energy demand at the cost of high environmental impact on water bodies. Therefore, estimating the environmental impacts of the uranium recovery systems from desalination waste is a necessity. This study assessed the environmental impact of uranium recovery method from brine via AF1 and PAN-AO amidoximated adsorbents and compared them with the conventional uranium mining methods. As a life-cycle impact assessment method International Reference Life Cycle Data System was conducted with 16 impact categories considering cradle to gate analysis. The results for AF1, PAN-AO and all conventional uranium extraction methods showed that recovery of uranium in the long run is more effective than the conventional procedures. The sensitivity analysis results reveal that hydroxylamine, hazardous waste disposal are the most influential parameters during the uranium recovery via adsorbent methods. Comparative analysis between energy sources used in adsorbent recovery processes indicated that solar energy has the lowest environmental impacts among all kinds of energy scenarios. This study concluded that an alternative sustainable industrial process to obtain uranium is actually applicable. Hence, developing a uranium recovery strategy from brine should be considered while uranium mines are under investigation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Bioremediation of heavy crude oil contamination,"Crude oil contamination is one of the major environmental concerns and it has drawn interest from researchers and industries. Heavy oils contain 24-64% saturates and aromatics,14-39% resins and 11-45% asphaltene. Resins and asphaltenes mainly consist of naphthenic aromatic hydrocarbons with alicyclic chains which are the hardest to degrade. Crude oil biodegradation process,with its minimal energy need and environmentally friendly approach,presents an opportunity for bioremediation and as well for enhanced oil recovery to utilize heavy oil resources in an efficient manner. Biodegradation entails crude oil utilization as a carbon source for microorganisms that in turn change the physical properties of heavy crude oil by oxidizing aromatic rings,chelating metals and severing internal bonds/chains between molecules. Biodegradation does not necessarily lower quality of crude oil as there are cases where quality was improved. This paper provides information on heavy crude oil chemistry,bioremediation concept,biodegradation enzymes,cases of Microbial Enhanced heavy crude Oil Recovery (MEOR) and screening criteria towards a better understanding of the biodegradation application. Through the utilization of single microorganisms and consortia,researchers were able to biodegrade single pure hydrocarbon components,transform heavy crude oil fractions to lighter fractions,remove heavy metals and reduce viscosity of crude oil. © Al-Sayegh et al.",Not About Sufficiency
"Driving Safe, Reliable and Sustainable Operations Using a Novel Asset Performance Management Framework","The oil and gas industries are under a huge pressure to deliver the world's energy needs in a secure and affordable manner whilst keeping up with ever-increasing emphasis on regulatory compliance and environmental sustainability. Price volatility calls for decarbonization, and aging infrastructure have added pressure on shrinking margins, despite resulting cost-cutting initiatives. The Energy industry carries added risks due to the nature of its operations: handling and processing hydrocarbons, complexity of the asset mix and value chains, as well as the potential for severe personnel, process safety and environmental incidents. The license to operate is very much linked to the operators' ability to manage all those risks effectively, throughout the asset life cycle by ensuring that integrity and reliability are designed into projects and delivered throughout the consecutive lifecycle stages. (Procurement, construction, commissioning, operations, and disposal). Establishing a best practice asset performance management program while balancing these business drivers and factors into the decision-making, results in optimized management of risks to the business. This paper presents a novel asset performance management framework based on Risk-Based Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM3), with emphasis on explainable, open box hybrid Man-Machine collaboration models that have proven effective in identifying and monetizing dynamic risks, recommending and prioritizing proactive risk management actions, and finally, monitoring the effectiveness of those interventions to form a profile for driving safe, reliable and sustainable operations of Oil and Gas Facilities. The proposed methodology relies on Contextualizing equipment data from operational technology (OT) systems combined with years of codified experts' knowledge. By shedding the light on the data, the data will shine a spotlight on what matters and help prioritize actions thus balancing Risk, Cost, and business objectives. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",Not About Sufficiency

"Ecohumanism, democratic culture and activist pedagogy: Attending to what the known demands of us","In two different occasions in the twentieth century John Dewey and Maxine Greene stressed the point that educators should attend to ‘what the known demands of us’. Following this dictum, from a critical perspective and with a constructive pedagogical spirit, in this paper we portray a new paradigm for values education that addresses the major challenges to the sustainable futures of young people in the third decade of the twenty first century as well as proposing transformative and empowering educational strategies. Employing the terminology of sustainability in its wider sense, we begin with a widely acknowledged diagnosis of the five major global risks–interconnected and interdependent–that endanger the sustainable future of humanity and nature: environmental, political, social, health, and cultural. We then move to suggest a constructive solution, proposing three conceptual pillars for repairing the world and laying foundation for a thriving sustainable future: (a) Ecohumanism as the paradigm for values education–merging the humanist concern for human dignity, social justice and democracy with the ecological concern for climate stability, biodiversity and environmental sustainability; (b) education of democratic personality and for democratic culture that is holistic and transformative; and (c) a threefold notion of activist pedagogy that addresses the element of cultivating personal agency, empowering political literacy and agency, and engaging students in experiential, holistic, and active teaching-learning experiences. © 2023 The Author(s).

The Effect of Environmental Smart Technology and Renewable Energy on Carbon Footprint: A Sustainability Perspective from the MENA Region,"This paper looks at the changing impact of renewable energy and green innovation on the carbon footprint of eight MENA nations between 2000 and 2020. We investigate this by using the panel Q-ARDL model for the first time, and we find that, with various impacts across different quantiles, a rise in green innovation and renewable energy greatly boosts environmental sustainability in the short run. In the long run, this effect becomes increasingly more noticeable. According to our analysis, the chosen MENA countries quickly embraced energy storage, solar hydrogen, and other technology pathways to diversify their energy mix, which was a turning point in the fight against climate change. Although these factors have been separately examined in different studies, our research merges them into a single non-parametric model. This research is significant as it provides empirical evidence on the efficiency of green innovation and renewable energy policies, and it will guide policymakers and energy stakeholders in developing strategies to achieve sustainable development goals. © 2024 by the author.",Not About Sufficiency

Barriers to Success: A Technical Review on the Limits and Possible Future Roles of Small Scale Gasifiers,"Literature and manuals refer to biomass gasification as one of the most efficient processes for power generation, highlighting features, such as residual biomass use, distributed generation and carbon sequestration, that perfectly incorporate gasification into circular economies and sustainable development goals. Despite these features, small scale applications struggle to succeed as a leading solution for sustainable development. The aim of this review is to investigate the existing technological barriers that limit the spreading of biomass gasification from a socio-technical point of view. The review outlines how existing technologies originated from under feed-in-tariff regimes and highlights where the current design goals strongly differ from what will be needed in the near future. Relevant market-ready small-scale gasification systems are analyzed under this lens, leading to an analysis of the reactor and filtration design. To help understand the economical sustainability of these plants, an analysis of the influence of capital expenditures and operating expenditures on the return of investment is included in the discussion. Finally, a literature review on prototypes and pre-market reactors is used as a basis for spotting the characteristics of the system that will likely resolve issues around fuel flexibility, cost efficiency and load variability.",Not About Sufficiency
eDNA offers opportunities for improved biodiversity monitoring within forest carbon markets,"Forest-based carbon sequestration projects incentivize reforestation and restoration activities while offering opportunities to realize co-benefits such as biodiversity conservation. While conservation aspects are increasingly emphasized in these projects, the rigor of biodiversity co-benefit verification has been highly variable. Recent advances in biodiversity monitoring based on shed DNA in the environment (eDNA) offer promise for improving effectiveness, standardization, and transparency. Here we analyze 129 forest carbon projects and 396 peer-reviewed studies to identify how biodiversity co-benefits are currently verified within forest carbon markets, and to evaluate the potential of eDNA for tracking biodiversity change. Our analysis revealed that eDNA studies focused more on smaller organisms (microbes and invertebrates) and on temperate ecosystems compared with biodiversity-focused forest carbon projects. Efforts to align these two worlds via investments into broadening the geographic and taxonomic scope could allow greater adoption and increased accountability in biodiversity monitoring within forest carbon markets (i.e. standardized, auditable biodiversity data trails). Adapting advancements in eDNA technology to the biodiversity monitoring needs of nature-based initiatives will aid countries and organizations striving to meet global conservation commitments. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Modelling ambitious climate mitigation pathways for Australia's built environment,"Achieving net zero operational and embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the built environment is recognised in Australia and globally as a key strategy to address climate change and achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, gaps in knowledge remain regarding potential national pathways to achieve this outcome in Australia. This study further extends and applies a national-scale integrated macroeconomic simulation model to explore coherent pathways to net zero emissions in the built environment sector by 2050. The scope of the study includes residential and commercial buildings and both operational and embodied emissions. It applies scenario analysis incorporating different levels of climate ambition, including a shift to renewable energy, electrifying buildings, improving energy efficiency and replacing carbon-intensive materials. We find that a high ambition scenario (Scenario 2) delivers a 94% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 when compared against business-as-usual, placing a net-zero target within reach. Improvements on Australia's SDGs performance are also attained. Through subsequent pathways analysis we find that achieving net zero or even net negative operational and embodied emissions is feasible with more ambitious action in key areas, including increasing the share of mass-timber buildings and reducing end-of-life losses in sequestered carbon. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Sustainability Potential of Marginal Areas for Food, Feed, and Non-Food Production in the Puglia Region, Southern Italy: Part II: A Review","There is considerable unused and unproductive land in rural areas of the Puglia region, Southern Italy. These areas and their local cultivators/growers have always been overlooked by academic, policy, and investment circles despite their potential to improve food security and the livelihood of rural communities. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the sustainability potential of these areas to produce food, feed, and non-food products. This evaluation will play a vital role in the sustainable development of rural regions such as the Puglia region. In this review, we highlighted important aspects regarding the management potential and the expected contribution that various types of marginal areas (MAs) could add to the regional economy of Puglia. The authors focused on the extent to which Puglia's marginal lands can realistically be utilized to meet Italy's food production targets, considering the economic, social, and environmental potential of different marginal area types within the Puglia territories. In writing this review, we have been inspired by the lack of sufficient information necessary to carry out a plan for the revitalization of MAs and the sustainable development of regional rural areas. Although Italian scholars have not extensively researched MAs, the available data suggest that they could significantly contribute to the development of regional economy and food security, despite their complexity and low-input nature. The scientific evidence suggests that the main challenge associated with using MAs for food and/or non-food production is balancing biodiversity conservation with local residents' social and economic development. Presently, some small-scale or family farms are already operating within MAs. However, they still contribute minimally to the overall agricultural production in the region, even though they have the potential to play an important economic role for numerous rural communities in Puglia. Furthermore, the available data indicate that over 40% of existing farmers in MAs require greater support to sustain their activities. Such support should be tailored to the local context, built on and, where appropriate, improved upon existing practices, while addressing various threats to these areas. In this regard, sustainable development policies should shape MAs' landscapes through the support of initiatives aimed at the recovery of traditional agricultural activities, the use of local varieties, the protection of the environment, and the conservation of biodiversity. The authors believe that this review provides policymakers with recommendations to consider when supporting the sustainable use of MAs as a potential source of food security and sustainable development for people living in these areas.",Not About Sufficiency

Coupling azo dye degradation and biodiesel production by manganese-dependent peroxidase producing oleaginous yeasts isolated from wood-feeding termite gut symbionts,"Background: Textile industry represents one prevalent activity worldwide, generating large amounts of highly contaminated and rich in azo dyes wastewater, with severe effects on natural ecosystems and public health. However, an effective and environmentally friendly treatment method has not yet been implemented, while concurrently, the increasing demand of modern societies for adequate and sustainable energy supply still remains a global challenge. Under this scope, the purpose of the present study was to isolate promising species of yeasts inhabiting wood-feeding termite guts, for combined azo dyes and textile wastewater bioremediation, along with biodiesel production. Results: Thirty-eight yeast strains were isolated, molecularly identified and subsequently tested for desired enzymatic activity, lipid accumulation, and tolerance to lignin-derived metabolites. The most promising species were then used for construction of a novel yeast consortium, which was further evaluated for azo dyes degradation, under various culture conditions, dye levels, as well as upon the addition of heavy metals, different carbon and nitrogen sources, and lastly agro-waste as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly substrate alternative. The novel yeast consortium, NYC-1, which was constructed included the manganese-dependent peroxidase producing oleaginous strains Meyerozyma caribbica, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Vanrija humicola, and showed efficient azo dyes decolorization, which was further enhanced depending on the incubation conditions. Furthermore, enzymatic activity, fatty acid profile and biodiesel properties were thoroughly investigated. Lastly, a dye degradation pathway coupled to biodiesel production was proposed, including the formation of phenol-based products, instead of toxic aromatic amines. Conclusion: In total, this study might be the first to explore the application of MnP and lipid-accumulating yeasts for coupling dye degradation and biodiesel production. © 2021, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Advancing Sustainability in Ophthalmic Surgeries and Interventions: A Narrative Review of Environmental Impact and Best Practices,"Healthcare is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the field of ophthalmology, particularly through high-volume surgeries such as cataract, glaucoma, and retina interventions, has a considerable environmental impact. This review explores the environmental consequences of ophthalmic surgeries, emphasizing recent research on carbon emissions, waste production, and resource use. It also examines current sustainable practices and suggests evidence-based recom-mendations to mitigate the carbon footprint of ophthalmic care. Sustainability has become a critical priority in healthcare, particularly in high-volume specialties like ophthalmology, which generate significant environmental impact through resource-intensive surgical procedures. This review examines the carbon footprint of key ophthalmic surgeries—cataract, glaucoma, and retina—and identifies primary sources of emissions, including single-use disposables, energy consumption, and the use of potent greenhouse gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆) in retina surgery. Strategies to mitigate these impacts are proposed, focusing on transitioning to reusable instruments and supplies, reducing pharmaceutical waste, optimizing energy use in surgical facilities, and considering air tamponade as a viable alternative to high global warming potential (GWP) gases in retina procedures. Case studies, such as the sustainable practices at Aravind Eye Hospital, illustrate the feasibility of combining high-quality ophthalmic care with environmental responsibility. By adopting evidence-based solutions, the field of ophthalmology can significantly reduce its ecological footprint, aligning with global sustainability initiatives while maintaining patient safety and surgical efficacy. © 2025 AlHilali et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Is the Spanish Population Pro-Conservation or Pro-Utilitarian towards Threatened Flora? Social Analysis on the Willingness to Protect Biodiversity,"Conserving biodiversity in the context of global change is a challenge for the sustainability of life as we know it. Scientific protection work, particularly for flora, often lacks interdisciplinary approaches that consider human dynamics. The main objective is to evaluate the level of commitment of Spanish society toward the conservation of biodiversity in general and vascular flora in particular. As a secondary objective, it aims to contribute to the transfer between management and the general population. Methodologically, the survey has been used to estimate the willingness to protect threatened flora. The surveyed population is structured on the basis of its commitment to biodiversity conservation into: pro-conservation or pro-utilitarian group. The results are conclusive and indicate a high commitment of the Spanish society to conservation in aspects such as fees or legislative limitations on owners. It also reveals a deficiency in the transfer of the efforts made, from management, to society. It can be concluded that the survey, as a tool, allows us to know the starting social reality, detect weaknesses and deficiencies that allow management to be adapted to that reality, replicate work longitudinally to know the evolution of the measures and, indirectly, bring reality closer, of conservation to the people surveyed (science transfer). © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
What's food and nutrition security got to do with wildlife conservation?,"We review the linkages between food security, nutrition and wildlife conservation in the early 21st century. Declines in wildlife populations and habitats have occurred in parallel with increasing human population and the global emergence of the double burden of under- and over-nutrition. Nutritionsensitive landscapes and nutrition- and gender-sensitive value chains are key to delivering optimal food and nutrition security and environmental outcomes. Neglected or underutilized crops and sustainable harvest of wild food have the potential to play a number of roles in the improvement of food security that include being: (a) a way to reduce the risk of over-reliance on very limited numbers of major crops and animals; (b) a way to increase sustainability of agriculture through a reduction in the carbon footprint of agriculture and maintenance of biodiversity; (c) a contribution to food quality; and (d) a way to preserve and celebrate cultural and dietary diversity. Dietary diversity and reduced greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram of animal-source food produced can be promoted through the consumption of all edible parts of the carcass, including highly nutritious offal. We argue that adopting a nutrition-sensitive landscape approach would improve consumer understanding of food systems, nutrient cycles, ecosystems services and potentially linkages between dietary diversity and biodiversity.",Not About Sufficiency
Grass clover swards: A way out for Dutch dairy farms under legislative pressure?,"CONTEXT: Policy measures have been taken to improve water quality in the Netherlands. These measures include the abolishment of derogation, which allowed dairy farmers to go beyond the maximum application of 170 kg nitrogen (N) from organic fertiliser per hectare, and additional measures of the 7th Nitrates Action program. Grass-clover swards, known for their symbiotic N fixation, could be a strategy to deal with stricter N policies and can potentially improve the environmental sustainability and economic viability of Dutch dairy farms. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the effects of stricter N policies on the farm structure, farm income and environmental performance of a representative Dutch dairy farm on a sandy soil, and to assess the effect of incorporating perennial ryegrass-red white clover (GCrw) swards and perennial ryegrass-white clover (GCw) swards into the grassland management of this farm using a model. METHODS: A whole-dairy farm linear programming model was used with the objective function to maximize farm income. The model was combined with a farm nutrient balance and life-cycle assessment to determine the impact on nutrient surpluses and greenhouse gas emissions. We modelled a representative Dutch dairy farm with perennial ryegrass (PRG) before and after implementing stricter N policies. Thereafter, the implications of implementing GCrw and GCw swards was assessed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Including the policy measures increased the share of maize land (+12%), decreased the number of dairy cows (-9 cows), reduced farm income (€-18,858 yr-1), led to similar greenhouse gas emissions (∼800 kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-eq) per tonne (t) of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM)), and resulted in a lower N surplus (-65 kg ha-1 yr-1) and phosphate surplus (-4.4 kg ha-1 yr-1) for a scenario with only PRG. The use of GCrw and GCw swards could partly compensate for the reduction in farm income (€+9,255 up to +14,706 yr-1). A combination of PRG, GCrw and GCw resulted in the highest farm income. The use of grass-clover swards only had the most positive effect on greenhouse gas emissions (767 kg CO2-eq t-1 FPCM) and N surplus (113 kg ha-1 yr-1). Sensitivity analysis showed the importance of yields and feed characteristics on the obtained farm income. SIGNIFICIANCE: Grass-clover swards might partly compensate for the negative economic consequences of stricter N policies for Dutch dairy farms. Furthermore, implementing grass-clover swards reduced the GHG emission intensity of milk, but not always nutrient surpluses per hectare of farm land. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Although invisible, fungi are recognized as the engines of a microbial powerhouse that drives soil ecosystem services","Soil ecosystem services (SES) are the benefits that humans derive from soil. These services emerge from the complex interactions between biotic and abiotic processes within soil systems. They are vital for maintaining ecosystem resilience and ensuring long-term sustainability. Soil hosts a diverse group of biota, among them fungi play a crucial role in supporting and enhancing SES due to their remarkable adaptability and ability to thrive under unfavorable conditions. This review explores the multifaceted roles of fungi in SES, emphasizing their growing importance in strengthening ecosystem resilience and climate change adaptation. Fungi significantly contribute to the key ecosystem processes such as soil aggregation, organic matter (OM) decomposition, nutrients cycling, plant productivity, and carbon (C) sequestration. However, potential threats to fungal abundance and diversity could undermine these critical functions, highlighting the need for proactive measures to preserve fungal communities. The pivotal role of fungi in SES, including agricultural production and climate regulation, tailor them as indispensable microbial engines that shape and maintain ecosystem resilience. Emerging evidence suggests that soil fungal communities may become increasingly prominent under the future climate scenarios. Thus, understanding how fungal functional roles evolve in response to climate change is emergent for safeguarding SES and ensuring environmental sustainability. Furthermore, the co-occurrance of fungi with other soil organisms in supporting SES highlights the need to integrate diverse soil biota alongside fungi to promote sustainable SES. Collaborative efforts to comprehend and manage soil microbial communities are imperative for maintaining the long-term ecological stability of ecosystems.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards climate action at farm-level: Distinguishing complements and substitutes among climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs) in flood prone areas,"In recent times, climate change has become a serious threat to crop production in many parts of the globe. Particularly, in Bangladesh, climate-smart agriculture practices (CSAPs) are promoted as a practical tool for mitigating and adapting to climate change in an effort to enhance pro-ductivity. Despite myriad studies on determinants of CSAPs adoption, complements and sub-stitutes among CSAPs are seldom emphasized and recognized, thus up till now policy has not been cogently informed on how to satisfactorily promote adoption of multiple CSAPs in salinity risk hotspots. Therefore, the aim of this present study is to examine the factors that affect the like-lihood and intensity of adoption of multiple CSAPs in Bangladesh with special emphasis on compliments and substitutes. To this end, survey and plots level observation data were collected from 600 farm households and 1260 plots in flood prone areas, respectively. Also, five CSAPs are under consideration - use of stress tolerant varieties (STV), intercropping with legumes (ICL), minimum tillage (MT), crop rotation with legumes (CRL) and furrow irrigated bed planting (FIBP). Multivariate and ordered Probit models were applied to achieve the objectives of the study. In the interest of effective climate action, we find two sets of complementary CSAPs (STV x ICL x MT or STV x ICL x FIBP) and substitutes (CRL with ICL and MT or FIBP with MT). Key determinants of complements are sources of information, training on CSA, extension service, and government support. Therefore, the study strongly recommends effectively coordinating the functions of multiple stakeholders such as farmers, agricultural institutions, agricultural service providers, and concerned government departments at the local level to enhance successful adoption of multiple CSAPs (compliments). This is pivotal especially against the background of the sustainable development goals on climate action as it could potentially recuperate the dynamism of agriculture in salinity risk hotspots of Bangladesh.",Not About Sufficiency

The paper extracted data from existing literature from scholarly peer-reviewed journals. It aims to provide useful information for policy-makers, forest managers, and indigenous communities, to promote SFM and the sustainable development goals related to a sustainable environment. The study found that indigenous knowledge (IK) which includes ethnobotanical knowledge and plant selection, mixed land use, seed banks, and cultural beliefs such as sacred groves and taboos are some traditional practices, beliefs, and cultural knowledge that support SFM and can be integrated into international and national environmental management policies which the two-eyed seeing framework (TESF) seeks to promote. The framework highlights the potential of implementing IK into SFM. Also, the Akwé: Kon Guidelines, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), are some global environment policies that recognise traditional people and indigenous knowledge since the commencement of the CBD in the nineties. The paper recommends, for a future study, investigating the applicability of the Akwé: Kon Guidelines in international and national projects and programs that impact traditional sacred lands, forests and rivers, and indigenous people. Also, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement need to fully acknowledge the supporting role of indigenous knowledge and people in climate change mitigation and adaptation solutions, especially in Africa, since the majority of the world's population constitutes indigenous people who inhabit healthy standing forests and ecosystems. © The authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Nature-Based Solutions as a Decarbonization Strategy,"In the context of practical climate change action, cost effective measures to tackle emissions, either directly or through carbon sequestration, are urgently needed. This paper introduces a novel nature-based solution for wastewater treatment that also offers significant carbon sequestration benefits, and provides considerable savings over conventional approaches. This innovative solution was proposed for an unconventional gas field Mega-Project within the Middle East. As part of the sustainability requirements of the Mega-Project, a new screening tool was developed to rapidly appraise over 370 initiatives, focusing on sustainability and decarbonization across the construction and operations phase of the project. Key themes identified included water conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable power production. A resulting comprehensive circular sustainability strategy was developed, utilizing renewables for water heating, composting for food waste, treating sanitary waste and process wastewaters via a Reed Bed, and a native tree plantation area to utilize the treated water and compost. The solution aligns with the green/circular economy ideals and offers significant multiple benefits. The proposed Reed Bed design consists of 12 × 1,000 m2 of Vertical Flow Wetlands cells, and 3 × 9,000 m2 of Surface Flow Wetlands cells. Once operational, this nature-based solution will facilitate the reclamation of over 16 million m3 of treated water, to be used for tree plantations. The 1,000 hectares of plantations would additionally be fenced off to facilitate natural rangeland regeneration and as a barrier to increasing desertification. Based on this proposal, it was estimated that the combination of the fenced rangeland, plantations, and reed beds would sequester approximately 1.25 MtCO2 over 25 years. This initiative additionally presents a biodiversity value of over US $400 million. Further significant benefits of the scheme includes a site footprint reduction of over 800,000 m2 and a cost saving of around US $100 million. Besides these economic and environmental benefits, reed beds provide a host of other sustainability benefits. This project will result in a strategic shift within the client organization resulting in the widespread adoption of nature-based solutions to replace conventional wastewater treatment and disposal, representing significant organizational decarbonization benefits. All of the Client's processing facilities will be evaluated for the suitability of deploying similar reed bed based solutions. This paper presents the first in-country and in-company deployment of a novel constructed wetland systems and marks a strategic shift for the oil and gas industry. We demonstrate how the adoption of nature-based solutions over conventional wastewater treatment offers significant decarbonization benefits, cost savings, and environmental advantages. The combined benefits present a new pragmatic option for the industry's toolbox of decarbonization and waste treatment solutions.

"Assessment of the environmental impacts of conflict-driven Internally Displaced Persons: A sentinel-2 satellite based analysis of land use/ cover changes in the Kas locality, Darfur, Sudan","Internal displacement of populations due to armed conflicts can substantially impact a region’s Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and the efforts towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The objective of this study was to determine the effects of conflict-driven Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) on vegetation cover and environmental sustainability in the Kas locality of Darfur, Sudan. Supervised classification and change analysis were performed on Sentinel-2 satellite images for the years 2016 and 2022 using QGIS software. The Sentinel-2 Level 2A data were analysed using the Random Forest (RF) Machine Learning (ML) classifier. Five land cover types were successfully classified (agricultural land, vegetation cover, built-up area, sand, and bareland) with overall accuracies of more than 86% and Kappa coefficients greater than 0.74. The results revealed a 35.33% (-10.20 km2) decline in vegetation cover area over the six-year study period, equivalent to an average annual loss rate of -5.89% (-1.70 km2) of vegetation cover. In contrast, agricultural land and built-up areas increased by 17.53% (98.12 km2) and 60.53% (5.29 km2) respectively between the two study years. The trends of the changes among different LULC classes suggest potential influences of human activities especially the IDPs, natural processes, and a combination of both in the study area. This study highlights the impacts of IDPs on natural resources and land cover patterns in a conflict-affected region. It also offers pertinent data that can support decision-makers in restoring the affected areas and preventing further environmental degradation for sustainability. © 2024 Public Library of Science.

"Impact of Climate Change on Dryland Agricultural Systems: A Review of Current Status, Potentials, and Further Work Need","Dryland agricultural system is under threat due to climate extremes and unsustainable management. Understanding of climate change impact is important to design adaptation options for dry land agricultural systems. Thus, the present review was conducted with the objectives to identify gaps and suggest technology-based intervention that can support dry land farming under changing climate. Careful management of the available agricultural resources in the region is a current need, as it will play crucial role in the coming decades to ensure food security, reduce poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. Technology based regional collaborative interventions among Universities, Institutions, Growers, Companies etc. for water conservation, supplemental irrigation, foliar sprays, integrated nutrient management, resilient crops-based cropping systems, artificial intelligence, and precision agriculture (modeling and remote sensing) are needed to support agriculture of the region. Different process-based models have been used in different regions around the world to quantify the impacts of climate change at field, regional, and national scales to design management options for dryland cropping systems. Modeling include water and nutrient management, ideotype designing, modification in tillage practices, application of cover crops, insect, and disease management. However, diversification in the mixed and integrated crop and livestock farming system is needed to have profitable, sustainable business. The main focus in this work is to recommend different agro-adaptation measures to be part of policies for sustainable agricultural production systems in future.",Not About Sufficiency
Nexus between Nuclear Energy Consumption and Carbon Footprint in Asia Pacific Region: Policy toward Environmental Sustainability,"The distribution of energy sources is regarded to be an act of compassion in many of the Sustainable Development Goals outlined by the United Nations. In order to build a firm foundation for competitiveness and prosperity, nations should maintain equilibrium with the three key aspects of the global energy trilemma, which are energy affordability, energy access, and ecological balance. In light of this, the purpose of this research was to investigate the impact that nuclear energy, technological advancements, renewable energy, non-renewable energy, and natural resources have had on carbon footprints. We selected the top five nuclear energy countries by consumption in the Asia Pacific region, including China, India, Japan, Pakistan, and South Korea. We devised an exhaustive and all-encompassing empirical inquiry and used contemporary econometric methods. The second-generation panel’s long-run cointegration promotes the idea of long-term relationships between the series. According to the data, using nuclear and renewable sources of energy significantly contributes to an improvement in environmental quality. On the other hand, advancements in technology and the use of energy sources that do not replenish themselves considerably decrease environmental sustainability. In addition, natural resources end up playing a negative role in the long term. The results of the panel’s investigation into the chain of events that led to the development of nuclear power showed that the chain of events was unidirectional. In addition, there is causality that runs in both directions between technological innovation, renewable energy sources, non-renewable energy sources, and natural resources that have a carbon footprint. In light of this, it is recommended that these countries should combine energy policy actions and build energy strategy consistency by harmonizing the essential features of global nuclear energy in order to aid in the development of a well-calibrated energy structure. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Beyond yields: Climate change effects on specialty crop quality and agroecological management,"Climate change is impacting the sustainability of food systems through shifts in natural and human dimensions of agroecosystems that influence farmer livelihoods, consumer choices, and food security. This paper highlights the need for climate studies on specialty crops to focus not only on yields, but also on quality, as well as the ability of agroecological management to buffer climate effects on quality parameters. Crop quality refers to phytonutrient and secondary metabolite profiles and associated health and sensory properties that influence consumer buying decisions. Through two literature reviews, we provide examples of specialty crops that are vulnerable to climate effects on quality and examples of climate-resilient agroecological strategies. A range of specialty crops including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, stimulants, and herbs were identified to respond to climate variables with changes in quality. The review on climate-resilient strategies to mitigate effects on crop quality highlighted a major gap in the literature. However, agricultural diversification emerged as a promising strategy for climate resilience more broadly and highlights the need for future research to assess the potential of diversified agroecosystems to buffer climate effects on crop quality. We integrate the concepts from our literature review within a socio-ecological systems framework that takes into account feedbacks between crop quality, consumer responses, and agroecosystem management. The presented framework is especially useful for two themes in agricultural development and marketing, nutrition-sensitive agriculture and terroir, for informing the design of climate-change resilient specialty crop systems focused on management of quality and other ecosystem services towards promoting environmental and human wellbeing.",Not About Sufficiency
"Innovative approach to Pb (II) removal using zinc-based MOFs-derived carbon: In-depth analysis of adsorption mechanisms, isotherms, thermodynamics, and kinetics","Water contamination by lead is a critical environmental problem due to its toxicity and persistence in industrial effluents. The removal of lead ions from aqueous solutions has become a significant concern for environmental and public health. In this study, we explore the synthesis of carbon derivatives from zinc-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a potential solution to this issue. The high surface area and porous structure of MOFs make them ideal candidates for adsorbing toxic metals like lead. This research hypothesizes that carbonized MOFs can effectively remove lead ions from contaminated water. To test this hypothesis, carbon derivatives were synthesized through a solvothermal method at 700 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The materials were characterized by XRD, FTIR, FESEM, EDX, and BET analyses. The results indicated significant changes in crystallinity and an increase in the specific surface area after pyrolysis. A central composite design (CCD) was employed to study the effects of various factors such as adsorbent dosage (5–25 mg), lead concentration (20–100 mg/L), contact time (10–50 min), and pH (3–7) on the adsorption process. The optimal conditions for lead removal were found to be an initial lead concentration of 80 mg/L, adsorbent dosage of 10 g/L, an equilibrium time of 38 min, and a pH of 6. The experimental data were well-fitted to the Langmuir adsorption model, suggesting a maximum adsorption capacity of 1395.31 mg/g. According to kinetic studies, the best match was given by the pseudo-second-order model (R2 = 0.9993). These findings suggest that carbon derived from zinc-based MOFs is a highly effective adsorbent for the removal of lead from contaminated water. © 2025",Not About Sufficiency

Restoration of mine degraded land for sustainable environmental development,"The extraction of natural resources through mining activities has tremendously increased to maintain the trade-off between demand and supply of energy resources. Surface mining activities lead to deforestation, displacement of topsoil and overburden rocks, and disposal of huge amounts of waste that depletes ecosystem services. We attempt to summarize the recent advance in the restoration of mine degraded lands and their role in the sustainable management of the post-mining ecosystem. Selective plantation and application of various soil amendments along with the topsoil potentially enhance the recovery of mine degraded lands. Afforestation of mine degraded lands can generate economic, social, and environmental benefits to mining companies and the regional population. Outcomes of numerous studies have highlighted the need for the selective plantation that demonstrates characters like stress tolerance, climate resilience, and native to the local ecosystem. Besides, it is important to restore the ecosystem in such a way that it can deliver ecosystem services and match the objectives of international policies like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",Not About Sufficiency
Importance of stress response mechanisms in filamentous fungi for agriculture and industry,"Sustainable production of food crops is urgently required to meet the demands of a growing human population worldwide. Global food security has to be elevated to decline increasing rates of cancer or various other serious diseases caused by contaminated food. Rapid climate change including global warming increases detrimental effects on the food-supply chain and its safety caused by polluted environments due to utilization of fossil fuels and use of hazardous chemical substances during the past century. Soil health and crop productivity improvement strategies are of vital importance. Necessary measures include the reduction of food spoilage before and after harvesting, increased application of biological control methods to reduce pesticide application, improved bioremediation of polluted sites, and increased generation of biofuels from sustainable sources. Fungi are ubiquitous and are able to survive under very challenging conditions as part of an important ecological function in recycling carbon and nitrogen sources. They produce a wide range of enzymes for numerous primary and secondary metabolites. Fungi play prominent roles in agriculture, food production, and processing but also in crop loss. Fungal biotechnology supports pharmaceutical industries, energy production, and food industries. The other side of fungal life includes harmful mycotoxins damaging human health. Like other living organisms, fungi must cope with a variety of stresses to survive. Fungal stress is a major issue affecting agriculture as well as industrial microbiology. This includes stresses encountered or caused by fungi. They can act as pathogens to plants or can spoil food after harvesting during storage or transport. Fungal species can be used in bioremediation or as biocontrol agents that may enhance plant health and crop production. Especially species of the genera Trichoderma, Penicillium, or Aspergillus can produce biomass-degrading enzymes, antibiotics, and useful chemicals, respectively. Understanding how fungi deal with stress while infecting a plant host or during industrial processes will help to optimize the use of fungi in agricultural and industrial applications and improve the environment and combat with plant dieses caused by fungi. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",Not About Sufficiency
General Practice,"This chapter looks at the shared sustainability patterns between different systems of primary medical care in a number of high-income countries. The legal and local frameworks in each country mean that different priorities for sustainability have emerged. Generally, 4%-5% (or more) of these countries’ carbon footprint is from health care, and primary health care is about 25% of this. Prescribing medication (especially inhalers) is 60% of the primary care footprint generally. The inverse care law is closely linked to environmental sustainability, as marginalised groups suffer in both ways. There is progress on procurement and metered dose inhalers, but a general lack of urgency compared to COVID. Prevention is discussed as the best route to more sustainable care, suggesting a need for real conversations about diets and transport. As a result of planetary health changes, people’s health issues are changing, and examples of this are shared (air pollution is addressed more in another chapter). This leads to the suggestion that primary care’s voice should be clear that environmental issues are health issues. Detailed general practitioner (GP) perspectives and initiatives from Australia, Canada, England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales are shared.

Promoting sustainable agriculture by exploiting plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) to improve maize and cowpea crops,"Maize and cowpea are among the staple foods most consumed by most of the African population, and are of significant importance in food security, crop diversification, biodiversity preservation, and livelihoods. In order to satisfy the growing demand for agricultural products, fertilizers and pesticides have been extensively used to increase yields and protect plants against pathogens. However, the excessive use of these chemicals has harmful consequences on the environment and also on public health. These include soil acidification, loss of biodiversity, groundwater pollution, reduced soil fertility, contamination of crops by heavy metals, etc. Therefore, essential to find alternatives to promote sustainable agriculture and ensure the food and well-being of the people. Among these alternatives, agricultural techniques that offer sustainable, environmentally friendly solutions that reduce or eliminate the excessive use of agricultural inputs are increasingly attracting the attention of researchers. One such alternative is the use of beneficial soil microorganisms such as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). PGPR provides a variety of ecological services and can play an essential role as crop yield enhancers and biological control agents. They can promote root development in plants, increasing their capacity to absorb water and nutrients from the soil, increase stress tolerance, reduce disease and promote root development. Previous research has highlighted the benefits of using PGPRs to increase agricultural productivity. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms of action of PGPRs and their exploitation as biofertilizers would present a promising prospect for increasing agricultural production, particularly in maize and cowpea, and for ensuring sustainable and prosperous agriculture, while contributing to food security and reducing the impact of chemical fertilizers and pesticides on the environment. Looking ahead, PGPR research should continue to deepen our understanding of these microorganisms and their impact on crops, with a view to constantly improving sustainable agricultural practices. On the other hand, farmers and agricultural industry players need to be made aware of the benefits of PGPRs and encouraged to adopt them to promote sustainable agricultural practices. © 2024 Agbodjato and Babalola.",Not About Sufficiency
From conflict to collaboration: Atewa Forest governance,"The problem of forest degradation and loss has become the concern of many countries. To address this challenge, some collaborate in sustainable forest management.

A Review Study on Ozone Phytotoxicity Metrics for Setting Critical Levels in Asia,"Ground-level ozone (O-3) can be a menace for vegetation, especially in Asia where O-3 levels have been dramatically increased over the past decades. To ensure food security and maintain forest ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration and functional diversity of soil biota, in the over-populated Asia, environmental standards are needed. To set proper standards, dose-response relationships should be established from which critical levels are derived. The predictor of the response in the dose-response relationship is an O-3 metric that indicates the dose level to which the plant has been exposed. This study aimed to review the relevant scientific literature and summarize the O-3 metrics used worldwide to provide insights for Asia. A variety of O-3 metrics have been used, for which we discuss their strengths and weaknesses. The most widely used metrics are based only on O-3 levels. Such metrics have been adopted by several regulatory agencies in the global. However, they are biologically irrelevant because they ignore the plant physiological capacity. Adopting AOT40 (O-3 mixing ratios Accumulated Over the Threshold of 40 nmol mol(-1)) as the default index for setting critical levels in Asia would be a poor policy with severe consequences at national and Pan-Asian level. Asian studies should focus on flux-based O-3 metrics to provide relevant bases for developing proper standards. However, given the technical requirements in calculating flux-based O-3 metrics, which can be an important limitation in developing countries, no-threshold cumulative exposure indices like AOT0 should always accompany flux-based indices.",Not About Sufficiency

Evaluating the Impact of Participatory Community Radio on SDGs 15 through a Quasi-Experimental Approach,"The Niger Delta, a region in southern Nigeria that includes the states of Delta, Bayelsa, and Rivers, is experiencing significant environmental degradation caused by factors such as oil spills, deforestation, and habitat destruction. Given the severity of these issues, it is crucial to identify effective strategies for promoting sustainable land management and conservation in the area. One such strategy is the use of community radio. Despite community radio's potential, there is limited research on its effectiveness in addressing environmental issues like deforestation and biodiversity loss in the Niger Delta, specifically regarding its impact on SDG 15, which aims to protect ecosystems, manage forests, combat desertification, protect biodiversity, and integrate ecosystem values. This study investigated the impact of participatory community radio interventions on Sustainable Development Goal 15 in the Niger Delta. The study adopted a quasi-experimental research approach. A matched sample of 338 participants (169=control and 169= experimental groups) underwent a two-phase investigation, which revealed significant changes in knowledge, attitude, and behaviour linked to environmental issues following the intervention (i.e., exposure to participatory community radio programme). The study confirmed a favourable shift in sustainability outcomes among groups exposed to participatory community radio projects. Furthermore, the study highlighted the complex interplay between attitudes, community or team discussions, and long-term sustainable behaviour, offering insight into the significance of collective engagement in developing environmental practices.

Determinants of Small Mammals’ Body Condition in Eucalyptus Dominated Landscapes,"The timber industry has increased considerably in recent decades to meet human needs for wood. In Portugal, Eucalyptus plantations are the most common use of forested land, presenting the largest coverage of Eucalyptus globulus in Europe. Although it is established that this landscape can affect biodiversity patterns, it is not clear what its role in shaping small mammals’ body condition is. Here, we tested the effect of Eucalyptus plantations on small mammals’ body condition, together with vegetation structure, weather, predators/competitors’ abundance, and parasites’ prevalence, using the Scaled Mass Index (SMI) as a surrogate. Capture of small mammals took place in 11 study areas in central Portugal from 2019 to 2022. The drivers’ influence was tested using structural equation models (SEM). The response of body condition to Eucalyptus is species-specific, with Crocidura russula displaying better individual condition in native habitats (i.e., there was an indirect negative effect of Eucalyptus plantations). The overall model suggested that deer abundance, precipitation, and forest integrity promoted higher body condition levels, while wild boar abundance had an adverse effect. The management of these plantations must ensure the integrity of the remnants of native patches and control of highly abundant competitors (e.g., wild boar) to maintain a healthy and functional small mammal community. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The effect of institutions on clean energy investments and environmental degradation across income groups: Evidence based on the Method of Moments Quantile estimation,"This research investigates the effects of institutional quality on environmental degradation using the Method of Moments Quantile Regression estimation. More specifically, it focuses on the impact of institutions on clean energy investments and environmental degradation, both globally and separately, for groups of countries representing various income levels. Unbalanced panel data from 61 nations between 2005 and 2022 were used in the analysis. The results reveal that different aspects of institutional quality are important in encouraging clean energy investments and curbing environmental degradation for different income groups. Political stability is a major driver of clean energy investments in low- and lower-middle-income countries. It is important for upper-middle-income countries to have a rule-based governance structure and an efficient legal system. Additionally, policies promoting sustainability appear to have a rather limited impact across income groups. While the results further suggest that abundant natural resources and openness to trade are major hindrances to clean energy investments and important causes of environmental degradation for the majority of income levels, they also indicate that the estimated effects vary between different levels of clean energy investments and environmental degradation. Moreover, the results support the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve for low-income countries. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change stress alleviation through nature based solutions: A global perspective,"Global climate change stress has greatly influenced agricultural crop production which leads to the global problems such as food security. To cope with global climate change, nature based solutions (NBS) are desirable because these lead to improve our environment. Environmental stresses such as drought and salinity are big soil problems and can be eradicated by increasing soil organic matter which is directly related to soil organic carbon (SOC). SOC is one of the key components of the worldwide carbon (C) cycle. Different types of land use patterns have shown significant impacts on SOC stocks. However, their effects on the various SOC fractions are not well-understood at the global level which make it difficult to predict how SOC changes over time. We aim to investigate changes in various SOC fractions, including mineral associated organic carbon (MAOC), mineral associated organic matter (MAOM), soil organic carbon (SOC), easily oxidized organic carbon (EOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) under various types of land use patterns (NBS), including cropping pattern, residue management, conservation tillages such as no tillage (NT) and reduced tillage (RT) using data from 97 studies on a global scale. The results showed that NT overall increased MAOC, MAOM, SOC, MBC, EOC and POC by 16.2%, 26.8%, 24.1%, 16.2%, 27.9% and 33.2% (P < 0.05) compared to CT. No tillage with residue retention (NTR) increased MAOC, MAOM, SOC, MBC, EOC and POC by 38.0%, 29.9%, 47.5%, 33.1%, 35.7% and 49.0%, respectively, compared to CT (P < 0.05). RT overall increased MAOC, MAOM, SOC, MBC, EOC and POC by 36.8%, 14.1%, 25.8%, 25.9, 18.7% and 16.6% (P < 0.05) compared to CT. Reduced tillage with residue retention (RTR) increased MAOM, SOC and POC by 14.2%, 36.2% and 30.7%, respectively, compared to CT (P < 0.05). Multiple cropping increased MAOC, MBC and EOC by 14.1%, 39.8% and 21.5%, respectively, compared to mono cropping (P < 0.05). The response ratios of SOC fractions (MAOC, MAOM, SOC, MBC, EOC and POC) under NT and RT were mostly influenced by NBS such as residue management, cropping pattern along with soil depth, mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature and soil texture. Our findings imply that when assessing the effects of conservation tillage methods on SOC sequestration, SOC fractions especially those taking part in driving soil biological activities, should be taken into account rather than total SOC. We conclude that conservation tillages under multiple cropping systems and with retention of crop residues enhance soil carbon sequestration as compared to CT in varying edaphic and climatic conditions of the world.

Nature’s contributions to people and the Sustainable Development Goals in Nepal,"Nature’s contributions to people (NCPs) underpin the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) but are declining globally. It is therefore critical to identify the drivers of changes in NCPs, and to understand how and where NCPs can contribute towards the achievement of the SDGs. By integrating the conceptual framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBESs) and the SDGs, we can obtain a better understanding of how changes in the state of NCPs support or hinder attainment of the SDGs, and how changes in NCPs are driven by development interventions. We conducted a systematic synthesis of the literature to determine the state of research on NCPs, trends in NCPs and their drivers, and the contribution of NCPs towards achieving the SDGs in Nepal, a low-income and highly biodiverse country. We found that NCPs contributed positively towards the achievement of 12 SDGs. However, NCPs were reported to be declining across Nepal, ultimately undermining Nepal’s ability to achieve SDG targets. The major direct drivers of decline were land-use change, over-exploitation, and climate change. These direct drivers were linked to conventional development interventions, including agricultural expansion and the construction of road and energy infrastructure. However, some interventions, such as community forestry and protected areas, increased the supply of NCPs. Better integration of Indigenous knowledge and local practices was also reported to be effective in improving the provision of NCPs and contributing to improving livelihoods at local scales. We identified opportunities for further research in NCPs, particularly in increasing geographical representativeness and improving our understanding of non-material NCPs. Our approach of combining the IPBES conceptual framework and the SDGs enabled us to more comprehensively identify how progress towards the SDGs are mediated by NCPs and provides actionable guidelines for how to take more integrative measures to achieve the SDGs in Nepal and countries facing similar development challenges. © 2022 The Author(s).

Linking soils to ecosystem services - A global review,"Soil plays a crucial role in ecosystem functioning. In the 1990s ecosystem services (ES) research focused on developing the concept and framework and only a few studies linked soil properties to ecosystem services. This study reviews the literature on the relationship between soils and ecosystem services and aims to contribute to the scientific understanding on soil and ecosystem services and their interrelations. Most studies have focused on provisioning and regulating ES relating to soil physico-chemical properties. Cultural services had only a few studies, and supporting services were mostly related to soil physico-chemical and biological properties. The number of ES papers increased rapidly after 2000 and in the past 5 years, regulating services such as carbon sequestration, climate and gas regulations, were commonly studied. Once the concept was established in the 1990s, studies focusing on the assessment, valuation, and payments of services became more prominent. Most soil-ES research is published in Geoderma. Soil scientists seems to be hesitant to use the term 'ecosystem services' even if their research is devoted to linking soils to ecosystem services. We suggest that future ES research should focus on exploring soil functional diversity of soil biota and the spatial aspects of soil properties to lower level ecosystem services (e.g., water purification, gene pool, and climate regulation). Soil scientists should engage professionals from other disciplines to further promote the contribution of soils to ecosystem services delivery and human well-being. ES soil studies could be used in local and national policy development and program on natural resource use and management (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Green library practices in selected academic libraries in Kwara State, Nigeria","This study investigated green library practices in selected academic libraries in Kwara State, Nigeria. The study adopted an exploratory design. A purposive sampling technique was used to select 18 librarians as the participants for the study, and the interview method was adopted for data collection. The findings reveal that all the academic libraries engaged in the fumigation of their environment to preserve library resources, and the level of adoption of information and communications technology resulted in the libraries having a high carbon footprint. The results also show that the academic libraries engaged in resource-sharing for economic sustainability and that they have value for their users in terms of social and cultural support. It is recommended that university management teams provide adequate funding to develop eco-friendly practices in university libraries, and that academic libraries provide solar systems to all their library units to enhance environmentally conscious practices. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Potential application of Latin American silvopastoral systems experiences for improving ruminant farming in Nigeria: a review,"In a world marked by shifting climate patterns, a growing human population, and rising demand for ruminant-derived protein, producers face the need to implement strategies that enhance productivity, reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), promote adaptability, and improve the sustainability of milk and meat production while optimizing resource use. One promising strategy to address these challenges is the adoption of silvopastoral production systems, which combine livestock with trees and shrubs. These systems are widely used in Latin America due to their proven benefits in terms of production, reduced emission intensity, land utilization efficiency, and other ecosystem services. Transferring technology from one region to another necessitates adapting these techniques to suit the receiving environment. This review suggests that the successful silvopastoral systems employed in the Latin America context can be effectively introduced in Nigeria, offering potential advantages for livestock owners. The research encompassed in this review demonstrates that the utilization of silvopastoral systems in ruminant farming can contribute to achieving several sustainable development goals, including enhancing food security, increasing milk and meat yields, supporting conservation efforts, bolstering biodiversity, and reducing GHG emissions. At the level of individual farms, the adoption of silvopastoral systems (SPS) can enhance the stability and resilience of farmers' livelihoods, boost milk production, facilitate animal growth, and improve animal welfare. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Wetlands and conservation: Exploring biodiversity dynamics, economic potentials, and conservation strategies in South Africa","Wetlands in South Africa, classified under the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) categorization system, face significant threats despite covering only 2.4% of the country's geographical area. A report by the Department of Water and Sanitation revealed that half of South Africa's native wetland area has been lost, rendering wetlands the most threatened ecosystems in the country. Out of 791 wetland habitats, 48% are severely endangered, while only 11% receive adequate protection. Primarily found in mesic eastern regions, wetlands in South Africa play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision. However, they are often degraded by factors such as eutrophication, drainage, and industrial effluent discharge. Notable wetland flora and fauna found in the country include various plant families and animal species, highlighting their rich biodiversity. Moreover, wetlands serve as valuable resources for income generation through initiatives like the Biogreen Project and the Wetlands for Life Initiative. Case studies have illustrated the gross domestic product (GDP) generation potential of wetlands in South Africa, such as targeting invasive plant species for biofuel production. Creativities like the wetlands for Life Initiative focused on wastewater treatment and biofertilizer production, promotes sustainable agriculture while the GreenTech Solutions Project demonstrates innovative technologies for wetland-based energy production. With the current energy and water need in South Africa, the coming years will witness efforts to integrate wetlands with sustainable farming systems and enhanced energy productivity. Collaboration among government agencies, conservation organizations, scientists, and local communities is essential for successful wetland conservation, as demonstrated by initiatives like the Working for Wetlands program led by the Department of Forestry, Fisheries, and the Environment. Overall, wetland conservation remains paramount in safeguarding these unique ecosystems and the myriad benefits they provide to both the environment and society. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Resilience in the face of ecological challenges: Strategies for integrating environmental considerations into social policy planning in Africa,"Africa faces severe ecological crises, such as climate change, resource depletion, and biodiversity loss, undermining sustainable development efforts and exacerbating poverty and hunger. Integrating environmental concerns into social policy planning could help build community resilience and support sustainable development. This study employed policy analysis and stakeholder engagement to identify key environmental issues, policy gaps, and strategies for integrating environmental considerations into social policies across various sectors in Africa. The study found a significant lack of integration of environmental concerns into social policy across areas like disaster management, agriculture, urban planning, healthcare access, and infrastructure development policies. As a percentage of respondents, the top environmental issues were flooding (32%), drought/desertification (13%), and food security/agriculture (11%), with farmers (35.4%) and women (21.7%) being the most vulnerable to climate change. Most community stakeholders (87.5%) emphasized the importance of integrating environmental considerations into social policy, with 56.25% rating it a high priority. They underscored the need for more locally driven planning, ecological monitoring, land restoration, diversified livelihoods, and climate change adaptation support through social policies to enhance environmental sustainability. This study's novelty lies in its comprehensive approach to understanding and addressing the complex interplay between environmental challenges and social policy planning in Africa. The findings emphasize the urgent need for policymakers to develop cross-sectoral national and local policies that use participatory processes to prioritize environmental sustainability, adaptation, community empowerment, and alignment with sustainable development goals while being responsive to continuing environmental uncertainty and change.",Not About Sufficiency

Solar Hydrogen Production and Storage in Solid Form: Prospects for Materials and Methods,"Climatic changes are reaching alarming levels globally, seriously impacting the environment. To address this environmental crisis and achieve carbon neutrality, transitioning to hydrogen energy is crucial. Hydrogen is a clean energy source that produces no carbon emissions, making it essential in the technological era for meeting energy needs while reducing environmental pollution. Abundant in nature as water and hydrocarbons, hydrogen must be converted into a usable form for practical applications. Various techniques are employed to generate hydrogen from water, with solar hydrogen production—using solar light to split water—standing out as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach. However, the widespread adoption of hydrogen energy is challenged by transportation and storage issues, as it requires compressed and liquefied gas storage tanks. Solid hydrogen storage offers a promising solution, providing an effective and low-cost method for storing and releasing hydrogen. Solar hydrogen generation by water splitting is more efficient than other methods, as it uses self-generated power. Similarly, solid storage of hydrogen is also attractive in many ways, including efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This can be achieved through chemical adsorption in materials such as hydrides and other forms. These methods seem to be costly initially, but once the materials and methods are established, they will become more attractive considering rising fuel prices, depletion of fossil fuel resources, and advancements in science and technology. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are highly efficient for converting hydrogen into electrical energy, producing clean electricity with no emissions. If proper materials and methods are established for solar hydrogen generation and solid hydrogen storage under ambient conditions, solar light used for hydrogen generation and utilization via solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) will be an efficient, safe, and cost-effective technique. With the ongoing development in materials for solar hydrogen generation and solid storage techniques, this method is expected to soon become more feasible and cost-effective. This review comprehensively consolidates research on solar hydrogen generation and solid hydrogen storage, focusing on global standards such as 6.5 wt% gravimetric capacity at temperatures between −40 and 60 °C. It summarizes various materials used for efficient hydrogen generation through water splitting and solid storage, and discusses current challenges in hydrogen generation and storage. This includes material selection, and the structural and chemical modifications needed for optimal performance and potential applications. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Understanding the expansion of oil palm cultivation: A case-study in Papua,"The overall objective of this article is to understand the reasons underlying the expansion of oil palm plantations in forested land, as well as to define ways to improve business as usual practices in Indonesia. In order to do so, a case study is addressed in a recently established oil palm plantation in Papua, Indonesia. Based on field work and literature data a cost benefit analysis comparing the benefits of the original primary forest land use to those of the newly established oil palm plantation was conducted. It was shown that development is important to local population; oil palm plantations can bring wealth and improved living standards, but establishment on forested areas also takes a lot of value away due to the loss of ecosystem services. The benefits from primary forest ecosystem services were estimated at 3,795.44 USD ha −1 y −1 while the profits estimated for the new established oil plantation were 2,153.00 USD ha −1 y −1 , therefore the land use change was not feasible. When running sensitivity analysis, it was revealed that prices of carbon emissions and commodities (Crude Palm Oil and Kernel Oil) have a large impact on the results. The beneficiaries are changing due to land use change, being the local population the biggest loser and the plantation company the biggest winner. Benefits are transferred from the local and global level to the national level. Case to case feasibility analysis including economic, environmental and social aspects should be required in advance to decide on the approval of an oil palm project. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Modeling long-term attainable soil organic carbon sequestration across the highlands of Ethiopia,"The objectives of this study across the highlands of Ethiopia were: (i) to characterize the association between soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and biophysical variables and (ii) to model and map attainable SOC sequestration associated with five improved land management practices. The spatial distribution of the SOC stock was studied using a multiple linear regression model driven by eight biophysical predictors. A widely used SOC model (RothC) was then used to model changes in SOC over the next 20–50 years of improved land management. Simulations were driven by the derived SOC stocks, pH and clay contents that are available in the ISRIC soils database at 250 m resolution and climate data from the “Enhancing National Climate Services Initiative” database. Organic carbon inputs to the model were estimated from the “Improved Crop Varieties Yield Register” of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Resource and the Central Statistics Authority. After 50 years of conservation tillage with 80% of available manure applied to cultivated land, the total SOC stock increased by 169,182,174 t, which is 2.8 times higher than the stock increase with only 50% of available manure applied. Introduction of improved pasture species and measures to control soil erosion was an important source of net carbon sequestration in grasslands. Afforestation and reforestation of degraded landscapes and protection of natural ecosystems further increased soil carbon. This highlights the importance of improved land management practices to SOC sequestration, which in turn could enhance agricultural productivity, food security and sustainable development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"An overview of land degradation, desertification and sustainable land management using GIS and remote sensing applications","Land degradation (LD) poses a major threat to food security, livelihoods sustainability, ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. The total area of arable land in the world is estimated at 7616 million acres or only 24% of the total area of the land surface, and currently about half of this area is cultivated. The productivity of arable land depends mainly on soil formation and management. Soil contains mineral components, organic matter and microorganism in a natural dynamic balance whose components have been formed in thousands and millions of years (geologic ages). Disruption of this balance due to human pressures and poor land use leads to soil degradation in few years. Scientists differed in setting a precise definition of the concept and dimensions of land degradation, but many agreed on the general concept of land degradation: ‘quantitative or qualitative change in the properties of soil that reduces the land's potential for production’ and the more comprehensive definition that land degradation is Change in the characteristics of the Earth. Leading to the creation of more desert or drier conditions, due to the decline or deterioration of the load of biological energy for a period of time does not have to be continuous, but temporary. Additionally, organic farming might be a substitute to prevent the deterioration of our soil. The emphasis of the current review is on how land degradation affects agriculture and the environment, as well as how we can manage our lands to prevent further degradation. Therefore, this review will focus in explain the land degradation definition and concept, and presenting two case studies from Egypt and India. © 2023, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Al–SrTiO3/Au/CdS Z-schemes for the efficient photocatalytic H2 production under visible light,"Development of sustainable solar fuels to meet the continued increase in the energy need worldwide is of particular importance. In addition, reducing carbon emissions could be the last hope to solve global challenges such as global warming and climate change. For this endeavor, different Al–SrTiO 3/Au/CdS Z-Scheme samples were developed by changing the weight percentage (wt. %) of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and the wt% ratio of Al–SrTiO3 to CdS NPs using post annealing of mixed powders method. The prepared samples were characterized using several physicochemical techniques to reveal their properties, then their photocatalytic H2 evolution performance was evaluated under visible light using photodeposited RhCr2O3 as H2 evolution cocatalyst. Our results showed that, Al–SrTiO3 particles possessed high crystallinity and cubic perovskite phase, Au NPs exhibited face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, and CdS NPs had cubic Zinc Blende phase as confirmed by XRD analysis. Our UV–Vis. diffuse reflectance analysis revealed that all prepared Z-scheme samples obtained a strong absorption in both UV and visible regions. SEM analysis confirmed the cubic morphology of the perovskite Al–SrTiO3 particles which were randomly deposited by Au NPs of relatively smaller size. While CdS NPs showed semi-spherical shape and were conjugated with Al–SrTiO3 directly to form the proposed Z-Schemes as proposed by our STEM mapping analysis. The highest amount of H2 (656.7 μ mole) was evolved by Al–SrTiO3/4 wt% Au/CdS (1:1) Z-scheme sample after 3 h of visible light irradiation. This sample had 4 wt % of Au NPs and equimolar ratio of Al–SrTiO3 and CdS NPs. This relatively higher activity might be because of the efficient light absorption, prolonged lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers and improved charge separation as revealed by the PL analysis. Our study can promote the ongoing efforts toward more carbon neutral societies. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",Not About Sufficiency
Are prevailing policy tools effective in conserving ecosystem services under individual private tenure? Challenges and policy gaps in a rapidly urbanizing region,"Forestlands worldwide provide vital ecosystem services (ES) essential for human well-being yet are facing rising threats from land-use/land-cover change. Land ownership patterns and property rights significantly influence land management practices and the protection of ES. Family forest owners (FFOs) are the targets of numerous conservation policies and programs, many of which are built around economic incentives and market-based instruments. This study combines a mail-administered survey with land use-land cover change modeling results to better understand whether FFOs plan to convert their properties, what motivates FFOs to adopt prevailing policies, and what other conservation policy models might be attractive. Our research focuses on FFOs whose parcels are identified as having high conservation values in a rapidly urbanizing watershed. Survey results show strong motivations among FFOs to protect biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and ES while expressing concerns about property taxes, regulations, and land-use threats. Our analysis indicates a relationship between anticipated land transfers or residential development and predicting factors including parcel size, government regulations, and tax concerns. Results reveal a gap between the design of existing conservation programs and FFOs' interest in adoption. Limited interest in conservation easements and carbon markets underscores the need for more flexible conservation tools aligned with landowner preferences. Moreover, FFOs' considerable awareness of existing conservation programs, alongside ongoing forest loss in the study region, underscores enrollment obstacles such as minimum-size eligibility requirements, thereby highlighting inadequacy of current frameworks in incentivizing long-term conservation outcomes. The findings from the studied watershed may have broader relevance for regions with similar land ownership patterns, land use dynamics, and political contexts worldwide.",Not About Sufficiency

Climate-Related Vulnerability Assessment Toward Disaster Risk Reduction: Insight from Pakistan,"Globally, climate-related disasters (CRDs) have become a common phenomenon in the last few decades, increasing vulnerability and causing disaster mortality. To manage disaster risk, the global Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction (SFDRR) provides a solid action plan for disaster risk reduction (DRR) considering all the dimensions of vulnerability. However, countries are still less receptive at the local level to adopting the SFDRR. Also, the global research community did not explore vulnerability features based on the Sendai Framework nor integrated such features with the four priorities of SFDRR. Based on the case of Pakistan, this study seeks to bridge the gap through three objectives. The first objective of the study is to identify the vulnerability features cited in the SFDRR. In addition, the research aims to develop a new vulnerability model by integrating SFDRR's four priorities. As a second objective, it is intended to develop a decision support framework for ranking and evaluating each of the SFDRR priority action areas under local conditions. A third objective is to assess the impact of climate-induced environmental, socioeconomic and political vulnerabilities on climate-driven mortality. To meet these three different objectives, the authors have adopted a multi-method approach by using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and binary logistic regression method (BLRM). Based on the assessment, the authors suggested some policy implications. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Not About Sufficiency
A paradigm shift in sustainable use of natural resources and their ecosystem services,"The sustainable development of natural resources along with interconnected crises of climate change, economic recession, food insecurity, increasing fuel consumption, and inflation in commodity prices have become hot burninign issue from last few decades, which have the greatest and most devastating impact on society's poor families. The theme of this chapter is to focus on the global issues of sustainable development, including knowledge of the interconnected crises in climate, energy, economy, poverty, and social injustice. This book chapter examines how practical science can be applied to real-world conservation and development problems to interpret natural resource management for those who must manage complex natural resource systems. It includes a significantly extended discussion of ecosystem assessment in which poverty, education, tradiation and other factors remains central concern to sustainable development. Finding solutions to and prevention of these crises necessitate interconnected and interdisciplinary thinking, which is also at the heart of sustainable development. The chapter takes a fresh look at the problem of attaining lower-carbon growth, climate adaptation, and the consequences for the long-term development of rapidly expanding economies. It investigates how these concerns are prompting serious reconsideration of what sustainable development is, what it should be, and how sustainable development policies and processes are being reassessed. It provides a concise, well-illustrated, and understandable introduction to the challenges and prospects of sustainable development, with a focus on developing countries. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.
