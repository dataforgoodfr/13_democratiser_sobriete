"""Georgetown ain't got a tree. We got the trees""-Amerindian Power & Participation in Guyana's Low Carbon Development Strategy","International bi-lateral agreements to support the conservation of rainforests to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are growing in prevalence. In 2009, the governments of Guyana and Norway established Guyana's Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS). We examine the extent to which the participation and inclusion of Guyana's indigenous population within the LCDS is being achieved. We conducted a single site case study, focussing on the experiences and perceptions from the Amerindian community of Chenapou. Based on 30 interviews, we find that a deficit of adequate dialogue and consultation has occurred in the six years since the LCDS was established. Moreover, key indigenous rights, inscribed at both a national and international level, have not been upheld with respect to the community of Chenapou. Our findings identify consistent shortcomings to achieve genuine participation and the distinct and reinforced marginalisation of Amerindian communities within the LCDS. A further critique is the failure of the government to act on previous research, indicating a weakness of not including indigenous groups in the Guyana-Norway bi-lateral agreement. We conclude that, if the government is to uphold the rights of Amerindian communities in Guyana, significant adjustments are needed. A more contextualised governance, decentralising power and offering genuine participation and inclusion, is required to support the engagement of marginal forest-dependent communities in the management of their natural resources.",Not About Sufficiency
"""Get us partnerships!""-a qualitative study of Angolan and Mozambican health academics' experiences with North/South partnerships","Background Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 17 focuses on North/South partnerships for sustainable development. Literature on research partnerships and capacity -building often neglects how these processes are carried out in practice, their social impacts and participants' subjective experiences. Recognizing the increasingly global dimensions of Higher Education Institutions, the University Development and Innovation - Africa project (UDI-A) was designed to train lecturers and administrative staff of Angolan and Mozambican Universities through collaborations with European institutions, aiming at strengthening African academic and social landscapes through knowledge translation and dissemination. This paper examines potential outcomes of UDI-A on participants' academic pathways, investigating the conflict between different imaginaries of capacity-building and partnerships, focusing on how Angolan and Mozambican health sciences researchers experience international collaborations. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven health academics, as well as a focus group discussion involving all participants. These were recorded, fully transcribed, anonymized and coded to identify common themes. A consent form was signed by all participants. Results and discussion UDI-A was considered innovative, fostering the improvement of pedagogical skills and increasing social entrepreneurship activities. Participants arrived with a specific institutional mandate and believed that the training received should be incorporated into institutional practices to ""modernize"" these specific Portuguese speaking African Universities and the health sector. The institutional mechanisms put in place to attain this goal, Centres for Academic Development and Innovation (""CADIs""), were considered potential research and development hubs and drivers of academic and societal transformation. Nevertheless, participants shared a sense of asymmetry (infrastructural, financial, in terms of access to information) between them and European trainers. Although this asymmetry was the underlying basis of this capacity-building project, they argued that UDI-A did not fully acknowledge their local contexts, compromising the prospective development of partnerships in the health field. Conclusions More attention should be devoted to understanding how participants experience capacity building processes, integrating the diversity of their aspirations and perceptions into subsequent phases of the project, requiring the development of methodological innovations to increase the impact of these programs.",Not About Sufficiency
1100-years history of transformation of the East European forest-steppe into arable land: Case study from Kursk region (Russia),"Large parts of the East European forest-steppe are covered by agricultural and pastoral landscapes with decreasing proportions of semi-natural meadow steppes and fragments of semi-natural woodland. Although numerous palynological records indicate that a total deforestation occurred in the last 500 years, the details of the transformation from natural vegetation into an agrarian landscape are still lacking as well as an evaluation of the political role in this process. This study focuses on the vegetation and fire history at the northern edge of the forest-steppe in the Kursk region (Russia) and aim to reconstruct the transformation process in its historical context. New pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs and charcoal records with decennial to centennial resolution obtained from the Seim River region enable a comprehensive reconstruction of the local and regional landscape history over the last 1100 years. The palynological records provide unique insights into the heterogeneous vegetation cover of microregions and evidence spatial asynchronous deforestation and crop field creation. The findings highlight a crucial role of political systems on the formation of agro-pastoral landscapes with small remaining forest patches of today. The heterogeneity of the natural vegetation distribution before major deforestation as well as the duration of human impact should be considered in ecosystem restoration projects.",Not About Sufficiency
A bibliometric analysis of the hydrogen production from dark fermentation,"Hydrogen energy plays an important role in solving the environmental problems caused by the fuel crisis and greenhouse gas emissions. However, hydrogen application on an industrial scale still requires technological advances, especially in choosing the best technological route for the recovery of renewable and cost-effective hydrogen. Therefore, this bibliometric review evaluated the research progress, trends, updates, and hotspots on hydrogen production from dark fermentation. The Web of Science(C) database was used to select the documents from 2000 to 2021, and the VOSviewer(C) and Bibliometrix softwares were used to carry out the bibliometric investigation. The results demonstrated that 3071 documents (2755 articles and 316 reviews) studied the hydrogen production from dark fermentation over the last 21 years. The number of publications exponentially increased in the last five years, which can be associated with the demand for new technologies to produce clean energy sources and decrease the environmental impacts caused by petroleum-based fuel. Keyword analysis revealed that the studies focused on the operational parameters, process optimization, pretreatment, and microbial community, aiming to increase the hydrogen yield during dark fermentation. Finally, this comprehensive review provides future directions for applying dark fermentation to produce hydrogen as a sustainable and renewable fuel in a biorefiney concept.

A call to arms for cell-cell interactions between bacteria in the plant microbiome,"Next-generation sequencing and computational biology has unravelled the different bacterial groups populating plant microbiomes. In addition, microbiologists have discovered many different mechanisms of cell-cell interactions that take place between bacteria. Bacteria use four prevalent mechanisms for intercellular interactions; however, their pertinent role in the formation and maintenance of plant microbiomes is currently unknown. We argue that it is overdue to speed up research on the biotic cell-cell interactions that take place between bacteria in plant microbiomes. This research will have a major impact on both fundamental sciences and translational agriculture via the development of bacterial prebiotic compounds as well probiotics competence, resulting in a more sustainable agriculture of economically important crops.",Not About Sufficiency
A Caribbean New Urban Agenda post-Habitat III: Closing the gaps,"Urbanisation, climate change and natural hazards present serious challenges for the Caribbean which Habitat III brought into focus. This paper critically examines problems associated with these complex challenges, to propose a relevant Caribbean specific New Urban Agenda and suggest implementation mechanisms which are essential to forge ahead. It reviews urban issues for fifteen countries that constitute the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). These problems are investigated from the perspective of four pillars of economic, social and environmental sustainability, and governance. The paper reveals that with the application of these main components and related thematic elements, many countries in this grouping are underperforming in achieving the sustainable development goal of safe, resilient and sustainable urban settlements. The main conclusion drawn is that countries of the CARICOM Caribbean should not adopt an imported blueprint to resolve critical urban issues. This is an opportune time for crafting a relevant indigenous New Urban Agenda for CARICOM Caribbean countries and finding the right implementation mechanisms to be at the frontline of change.

A case study of the opportunities and trade-offs associated with deproclamation of a protected area following a land claim in South Africa,"Reconciling conservation and social justice imperatives is a major challenge facing many postcolonial states worldwide. Where historically disenfranchised communities have laid legal claim to protected areas, the typical resolution has been collaborative management agreements between the state and claimant communities. The real outcomes of such strategies for people and ecosystems have been seriously questioned, although alternative approaches are seldom explored. Here, we reflect on one such alternative that was pursued in a case in South Africa, where the land was handed back to the community and a replacement protected area created. Our objective was to explore the opportunities and trade-offs associated with this approach for communities and conservation agencies alike, and to compare these to typical collaborative management outcomes. Methods included key informant interviews, focus group discussions and household surveys. We find that, surprisingly, this approach created more benefits for the conservation agency than for claimant communities. Indeed, the community experiences bore a striking resemblance to those experienced in collaborative management settings: intra-community conflict, confusion over leadership and serious questions about the boundaries of the ""community"". Processes aimed at redressing past injustice in disputes over conservation land, regardless of the approach adopted, must bring with them a strong commitment to building institutional and leadership capacities within communities, and pay serious attention to the ways in which equity and social justice can be fostered after the settlement of a land claim. Settlement agreements are frequently treated as the final step towards social justice, but are in fact just the beginning.",Not About Sufficiency

A comparison of voluntary and mandated climate change-related disclosure,"This study draws on legitimacy theory to investigate the relationship between mandatory disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions by companies that are subject to specific environmental legislation (the Australian National Greenhouse Energy Reporting Act 2007) and the level of voluntary environmental disclosures. Using a sample of 535 observations, we find that i) Overall, legislation-affected companies increase their disclosures compared with non-affected companies, ii) As many companies reduce their disclosures as increase them, iii) there is an increase in the level of emissions volume disclosures in legislation-affected companies compared with the same company pre-implementation, iv) legislation-affected higher emitters have higher levels of voluntary disclosures. These findings are consistent with legitimacy theory, which predicts differential disclosures in circumstances to avoid scrutiny. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A comprehensive review of biomass based thermochemical conversion technologies integrated with CO2 capture and utilisation within BECCS networks,"The future of the global environment is at threat due to global warming and climate change primarily driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage/utilisation (BECCS/U) through its CO2 negative emission capacity is considered a principal component of global mitigation strategies as agreed in the Paris climate change agreement. In this study, the current global status and efforts to implement BECCS systems are comprehensively reviewed. The potential for thermochemical conversion processes (combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, and liquefaction) to manifest within BECCS systems is analysed, in addition to their integration potential with carbon dioxide capture methods. Outcomes suggest that gasification and combustion processes when integrated with CO2 capture and storage (CCS), within combine heat and power (CHP) configurations, biomass integrated gasification combine cycle (BIGCC) and chemical looping cycle (CLC) are mature technologies. Furthermore, this review indicates that pyrolysis and liquefaction process are commercial and lab-scale respectively. When integrated within BECCS systems, pyrolysis systems are at the pilot level and liquefaction processes are at lab scale. Moreover, a comprehensive discussion on the negative emission potential from various BECCS configurations is provided, highlighting their role in advancing bio-refineries through waste management and conversion to value-added products such as biochar, ethanol, bio diesel etc. The pyrolysis process has CO2 mitigation potential of 2.2 GtCO(2)/year by 2020-2050. Finally, an insight into the commercial barriers and future perspectives of BECCS technologies, role of international supply chains therein, and the need for effective stakeholder management to facilitate BECCS systems within global trade.",Not About Sufficiency
A critical review on biochar for environmental applications,"Water contamination is one of the most pressing environmental issues of the present. There is a significant amount of interest in the slow pyrolysis of biomass to produce biochar, a solid byproduct that is stable and rich in carbon. Adsorbents manufactured from hydrochars, sometimes referred to as hydrochar created by hydrothermal methods, have been tested for the removal of possible contaminants from wastewater. The hydrothermal processes of hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and liquefaction (HTL) yield hydrochars, a distinct category of biochar. Because of its peak efficiency, large surface area, large size of pore and capacity to regenerate, hydrochar is an acceptable option for the rehabilitation of a range of pollutants. The formation, activation, identification, and use of biochar and hydrochar were highlighted in this review. The physiochemical properties of the char produced by the two processes are very different, which has an impact on their potential uses in areas like wastewater pollution remediation, soil improvement, greenhouse gas emission and carbon sequestration among others.",Not About Sufficiency
A Duty to Care: The Case of Sharma v Minister for the Environment [2021] FCA 560,"This analysis considers the implications of Sharma v Minister for the Environment [2021] FCA 560 and its finding of a novel duty of care owed by the Australian Government to children to prevent climate harms. While the judgment of a single Federal Court justice is likely to be appealed and did not result in an injunction halting the coal mine, its close consideration of scientific evidence of climate impacts and recognition of the special vulnerability of children has potentially profound ramifications for the ongoing development of climate litigation, both in Australia and globally. More broadly, the Sharma decision adds to growing momentum for governments to be held accountable for their actions on climate change, effectively calling for a duty to care in the face of inter-generational injustices inflicted by inaction on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to safe levels.",Not About Sufficiency
"A methodology for evaluating the effects of climate change on climatic design conditions for buildings and application to a case study in Madison, Wisconsin","Climatic design conditions are widely used by the building community as environmental parameters informing the size and energy requirements for heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, along with other building design characteristics. Climatic design conditions are calculated by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers using historical climate data. Our work advances methods for projecting future climate design conditions based on data from global climate models. These models do not typically archive the hourly data required for climate design condition calculations, and they often exhibit large biases in extreme conditions, daily minimum temperatures and daily maximum temperatures needed for climatic design conditions. We present a method for rescaling historical hourly data under future climatic states to estimate the impact of climate change on future building climatic design conditions. This rescaling method is then used to calculate future climatic design conditions in Madison, Wisconsin, throughout the 21st century for two future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The results are consistent with a warming climate and show increases in heating, cooling, humidification and dehumidification design conditions, suggesting less extreme cold conditions and more extreme hot and humid conditions in Madison. The design conditions used for estimating energy demand, degree days, show that under a business-as-usual scenario, by the mid-century, building heating and cooling in Madison (climate zone 5A) will be similar to the current heating demand in Chicago, IL (climate zone 5A) and cooling demand in Baltimore, MD (climate zone 4A); by the late-century, building heating and cooling in Madison will resemble the current heating demand in St Louis, MO (climate zone 4A) and cooling demand in Augusta, GA (climate zone 3A). Given the rapid pace of climate change in the 21st century, our work suggests that historical design conditions may become obsolete during even the initial stages of a building's expected life span. Changes in climatic design conditions in Madison highlight the importance of considering future climatic changes in building design to ensure that buildings built today meet the performance needs of the future.",Not About Sufficiency
A mini review on renewable sources for biofuel,"Rapid growth in both global energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions associated with the use of fossil fuels has driven the search for alternative sources which are renewable and have a lower environmental impact. This paper reviews the availability and bioenergy potentials of the current biomass feedstocks. These include (i) food crops such as sugarcane, corn and vegetable oils, classified as the first generation feedstocks, and (ii) lignocellulosic biomass derived from agricultural and forestry residues and municipal waste, as second generation feedstocks. The environmental and socioeconomic limitations of the first generation feedstocks have placed greater emphasis on the lignocellulosic biomass, of which the conversion technologies still faces major constraints to full commercial deployment. Key technical challenges and opportunities of the lignocellulosic biomass-to-bioenergy production are discussed in comparison with the first generation technologies. The potential of the emerging third generation biofuel from algal biomass is also reviewed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
A new generation of centrifugal pumps for high conversion efficiency,"Centrifugal pumps are fundamental machines in our daily life. Indeed, they can be found everywhere, for instance, in domestic, civil, industrial, and agricultural fields. In the last years, the pump market has newly gained a boost coherently with the world demographic growth. Pumps are among the main responsible for electric energy consumption, therefore even a slight efficiency improvement (+1%) can be effective in contrasting the growth of the global Greenhouse Gas Emissions (at least -570 tCO(2)/day in Europe). For this reason, a new generation of centrifugal pumps is here proposed. In particular, the impeller has been redesigned improving the flow guidance inside the vanes and simultaneously reducing the number of blades, with the aim to increase the blade loading, reducing manufacturing costs, and enhancing the conversion efficiency with respect to conventional configurations. Furthermore, the new impeller design respects all the geometrical constraints of the corresponding conventional configuration, allowing its retrofit with a boost of performance. To reach these goals, a 1D in-house code has been developed implementing a Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) for the selection of the most suitable design point (H and Q), and introducing two parameters for the blade loading evaluation, namely, the blade pressure coefficient (C-p,C- blade), computed locally along the impeller blade walls, and the blade lift coefficient (C-L), achieving an optimal vane arrangement. Starting from a baseline centrifugal pump, the novel impeller has been designed, manufactured, and finally experimentally tested. The resulting new generation of centrifugal pumps actually proves to have a higher performance (maximum efficiency at BEP +1%), a flatter efficiency curve, and a monotone bending characteristic curve, while keeping unchanged the required Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH3%).",Not About Sufficiency
A novel framework for developing environmentally sustainable and cost-effective ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) using advanced machine learning and multi-objective optimization techniques,"This study aims to propose a novel framework for strength prediction and multi-objective optimization (MOO) of economical and environmentally sustainable ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) which aids in intelligent, sustainable, and resilient construction. Different tree- and boosting ensemble-based machine learning (ML) models are integrated to form an accurate and reliable prediction model for the uniaxial compressive strength of UHPC. The optimized models are integrated into a super learner model, resulting in a robust predictive model that is used as one of the objective functions in the MOO problem. A total of 19 objective functions are considered, including cost, uniaxial compressive strength, and 17 environmental impact categories that comprehensively evaluate the environmental sustainability of the UHPC mix. The resulting impacts from the mid-point indicators were calculated using the Eco-invent v3.7 Life Cycle Inventory database. The results showed that the super learner model accurately predicted the uniaxial compressive strength of UHPC. The MOO resulted in Pareto fronts, demonstrating the trade-off among the uniaxial compressive strength, cost, and environmental sustainability of the mix and a broad range of solutions that can be obtained for the 19 objectives. The study provides a useful tool for designers and decision-makers to select the optimal UHPC mixture that meets specific project requirements. Finally, for the practical application of the ML predictive model and MOO algorithm for UHPC, a graphical user interface-based software tool, FAI-OSUSCONCRET, was developed. This software tool offers fast, accurate, and intelligent predictions and multi-objective optimizations tailored to specific project requirements, thus resulting in a UHPC mixture that perfectly meets project needs.",Not About Sufficiency
A numerical investigation into the anomalous slight NOx increase when burning biodiesel; A new (old) theory,"Biodiesel is a notable alternative to petroleum derived diesel fuel because it comes from natural domestic sources and thus reduces dependence on diminishing petroleum fuel from foreign sources, it likely lowers lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, and it lowers an engine's emission of most pollutants as compared to petroleum derived diesel. However, the use of biodiesel often slightly increases a diesel engine's emission of smog forming nitrogen oxides (NOx) relative to petroleum diesel. In this paper, previously proposed theories for this slight NOx increase are reviewed, including theories based on biodiesel's cetane number, which leads to differing amounts of charge preheating, and theories based on the fuel's bulk modulus, which affects injection timing. This paper proposes an additional theory for the slight NOx increase of biodiesel. Biodiesel typically contains more double bonded molecules than petroleum derived diesel. These double bonded molecules have a slightly higher adiabatic flame temperature, which leads to the increase in NOx production for biodiesel. Our theory was verified using numerical simulations to show a NOx increase, due to the double bonded molecules, that is consistent with observation. Further, the details of these numerical simulations show that NOx is predominantly due to the Zeldovich mechanism. Published by Elsevier B. V.",Not About Sufficiency
A parallel framework on hybrid architectures for raster-based geospatial cellular automata models,"Geospatial cellular automata (Geo-CA) models have encountered challenges in computing efficiency and scalability when conducting large-scale land use change simulation applications. Parallel computing has proven to be effective to address these challenges. However, parallelization strategies for existing parallel Geo-CA models are always optimized for specific models and lack applicability to others. Besides, most parallel Geo-CA models focus on parallelizing land use change simulations, ignoring land use transition rule mining. Moreover, there is a lack of effective parallel strategies for demand-constrained land use change simulation on distributed heterogeneous architectures. This study proposes a parallel framework on hybrid parallel computing architectures applicable for raster-based Geo-CA models to enhance their computing efficiency and scalability while maintaining simulation accuracy. The framework provides parallelization strategies for both the land use transition rule mining for multiple land use types and the demand-constrained land use change simulation on distributed heterogeneous architectures. The framework was employed to parallelize two contemporary Geo-CA models, i.e., PLUS and MCCA. Experiments showed that the parallelized models achieved significant improvements in computing efficiency and scalability, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework for large-scale land use change simulation studies.",Not About Sufficiency
A practical evaluation on integrated role of biochar and nanomaterials in soil remediation processes,"Soil decontamination and restoration continue to be a key environmental concern around the globe. The degradation of soil resources due to the presence of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) has a substantial influence on agricultural production, food security, and human well-being, and as a result, urgent action is required. PTEs pollution is not a threat to the agroecosystems but also a serious concern to human health; thereby, it needs to be addressed timely and effectively. Hence, the development of improved and cost-effective procedures to remove PTEs from polluted soils is imperative. With this context in mind, current review is designed to distinctly envisage the PTEs removal potential by the single and binary applications of biochar (BC) and nanomaterials (NMs).2 Recently, BC, a product of high-temperature biomass pyrolysis with high specific surface area, porosity, and distinctive physical and chemical properties has become one of the most used and economic adsorbent materials. Also, biochar's application has generated interest in a variety of fields and environments as a modern approach against the era of urbanization, industrialization, and climate change. Likewise, several NMs including metals and their oxides, carbon materials, zeolites, and bimetallic-based NMs have been documented as having the potential to remediate PTEs-polluted environments. However, both techniques have their own set of advantages and disadvantages, therefore combining them can be a more effective strategy to address the growing concern over the rapid accumulation and release of PTEs into the environment.",Not About Sufficiency

A review of recent modification strategies of TiO2-based photoanodes for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting performance,"To address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and sea level rise brought on by global climate change, hydrogen (H2) has the capacity to substitute fossil fuels as a carbon-free source of energy. The most reliable method of producing H2 is photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, which uses water and solar as renewable energy sources. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the excellent semiconductors utilized as an effective photoanode in PEC water splitting due to its efficient light absorption, cost-effectiveness and excellent photostability. The primary emphasis of this review was on the various techniques used to modify TiO2-based photoanodes and presents a comprehensive overview of the latest progress made towards improving their effectiveness for PEC water splitting. It involves different preparation methods of TiO2-based photoanodes such as hydrothermal, chemical vapor, physical vapor, electrochemical deposition, and other methods which plays a crucial role in determining their structural, morphological, and surface properties. These properties, in turn, influence the light absorption, charge transport, and PEC water splitting activity, ultimately affecting the effectiveness and efficiency of PEC water splitting.

A risk-based approach to land-use planning,"The Seveso II-Directive requires that the objectives of preventing major accidents and limiting their consequences be taken into account by the Member States in their land-use policies and/or other relevant policies. This is to be achieved by ensuring adequate distances between industrial establishments and residential areas, areas of public use and areas of particular natural sensitivity or interest. A risk-based framework implemented in a computer program is presented which enables one to calculate adequate distances. The criterion used is a limit on the individual risk of death. The method is a simplified risk analysis which represents the plant, whose characteristics are normally unknown at the stage of land-use planning, by generic frequencies of release for process units and storage tanks. Their number depends on the size of the site to be allotted. The procedure is capable of addressing the siting of new establishments and, with due regard to the simplifications used, modifications to and new developments in the vicinity of existing establishments. Given the numerous assumptions, which have to be made, the framework represents a convention. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency

A suggestion to assess spilled hydrocarbons as a greenhouse gas source,"Petroleum-contaminated site management typically counts destruction of hydrocarbons by either natural or engineered processes as a beneficial component of remediation. While such oxidation of spilled hydrocarbons is often necessary for achieving risk reduction for nearby human and ecological receptors, site assessments tend to neglect that this also means that the pollutants are converted to greenhouse gases and emitted to the atmosphere. This article presents a suggestion that the current and long term greenhouse gas emissions from spilled hydrocarbons be incorporated to petroleum site assessments. This would provide a more complete picture of pollutant effects that could then be incorporated to remedial objectives. At some sites, this additional information may affect remedy selection. Possible examples include a shift in emphasis to remedial technologies that reduce pollutant greenhouse gas effects (e.g., by conversion of methane to carbon dioxide in the subsurface), and a more holistic context for considering remedial technologies with low emission footprints.

Furthermore, phytoplankton and microalgae have essential roles in the marine carbon cycle and bioenergy utilization, as revealed by the high proportion of published literature, while the carbon transport mechanisms of seagrass and macroalgae was understudied. Thematic evolution analysis revealed that remote sensing was the most commonly used technology as an emerging research field for ecological monitoring and ecological investigation in blue carbon research in recent years. In addition, increasing carbon sinks by artificial approaches, fishery carbon sinks, and carbon sequestration by macroalgae have been potential hotspots for blue carbon research development. The findings from this study shed light on the trends of blue carbon in the past eighteen years, current research points in the field, and areas that need more research investment going forward.",Not About Sufficiency
A ZEN approach to post-2015 development goals for Asia and the Pacific,"The Asia-Pacific region includes a majority of the world's population and many of its most rapidly growing economies. It is also home to the world's largest number of extremely poor people, many fragile states, and unsustainable environmental practices. The region has increased its influence in the world economy but is still grappling to overcome complex interrelated challenges of poverty, inequality and sustainable development. Its priorities must be addressed as a central element of any post-2015 global development goal framework. Drawing from lessons of the Millennium Development Goals, this paper suggests a conceptual framework to guide a new generation of goals, along with an intergovernmental approach to implementation. The ""ZEN"" framework stresses the distinct challenges of achieving zero extreme poverty (Z), setting country-specific ""Epsilon"" benchmarks for broader development challenges (E), and promoting environmental sustainability both within and across borders (N).

Acceptable Automobility through Automated Driving. Insights into the Requirements for Different Mobility Configurations and an Evaluation of Suitable Use Cases,"It is hoped that Automated Driving (AD) will make alternatives to the private car more attractive and facilitate the transition to sustainable transport. However, this expectation may underestimate both the resistance of private automobility and the unintended consequences of automated driving. Whether AD will contribute to sustainable mobility depends largely on its implementation and how its risks are prevented. This paper provides empirical insights into the design of acceptable forms of AD by investigating specific use cases with respect to the requirements of different mobility configurations. We pay special attention to people who travel with children. Our use cases comprise three probable types, covering the spectrum from demand-responsive transport (DRT) to private vehicles. Our results include the identification of mobility configurations and an analysis of AD use cases considering several empirically derived criteria: improved accessibility, ease of daily life and well-being, and improvement of the traffic situation and the transport system. Our analysis is based on a qualitative study in the Berlin area, Germany. The discussion focuses on the usefulness of AD against the background of different user perspectives, sustainability, and societal requirements, as well as an evaluation of AD in terms of its acceptability. We conclude that automated mobility use cases should meet the requirements of different mobility configurations to promote the transformation from private to shared automobility and, eventually, less automobility overall.",Not About Sufficiency
Achieving net zero neighborhoods: A case study review of circular economy initiatives for South Wales,"Adopting net zero neighborhoods (NZN) combined with circular economy are increasingly recognized as an essential strategy for construction companies, allowing their transition towards sustainability and contributing to climate change mitigation. Transforming existing neighborhoods into NZN is necessary to achieve energy selfsufficiency and net zero by 2050. The success of NZN hinges on government initiatives. However, existing studies appear to lack a comprehensive exploration of the transformation initiatives within NZN, spanning aspects like raw materials, construction practices, transportation, and waste management, particularly in terms of technological advancements. To address the gap, this research introduces a conceptual framework that integrates the multiple case studies design method with an urban transformative capacity model. This innovative framework is the first application of a multi-level urban transformative capacity model in transforming existing neighborhoods into NZN within a specific region. This research specifically utilizes South Wales in the UK as a case study. It identified four key initiatives in technology, construction, transportation, and waste management. These initiatives offer significant benefits, including fostering a more sustainable and environmentally friendly construction industry through enhanced traceability and efficiency, and simultaneously promoting social sustainability by improving community engagement, providing social benefits through sharing economy initiatives, and creating new green job opportunities.",Not About Sufficiency
Acid-assisted pretreatment for sweet elephant grass in choline chloride/ glycerol DES: Experimental and mechanism study,"Sweet elephant grass (SEG), a promising bioenergy grass, possesses considerable potential for bioenergy production. However, research on its pretreatment and utilization remains limited. In this study, small quantities of Br & oslash;nsted acids were introduced to a deep eutectic solvent (DES) comprising choline chloride (ChCl) and glycerol (Gly) for SEG pretreatment. Under mild conditions (110 degrees C, 2 h), a maximum lignin removal rate of 90.08 % and a complete hemicellulose removal could be accomplished in the presence of Br & oslash;nsted acid. Cellulose retention rates consistently above 70 % were obtained in all the cases, and a desirable glucose yield up to 94.07 % was achieved from the resulting cellulose after further enzymatic hydrolysis. The pretreatment mechanism was elucidated through a combination of characterizations and theoretical calculations, which demonstrated effective disruption of lignin and lignin-carbohydrate complex occurred by the CH & sdot;& sdot;& sdot;pi, HO & sdot;& sdot;& sdot;H, and Cl & sdot;& sdot;& sdot;H bond interactions between lignin and DES. Furthermore, the scission of beta-O-4 bond was promoted by Br & oslash;nsted acids in DES.

Applying Industry 4.0 technologies in the COVID-19 sustainable chains,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is 1) to investigate the effects on the crucial Industry 4.0 technological innovations that interact between the real and virtual worlds and that are applied in the sustainable supply chain process; 2) to contribute to the identification of the opportunities, the challenges and the gaps that will support the new research study developments and 3) to analyze the impact of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators of the sustainable supply chain performance in the midst of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). Design/methodology/approach - This research is performed through a bibliographic review in the electronic databases of the Emerald Insight, the Scopus and the Web of Science, considering the main scientific publications on the subject. Findings - The bibliographic search results in 526 articles, followed by two sequential filters for deleting the duplicate articles (resulting in 487 articles) and for selecting the most relevant articles (resulting in 150 articles). Practical implications - This article identifies the opportunities and the challenges focused on the emerging Industry 4.0 theme. The opportunities can contribute to the sustainable performance of the supply chains and their territories. The Industry 4.0 can also generate challenges like the social inequalities related to the position of the man in the labor market by replacing the human workforce with the machines. Therefore, the man-machine relationship in the Industry 4.0 era is analyzed as a gap in the literature. Therefore, as a way to fill this gap, the authors of this article suggest the exploration of the research focused on the Society 5.0. Also known as ""super-smart society,"" this recent theme appeared in Japan in April 2016. According to Fukuda (2020), in addition to the focus on the technological development, the Society 5.0 also aims at the quality of life and the social challenge resolutions. Originality/value - This article contributes to the analysis of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the sustainable supply chain performance. It addresses the impacts of the Industry 4.0 technologies applied to the supply chains in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzes the research gaps and limitations found in the literature. The result of this study can add value and stimulate new research studies related to the application of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the supply chain sustainable performance. It can encourage the studies related to the COVID-19 impacts on the sustainable supply chains, and it can promote the research development on the relationship among the man, the machine and the labor in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.",Not About Sufficiency
Actions Speak Louder than Words: Investigating the Interplay between Descriptive and Injunctive Norms to Promote Alternative Fuel Vehicles,"Environmental problems are escalating. Alternate fuel vehicles are a technologically viable solution to curb transport-related pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that cause environmental problems. Based on the theory of norms-driven behavior, this study explains how the underlying facets of subjective social norms (injunctive and descriptive) are linked with personal norms (integrated and introjected) and how this linkage leads to eco-socially conscious consumer behavior related to the choice and use of personal cars. Data were collected from 687 automobile customers from eight large cities in Pakistan. The partial least squares structural equation modeling approach was employed to test the hypothesized relationships of the study. The results showed that subjective norms are positively associated with personal norms, and both together lead to eco-socially conscious consumers' behavior related to the choice and use of personal cars. Implications for marketers are suggested to promote alternate fuel vehicles and the eco-social use of personal cars.",Not About Sufficiency

Adherence to environmental law: the strategic complementarities of compliance decisions,"In this paper we address why firms comply with environmental regulations when enforcement is weak by suggesting that firms choose their level of environmental compliance strategically. Our theoretical model shows that compliance decisions among firms are strategic complements-increased compliance by one firm will positively influence the compliance rate of its rival. In our empirical analysis we find that the compliance rates of other regulated entities have a positive and significant effect on a regulated source's compliance behavior in three of our four heavily regulated industries. If compliance decisions are strategic complements, this may partially explain high compliance rates in the presence of limited regulatory pressure.

Adopting and assimilating new non-pharmaceutical technologies into health care: a systematic review,"Objective: To explore what is known about organizational processes that determine whether (and the extent and rate at which) new non-pharmaceutical technologies are adopted and assimilated into routine health care. Methods: Electronic searching of four databases, hand searching of six journals and electronic citation tracking searches of three key research papers. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: Ninety-nine empirical studies and seven narrative overviews informed the findings. The majority (62%) of the studies took a deterministic approach (mainly using cross-sectional mailed questionnaires) and typically studied the impact of organizational variables - such as organizational size - on the rate of adoption of technological innovations. The remaining studies were process-based using a single- or multi-case study approach. The organizational processes that determine whether and how technological innovations are adopted and assimilated into routine health care practice are dependent upon the specific innovation concerned, the different actors involved at various points in time, and the particular organizational context in which decisions are made. It is important to see 'adoption' and 'assimilation' as part of an ongoing process rather than discrete events, and as a process that comprises both 'formal' organizational and 'informal' decisions by individual users (the latter often shaped by discussions with their peers and colleagues). Conclusions: Further process-based studies are needed to provide a clearer evidence base for recommendations on how to facilitate the adoption and assimilation of beneficial new technologies. Three theoretical perspectives could form the basis of such studies and produce practical advice for managers and practitioners.

Biomass Pyrolysis Solids as Reducing Agents: Comparison with Commercial Reducing Agents,"Biomass is one of the most suitable options to be used as renewable energy source due to its extensive availability and its contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass under appropriate conditions (slow heating rate and high temperatures) can produce a quality solid product, which could be applicable to several metallurgical processes as reducing agent (biocoke or bioreducer). Two woody biomass samples (olives and eucalyptus) were pyrolyzed to produce biocoke. These biocokes were characterized by means of proximate and ultimate analysis, real density, specific surface area, and porosity and were compared with three commercial reducing agents. Finally, reactivity tests were performed both with the biocokes and with the commercial reducing agents. Bioreducers have lower ash and sulfur contents than commercial reducers, higher surface area and porosity, and consequently, much higher reactivity. Bioreducers are not appropriate to be used as top burden in blast furnaces, but they can be used as fuel and reducing agent either tuyre injected at the lower part of the blast furnace or in non-ferrous metallurgical processes where no mechanical strength is needed as, for example, in rotary kilns.",Not About Sufficiency

Advancing Global Climate and Biodiversity Goals Through Regenerative Tourism,"Tourism has a particular responsibility to contribute to climate and biodiversity goals because of its intense use of long-range transport and its strong dependence on natural capital as an asset. Tourism is a major contributor to the global economy, but also to greenhouse gas emissions. The severe impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the tourism sector triggered a search for enhanced resilience, replacing the past paradigm of ""boosterism"", and the dominant paradigm of ""sustainable tourism"". Sustainable tourism is no longer sufficient, and a shift towards a new paradigm of regenerative tourism is needed to address the environmental and societal challenges faced by the tourism industry. Here, the evidence pointing at the rise of regenerative tourism as a new paradigm is reviewed, the differential goals of regenerative, relative to sustainable tourism, are defined and actions along five domains of action are identified that can help tourism destinations embrace the transition toward the regenerative tourism paradigm. Regenerative tourism seeks to enhance the natural, cultural and social capital of destinations while creating net positive benefits for people and the planet. It emphasizes collaboration with local communities and an ambitious and holistic approach to sustainability, going beyond reducing negative impacts to creating positive ones. Regenerative tourism aligns the industry, the Paris Agreement, and the Convention on Biological Diversity, while advancing the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals. The transition to regenerative tourism requires investments in technology and innovation, transparent collaboration, and a holistic focus on well-being for both people and the planet.",Not About Sufficiency

"Air quality and health co-benefits of vehicle electrification and emission controls in the most populated United States urban hubs: Insights from New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston","Transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs) is a prominent strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, given the complexity of atmospheric chemistry, the nuanced implications on air quality are yet to be fully understood. Our study delved into changes in PM2.5, ozone, and their associated precursors in major US urban areas, considering various electrification and mitigation scenarios. In the full electrification (FullE) scenario, PM2.5 reduction peaked at values between 0.34 and 2.29 mu g.m(-3) across distinct regions. Yet, certain areas in eastern Los Angeles exhibited a surprising uptick in PM2.5, reaching as much as 0.67 mu g.m(-3). This phenomenon was linked to a surge in secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), resulting from shifting NOx/VOCs (volatile organic compounds) dynamics and a spike in hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations. The FullE scenario ushered in marked reductions in both NOx and maximum daily average 8-h (MDA8) ozone concentrations, with maximum levels ranging from 14.00 to 32.34 ppb and 2.58-9.58 ppb, respectively. However, certain instances revealed growths in MDA8 ozone concentrations, underscoring the intricacies of air quality management. From a health perspective, in the FullE scenario, New York, Chicago, and Houston stand to potentially avert 796, 328, and 157 premature deaths/month, respectively. Los Angeles could prevent 104 premature deaths/month in the HighE-BL scenario, representing a 29 % EV share for light-duty vehicles. However, the FullE scenario led to a rise in mortality in Los Angeles due to increased PM2.5 and MDA8 ozone levels. Economically, the FullE scenario projects health benefits amounting to 51-249 million $/day for New York, Chicago, and Houston. In contrast, Los Angeles may face economic downturns of up to 18 million $/day. In conclusion, while EV integration has the potential to improve urban air quality, offering substantial health and economic advantages, challenges persist. Our results emphasize the pivotal role of VOCs management, providing policymakers with insights for adaptable and efficient measures.",Not About Sufficiency
Overview of bioenergy use and production in sub-Saharan Africa,"The importance of biomass energy and the challenges of the sector in Sub-Saharan Africa has for a long time been the subject of considerable research. Unfortunately, the results of this work remain scattered and fragmented. This study aims to assess the current state of knowledge on the use and production of bioenergy in sub-Saharan Africa in order to guide the actors involved in the modernization process. The study is based on a cross-analysis of scientific publications on bioenergy for this region. The publications obtained are divided into predefined thematics, year of publication and geographical origin of the research centers. Statistical processing, especially Principal Component Analysis was carried out to establish a link between the countries of the research centers and the addressed thematic. The results showed that 2009 is a pivotal year for research in the field of bioenergy in Sub-Saharan Africa. France has been identified as the country most involved in research into the development of bioenergy in the region. Despite modernization efforts, the production and use of biomass for energy purposes in Sub-Saharan Africa remains traditional. However, the study reveals that apart from wood which is becoming scarce, Sub-Saharan Africa has many biomass ressources with high energy potential which can significantly contribute to satisfying local energy needs. Unfortunately, their valorization into modern renewable energy remains embryonic. The challenges to be met are 40 % technological, 32 % land-related and 28 % socio-political.

"Debating clean energy: Frames, counter frames, and audiences","In the United States, both scholars and practitioners have repeatedly emphasized the importance of ""issue framing"" for garnering public support for climate change policy. However, the debate frequently overlooks the importance of counter frames. For every framing attempt by advocates of climate policy, there will be a counter frame by the opponents of climate policy. How do counter frames influence the effectiveness of issue framing as a communication strategy? To answer this question, we report results from a survey experiment on a nationally representative sample of 1000 Americans on clean energy policy, a key policy issue in the public debate on climate change in the United States. Overall, we find that different combinations of positive and negative frames have remarkably little effect on support for clean energy policy. A follow-up on-line survey experiment with a convenience sample of 2000 Americans suggests that the counter frames are responsible for undermining the effects of the original frames.

Modelling the mass adoption potentials of fashion-augmented reality among the young consumers: evidence from an emerging economy,"PurposeThe increasing demand for fashion-augmented reality (FAR) in online fast fashion shopping has the potential to reduce soil and water pollution. Hence, it is vital to understand the success factors that influence consumers' intention to use FAR (IAR) and actual usage of FAR (UAR) to enhance its adoption.Design/methodology/approachBy incorporating the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, this study examined the influence of success factors on IAR, the effect of IAR on UAR and the mediating role of IAR in the relationship between success factors and UAR. In total, 803 responses were collected from Indonesia using a cross-sectional approach. Data were examined using partial least squares structural equation modelling.FindingsTheir findings revealed that perceived enjoyment, perceived service value and facilitating conditions significantly influenced IAR and UAR. However, the impacts of perceived functional benefits, lifestyle compatibility and perceived trust were insignificant. Nevertheless, the IAR has a significant influence on UAR.

Real-scale investigation of liquid CO2 discharge from the emergency release coupler of a marine loading arm,"Carbon capture, utilisation and storage has been recognised as a necessary measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. CO(2 )shipping represents a promising transportation option that offers flexible sink-source matching to enable decarbonisation at a global scale. In order to implement safe and reliable loading and offloading operations at the terminal, marine loading arms require the integration of emergency release systems in the event of sudden movement of the ship away from the berthing line. In this study, a cryogenic test facility was constructed to handle CO2 in proximity of the triple point (~0.9 MPa[abs] - 1.7 MPa[abs], 227 K -239 K) and replicate the principles of an emergency release coupler during a shutdown, with the aim of investigating the CO(2 )discharge and dispersion behaviour, and determining the implications on coupler design and safety protocols. Findings show that separation of the test vessel leads to an abrupt discharge of the liquefied CO(2 )inventory and several phase transitions within 0.6 s of the start of the discharge in all tests. The clouds disperse in a 'tulip' shape that could be clearly observed from afar, and generation of carbon dioxide solids was observed on the vessel surface in all performed tests, bringing the temperature inside the vessel to approximately 190 K. The implementation of protective barriers is expected to reduce the impact of the release, though the risk of asphyxiation or cryogenic burns to surrounding personnel cannot be ruled out given the magnitude of the discharge process.",Not About Sufficiency
Enhancing Electric Shuttle Bus Efficiency: A Case Study on Timetabling and Scheduling Optimization,"As transit authorities increasingly adopt electric buses (EBs) to mitigate air quality concerns and greenhouse gas emissions, new challenges arise in bus scheduling and timetabling. Unlike traditional buses, EBs face operational obstacles due to their shorter range and extended charging times. Existing mathematical optimization models for operation planning of traditional buses must be revised to address these unique characteristics of EBs. This study introduces a new approach to integrate timetabling and bus scheduling to enhance the level of service and minimize operational costs, using a case study of a University shuttle bus service in Montreal, Canada. The level of service will be enhanced by reducing students waiting time and improving their in-vehicle comfort through seat availability. The scheduling aspect seeks to reduce the total operational costs, which include travel, electricity consumption, and usage costs of EBs. The proposed algorithm calculates the waiting time and seat availability for different headway values and addresses the scheduling problem using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model with an arc-based approach, solved using the Cplex Optimization Studio software version 12.8. A normalized weighted sum technique is then applied to select the optimal headway, balancing waiting time, seat availability, and operational costs. The effectiveness of our approach was tested through a case study of Concordia University's shuttle bus service. Comparative analysis of the current and proposed schedules shows that our approach significantly improves service quality by decreasing waiting times and increasing seat availability while optimizing cost-effectiveness compared to the existing timetable of the Concordia shuttle bus. The proposed approach ensures a smooth transition to a fully electric transit system for shuttle bus services.",Not About Sufficiency
Perspectives on geologic carbon storage,"Geologic carbon storage (GCS) is a fundamental pillar of carbon management that helps mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and addresses the negative effects of climate change. Viable CO2 storage sites share some of the same elements required for successful petroleum systems. For example, while reservoir, seal, and trap are required, migration pathway and timing are not important for CO2 storage, because rather than withdrawing fluid from a trap, CO2 storage involves injection into a geologic trap. Conceptually, this represents a form of reverse production. Numerous petroleum traps around the world, as well as naturally occurring CO2-producing fields and natural gas storage sites attest that safe, long-term storage is possible. Research over the past two decades identified five methods of Geologic Carbon Storage which have been validated through several demonstration and pilot projects around the world: (1) storage in depleted oil and gas fields, (2) use of CO2 in enhanced hydrocarbons recovery (3) storage in saline formations/aquifers, (4) injection into deep unmineable coal seams, and (5) in-situ/ex-situ carbon mineralization. The greatest volumetric potential for GCS is found in saline aquifers which are present throughout the world's sedimentary basins.",Not About Sufficiency

"The ""Greening"" of Empire: The European Green Deal as the EU first agenda","The recent past has seen the proposal of multiple 'Green New Deals' across geographies as a means to fight against the climate crisis and ecological breakdown. Of these, the European Green Deal- EGD represents the world's first public commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Because the EGD plans to ""transform the EU,"" in this paper we examine how it fits within a historical continuum of colonial and neo-colonial relations. We argue that the EGD is the latest discursive strategy for the 'greening' of empire through four registers: (1) turning ecological crises into profitable opportunities; (2) portraying the EU as a 'moral' intervener; (3) building on a 'green' ""will to improve""; and (4) securitizing and consolidating the empire. We find how the EU acts in key policy arenas of diplomacy, trade and investment leading to the 'greening' of the empire that ensures its continued economic and political leadership while fundamentally maintaining a status quo. We conclude with some reflections on the role of the EU to cede place to other possibilities of building anti-colonial ecologies.",Not About Sufficiency
Species interactions and distinct microbial communities in high Arctic permafrost affected cryosols are associated with the CH4 and CO2 gas fluxes,"Microbial metabolism of the thawing organic carbon stores in permafrost results in a positive feedback loop of greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 and CH4 fluxes and the associated microbial communities in Arctic cryosols are important in predicting future warming potential of the Arctic. We demonstrate that topography had an impact on CH4 and CO2 flux at a high Arctic ice-wedge polygon terrain site, with higher CO2 emissions and lower CH4 uptake at troughs compared to polygon interior soils. The pmoA sequencing suggested that USC alpha cluster of uncultured methanotrophs is likely responsible for observed methane sink. Community profiling revealed distinct assemblages across the terrain at different depths. Deeper soils contained higher abundances of Verrucomicrobia and Gemmatimonadetes, whereas the polygon interior had higher Acidobacteria and lower Betaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria abundances. Genome sequencing of isolates from the terrain revealed presence of carbon cycling genes including ones involved in serine and ribulose monophosphate pathways. A novel hybrid network analysis identified key members that had positive and negative impacts on other species. Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with numerous positive interactions corresponded to Proteobacteria, Candidatus Rokubacteria and Actinobacteria phyla, while Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria members had negative impacts on other species.

How is the military and defence sector of EU member states adapting to climate risks?,"Climate change has direct and indirect consequences for the military and defence sector. Direct impacts are for example the damaging of military infrastructure due to more extreme climatic conditions or the impact on operational capabilities when on missions. Indirect impacts include the increase of global instability and insecurity, or migration due to changing climatic conditions. Climate change risks are often seen as a threat multiplier. Whilst the impacts of climate change on the military and defence sector is gaining attention in both political and scientific realms, the way this sector adapts to these risks is, however, still pretty much unknown. This research aims to assess how the European Union member states' military and defence sector are adapting to the impacts of climate change. We map and analyse the current policy actions by analysing the defence and climate policy documents (n = 63) and conducting interviews (n = 8) with civil servants of defence ministries across the EU. We find that almost none of the countries have a concrete climate change adaptation plan for their military. Whilst several frontrunner countries do mention climate change in their defence policy documents, they lack concrete policy goals and instruments. Moreover, concrete adaptation measures are not discussed by most of the countries. France is a notable exemption as it offers more detailed policies, but they too are at the groundwork stage. Hardly any reference to the military was found in the climate policy documents of the countries. The results show that the military and defence sector of the EU member states are not well prepared to the impacts of climate change and that concerted action is needed to close the adaptation gap adequately and effectively.",Not About Sufficiency
"Malaria Infection, Poor Nutrition and Indoor Air Pollution Mediate Socioeconomic Differences in Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Cape Coast, Ghana","Background: The epidemiological evidence linking socioeconomic deprivation with adverse pregnancy outcomes has been conflicting mainly due to poor measurement of socioeconomic status (SES). Studies have also failed to evaluate the plausible pathways through which socioeconomic disadvantage impacts on pregnancy outcomes. We investigated the importance of maternal SES as determinant of birth weight and gestational duration in an urban area and evaluated main causal pathways for the influence of SES. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 559 mothers accessing postnatal services at the four main health facilities in Cape Coast, Ghana in 2011. Information on socioeconomic characteristics of the mothers was collected in a structured questionnaire. Results: In multivariate linear regression adjusting for maternal age, parity and gender of newborn, low SES resulted in 292 g (95% CI: 440-145) reduction in birth weight. Important SES-related determinants were neighborhood poverty (221 g; 95% CI: 355-87), low education (187 g; 95% CI: 355-20), studentship during pregnancy (291 g; 95% CI: 506-76) and low income (147 g; 95% CI: 277-17). In causal pathway analysis, malaria infection (6-20%), poor nutrition (2-51%) and indoor air pollution (10-62%) mediated substantial proportions of the observed effects of socioeconomic deprivation on birth weight. Generalized linear models adjusting for confounders indicated a 218% (RR: 3.18; 95% CI: 1.41-7.21) risk increase of LBW and 83% (RR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.31-2.56) of PTB among low income mothers. Low and middle SES was associated with 357% (RR: 4.57; 95% CI: 1.67-12.49) and 278% (RR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.39-10.27) increased risk of LBW respectively. Malaria infection, poor nutrition and indoor air pollution respectively mediated 10-21%, 16-44% and 31-52% of the observed effects of socioeconomic disadvantage on LBW risk. Conclusion: We provide evidence of the effects of socioeconomic deprivation, substantially mediated by malaria infection, poor nutrition and indoor air pollution, on pregnancy outcomes in a developing country setting.",Not About Sufficiency
American evangelicals and domestic versus international climate policy,"Because a significant portion of the American electorate identify themselves as evangelical Christians, the evangelical position on climate policy is important to determining the role the United States could play in global climate cooperation. Do evangelicals oppose all climate policies, or are they particularly opposed to certain types of policies? We argue that American evangelicals oppose climate policy due to their distrust of international cooperation and institutions, which has been a prominent feature of evangelical politics since the beginning of the Cold War. Using data from the 2011 Faith and Global Policy Challenges survey and the 2010 Chicago Council Global View survey, we find support for the theory. Evangelicals are equally likely to support domestic climate policy as other Americans, but they are significantly less likely to support international treaties on climate cooperation. The findings suggest that proponents of climate policy could win more evangelicals to their side by focusing on domestic action, instead of multilateral negotiations or international institutions.",Not About Sufficiency
Amorphous TiNiSn thin films for mechanical flexibility in thermoelectric applications,"Thermoelectric devices convert heat to electricity without greenhouse gas emissions and have the potential to serve as energy sources in wearable devices. Ongoing efforts are focused on designing materials that offer both high conversion efficiency and mechanical flexibility. Half-Heusler materials, such as TiNiSn, exhibit promising chemical stability and thermoelectric efficiency, but their inherent brittleness poses challenges for applications in flexible devices. Here, TiNiSn thin films were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature to investigate their response to bending for flexible devices applications. Therefore, different substrates were considered: Si, Kapton, silk, and printer paper, whereas Si was used as a reference. The composition and structure of the deposited thin films were analyzed by employing energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering, respectively. The film morphology was examined via scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) was employed to explore interfaces between the flexible substrates and amorphous TiNiSn and calculate the Cauchy pressure, a key indicator of ductile/brittle behavior. Amorphous TiNiSn thin film exhibits good adhesion to flexible Kapton, silk, and paper substrates. Mechanical loading, namely bending up to 154 degrees, was applied to assess crack formation, revealing only a few cracks at 78 degrees and 154 degrees, thus indicating a certain level of flexibility. DFT data support these findings, showing intermediate adhesion strength between amorphous TiNiSn and monomers from the flexible substrates. The calculated Cauchy pressure of 30 GPa suggests the ductility of TiNiSn in the amorphous state. Therefore, replacing alternative time-consuming synthesis methods, eliminating the demand for high temperatures, and providing a nontoxic and cost-effective material with good adhesion to various substrates are reasons why amorphous TiNiSn thin film emerges as a good candidate for flexible thermoelectric devices.",Not About Sufficiency
An assessment of environmental impacts and economic benefits of multiple aluminum production methods,"The booming development of the aluminum industry has greatly contributed to China's economic development, but it also imposed a burden on the environment. Recent technological development has emerged various methods for aluminum production to improve production efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, while reducing energy intensity in traditional production practices can also lower emissions and remain low production costs. However, which approach that performs better in achieving economic benefits and reducing environ-mental impacts is unclear. This study analyzed six major aluminum production methods based on alumina production process and energy mix. Environmental parameters were derived based on life cycle assessment, and economic cost parameters were formed by building an economic benefits model. This paper then analyzed the potential of achieving economic benefits and environmental impacts reduction for each method using life cycle assessment and principal component analysis. Finally, the greenhouse gas emissions from the aluminum industry in 2030 based on scenario analysis was analyzed. We found that Bayer process-hydropower method performs the best in reducing environmental impacts and achieving economic benefits, while the sinter process-thermal power method performs the worst. The effect of reducing emissions by changing the energy mix (75%) was more significant than that by changing the alumina production process (up to 10%). Furthermore, we used scenario analysis to expand the capacity share of the Bayer process-hydropower method with optimal comprehensive benefit increased by 22.2%, the cost of electricity decreased by 313.77 CNY/t-Al, and the global warming po-tential was reduced by nearly 1/3. Thus, our results reveal the significant benefits of the Chinese government's push to increase the share of clean energy applications in the aluminum industry.",Not About Sufficiency
AN ECO-INNOVATIVE FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT FOR SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY,"Sustainable consumption and production have been increasingly required in the construction industry. However, previous studies have not yet comprehensively developed evaluation tools and methods to implement sustainable consumption and production. To achieve this objective, we utilized the eco-innovation, which provides effective analysis of sustainable consumption and production for the construction firms by eliminating subjectivity and ambiguity of evaluations. We adopted the fuzzy set theory to overcome the uncertainty occurring from the judgments of experts and utilized decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory approach to analyse the causal relationships between our methods and evaluation criteria. The results showed that environment and sustainable consumption are the key factors, while life cycle assessment, eco-labels, and environmental certification as well as improving eco-efficiency are critical to realizing sustainable consumption and production. The study enhances the understanding of the major players to achieve sustainable consumption and production, and link sustainable consumption and production with the eco-innovative practices.

An Empirical Comparison of Carbon Credit Projects under the Clean Development Mechanism and Verified Carbon Standard,"Carbon credit projects generate carbon credits by abating greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon credits can then be traded on carbon markets or immobilized in order to compensate for caused emissions. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), as the two most important carbon credit mechanisms, are investigated and compared regarding the success of projects. We define success as the fulfilling of the ex-ante emission abatement estimation and apply regression analyses to explain its variation on a project level by technology, location, scale, duration and participation. The results are discussed in detail on technology level for wind power, energy efficiency, hydro power as well as biomass projects and are compared with regard to CDM and VCS. Our main results indicate that large scale projects often compensate for their under-performance due to economies of time. Furthermore, the duration of projects, their location and structure of participants have significant influence on the success of the projects. The sign of the coefficients of explanatory variables are broadly in line with intuition and related literature, although, due to data availability, they are not always highly significant statistically.",Not About Sufficiency
An Integrated Artificial Intelligence Approach for Building Energy Demand Forecasting,"Buildings are complex assets, characterized by environments and uses that change over time, variable occupancies, and long life cycles. They have high operational costs, mostly due to their energy requirements, and account for 30% to 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, substantial effort has been made to forecast their energy needs, with the scope of optimizing their economic and environmental impact. In this regard, the available literature focuses mainly on short-term modeling through the implementation of sets of physics-based equations (i.e., white-box), functional relationships between input and output variables (i.e., black-box), or a combination of both (i.e., grey-box). On the other hand, more research is required on long-term forecast models with the aim of reducing the energy needs. Within this context, this article presents an original automatic procedure for forecasting the energy needs of buildings in short- and long-term time horizons. This is accomplished by scaling an unknown facility from a similar facility that is already known and by executing a black-box approach based on machine learning algorithms. The proposed method is implemented in real case studies in Italy, predicting the energy needs (i.e., heating, cooling, and electricity) of Sant'Anna Hospital in Ferrara using the historical data of Ca' Foncello Hospital in Treviso. The results show an adjusted coefficient of determination above 0.7 and an average error below 10% for all the energy vectors, demonstrating a feasible forecast performance with a low training set-to-test set ratio.",Not About Sufficiency
An integrated remote sensing and model approach for assessing forest carbon fluxes in China,"Forest plays an important role in reducing pressure on the natural environment, weaking the influence of greenhouse effects, and sequestrating atmospheric carbon dioxide. So far, due to the lack of complete understanding of forest ecosystem processes and the limitations on the scope of application of evaluation methods, there are still great uncertainties in the researches on carbon fluxes of forest ecosystems in China at the national level. En this study, an individual tree species FORCCHN model, which could flexibly use the inventory data as the initial field (more accurately) or use the remote sensing information to inverse initial field was applied. The dynamics of key carbon cycle fluxes (net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP)) and carbon sequestration of forest ecosystems in China from 1982 to 2019 were simulated based on remote sensing data and FORCCI IN model. The results showed that forest ecosystems in China had great carbon sequestration potential over the past 39 years. From 1982 to 2019, the NPP of Chinese forests presented a fluctuated increase. Total NPP from 2011 to 2019 ranged from 0.91 PgC.a(-1) to 1.14 PgC.a(-1). Annual average NEP of forest ecosystems in China from 2011 to 2019 was 0.199 PgC.a(-1 )(1Pg = 10(15) g). Influenced by climate, soil and vegetation, carbon sequestration potential in Chinese forest ecosystems presented obvious regional differences in space. The spatial distribution of NEP gradually increased from Northwest to Southeast China. From 2011 to 2019, forests in Yunnan Province had the strongest carbon storage capacity (72.79 TgC.a(-1) Tg = 10(12) g), followed by forests in Guangxi (18.49 TgC.a(-1)) and forests in Guangdong (10.01 TgC.a(-1)). Our results not only address concerns about carbon sequestration but also reflect the importance of Chinese forest resources in the development of the national economy and society.",Not About Sufficiency
An inventory of the energy use and carbon dioxide emissions from island tourism based on a life cycle assessment approach,"Tourism is an economic activity that results in a wide range of environmental impacts. The contribution of tourism to human-induced climate change is an increasingly important issue. However, the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from tourism products have never been thoroughly discussed. This study uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to explore energy use and CO2 emissions of island tourism and then compare the environmental loads of different tourism subsectors. This study uses three Taiwanese islands (Penghu, Kinmen, and Green islands) as examples to examine the LCA approach, and it calculates and compares the energy usage and CO2 emissions of the transportation, accommodation, and recreation activity sectors. Results show that each tourist consumes 502, 447, and 118 MJ of energy per day on Penghu, Kinmen, and Green islands, respectively. Each tourist also generates 34.0, 27.9, and 7.1 kg of CO2 emissions on Penghu, Kinmen, and Green islands, respectively. Each Penghu tourist per day consumes 4.25 times as much energy as each Green tourist, and each Penghu tourist generates 4.7 times the CO2 emissions as each Green tourist. In summary, the transportation sector generates the largest energy (4967%) and the largest proportion of CO2 emissions (5872.4%); the airplane sector is the primary contributor. Finally, this study discuses the advantages and limitations of the LCA approach. (c) 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2011",Not About Sufficiency
An optimization approach for integrating planning and CO2 emission reduction in the petroleum refining industry,"The petroleum refining industry plays a very important role in international economics and in our daily life. The world refining capacity has increased rapidly during the past decade, and this makes operation planning, scheduling, and general optimization become important tools for the refinery industry. However, environmental regulations and risks of climate change are pressuring the refinery industry to minimize its greenhouse gas emissions. In this research, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is proposed for the production planning of refinery processes to achieve maximum operational profit while reducing CO2 emissions to a given target through the use of different CO2 mitigation options. The options considered in this study are flow-rate balancing (decreasing the inlet flow rate to a unit that emits more CO2) fuel switching (changes in a certain operation to run with a different fuel that emits less CO2 emissions, such as natural gas), and installation of a CO2 capture process (e.g., the monoethanolamine (MEA) process). The objective of the MINLP model is to determine suitable CO2 mitigation options for a given reduction target while meeting the demand of each final product and its quality specifications, while simultaneously maximizing profit. In this study, a Global optimization algorithm is used on the different case studies considered.",Not About Sufficiency
An Ultra-Low-Latency Guaranteed-Rate Internet for Cloud Services,"An Enhanced-Internet network that provides ultra-low-latency guaranteed-rate (GR) communications for Cloud Services is proposed. The network supports two traffic classes, the Smooth and Best-Effort classes. Smooth traffic flows receive low-jitter GR service over virtual-circuit-switched (VCS) connections with negligible buffering and queueing delays, up to 100% link utilizations, deterministic end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees, and improved energy efficiency. End-to-end delays are effectively reduced to the fiber ""time of flight."" A new router scheduling problem called the Bounded Normalized-Jitter integer-programming problem is formulated. A fast polynomial-time approximate solution is presented, allowing TDM-based router schedules to be computed in microseconds. We establish that all admissible traffic demands in any packet-switched network can be simultaneously satisfied with GR-VCS connections, with minimal buffering. Each router can use two periodic TDM-based schedules to support GR-VCS connections, which are updated automatically when the router's traffic rate matrix changes. The design of a Silicon-Photonics all-optical packet switch with minimal buffering is presented.

An updated framework for climate change impact assessment of bioenergy and an application in poplar biomass,"Mainstream life cycle assessment (LCA) studies on the climate change impact of bioenergy fail to account for some direct impacts, such as biomass-derived CO2 emissions and potential impacts on future carbon dynamics. For a more persuasive assessment of the climate change impacts of bioenergy, a simplified and comprehensive framework was developed for LCA by integrating the atmospheric carbon cycle model, plant growth model, and biomass decomposition model. The system includes four components: fossil fuel-derived greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, biogenic CO2 emissions, biomass regrowth for compensation, and the difference in carbon sequestration from the reference scenario. For an illustration purpose, the framework was applied in the study of the climate change impacts of hybrid poplar use for bio-ethanol, bio-diesel, heating, and bio-power. The LCA study indicated that the fossil fuel-derived GHG emissions (15.77-42.55 kg CO2 eq/GJ) from biomass utilization were lower than those from the combustion of fossil fuels. Because the fossil fuel-derived GHG emissions, biogenic CO2 emissions, and biomass regrowth for compensation were positive, the sums of the three components (120.21-243.97 kg CO2 eq/GJ) were higher than the emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. However, biomass utilization may improve biomass regrowth or avoid biomass decomposition. The differences in carbon sequestration are usually negative and can offset the positive climate change impacts. The final total climate change impacts for the different types of bioenergy were from -26.85 kg CO2 eq/GJ to 1.08 kg CO2 eq/GJ. The newly developed framework is more persuasive and comprehensive than the conventional LCA because it includes all the direct impacts of biomass utilization based on the biomass characteristics. The application of this framework can ensure the sustainable utilization of biomass and avoid ecosystem degradation.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysing Gordon's trade-off by adapting Thurow's approach of pure public good to the German energy sector,"Background: We analyse Gordon's trade-off by adapting Thurow's approach of pure public good using the example of the German energy sector which is in a transition process to a low-carbon sustainable energy system (Energiewende). The income distribution and the energy expenditures of households are interpreted as public goods. Their distribution is measured with the Atkinson index, which determines how the quality of life, as measured in income and energy expenditures, is distributed among society. Methods: We use the disaggregated consumption and income for 39.409 million German households. Our socioeconomic analysis focuses on six household types. Results: Our analysis shows that among German households, energy expenditures are more equally distributed than private consumption in general and income. The rather (but by far not completely) equal distribution of energy expenditures confirms Smil's finding that energy is the universal currency (Sen, On Economic Inequality, 1973) for people's welfare and can be seen as an indicator of the basic needs of households irrespective of household income. Nevertheless, low-income households have to spend a higher share of their income on energy to avoid energy poverty. Further price increases could lead to an unequal distribution and rising energy poverty. Conclusions: The socio-economic conditions of society and its energy sector have to be addressed in a transition processes. Energy poverty constitutes an infringement of the sustainability concept. If society does not take distributional effects into account, the transition process itself could be jeopardized.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysis of Economic Vitality and Development Equilibrium of China's Three Major Urban Agglomerations Based on Nighttime Light Data,"Eliminating poverty, reducing inequality, and achieving balanced development are one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Objectively and accurately measuring regional economic vitality and development equilibrium is a pressing scientific issue that needs to be addressed in order to achieve common prosperity. Nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing data have been proven to be a good proxy variable for socio-economic development, and are widely used due to their advantages of convenient access and wide spatial coverage. Based on multi-source data, this study constructs an Economic Development Index (EDI) that comprehensively reflects regional economic vitality from two aspects, economic quality and development potential, combines the Nighttime Light Development Index (NLDI) as the evaluation indicators to measure the economic vitality and development equilibrium, analyzes the economic vitality and development equilibrium of 300 district and county units in China's three major urban agglomerations from 2000 to 2020 and their temporal and spatial variation characteristics, and discusses the connotation of EDI and its availability. The results show the following: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the average growth rate of EDI in China's three major urban agglomerations reached 36.32%, while the average decrease rate of NLDI reached 38.75%; both economic vitality and the development equilibrium have been continuously enhanced.

Analysis of the fly ash from the processing of wood chips in a pilot-scale downdraft gasifier: Comparison of inorganic constituents determined by PIXE and ICP-AES,"Gasification of biomass ultimately generates at least one solid byproduct in which the inorganic constituents of the biomass are concentrated. Given the potential for utilization, or issues with disposal, facile methods are needed for determining the compositions of the fly ashes from recently-available gasifier-based bioenergy systems. Proton induced x-ray emission spectroscopy (PIXE) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) were used to characterize the fly ash recovered from a pilot-scale (25 kW) modular bioenergy system operated with wood chips as the feedstock. The composition of the fly ash from the downdraft gasifier showed some similarities to compositions reported for boiler wood ashes, apart from one half of the material being unburned carbon. Although ICP-AES showed greater sensitivity for the analysis of the fly ash, especially for small amounts of heavy metal contaminants, PIXE proved to be a powerful analytical tool for screening of elements from sodium to uranium. Such broad spectrum screenings could prevent the inadvertent land application of unsuspected pollutant elements. Fly ashes from biomass gasification appear to be suitable for use as ash-based fertilizers for forest lands; however, combustion to remove unburned carbon may be advisable.

"Analysis on the effects of ecological conservation redline policies in the Pearl River Delta area, China","IntroductionThe ecological conservation redline (ECR) policies conducted in China are an important innovation to protect biodiversity, safeguard ecological security, and achieve sustainable development. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) area implemented the ECR policies in 2005. MethodsThis study examines the contrast between the 15 years before and after 2005. It also reveals the ECR policies' effects by comparing land use change, landscape pattern index, and habitat quality inside (IECR) and outside (OECR) the ECR area. Results and discussionThe results suggest that: (1) The ECR area has served as an ecological barrier in maintaining the stability of natural ecosystems. Over the past 30 years, the PRD area significantly changed land use types and ecosystems, mainly concentrated in the central plains and estuaries. Specifically, in the IECR, land use change was relatively stable, with a decrease of 0.05% and 0.57% in ecological land and an increase of 0.28% and 0.68% in construction land before and after 2005. In contrast, the OECR area land use changed dramatically, with a decrease of 0.37% and 1.36% in ecological land and an increase of 7.06% and 5.02% in construction land before and after 2005. (2) A general trend of landscape fragmentation exists in the study area. The contagion (CONTAG) in the IECR area is higher than in the OECR. The Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) in the IECR is lower than in the OECR area, which indicates a high degree and rapid landscape fragmentation in the OECR area. (3) Over 85% of the IECR scale had a habitat quality of 0.8-1, while the OECR area had an almost half scale with a habitat quality of 0-0.2. On the whole, the ecological stability and landscape connectivity of in the IECR area was higher than that of the OECR area. This indicates that the prohibitions on human disturbance, industrial construction, and logging activities in the IECR area allow green vegetation to succumb under natural conditions. Habitat quality in the IECR area was also higher than that of the OECR area in the PRD area, revealing that the quality of green development in the IECR area was higher. Finally, the ECR policies' implementation has protected the environment in the PRD area and will provide experience for ecological conservation in other areas.",Not About Sufficiency

An historical analysis helps to show how the problems have been solved thus far. The objective of this investigation is to present an overview of environmental problems and the corresponding regulations in Western Europe during the 1980s. Environmental problems for 18 Western European countries were identified from abstracts from a data base on environmental literature. The 1977 findings were systematized on the basis of 20 key words according to source and impact, and a new data base was established. The data showed that the main environmental problems in Western Europe were: energy production/acid rain, nuclear power/waste, air pollution/climate, heavy metals, pesticides, water pollution, solid waste, and unforeseen accidents. Many environmental problems are common to most European countries. Regulatory measures differ significantly. In some countries environmental regulations are largely limited to the implementation of European Economic Community (EEC) directives. We have supplemented the national analyses with an examination of existing and proposed EEC regulations along with interviews with civil servants in the EEC Commission. In the 1980s, EEC environmental regulations were similar to environmental regulations in some member states.

Antecedents of Thai student teacher sustainable consumption behavior,"A new area of research and intervention has arisen, namely the psychology of sustainability. Therefore, this study investigates how an undergraduate student teacher's psychological traits, their psychological state, their situation, and environmental education affect their sustainable consumption behavior. Two sample groups were selected from ten Thai university education programs' science (n = 400) and social science (n = 400) colleges nationwide. The research instrument used randomized multistage questionnaires for each group, which used a five-level scale to evaluate each student teacher's item agreement. The analysis of the causal relationship models used LISREL 9.10 which determined that both models and their four causal variables positively affected a Thai student teacher's sustainable consumption behavior (SCB). For the science education student teachers, these were the situation (SIT = 0.87), environmental education (EDU = 0.34), their psychological state (STATE = 0.22), and their psychological traits (TRAITS = 0.22). For the social science education student teachers, these were SIT = 0.85, STATE = 0.25, EDU = 0.08, and TRAITS = 0.04. Combined, they can explain 92% (science program) and 82% (social science program) of variance in a student teacher's SCB. The study also determined that EDU's attitude and conservation factors were critical, which most probably increased in prominence due to media awareness efforts. There also appears to be greater individual responsibility in SCB as well as the perceived need to conserve resources. Finally, this study further confirmed numerous other studies in which humans have a strong desire to fit in and will conform to the behavior of those around them, with this study concluding that each student teacher's situation was determined to have a moderate to strong influence on either their psychological state or environmental education. This study contributed to the literature as it investigated 18 aspects related to four casual variables affecting a Thai student teacher's sustainable consumption behavior. The study was unique in that it classified and compared opinions from two diverse university teaching programs nationwide (Science and Social Science), whose results can help educational leaders identify and develop in-depth, SCB future programs.",Not About Sufficiency

Application of adaptive mutation bird swarm algorithm in optimal dispatching of microgrid grid connection,"Distributed power grid integration contributes to both the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of the environment.

First, the algorithm determines if the population is in the local optimal state. The local optimal individual is then subjected to Cauchy mutation in order to determine the optimal value again.

Multistage Optimization toward a Nearly Net Zero Energy Building Due to Climate Change,"Climate change is one of the major problems of the planet. The atmosphere is overloaded with carbon dioxide caused by fossil fuels that are burned for energy. Almost 40 percent of the total energy worldwide is used by the building sector, which comes from non-renewable sources and contributes up to 30% of annual greenhouse gas emissions globally. The building sector in Iran accounts for 33.8% of Iran's total energy usage. Within the building sector, the energy consumption of Iranian educational buildings is 2.5 times higher than educational buildings in developed countries. One of the most effective ways of reducing global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions is retrofitting existing buildings. This study aims to investigate whether a particular energy-optimized design under the present climate conditions would respond effectively to future climate change. This can help designers make a better decision on an optimal model, which can remain optimal over the years based on climate change. For methodological purposes, multistage optimization was used to retrofit an existing educational building. Specifically, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was chosen to minimize the cooling and heating load, as well as consider investment costs for present and future weather files, using the jEPlus tool. Furthermore, the TOPSIS method was used to identify the best set of retrofit measures. For this purpose, a four-story educational building in Tehran was modeled on Design Builder software v7.0.0.116 as a case study to provide a better understanding for researchers of how to effectively retrofit a building to achieve a nearly zero energy building considering climate change. The results show that the optimized solution for the present weather file does not remain the optimized solution in 2080. Moreover, it is shown that to have an optimized building in regard to future weather files, the model should be designed for the future weather conditions. This study shows that if the building becomes optimized using the present weather file the total energy consumption will be reduced by 65.14% and 86.18% if using the future weather file. These two figures are obtained by implementing active and passive measures and show the priority of using the future weather file for designers. Using PV panels also, this building is capable of becoming a nearly net zero building, which would produce about 90% of its own energy demands.",Not About Sufficiency
Archaeopedological analysis of colluvial deposits in favourable and unfavourable areas: reconstruction of land use dynamics in SW Germany,"Colluvial deposits, as the correlate sediments of humaninduced soil erosion, depict an excellent archive of land use and landscape history as indicators of human-environment interactions. This study establishes a chronostratigraphy of colluvial deposits and reconstructs past land use dynamics in the Swabian Jura, the Baar and the Black Forest in SW Germany. In the agriculturally favourable Baar area multiple main phases of colluvial deposition, and thus intensified land use, can be identified from the Neolithic to the Modern times. In the unfavourable Swabian Jura increased colluvial deposition began later compared to the more favourable areas in the Baar. The same holds true for the unfavourable areas of the Black Forest, but intensified land use can only be reconstructed for the Middle Ages and Early Modern times instead of for the Bronze and Iron Age as in the Swabian Jura. Land use intensity and settlement dynamics represented by thick, multilayered colluvial deposits increase in the Baar and the Black Forest during the Middle Ages.

While most of the attention of science and innovation policy in the last decades has explored the relevance of the interconnections between public and business players in enhancing knowledge-based societies, a major trend has been ignored: both the quota of public R & D and its share over the total R & D investment has shrunk in the majority of OECD countries. As a result, a larger fraction of knowledge is today generated in the business sector. We argue that this is a major problem since public research and private research differ along a number of characteristics, e.g. public access, potential for future technological innovations, criteria of resource allocation. This trend can have adverse implications for long-term innovation and economic welfare in our societies. Through the lens of the public goods theory and of the sector of funding and execution of R & D for the period 1981-2013 we try to explain why.",Not About Sufficiency
Innovation in construction equipment and its flow into the construction industry,"The rate of innovation in construction equipment is measured by using two variables over a 30-year period, 1962-92: The number of new models introduced every year and the technological life of eight earthmoving equipments are considered in this study. The findings indicate that the rate of innovation in the construction equipment industry increased in the 30-year study period. The findings also suggest that these innovations are incremental in nature, stimulated by technological advances in other industries, but primarily driven by market forces. Technological advances are not confined to the industry that produces innovations. The mapping of the interindustry flow of innovations highlights that while construction companies play a predominant role in generating their own technological innovations, they are also heavily dependent on other industries, such as the construction equipment industry for the flow of technical system innovations. As such, the continuous and incremental innovations in the construction equipment industry are bound to act as a catalyst for the generation of technological advances in the construction industry.",Not About Sufficiency
Are global spillovers complementary or competitive? Need for international policy coordination,"Advanced and emerging economies are becoming more interdependent with rapid pace of globalization of capital markets and technological innovations in recent years. We examine whether technology and monetary policy shocks get transmitted between advanced and emerging market economies and to what extent they generate complementary or competitive effects. Given the globally integrated nature of capital markets, we uncover a transmission mechanism by which technology and policy shocks in advanced and emerging countries spill over between them through the capital flow channel. We mainly investigate whether analysis from a SVAR model by econometricians provides empirically similar conclusions to those from a macroeconomic theory-based DSGE model in measuring the impact of demand-side policy and technology shocks. We fit our VAR models to the same time series data used to calibrate and estimate the DSGE model. We conclude that monetary and fiscal policy shocks are competitive between the US (advanced economy) and India (emerging market), while domestic and global technology shocks or the exchange rate shocks have complementary effects. Intuitively, technology enhances productivity in both countries, while policy shocks tend to drive capital to a country with higher rate of return. Thus policy shocks in advanced countries could have unintended effects in terms of capital inflows to emerging economies and hence greater coordination of policies can help limit adverse cross-border spillovers.

Numerical investigation of solar and wind energy assisted plugged in hybridized engine driven auto-rickshaw/three-wheeler,"In South-Asian region, Auto-rickshaw (electric/engine driven) is a well-known vehicle. Mostly in India and Bangladesh, people prefer auto-rickshaw for traveling small to medium distances. However, no reliable study has been conducted using both solar and wind energy in auto-rickshaw. This paper is basically a research on using both solar and wind energy in engine driven auto-rickshaw along with a plugged-in hybrid technology. Placement of a wind turbine on the roof of the vehicle is not an effective idea. For this reason, a model of the vehicle is proposed for the placement of the turbine inside the vehicle and the model is validated by ANSYS CFX simulation. The theory and the simulation results match perfectly. From the analysis, it has been found that both the renewable energies will provide approximately 29.34% of the total power to run the vehicle altogether. The vehicle will not only reduce the pressure on national grid electricity but also reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by a large amount, if the conventional one is replaced by the proposed one. A custom drive cycle is also obtained using the vehicle properties and comparing with Asian Urban Drive Cycle. A novel CFD simulation is conducted for wind turbine blade considering reasonable data. Feasibility study of the proposed vehicle is also analyzed in this paper considering cost, weight and emission and a future recharging infrastructure is also proposed for running the vehicle on 100% green energy. Finally, this paper would help researchers for the further development of the combined system.",Not About Sufficiency
Enhancing energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness while reducing CO2 emissions in a hospital building,"Global population growth drives fossil fuel usage, surpassing natural greenhouse gas emissions and causing climate change, higher temperatures, floods, and agricultural erosion. The study underscores the significance of appropriate material selection and meticulous building design to establish a healthy living environment and mitigate energy consumption. The research is dedicated to the reduction of CO2 emissions. Hospitals, due to their constant energy requirements, require optimal temperature and comfort management for patients, necessitating careful design to avoid disruptions and power outages. The principal objective of this research is to enhance energy efficiency in the design phase of hospital buildings in Turkey and to develop an energy-efficient hospital model. This objective is achieved by evaluating different insulation materials, building orientations, lighting efficiency, and window-to-wall ratios. The methodology involves creating a reference structure for energy load calculations using Revit software and utilizing the Green Building Studio (GBS) program to conduct energy analyses in 7 different cities across Turkey. The study found that the utilization of building parameters with renewable energy sources reduced energy consumption by 57.5%, total costs by 16.24%, and CO2 emissions by 26.3%. The fundamental contribution of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of reducing energy consumption, costs, and CO2 emissions through design adjustments. The novelty of this research lies in its comprehensive approach to optimizing energy efficiency and CO2 emissions in hospital buildings in Turkey. These findings underline the significance of energy-efficient design, particularly considering the impact of increased energy usage and CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing dosimetric advancements in spatially fractionated radiotherapy: From grids to lattices,"Spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT) techniques have undergone transformative evolution, encompassing physical GRID therapy, MLC-based grids, virtual TOMO GRIDs, and 3-dimensional high-dose lattices. Historical roots trace back to Alban K & ouml;hler's pioneering Spatially fractionated grid therapy (SFGRT), utilizing physical grids for dose modulation. Technological innovations introduced multi-leaf collimators (MLCs), enabling adaptable spatial fractionation and a shift to the broader term ""SFRT."" Physics and dosimetry-based studies have demonstrated the feasibility of computerized treatment planning and identified the potential to minimize the peripheral dose while using such high-dose therapy. Meanwhile, 3-dimensional high-dose lattices showed enhanced precision. The meticulous placement of high-dose volumetric spheres enables a reduction in the volume of high-dose spills. Advancements in 3-dimensional lattices through intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) techniques offer enhanced therapeutic options. A database of SFRT studies identified 723 articles. This review shows the trajectory of SFRT from traditional grids to MLC-based approaches, virtual TOMO GRIDs, and innovative 3-dimensional lattices. Technological innovations, dosimetric advancements, and clinical feasibility have underscored the continual progress in refining spatially fractionated radiotherapy. The integration of MLCs and lattice techniques has demonstrated improved therapeutic outcomes, solidifying their relevance in modern radiation therapy protocols. Research has yet to reveal a clear correlation between treatment outcomes and dosimetric parameters. Additional investigations are necessary to assess the impact of various dosimetric parameters, such as EUD, peak-to-valley ratio (PVDR), D5%, D10%, D20%, D90%, etc., on the effectiveness of treatments.

Assessing embodied carbon and financial implications in concrete T-girder bridge design for cost-effective sustainability,"The substantial contribution of the global construction sector to greenhouse gas emissions underscores the urgency of mitigating its environmental impact. This study addresses the pressing need for sustainable practices in the construction sector, focusing on the intricate relationship between concrete grade selection, bridge span length, embodied carbon, and construction costs within a concrete T-girder highway bridge design. By examining various girder spacings, concrete grades, and bridge spans, this study aims to provide holistic insights into material optimisation for structural efficiency, sustainability, and economic viability. Notably, the findings reveal a nuanced understanding of design parameters, with shorter spans exhibiting minimal sensitivity to girder spacing and concrete grade, whereas longer spans highlight their significant role in shaping embodied carbon and cost. The results also show a remarkable similarity between the C25/30 and C32/40 concrete grades, emphasizing the need for a strategic balance between environmental and financial performance. This study underscores scientific rigour and methodological robustness, providing useful contributions to the field of sustainable construction practices. In conclusion, this research advocates a balanced approach that integrates concrete grade, girder spacing, and span length considerations to optimise sustainability and economic feasibility in concrete T-girder bridge designs.

Assessing multifunctional retrofit potential of urban roof areas and evaluating the power and carbon benefits under efficient retrofit scenarios,"Green roof installations and photovoltaic (PV) systems are widely employed roof retrofits that aid cities in mitigating climate change impacts, while avoiding the need for increased land utilization. By integrating PV systems with vegetation on urban roofs, a photovoltaic-green (PV-Green) system can be achieved for multifunctional use of the roof space, thereby simultaneously achieving PV and greening benefits. However, current research solely based on one retrofit type cannot meet the requirement for assessing the multifunctional retrofit potential of urban roofs. In this study, an assessment method is proposed to identify and quantify the multiple retrofit potential of urban roofs by integrating roof attributes (slope, orientation, and area), roof type (gable or flat), solar attributes (radiation and irradiation duration), and biogeochemical simulation. Moreover, three roof retrofit scenarios, Scenario 1 (S1): maximization of PV-Green roofs, Scenario 2 (S2): maximization of PV economic benefits, and Scenario 3 (S3): maximization of public subjective well-being through roof greening, were designed to allocate the use of urban roof spaces and evaluate their respective potential power and carbon benefits at the city scale. Using Shanghai's downtown as an example, the results showed that 85,722 roofs (or 7310.86 ha) were available for multifunctional use. S1 revealed that applying PV-Green roofs can increase the additional green biomass by 0.74 x 107 kg C/yr compared to only installing PV roofs. Moreover, S1 produced the highest power output of 2.31 x 1010 kWh/yr to meet 15.4% of Shanghai's electricity demand. S2 identified 609 flat roofs and 70,527 gable roofs that were uneconomical for PV system installation. This indicated that the solar radiation received by most gable roofs was insufficient to cover the installation cost. S3 offered a biomass production of 1.48 x 107 kg C/yr and increased carbon stocks in Shanghai by 0.87%. This assessment method provides urban planners and policymakers with an analytical tool to optimize the use of urban roof spaces, thereby enhancing urban livability and sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing productivity and carbon sequestration capacity of subtropical coniferous plantations using the process model PnET-CN,"A generalized, lumped-parameter ecological model PnET-CN was calibrated and validated for a subtropical coniferous plantation in southern China. PnET-CN model describes the biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) and can assist in estimating carbon sequestration potential. For validation of PnET-CN, data from coniferous forest plantations in southern China was used. Simulated daily gross primary productivity (GPP) from 2005 to 2007 agreed well with observations (R-2=0.56, S.D.=0.009). Simulations of monthly soil respiration (R-s) from 2005-2007 agreed well with R-s observations (R-2=0.67, S.D. =0.03). Simulated annual net primary productivity (NPP) from 1998-2006 was 803 33 gCm(-2)a(-1), about 4% higher than NPP observation (752 +/- 51 gCm(-2)a(-1)). Simulations of annual NEP from 2005-2007 only overestimate 9 gCm(-2)a(-1) (4%), 4 gCm(-2)a(-1) (1%) and 34 gCm(-2)a(-1) (8%) compared to NEP observations, respectively. Simulated annual foliar N concentration (FoINCon) (1.09%) is 10% lower than observed monthly FoINCon (0.87%-1.58%). Simulated annual N leaching (0.26 gNm(-2)) is about 10% lower than leaching observation (0.29 gNm(-2)). PnET-CN model validation indicates that PnET-CN is capable to simulate daily GPP, annual NPP, annual NEP, monthly R-s, annual FoINCon and annual nitrate N leaching for subtropical coniferous plantations in southern China. The results obtained from the validation test revealed that PnET-CN model can be used to simulate carbon sequestration of planted coniferous forests in southern China to a high level of precision. Sensitivity analysis suggests that great care should be taken in developing generalizations as to how forests will respond to a changing climate. PnET-CN performed satisfactorily in comparison to other models that have already been calibrated and validated in coniferous planted subtropical forests in China. Based on PnET-CN validation and its comparison to other models, future improvement of PnET-CN should focus on seasonal foliar N dynamics and the effects of water stress on autotrophic respirations in subtropical coniferous plantations in southern China.",Not About Sufficiency

"Assessing public support for air pollution mitigation and control policies: health, socioeconomic, and ideological predictors in an overburdened and vulnerable region of the US","BackgroundThe San Joaquin Valley (SJV) in California is one of the most polluted regions in the U.S. This study examined favorability for air pollution mitigation policies, interventions, and identified predictors amongst region's residents.MethodsA cross-sectional online survey asked about health status and conditions, self-protective behaviors, attitudes toward air pollution recommendations, air quality information knowledge and mitigation behaviors, as well as whether their views were favorable or unfavorable towards policy and interventions. EuroQOL-5D-3L was utilized to estimate quality-of-life distribution equity and air pollution policy favorability.ResultsA total of 310 adults residing in the SJV participated in the survey. The mean age was 42.90 years, with 34% having asthma. People with asthma reported the lowest health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to other air pollution ""sensitive"" groups. Concerns included the costs, charge and attributes of adopting hybrid or electric vehicles. Residents supported air pollution control and public space preservation, with socioeconomic factors and health state being significant predictors. Left-wing ideologies favor policies charging polluters, controlling emissions, and preserving public spaces, whereas right-wing views negatively predict support for electric vehicle charges and local organization interventions.ConclusionsResults may help air pollution control policymakers, public health agencies, environmental justice organizations, and the health equity research community understand the reasons for differential responses to air pollution interventions and mitigation efforts. This new knowledge could assist stakeholders in recommending sustainable and cost-effective interventions for improving air quality, elicit behavior change, and climate change adaptation in the region.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the Impact of Human Capital's Structure on High Value-Added Economic Sectors in European Countries: Illustration of Mining Industry,"The aim of the research was to assess the impact of a new structure of human capital on high value-added economic sectors in European countries. The conducted theoretical and empirical research has shown that the proposed new concept of human capital has a place to be. Three dimensions of human capital, such as quality, quantity and value, have different impacts on different sectors of European economies. Based on empirical data, the multiple linear regression model was chosen as a method that the best-fit structure of the data collected. The proposed econometric model revealed that the value of human capital is the most important component among three having very close statistical interconnections with qualitative dimensions. It was researched that Scandinavian countries scored the highest level of value dimension of human capital as well as high value-added in the economy. Open, trusted, tolerant, culturally diverse societies create preconditions for a rise for creative culture, which is a source for the formation of technological innovations and adaptation in high value-added economic sectors. Moreover, because of this value-added chain, technological innovations penetrate traditional industries as mining brings the reduction of cost, the increase in productivity and value-added, safety, and shared value in society through environmental issues.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the potential for CO2 storage in saline aquifers in Brazil: Challenges and Opportunities,"This study underscores the critical role of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and addresses the potential for CCS projects in saline aquifers in Brazil, one of the world's largest carbon emitters. The country's ability to adopt CCS is significantly influenced by the availability of data related to regional CO2 storage potential and identifying suitable geological framework for CO2 injection. While oil and gas reservoirs have traditionally been prioritized, saline aquifers represent an underexplored and potentially higher capacity storage option. Despite Brazil's 31 sedimentary basins, the data quantity and availability for these contexts remain insufficient for advanced studies on the geological storage of CO2 considering saline aquifers. An initial study was conducted indicating five potential targets in the Parana and Potiguar Basins for geological storage in saline aquifers based on available public data, mainly drilling data. This review reveals substantial challenges related to the evaluation of Brazil's CO2 storage capacity, such as the lack of modern seismic studies, the absence of a regulatory framework for CO2 storage, and insufficient investment in new well exploration. These challenges necessitate multistakeholder collaboration, the development of a supportive regulatory environment, and investment in extensive site characterization campaigns. Addressing these barriers is fundamental to realizing the country's CCS potential and contributing to global decarbonization efforts.

Assessing the sequestration time scales of some ocean-based carbon dioxide reduction strategies,"Ocean-based carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR) strategies are an important part of the portfolio of approaches needed to achieve negative greenhouse gas emissions. Many ocean-based CDR strategies rely on injecting CO2 or organic carbon (that will eventually become CO2) into the ocean interior, or enhancing the ocean's biological pump. These approaches will not result in permanent sequestration, because ocean currents will eventually return the injected CO2 back to the surface, where it will be brought into equilibrium with the atmosphere. Here, a model of steady state global ocean circulation and mixing is used to assess the time scales over which CO2 injected in the ocean interior remains sequestered from the atmosphere. There will be a distribution of sequestration times for any single discharge location due to the infinite number of pathways connecting a location at depth with the sea surface. The resulting probability distribution is highly skewed with a long tail of very long transit times, making mean sequestration times much longer than typical time scales. Deeper discharge locations will sequester purposefully injected CO2 much longer than shallower ones and median sequestration times are typically decades to centuries, and approach 1000 years in the deep North Pacific. Large differences in sequestration times occur both within and between the major ocean basins, with the Pacific and Indian basins generally having longer sequestration times than the Atlantic and Southern Oceans. Assessments made over a 50 year time horizon illustrates that most of the injected carbon will be retained for injection depths greater than 1000 m, with several geographic exceptions such as the Western North Atlantic. Ocean CDR strategies that increase upper ocean ecosystem productivity with the goal of exporting more carbon to depth will have mainly a short-term influence on atmospheric CO2 levels because similar to 70% will be transported back to the surface ocean within 50 years. The results presented here will help plan appropriate ocean CDR strategies that can help limit climate damage caused by fossil fuel CO2 emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of Atmospheric Carbon Sequestration in Forest Products,"An integrated assessment of carbon balance in biomass removed during lumbering and transformed into products of forest, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry is conducted. Carbon sequestration was calculated with the IPCC technique. Depending on the economic state of the forest complex, from 1961 to 2005, its products can be both a source of emission of about 15 Mt CO(2) per year and a pool that can uptake up to 54.1 Mt CO(2) per year. In 2004, 28.3 Mt CO(2) or 1.4% equivalent emission from other national economy sectors came to forest products from the atmosphere. Rational use of forest products and reduced non-productive losses of raw wood can lead to a significant contribution of the forest complex to decrease in greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of carbon sequestration potential of tropical tree species for urban forestry in India,"Urban, peri urban and patch forests play a critical role in climate change mitigation through increased carbon storage and for that, it is imperative to assess the species response in an eco-region to recommend a potentially higher carbon sequestering species. In urban settings, green spaces, in particular, trees play a vital role in pre-serving biodiversity, reducing the impact of urban heat islands, enhancing the hydrological cycle, as well as sequestering carbon. When introduced in urban greening projects, native species provide better ecosystem ser-vices, conserve and maintain biodiversity more sustainably than exotic species. However, fewer efforts are being made to evaluate the carbon sequestration potential of native tropical tree species in urban greening initiatives. The present study aims to assess the biomass production and carboxylation efficiency of three native tropical tree species to identify the high carbon sequestering species, which will enhance the carbon stocks under urban green spaces. Above ground biomass, carbon stock and physiological performance of three native tropical tree species (Tectona grandis, Mallotus nudiflorus and Syzygium cumini) were measured in Botanical Garden of CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow for eight years old tree stands. Above ground biomass (AGB, Mg/ha) was measured using a non-destructive method by applying allometric equations. Tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH) and leaf area index (LAI) was maximum in T. grandis stand (10.43 m, 29.21 cm, 1.95, respectively). Maximum AGB (71.94 Mg/ha) and carbon stock (25.54 Mg/ha) was observed in T. grandis plantations among the three tree stands. T. grandis stand also had maximum litter fall (5.82 Mg/ha). Highest diurnal photosynthesis rate, water use efficiency and stomatal conductance were also observed in T. grandis stand. However, maximum photosynthetic rate was observed in Mallotus nudiflorus. One way ANOVA revealed significant differences (p < 0.001) in AGB, carbon stock and physiological parameters among the three species. Pearson's Correlation matrix established the positive relationship between growth performance and physiological traits of species with their capacity to sequester carbon. T. grandis can be promoted for urban greening projects for achieving carbon sequestration targets with short time span, however plantation of mixed native species will provide better de-livery of all ecosystem services in sustainable mode. Results from the present study shed light on the patterns of carbon sequestration by these species, which in turn will help in the decision-making process for sustainable urban greening. Further, more tropical species can be assessed for their biomass and carbon capture capacities to determine the best species matrix for plantations to enhance carbon storage and develop climate resilient greenbelt under urban landscape forestry programs.",Not About Sufficiency

Assessment of Multiple Intelligences in First-Year Engineering Students in Northeast Mexico,"In sustainable education, it is important to analyze student diversity in order to create strategies that allow for the implementation of inclusive education based on the differences observed among students. To achieve this, a sample of 321 first-year engineering students (107 females and 214 males) at a private university in northeast Mexico was analyzed during the 2020 academic year. Students were classified according to their gender, engineering program, and the development of their multiple intelligences according to Howard Gardner theory of multiple intelligences. To verify the effect of gender and program factors on the development of multiple intelligences, Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed with alpha = 0.05. The analysis of the effects of gender identified significant differences in four intelligences: linguistic and interpersonal (for which the female students obtained higher mean scores) and mathematical and visual (for which the male students obtained higher mean scores). The analysis of the effects of the engineering program identified significant differences in five intelligences: mathematical, visual, and musical (for which civil engineering students obtained a higher mean score than the students in the other programs); kinesthetic (for which computer science students obtained a lower mean score than students in the other programs); and naturalistic (for which sustainability engineering students obtained a higher mean score than students in the other programs).

"Assessment of sectoral greenhouse gas emission effects of biomass, fossil fuel, and (non)metallic ore utilization of the Nordic economy","In a rare empirical approach, and considering the uniqueness of the Nordic economy, this study examines the differential effect of domestic material utilization, i.e., biomass, fossil fuel, metallic ores, and non-metallic ores on the sectoral greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, i.e., industrial, agricultural, land use, land use change and forestry (LULCF), waste management, and energy GHG emissions in the period 1990-2020. By applying competent econometric tools that accounts for potential estimation bias, the result revealed that metallic ore consumption among the Nordic countries is detrimental to the region's environmental sustainability, more so to the region's greening circular economy drive. This is because metallic ore utilization spurs industrial, agricultural, LULCF, waste management, and energy GHG emissions. Similarly, biomass material consumption spurs GHG emissions arising from the LULCF, waste management, and energy sector activities while fossil fuel materials spur LULCF and energy GHG emissions. However, non-metallic ores consumption provides a desirable outcome as it mitigates GHG emission with respective elasticities of similar to 0.06, similar to 0.01, and similar to 0.05, in the industrial, agricultural, and waste management sector activities while biomass also plays a statistically significant role of reducing agricultural GHG emission by similar to 0.02% when there is a percent increase in the consumption of biomass.

Assessment of the historical environmental changes from a survey of local residents in an urban-rural catchment,"When attempting to address the environmental problems of a catchment, it is important to consider changes in a long-term environmental context. However, the long-term data on the state of the environment that are required for such an examination are rarely documented. Such data collection typically requires several years of investigation and observation. In addition, as there may be a significant time lag between the occurrence of a phenomenon and its cause, subsequent environmental investigations of changing animal and plant states scaling up to 5 years may be inadequate. We conducted a long-term analysis of the environmental changes in five sub-catchments of the Nagara River, Japan, assessing a period of 30 years, using a questionnaire survey approach involving local communities. Four sub-catchments of the Yoshida River were also analyzed for comparison. In addition, we attempted to clarify the relationship between various environmental factors and the space-time response of animals and plants. The survey included eight topics: assumed information, hydrological characteristics, habitat conditions for living things, forest state, land cover conditions, river awareness, free-entry information, and respondent information. Our method also has academic significance in that it validates the environmental agent extraction technique using a questionnaire survey. Our results identify management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss due to climate change. Forest management and human activities should be undertaken with care, and the environmental context going forward into the next century should be considered for integrated catchment management. Elsewhere, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, and/or efforts to provide corridors to ease species movements may be necessary at the global level.

Assessment of the renewable energy generation towards net-zero energy buildings: A review,"Decarbonizing the building sector is extremely important to mitigating climate change as the sector contributes 40% of the overall energy consumption and 36% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Net-zero energy buildings are one of the promising decarbonization attempts due to their potential of decreasing the use of energy and increasing the total share of renewable energy. To achieve a net zero energy building, it is necessary to decrease the energy demand by applying efficiency enhancement measures and using renewable energy sources. Net-zero energy buildings can be classified into four models (Net-Zero Site Energy buildings, Net-Zero Emissions buildings, Net-Zero Source Energy buildings, and Net-Zero Cost Energy buildings). A variety of technical, financial, and environmental factors should be considered during the decision-making process of net-zero energy building development, justifying the use of multi-criteria decision analysis methods for the design of net-zero energy buildings. This paper also discussed the contributions of renewable energy generation (hydropower, wind energy, solar, heat pumps, and bioenergy) to the development of net-zero energy buildings and reviewed its role in tackling the decarbonization challenge. Cost-benefit analysis and life cycle assessment of net-zero energy building designs and their challenges were reviewed to shape the priorities of future development. It is important to develop a universal decision instrument for optimum design and operation of net-zero energy buildings. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Assessment of 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' forces as determinants of rotifer distribution among lakes in Ontario, Canada","Predation and food supply are generally perceived as important determinants of spatial and temporal variations of populations. The population dynamics of freshwater rotifers have been well researched in this aspect. However, their spatial variations have attracted less attention and have not been studied by simultaneously considering both predation and food supply. We studied spatial variations of rotifer abundance among 34 Canadian boreal lakes. A large part of the variance of rotifer abundance was associated with variables related to trophic status including chlorophyll a and total phosphorus. However, abundances of mesozooplankton such as potential predators and competitors did not correlate with rotifer abundance and did not explain the residual of the regression between rotifer abundance and chlorophyll a. The results of the present study indicated that variation in rotifer abundance among lakes was caused by 'bottom-up' forces related to food supply and not by 'top-down' predatory interactions. This provides a contrast to previous empiric and experimental studies that reported that temporal variations of rotifer abundance were mainly regulated by 'top-down' interactions. This discrepancy suggests that overall differences in rotifer abundance among lakes are mainly determined by 'bottom-up' forces while temporal changes in single lakes are shaped by 'top-down' forces. Meanwhile, the composition of rotifer species was correlated with mesozooplankton abundance as well as trophic status. Rotifer species with long spines or rigid loricae were found in the lakes where mesozooplankton were abundant, which suggests that defensive morphology could have affected the rotifer species distribution among the study lakes.",Not About Sufficiency
"Monitoring the spatiotemporal changes in regional ecosystem health: a case study in Izmir, Turkey","The maintenance of human well-being and development is dependent on ecosystem goods and services.

The study used the vigour, organization and resilience model together with potential ecosystem services to understand the relationships between LULC structure, ecosystems and human activities using the most populous and urbanized parts of Izmir metropolitan city. For this purpose, the CORINE land cover maps and Landsat satellite images for 1990 and 2018 were used. Our results showed that there was an increase in the mean regional ecosystem health value (from 48.06 to 49.32) during 1990-2018, but it changed in an inconsistent way in the different parts of the study area. The urban sprawl type and the presence of vegetation were important factors affecting the overall REH value. The spatiotemporal LULC changes were effective on all the ecosystem health indicators. Among all the ecosystem health indicators, ecosystem vigour and resilience were the most important factors positively affected the REH level in highly urbanized districts. Overall, our study showed that whilst the gains in vegetation between urban and rural areas enhanced the ecosystem vigour and resilience during 1990-2018, they have also improved the regional health of districts located along the coastal parts of the study area.",Not About Sufficiency

Australian household adoption of solar photovoltaics: A comparative study of hardship and non-hardship customers,"Prior studies establish that electricity systems across the globe need to transition toward renewable energy and that renters have a low adoption of effective means to do so through access to household solar photovoltaics (PV). Yet, the economic, environmental, and social costs of low PV adoption by people who have trouble paying their electricity bills (hardship customers), who are more likely to be low-income tenants, remain understudied. Drawing on electricity use data from an Australian energy retailer we compare the performance of PV for hardship customers against 'average' households. Results illustrate that if society could achieve greater solar PV installation on hardship homes, annual grid-based electricity consumption could be reduced by 40%, lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 1.6 tCO(2)e per household annually and energy bills by $2908 per low-income household over 15 years. We illustrate how Australian policy could be re-oriented to encourage greater PV adoption on hardship properties, including through support for a new market structure that distributes the economic benefits of PV between renters and landlords.",Not About Sufficiency
Automated CO2 and CH4 monitoring system for continuous estimation of degassing related to hydropower,"Reliable measurement of greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs is essential for estimating the carbon footprint of the hydropower industry. Among the different emission pathways, degassing downstream of the turbines and spillway is poorly documented mainly because of the safety stakes related to sampling up and downstream the power plants. The alternative being to sample the water from the turbine inside the station, this study aimed to assemble a custom automated CO2 and CH4 monitoring system (SAGES), especially designed for long-term surveys in hydropower facilities, with a special focus on low maintenance requirements. The SAGES combines infrared and laser technologies with a modular programming approach and run with a specifically designed plexiglass equilibration system (PES) that maintain a permanent headspace and avoid clogging by suspended solids. Although the SAGES is based on commercially available devices, it is the first time they are combined and used with the gas equilibrator. To ensure the reliability of the mounting and to control the quality of the readings, the system was tested in laboratory prior to its installation in generating stations. SAGES and PES performances were compared with those of generic devices available on the market although less adapted to the specific deployments targeted. The SAGES gas partial pressure measurements were accurate and linear in the entire range tested: 0 to 5,000 ppm for pCO(2) and 0 to 600 and 10,000 ppm for pCH(4). Gas PP measurements were comparable to the reference CO2/CH4 sensor and there was no drift during long term deployment. The SAGES/PES installed in 2021 in cascading generating stations of the Romaine complex collected more than 28,000 data points over a 10-month period and required only two maintenances. Results show that the SAGES is a reliable tool that provide long-term CO2 and CH4 dataset in generating stations while requiring minimal energy, care and maintenance. The data collected in turbine water and the recent use of the SAGES in peat land by a collaborative team demonstrate how the SAGES systems can efficiently contribute to the understanding of reservoir carbon cycles.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the potential of ammonia and hydrogen as alternative fuels for transportation,"This study investigates the potential of hydrogen and ammonia, as alternatives for transportation fuels to tackle urgent issues concerning greenhouse gas emissions and air quality in the worldwide transportation sector. By examining studies and technological progresses, we evaluate the feasibility of transitioning to these energy options. Through an investigation of production methods, energy efficiency, environmental consequences, and infrastructure requirements, we present both the advantages and disadvantages of using hydrogen and ammonia as fuel substitutes. We spotlight production techniques such as electrolysis and renewable energy sources that could significantly decrease carbon emissions and air pollutants. Nonetheless, key challenges such as expanding infrastructure, cost-effectiveness, and safety considerations need to be resolved for adoption. Drawing on findings from research and industry developments, this article contributes to publications on transportation solutions while proposing avenues for research efforts and policy initiatives. Existing challenges and limitations are also discussed in details. In conclusion, this research underscores the significance of research endeavors and policy backing to unlock the potential of hydrogen and ammonia as sustainable transportation fuels underscoring their role in mitigating environmental impacts and promoting global sustainability objectives.",Not About Sufficiency
Wildness and habitat quality drive spatial patterns of urban biodiversity,"Urban green and blue spaces (UGBS) are key for biodiversity conservation. Many studies focus on UGBS benefits for well-being, but how UGBS ecological and quality influence urban biodiversity is still poorly understood. We analysed the predictive accuracy of urban wildness (UW) and habitat quality (HQ) spatial patterns to biodiversity in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country. Using GIS techniques, we mapped relative UW as a landscape quality, considering remoteness, challenging terrain, and perceived naturalness. We further evaluated HQ using the InVEST habitat quality module, including data on habitat sensitivity to threats (e.g. population density, light and noise pollution, accessibility) and suitability for biodiversity support, based on a parametrization by expert consultation. We compared UW and HQ to observed species richness obtained from crowd-sourced databases as a biodiversity proxy. UW and HQ models predicted general biodiversity urban patterns, being particularly adequate in UGBS. Peripheral UGBS were associated with higher UW and HQ and positively correlated to biodiversity, as opposed to the smaller-sized centrally located UGBS, more exposed to threats. Both predictors significantly explained biodiversity, and HQ better accounted for threat susceptibility in UGBS. Our findings suggest that small-sized UGBS, such as parks and squares, fail to effectively support urban biodiversity, due to their high exposure and vulnerability to threats, particularly in centric areas. Emphasizing efforts in larger centric UGBS with rewilding strategies (e.g. lowering management frequency) and reducing exposure to threats is essential to increase the habitat quality of UGBS and thus support urban biodiversity.",Not About Sufficiency
Does environmental regulation drive specialisation in green innovation?☆,"We examine the response of technological change to one of the major environmental regulations in the European Union (EU) - the Ambient Air Quality Directive (AAQD).

Barriers to and facilitators of climate change action in architecture practice,"There is urgent need for the transformation of built environments to tackle climate change. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2 degrees C is of paramount importance, as is planning for future climate change risks. Architects, as designers of the built environment hold an important role in advocating and enabling the necessary mitigation and adaptation actions required in the design and construction of new buildings, and the reuse of existing built fabric - to reduced embodied carbon and achieve operational energy efficiency. Despite the importance, most built environments do not yet adequately address climate change. Limited research has examined the barriers that architectural professionals encounter when integrating climate change action in their projects during their role designing built environments. This is the gap that this research addresses. Interviews with twenty-two Australian architectural practitioners were undertaken, to investigate their experience of barriers to and facilitators of climate change action in their professional practice. Four key themes were found: 1) actors, 2) processes and structures, 3) information and knowledge, and 4) the role of government. Barriers and facilitators were found to be embedded in architects' perception of their role, the processes and practices they undertake, and their relationship with other stakeholders. The facilitators identified can assist drive better outcomes for future design and construction of buildings. Recommendations identified include: 1) build architects' confidence and capability to be advocates; 2) develop of architects' climate change knowledge and competence; 3) transform design processes to be more circular, interdisciplinary and long term focused, and 4) reform current built environment policy to adequately consider climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
Deforestation and Malaria on the Amazon Frontier: Larval Clustering of Anopheles darlingi (Diptera: Culicidae) Determines Focal Distribution of Malaria,"We performed bimonthly mosquito larval collections during 1 year, in an agricultural settlement in the Brazilian Amazon, as well as an analysis of malaria incidence in neighboring houses. Water collections located at forest fringes were more commonly positive for Anopheles darlingi larvae and Kulldorff spatial analysis pinpointed significant larval clusters at sites directly beneath forest fringes, which were called larval ""hotspots."" Remote sensing identified 43 ""potential"" hotspots. Sampling of these areas revealed an 85.7% positivity rate for A. darlingi larvae. Malaria was correlated with shorter distances to potential hotpots and settlers living within 400 m of potential hotspots had a 2.60 higher risk of malaria. Recently arrived settlers, usually located closer to the tip of the triangularly shaped deforestation imprints of side roads, may be more exposed to malaria due to their proximity to the forest fringe. As deforestation progresses, transmission decreases. However, forest remnants inside deforested areas conferred an increased risk of malaria. We propose a model for explaining frontier malaria in the Amazon: because of adaptation of A. darlingi to the forest fringe ecotone, humans are exposed to an increased transmission risk when in proximity to these areas, especially when small dams are created on naturally running water collections.",Not About Sufficiency
"Beyond the COVID Pandemic, Telemedicine, and Health Care","This article reviews the current experience and the flaws encountered in the rush to deploy telemedicine as a substitute for in-person care in response to the raging coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; the preceding fault lines in the U.S. health care system that exacerbated the problem; and the importance of emerging from this calamity with a clear vision for necessary health care reforms. It starts with the premise that the precursors of catastrophes of this magnitude provide a valid basis for planning corrective measures, improved preparedness, and ultimately serious health reform. Such reform should include standardized protocols for proper deployment of telemedicine to triage patients to the appropriate level and source of care at the point of need, proper use of relevant technological innovations to deliver precision medicine, and the development of regional networks to coordinate and improve access to care while streamlining the care process. The other essential element is a universal payment system that puts the United States at par with the rest of the industrialized countries, regardless of variation among them. The ultimate goal is creating an efficient, effective, accessible, and equitable system of care. Although timing is uncertain, the pandemic will be brought under control.

Benchmarking the Environmental Performance of the Jatropha Biodiesel System through a Generic Life Cycle Assessment,"In addition to available country or site-specific life cycle studies on Jatropha biodiesel we present a generic, location-independent life cycle assessment and provide a general but in-depth analysis of the environmental performance of Jatropha biodiesel for transportation. Additionally, we assess the influence of changes in byproduct use and production chain. In our assessments, we went beyond the impact on energy requirement and global warming by including impacts on ozone layer and terrestrial acidification and eutrophication. The basic Jatropha biodiesel system consumes eight times less nonrenewable energy than conventional diesel and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 51%. This result coincides with the lower limit of the range of reduction percentages available in literature for this system and for other liquid biofuels. The impact on the ozone layer is also lower than that provoked by fossil diesel, although eutrophication and acidification increase eight times. This study investigates the general impact trends of the Jatropha system, although not considering land-use change. The results are useful as a benchmark against which other biodiesel systems can be evaluated, to calculate repayment times for land-use change induced carbon loss or as guideline with default values for assessing the environmental performance of specific variants of the system.",Not About Sufficiency
Benchmarking urban performance against absolute measures of sustainability-A review,"Cities are a key target in the global quest for sustainability and are increasingly acting independently to take the lead in sustainability initiatives. To truly achieve sustainability, cities need to ensure that their consumption is compatible with absolute sustainability and validate achievements from a perspective that includes transboundary impacts. The aim of this review is to assess how well these topics are incorporated into commonly used urban sustainability assessment methods, using the safe and just space (SJS) framework definition of a minimum acceptable threshold for both ecological stability and standard of living. The review identified 277 different sustainability indicator frameworks that have been applied to cities and undertook a detailed assessment of the most commonly cited of these. Consumption-based footprint studies were separately assessed to determine the extent to which they measure SJS indicators for cities. Both indicator frameworks and footprint studies had a focus on boundaries of increasing risk, including carbon, water, and land use; however few measured highly exceeded boundaries including nitrogen and phosphorus use, biodiversity, and possibly chemical pollution. Social impacts were well covered in indicator frameworks, except food intake, but largely absent from footprint studies. Cities are largely not measuring their impact on planetary tipping points or transboundary impacts, risking resolving some environmental issues while exacerbating others.",Not About Sufficiency
Benders decomposition for the inventory vehicle routing problem with perishable products and environmental costs,"We consider the problem of inventory routing in the context of perishable products and find near-optimal replenishment scheduling and vehicle routes when the objective is to maximize the supplier's profit and minimize the costs due to fuel consumption, inventory holding, and greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated as a function of fuel consumed, and fuel consumption levels are accurately calculated as a function of vehicle speed, load and traveled distance. To solve the problem efficiently, we develop an exact method based on Benders decomposition to find high-quality solutions in reasonable time. To enhance the convergence rate of the Benders decomposition algorithm, we present several acceleration strategies, such as addition of valid inequalities to the master problem and warm-up start. The warm-up start acceleration strategy itself is a meta-heuristic based on the greedy random adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and mathematical programming formulations. We present computational results which illustrate the superior performance of the proposed solution methodology in solving large-scale instances with 60 customers and 6 planning periods with 4 vehicles using Benders decomposition. Additionally, we show that utilizing a more comprehensive model to calculate the fuel cost results in fuel savings of 2 to 11% on the tested instances compared to traditional models that assume that the fuel cost is solely a function of the distance traveled during delivery.

Benefits of multi-gas mitigation: An application of the Global Trade and Environment Model (GTEM),"To address the problem of human induced climate change effectively, climate policy must embody the principles of economic efficiency, environmental effectiveness and equity. In this paper it is shown that such a climate change policy should include a broad coverage of major greenhouse gases and sources. ABARE's Global Trade and Environment Model (GTEM) is used to analyse the economic impact of meeting a radiative forcing target using policies that focus on carbon dioxide emissions only and policies that focus on all major greenhouse gases and sources, including land use change and forestry emissions. It is projected that incorporating non-carbon dioxide gases into climate change policy reduces the economic adjustment cost significantly. Broadening the sources of carbon dioxide to include land use change and forestry emissions further reduces the economic adjustment costs.",Not About Sufficiency
A comparative life cycle assessment of marine fuels: liquefied natural gas and three other fossil fuels,"Air emissions from shipping have received attention in recent years and the shipping industry is striving for solutions to reduce their emissions and to comply with stricter regulations. Strategies to reduce emissions can consist of a fuel switch, engine changes, or end-of-pipe technologies, but they do not necessarily imply reduced life cycle emissions. The present paper assesses the environmental performance of marine fuels from well-to-propeller using life cycle assessment (LCA). Four fossil fuels are compared: heavy fuel oil (HFO), marine gas oil, gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel, and liquefied natural gas (LNG), combined with two exhaust abatement techniques: open-loop scrubber and selective catalytic reduction. LNG and other alternatives that comply with the SECA 2015 and Tier III NOx requirements give decreased acidification and eutrophication potentials with 78-90 per cent in a life cycle perspective compared with HFO. In contrast, the use of LNG does not decrease the global warming potential by more than 8-20 per cent, the amount depending mainly on the magnitude of the methane slip from the gas engine. None of the fossil fuels scrutinized here would decrease the greenhouse gas emissions significantly from a life cycle perspective. The study supports the need for LCA when evaluating the environmental impact of a fuel change, e.g. it is found that the highest global warming potential during the whole life cycle is connected to the alternatives with GTL fuel.",Not About Sufficiency
Between universalism and targeting: Exploring policy pathways for an Australian Basic Income,"Despite growing interest in proposals for a universal basic income, little advance has been made in implementation. Here we explore policy options for an Australian Basic Income. Our analysis responds to concerns that Basic Income is both too expensive and too radical a departure from existing welfare state structures to be a feasible policy option. Drawing on policy and Basic Income scholarship we identify changes to Australia's current means-tested benefits structures that move substantially towards Basic Income while remaining consistent with historic policy norms, which we call 'affluence testing'. Using microsimulation we explore fiscal and distributional trade-offs associated with the implementation of an affluence-tested Basic Income. Our results suggest Basic Income has the potential to significantly reduce inequality and poverty while also requiring taxes to rise substantially. Placing these trade-offs in international context we find the policy would reduce inequality to levels similar to Nordic welfare states while increasing overall taxation to approximately the OECD average.

Beyond Global Warming Potential A Comparative Application of Climate Impact Metrics for the Life Cycle Assessment of Coal and Natural Gas Based Electricity,"In the ongoing debate about the climate benefits of fuel switching from coal to natural gas for power generation, the metrics used to model climate impacts may be important. In this article, we evaluate the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal and natural gas used in new, advanced power plants using a broad set of available climate metrics in order to test for the robustness of results. Climate metrics included in the article are global warming potential, global temperature change potential, technology warming potential, and cumulative radiative forcing. We also used the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) climate-change model to validate the results. We find that all climate metrics suggest a natural gas combined cycle plant offers life cycle climate benefits over 100 years compared to a pulverized coal plant, even if the life cycle methane leakage rate for natural gas reaches 5%. Over shorter time frames (i.e., 20 years), plants using natural gas with a 4% leakage rate have similar climate impacts as those using coal, but are no worse than coal. If carbon capture and sequestration becomes available for both types of power plants, natural gas still offers climate benefits over coal as long as the life cycle methane leakage rate remains below 2%. These results are consistent across climate metrics and the MAGICC model over a 100-year time frame. Although it is not clear whether any of these metrics are better than the others, the choice of metric can inform decisions based on different societal values. For example, whereas annual temperature change reported may be a more relevant metric to evaluate the human health effects of increased heat, the cumulative temperature change may be more relevant to evaluate climate impacts, such as sea-level rise, that will result from the cumulative warming.",Not About Sufficiency
Enhanced co-production of hydrogen and ethanol from brown algae fermentation by supplementing nano zero-valent iron (nZVI),"Nano zero -valent iron (nZVI) has been shown to facilitate biofuel production, notably in hydrogen generation. However, its effect on bioethanol production is rarely studied, and even less so on its impact on hydrogen and ethanol co-production. This study therefore conducted ethanol-type hydrogen-producing fermentation with brown algae to explore the effect of nZVI. With the supplementation of nZVI, fermentation was accelerated and the production of hydrogen and ethanol were both significantly enhanced. At the optimal nZVI concentration of 100 mg/L, the production of hydrogen and ethanol increased by 71.44% and 65.11%, respectively. A high hydrogen yield of 2.32 mol/mol-mannitol was achieved. The ethanol yield (1.86 mol/mol-mannitol) reached 93% of the theoretical maximal yield with a high selectivity of 91.09%. Electron distribution analysis showed that nZVI increased the total electron amounts of fermentation, and directed more electrons to ethanol than hydrogen. The reduced redox potential (ORP) and increased NADH level further confirmed the role of nZVI. Moreover, nZVI fostered Fe 2 + availability to hydrogen-producing bacteria, enhancing the enzymes hydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, as well as cell biomass. The bioenergy conversion efficiency (BioECE) improved from 19.08% to 31.74% with 100 mg/L nZVI treatment. This study provided a first demonstration regarding the role of nZVI in hydrogen and ethanol co-production, highlighting the great potential of multiple bioenergy recovery from marine biomass.",Not About Sufficiency
Attitudes Toward Electric Vehicles: The Case of Perugia Using a Fuzzy Set Analysis,"Sustainable mobility has received increasing attention in recent years.

Bioenergy and bioexergy analyses with artificial intelligence application on combustion of recycled hardwood and softwood wastes,"Novel biomass bioenergy-bioexergy analyses via thermogravimetry analysis and artificial intelligence are employed to evaluate the three biofuels from wood wastes (softwood-SW, hardwood-HW, and woods blend-WB). The chemical characterization of SW has the highest bioenergy (higher heating value - HHV: 18.84 MJ kg(- 1)) and bioexergy (specific chemical bioexergy - SCB: 19.65 MJ kg(- 1)) with the SCB/HHV ratio of wood waste as about 1.043-1.046. The high C-element has a significant influence on the HHV-SCB. The three distinct zones of wood waste combustion are identified: moisture evaporation (Zone I, up to 110 degrees C), combustion reaction - degradation of three major lignocellulosic components (hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin) at Zone II, 110-600 degrees C, and ash remains (Zone III, 600-800 degrees C). The ignition (D-ig = 0.01-0.04) and fuel reactivity (R-fuel = 3.82-6.97 %center dot min(- 1)center dot degrees C- 1) indexes are evaluated. The comprehensive combustion index (S-n:>5 x 10(-7)%(2) min(- 2 )degrees C- 3) suggests that wood waste has a better combustion performance than bituminous coal. The statistical evaluation presents that the highest HHV-SCB values are obtained by performing combustion for SW-250 mu m at 15 degrees C center dot min(- 1).

Biological processes modelling for MBR systems: A review of the state-of-the-art focusing on SMP and EPS,"A mathematical correlation between biomass kinetic and membrane fouling can improve the understanding and spread of Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) technology, especially in solving the membrane fouling issues.

The key findings of this work show that the new conceptual approaches focus on the role of different bacterial groups in the formation and degradation of SMP/EPS. Even though several studies have been published regarding SMP modelling, there still needs to be more information due to the highly complicated SMP nature to facilitate the accurate modelling of membrane fouling. The EPS group has seldom been addressed in the literature, probably due to the knowledge deficiency concerning the triggers for production and degradation pathways in MBR systems, which require further efforts. Finally, the successful model applications showed that proper estimation of SMP and EPS by modelling approaches could optimise membrane fouling, which can influence the MBR energy consumption, operating costs, and greenhouse gas emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
Bio-Nanoparticles Mediated Transesterification of Algal Biomass for Biodiesel Production,"Immense use of fossil fuels leads to various environmental issues, including greenhouse gas emissions, reduced oil reserves, increased energy costs, global climate changes, etc. These challenges can be tackled by using alternative renewable fuels such as biodiesel. Many studies reported that biodiesel production from microalgae biomass is an environment-friendly and energy-efficient approach, with significantly improved fuel quality in terms of density, calorific value and viscosity. Biodiesel is produced using the transesterification process and the most sustainable method is utilizing enzymes for transesterification. Lipase is an enzyme with excellent catalytic activity, specificity, enantio-selectivity, compatibility and stability and hence it is applied in microalgae biodiesel production. But, difficulty in enzymatic recovery, high enzyme cost and minimal reaction rate are some of its drawbacks that have to be addressed. In this aspect, the nanotechnological approach of lipase immobilization in producing microalgae biodiesel is a promising way to increase production yield and it is due to the adsorption efficiency, economic benefit, recyclability, crystallinity, durability, stability, environmental friendliness and catalytic performance of the bio-nanoparticles used. Through increasing post-harvest biomass yield, absorption of CO2 and photosynthesis in the photobioreactor, the use of nanoparticle immobilized lipase during the generation of biodiesel from microalgae has the potential to also remove feedstock availability constraints. This review article discusses the production of microalgae biodiesel, and effect of nanoparticles and immobilized lipase nanoparticles on biodiesel production. The advantages of using lipase nanoparticles and the challenges in introducing the immobilized lipase on nanoparticles in large-scale microalgae biodiesel production are also discussed. Reducing the water and land use, energy and nutrient footprints of integrated algae-based operations must be the main goal of larger-scale experiments as well as ongoing research and development in order to expedite the adoption of microalgae-based biodiesel production. Also, the cost-effectiveness and large-scale availability of nanoparticles and the impact of lipase nanoparticles on engine performance should be analyzed for commercialization of microalgae biodiesel.",Not About Sufficiency
Biowaste to bioenergy options for sustainable economic growth opportunities in developing countries: Product space model analysis and policy map development,"The sustainable and eco-friendly economic growth of a country is associated with its economic progress and the advancement of its bioenergy sector. Biowaste can be used to produce bioenergy and is increasingly being recognized as a promising resource for filling the energy gap. However, in developing countries, biowaste-to-energy techniques are relatively immature owing to economic and technological challenges, forcing these countries to export cheap biowaste and obtain expensive energy imports. In this study, country-wise export data of potential biowaste materials were gathered, assessed, and filtered according to the feasibility of bioenergy generation. Five developing countries (Argentina, Brazil, India, Thailand, and Ukraine) were selected for the economic assessment based on the export value and revealed comparative advantage (RCA). Argentina has the most exports (9.59 billion USD), with seven biowaste products having RCA >1. The product space model (PSM) was employed to evaluate the income potential of biowaste and to appraise the studied countries overall level of sophistication, and then a suitable industrial policy was proposed according to PSM indicators. All the considered biowaste products have low-income potential, so it is better to produce bioenergy from these products. Thailand has the highest country-level sophistication, followed by India, Brazil, Ukraine, and Argentina. However, ac-cording to the PSM, the EXPY values exhibit significant growth for India (52.3%) and Thailand (31.9%), while the remaining countries experience moderate EXPY growth.

SPECIFICITY OF MISMATCH REPAIR FOLLOWING TRANSFORMATION OF SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE WITH HETERODUPLEX PLASMID DNA,"A method is described for genetic detection of mismatch repair products following transformation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method is based on the detection of .beta.-galactosidase activity in clonal derivatives of cells transformed with heteroduplex plasmid DNA. Heterduplex plasmid substrates were constructed by insertion of an oligonucleotide heteroduplex into the coding sequence of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene. The plasmid and oligonucleotides were designed so that one strand of the construct would code for a functional .beta.-galactosidase and the other strand would contain an in-frame nonsense codon. The frequencies of transformed clones containing only Lac+ cells, only Lac- cells, or a mixture of the two Lac phenotypes provided information on the efficiency of the repair reaction. With this method, plasmids carrying single-base substitution mismatches, a single-base frameshift mismatch (T/.DELTA.), or a 3-base-pair substitution mismatch (TGA/GAA) were tested. A/C, G/T, G/A, G/G, and T/.DELTA. mismatches were repaired with significantly greater efficiencies than C/C, A/A, T/T, and TGA/GAA. T/C was repaired with an intermediate efficiency. The frequencies of products obtained with G/G, G/A, and T/.DELTA. mismatches suggested modest inequality of repair in the two possible directions. Strains carrying the repair-deficient pms1-1 mutation were also tested. The efficiencies of repair of A/C, G/T, G/G, and A/A mismatches were reduced in pms1-1 cells compared with wild-type cells.

Using discrete choice experiments that mimic the real-world user experience of Google Maps' eco-route implementation, we show how different presentations of just-in-time information lead to stark differences in eco-route adoption and consumers' willingness to incur longer travel times to save emissions.

The CEC2013 test function is used to assess the improved KSO's performance and compared to 11 well-known optimization algorithms. BKSO performs better in statistical results and convergence curves. At the same time, BKSO achieves better fuel costs and fewer pollution emissions by testing with four real CEED cases, and the Pareto solution obtained is also better than other MAs. Based on the experimental results, BKSO has better performance than other comparable MAs and can provide more economical, robust, and cleaner solutions to CEED problems.",Not About Sufficiency
Level of Inequality and Welfare Change Across Vulnerable Groups in Emerging Regional States of Ethiopia: The Atkinson-Gini Social Welfare Analysis,"Economic growth in Ethiopia, particularly in developing regions, would follow fair income distributions and lower inequality that cannot affect social welfare. In line with the adopted pro-poor fiscal policies since 1995-96, the study looked at how price, tax reforms, and income growth affected social welfare. The study used survey data from the Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency by applying the Atkinson-Gini Index to estimate the level of inequality and social welfare of vulnerable groups. From the analysis, Ethiopia's economic growth was inflationary growth dominate. Price rises increased inequality and reduced consumption than tax reform. The findings invalidated the aim of income growth to mitigate the inflationary impact on welfare increase. Finally, the study found that providing social welfare support to these groups did not increase their ability to withstand the risks of declining welfare. Thus, the study recommended that income redistribution measures aided by pro-poor policies be implemented with caution.",Not About Sufficiency
"CLIMATE CHANGE, FRAGMENTATION, AND THE CHALLENGES OF GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW: ELEMENTS OF A POST-COPENHAGEN ASSEMBLAGE","The 2009 United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen has been widely viewed as a failure-a referendum in the eyes of many on the top-down, comprehensive approach to climate governance embodied in the Kyoto Protocol and carried forward in efforts to negotiate a successor regime. Despite a modest agreement on future work toward a new agreement, the most recent climate meeting in Cancun Mexico reinforces this view, underscoring the conclusion that Copenhagen represents an important inflection point for international climate policy. Although much of the post-Copenhagen commentary has correctly identified various problems, even fatal flaws, with the process, very little has been particularly helpful in marking out a constructive way forward. This Article takes some steps in that direction, offering a partial re-conceptualization of the nature and possibilities of global climate governance in the post-Copenhagen era. It starts from the premise that any realistic approach to climate governance must begin with the facts of globalization, legal pluralism, and fragmentation rather than the view that climate change is a particular kind of global problem that can only be solved through a top-down, supra-national regime aimed at managing the Earth system. As argued here, this ""Earth systems governance"" approach to the climate change problem, which derives from radically enhanced scientific and technical ways of understanding global environmental change and a particularly narrow view of collective action, has become deeply embedded as a basic objective of climate policy. The resulting logic of global environmental managerialism, however, is very much at odds with the plural, fragmented nature of the international legal and political order-a fact well illustrated by the limited results coming out of the recent climate meetings in Copenhagen and Cancun as well as the near total disarray that marks the current climate policy discourse in the United States and other major emitting countries. In contrast, an alternative, post-Copenhagen approach to the problem of climate governance that starts with the facts of globalization and its implications for law and legal order trains attention to new and different, and much messier, ways of coordinating efforts across jurisdictions and building enabling environments for collective action. This Article maps several key elements of post-Copenhagen climate governance through an analysis of efforts to bring reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (""REDD"") into climate policy. Although deforestation, nearly all of which occurs in the tropics, accounts for some fifteen percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, it has only recently become a major focus of climate policy, emerging as one of the few areas of consensus in the international climate negotiations. As a new paradigm for land use that implicates multiple legal and institutional orders at multiple levels, the REDD experience illustrates both the opportunities and the challenges of constructing climate governance through the complex articulation between distinctively global projects and particular national and sub-national institutions. Approaching climate governance from this perspective provides a basis for some more general claims regarding the possibilities of global environmental law in the context of a plural, fragmented international legal order.",Not About Sufficiency
Options to improve the carbon balance of the harvested wood products sector in four EU countries,"Harvested wood products (HWP) may contribute to climate change mitigation by storing carbon and by replacing energy-intensive materials and fossil energy, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, when assessing improved HWP utilisations, interactions between wood use pathways, the carbon stock dynamics, and the resulting effect on the GHG balance are still not well-understood. This research aims to assess the carbon sequestration effects of alternative wood product utilisations in four European Union (EU) countries. We conducted a material flow analysis of wood uses in France, Finland, Germany, and Spain for 2017 taking into account national production, imports, and exports. Then, we quantified the future dynamics of carbon stock in the HWP through time, assuming the same as in 2017 input and ignoring the forest sink. We then ran six alternative scenarios: two energy-focused (Energy, Energy+), two material-focused (Cascading, Material), one with extended half-life of the wood products (HL) and one as business as usual. For the simulation period (2020-2050), the material scenario leads to the highest mitigation benefits with a cumulative HWP net CO2 removals of -502 Mt CO(2 )for Germany, -290 Mt CO2 for France, -118 Mt CO(2 )for Spain, and -116 Mt CO2 for Finland over the 30 years. The Energy+ scenario with an increase in wood usage for bioenergy generates a loss of the HWP pool of 351, 80, 77, and 6 Mt CO2 for the same countries, not accounting for energy substitution effects. Overall, our results suggest that the HWP carbon stock can be increased in the short-medium term by prioritizing the use of wood for material purposes, while maintaining constant harvest. The HWP mitigation potential differed greatly according to national wood industry characteristics. Hence, tailoring the HWP mitigation strategies to the specific characteristics of the national wood chain would enhance the HWP climate benefits.",Not About Sufficiency

The appeasement effect of a United Nations climate summit on the German public,"The annual UN climate summits receive intense global media coverage(1-3), and as such could engage local publics around the world, stimulate debate and knowledge about climate politics, and, ultimately, mobilize people to combat climate change. Herewe showthat, in contrast to these hopes, although the German public were exposed to news about the 2015 Paris summit, they did not engage with it in a more active way. Comparing knowledge and attitudes before, during and after the summit using a three-wave online panel survey (quota sample, N = 1,121), we find that respondents learnt a few basic facts about the conference but they continue to lack basic background knowledge about climate policy. Trust in global climate policy increased a little, but citizens were less inclined to support a leading role for Germany in climate politics. Moreover, they were not more likely to engage personally in climate protection. These results suggest that this global media event had a modest appeasing rather than mobilizing effect.",Not About Sufficiency
"Building Resilient, Smart Communities in a Post-COVID Era: Insights From Ireland","The COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly throughout the world in early 2020. Beyond the substantial health impacts, the crisis has served as a catalyst for a dramatic shift in working practices, a greater reliance on technology, and a subsequent reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in the most heavily populated parts of the planet. Indeed, the crisis has highlighted the interconnected nature of society's vulnerabilities while also demonstrating that transformational change is possible. These rapid changes have ignited debate around how to build more resilient societies and the role of planning in promoting equitable and sustainable recovery. This article presents key insights from Ireland, as policymakers grapple with these questions and the role of technology in ensuring ongoing delivery of services and a continuation of democratic processes. Specifically, this short article focuses on the impact of the pandemic on town centres and regional growth in Ireland and the potential interventions which can aid in addressing recently intensified local challenges.",Not About Sufficiency

We argue in favour of a holistic view to initiate a socio-economic transition to improve the prospects for global sustainability and human well-being. Alternative approaches to ""Business-As-Usual"" for guiding the transition are already available for implementation. Yet, to ensure a successful and just transition, we need to change our priorities towards environmental integrity and well-being.

Comparison of Point Intercept and Image Analysis for Monitoring Rangeland Transects,"There is global recognition that sustainable land use requires monitoring that will detect change on a scale that protects the resource. That fundamental necessity is threatened where labor-intensive methods and high labor costs cause sampling deficiencies and increased Type-II error rates (false negatives). Ground-based imaging is a monitoring method that reduces monitoring labor costs. Nadir (vertical) images acquired with common digital cameras can be manually analyzed for cover using free software. We used an innovative field protocol to acquire standardized, freehand, nadir images (samples) of rangeland, then compared point intercept (PI) and image-analysis techniques. Between methods, precision (repeatability) across users was equivalent; cover measurements were often different, and the image-analysis technique took only a third as long to complete. Image analysis has several advantages over PI besides the reduced labor cost: Images are permanent resource records available for reanalysis if data are questioned, if software improves, or if management objectives change; and image analysis is less biased by moving vegetation, moving pointing devices, and bright vegetation color.",Not About Sufficiency
Unaccounted CO2 leaks downstream of a large tropical reservoir,"Recent studies show that tropical hydroelectric reservoirs may be responsible for substantial greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, yet emissions from the surface of released water downstream of the dam are poorly characterized if not neglected entirely from most assessments. We found that carbon dioxide (CO2) emission downstream of Kariba Dam (southern Africa) varied widely over different timescales and that accounting for downstream emissions and their fluctuations is critically important to the reservoir carbon budget. Seasonal variation was driven by reservoir stratification and the accumulation of CO2 in hypolimnetic waters, while subdaily variation was driven by hydropeaking events caused by dam operation in response to daily electricity demand. This ""carbopeaking"" resulted in hourly variations of CO2 emission up to 200% during stratification. Failing to account for seasonal or subdaily variations in downstream carbon emissions could lead to errors of up to 90% when estimating the reservoir's annual emissions. These results demonstrate the critical need to include both limnological seasonality and dam operation at subdaily time steps in the assessment of carbon budgeting of reservoirs and carbon cycling along the aquatic continuum.",Not About Sufficiency
Current state of biogas and biomethane production and its implications for Spain,"In recent years, Europe has tightened legislation to combat climate change. The new targets proposed by the different legal instruments include the European Green Deal, Directives RED I and RED II on renewable energies, 'Clean Energy for all Europeans' package, and the recently approved RepowerEU Plan, where the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and the promotion of renewable gases to be less energy-dependant are the focus of all the measures proposed. The adoption of these legal measures in Spain lags behind other countries and some financial aspects are underdeveloped. However, it is worth highlighting the measures that have been approved promote the development of projects in favour of biomethane and other renewable gases and measures to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. This study reviews the available information published in literature and discuss the current situation of biogas and biomethane production in Spain. Biomethane is a clean fuel alternative, which allows value addition to waste from numerous sources, such as landfills, agriculture, and sewage sludge. Spain has potential to produce biomass up to 163 TW h per year with important variations between regions. However, currently, it only has 146 biogas plants in operation (2.74 TW h per year) and 6 are producing biomethane, although a great number of projects are underway for the construction of new biomethane plants. The ability to address the obstacles that presently prevent the building of additional facilities will determine how well biomethane development proceeds in our nation.",Not About Sufficiency
Geomatics and bioenergy feasibility assessments: Taking stock and looking forward,"Renewable energy resources are spatially distributed, and their potential to contribute to societal energy supplies is dependent on local geographic nuances. To provide relevant and robust baseline information, these spatial qualities must be considered when assessing resource availability or technology performance. This is the impetus behind the application of geomatics in the field of renewable energy. Given that each renewable energy source option has unique geographic qualities, a one-size-fits-all analytical approach is not possible. It is thus important to examine how the geographic qualities of specific renewable energy options are managed in the methodological approaches that are used to assess them. To this end, this paper reviews the ways in which geomatics has been used to provide geographic information about bioenergy feasibility, and to solve fundamental bioenergy measurement problems in terms of distinguishing actual from potential feedstock, quantifying multiple biomass supply options, and assessing the scope of conversion platforms. Particular attention is given to data quality, the commensurability of data models and the energy sources they attempt to visualize and analyze, the methods used for facility location decisions, and the capacity to perform site-specific analyses of technology performance. The paper also discusses the ways that the 'static' nature of geographic information can be overcome to take seriously the temporal issues that are related to bioenergy feasibility. Moving forward, bioenergy assessments must begin with a comprehensive resource assessment and consider a range of conversion options. This baseline information will enable bioenergy to be taken seriously in energy investment decisions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Can urban low-carbon transitions promote enterprise digital transformation?,"To address the escalating environmental issues and foster the progress of green development, the Chinese government has initiated the low-carbon city pilot (LCCP) policy since 2010. Assessing the effects of this extensive and multifaceted environmental policy holds substantial theoretical and practical significance, particularly in terms of scrutinizing its impact on enterprise digital transformation (EDT). This study uses the LCCP as a quasi-natural experiment, utilizing the data obtained from Chinese listed companies spanning from 2007 to 2019, and empirically discovers that the LCCP can indeed stimulate enterprises to implement digital transformation strategies. After undergoing a series of robustness checks, including placebo tests and the instrumental variable method, the result obtained was still strongly supported. Heterogeneity tests reveal that the aforementioned conclusion is more typical for samples of non-state-owned and high-tech enterprises. A further mechanistic analysis indicates that the LCCP promotes EDT through two channels: encouraging enterprises to increase R&D expenditure and focusing on improving the resource allocation efficiency. This research, based on the empirical data obtained from China, enriches our understanding of the economic consequences of employing environmental regulations, and also offers valuable insights for other nations into formulating urban emission reduction measures to reap more policy benefits.",Not About Sufficiency
Asymmetric variation in DNA methylation during domestication and de-domestication of rice,"Hundreds of plant species have been domesticated to feed human civilization, while some crops have undergone de-domestication into agricultural weeds, threatening global food security. To understand the genetic and epigenetic basis of crop domestication and de-domestication, we generated DNA methylomes from 95 accessions of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon L.), cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) and weedy rice (O. sativa f. spontanea). We detected a significant decrease in DNA methylation over the course of rice domestication but observed an unexpected increase in DNA methylation through de-domestication. Notably, DNA methylation changes occurred in distinct genomic regions for these 2 opposite stages. Variation in DNA methylation altered the expression of nearby and distal genes through affecting chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, and the formation of chromatin loops, which may contribute to morphological changes during domestication and de-domestication of rice. These insights into population epigenomics underlying rice domestication and de-domestication provide resources and tools for epigenetic breeding and sustainable agriculture.

"Use, Potential, Needs, and Limits of AI in Wastewater Treatment Applications","Artificial intelligence (AI) uses highly powerful computers to mimic human intelligent behavior; it is a major research hotspot in science and technology, with an increasing number of applications to a wider range of fields, including complex process supervision and control. Wastewater treatment is an example of a complex process involving many uncertainties and external factors to achieve a final product with specific requisites (effluents with prescribed quality). Reducing process energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and resources recovery are additional requirements of these facilities' operation. AI could extend the purpose and the expected results of previously adopted tools and present operational approaches by leveraging superior simulation, prediction, control, and adaptation capabilities. This paper reviews current AI research in the wastewater field and discusses present achievements and potentials. So far, almost all applications in the sector involve predictive studies, often at a small scale or with limited data use. Frontline research aimed at the creation of AI-supported digital twins of real systems is being conducted, with few encouraging but still limited applications.

Capturing landscape values in peri-urban Satoyama forests: Diversity of visitors' perceptions and implications for future value assessments,"Peri-urban Satoyama forests in Japan provide multiple or bundles of cultural ecosystem services (CES), yet, visitors' perceptions of CES are not well established. There is a need to explore these perceptions in order to provide comprehensive information to forest managers. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by exploring the profiles of visitors of peri-urban Satoyama forests and their perceived importance of CES using a landscape value (LV) typology table. Nine LVs of Kaisho Forest in Aichi, Japan were assessed using face-to-face questionnaires on socio-demographic variables, forest use, and a photograph-based approach, which were analyzed using descriptive statistics, quantitative cross-tabulation, multiple response analyses, and geocoding. Results showed that the forest is visited mostly by married elderly people from Aichi Prefecture who were engaged in forest bathing or birdwatching. Forest use patterns, like frequency, duration of the visit, and group size, presented a significant relation to demographic variables, like marital status or gender. Furthermore, the study showed how visitors ' LV perceptions were weighted towards natural and aesthetic values. The sociocultural Satoyama forest elements displayed a more detailed value perception where recreational, therapeutic, spiritual, cultural-historic, and educational values were also assigned. The LV perception enhances a comprehensive description of the perceived positive effects of visiting such forests. Hence, we concluded that visitors gain positive effects on mental and emotional health and spirituality as part of CES.

"Carbon dynamics of paper, engineered wood products and bamboo in landfills: evidence from reactor studies","Background: There has been growing interest in the development of waste-specific decay factors for estimation of greenhouse gas emissions from landfills in national greenhouse gas inventories. Although engineered wood products (EWPs) and paper represent a substantial component of the solid waste stream, there is limited information available on their carbon dynamics in landfills. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of carbon loss for EWPs and paper products commonly used in Australia. Experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions designed to simulate optimal anaerobic biodegradation in a landfill. Results: Methane generation rates over incubations of 307-677 days ranged from zero for medium-density fibreboard (MDF) to 326 mL CH4 g(-1) for copy paper. Carbon losses for particleboard and MDF ranged from 0.7 to 1.6%, consistent with previous estimates. Carbon loss for the exterior wall panel product (2.8%) was consistent with the expected value for blackbutt, the main wood type used in its manufacture. Carbon loss for bamboo (11.4%) was significantly higher than for EWPs. Carbon losses for the three types of copy paper tested ranged from 72.4 to 82.5%, and were significantly higher than for cardboard (27.3-43.8%). Cardboard that had been buried in landfill for 20 years had a carbon loss of 27.3%-indicating that environmental conditions in the landfill did not support complete decomposition of the available carbon. Thus carbon losses for paper products as measured in bioreactors clearly overestimate those in actual landfills. Carbon losses, as estimated by gas generation, were on average lower than those derived by mass balance. The low carbon loss for particleboard and MDF is consistent with carbon loss for Australian wood types described in previous studies. A factor for carbon loss for combined EWPs and wood in landfills in Australia of 1.3% and for paper of 48% is proposed. Conclusions: The new suggested combined decay factor for wood and EWPs represents a significant reduction from the current factor used in the Australian greenhouse gas inventory; whereas the suggested decay factor for paper is similar to the current decay factor. Our results improve current understanding of the carbon dynamics of harvested wood products, and allow more refined estimates of methane emissions from landfills.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon Footprint of Semi-Mechanical Sago Starch Production,"Indonesia is the country with the greatest potential for sago in the world. This research is intended to determine the carbon footprint of sago starch produced from a semi-mechanical process.

Carbon reduction effect of ESG: empirical evidence from listed manufacturing companies in China,"Against the backdrop of global climate change, corporate carbon emissions have increasingly become a focal point, making carbon reduction by companies a pivotal issue. Based on data from Chinese listed manufacturing companies from 2010 to 2020, this paper explores the impact of ESG performance on carbon reduction. The results indicate that ESG performance significantly reduce corporate carbon emissions. Green technology innovation, corporate efficiency, and managerial short-sightedness are vital channels through which ESG promotes corporate carbon reduction. For companies with different environmental regulations, industry competition intensities, and capital intensities, the relationship between ESG performance and carbon reduction varies significantly. Notably, we found that in companies with strict environmental regulations, intense industry competition, and high capital intensity, the carbon-reducing effect of ESG performance is more pronounced. Furthermore, digital transformation positively moderates the relationship between ESG performance and carbon reduction. This study not only provides new empirical evidence for understanding the impact of ESG performance on carbon reduction but also offers valuable insights for businesses and policymakers to promote corporate efforts in carbon reduction and achieve China's ""Dual Carbon"" goals.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon sequestration potential in domestic sewage treatment plants of Indian cities,"Carbon sequestration is a new technology that is gaining importance in combating the harmful effects of global warming. The potential for carbon sequestration from domestic sewage treatment plants operating in India was studied.

By going in for carbon sequestration, domestic sewage treatment in India has a potential to be a carbon neutral sector with a capacity to store 22 thousand tonnes of CO2 every day at current levels. The Government of India's focus is on increasing the share of renewable energy sources to combat emissions; however, carbon sequestration technology would be an ideal solution for deployment over the time period required for renewable energy' share to become significant.

Urban digital twin-based solution using geospatial information for solid waste management,"With over 2 billion metric tons generated annually, global solid waste production has severe environmental consequences.

Carrying capacity in overwintering birds: when are spatial models needed?,"1. We sometimes need to predict the maximum number of bird-days that can be supported by the food supply in a site used by migratory birds outside the breeding season. So defined, carrying capacity is often estimated using the daily ration model (DRM). In this, the total biomass of accessible food, aggregated across all patches of differing food density, is divided by an individual's daily requirement. Carrying capacity can also be estimated using spatial depletion models (SDM), in which patches of differing food density are treated separately. We identify here some of the features of the food supply that enable patches to be amalgamated so that the very simple DRM can be used instead of a more complex SDM. 2. We show by theoretical modelling that the predictions of the DRM and SDM are often the same even though initial food density varies between patches. The wide range of conditions over which this is so are specified. 3. A DRM and a SDM of wildfowl eating seagrass Zostera spp. in a nature reserve produced similar predictions for the number of bird-days supported intertidally before the birds switched to farmland. 4. We conclude that a DRM can often be used instead of a SDM to predict bird-day carrying capacity. We identified two conditions in which the DRM cannot be used: (i) when the rate of additional food loss due to factors other than depletion by the birds themselves differs between patches; and (ii) when the relative profitabilities of patches, and thus the number of birds using each patch, change through the depletion period in non-simple ways that cannot be predicted without a SDM. Examples of such exceptions are described. 5. Synthesis and applications. By showing when a DRM can be used instead of a SDM, this study should help nature managers to predict the bird-day carrying capacity of a site in the simplest way yet available. However, predicting the maximum number of bird-days supported is not equivalent to predicting demographic rates and should not be confused with predictions for population size. Rather, it is probably best regarded as a measure of site quality.",Not About Sufficiency
The Case for Increasing the Global Capacity for Waste to Energy (WTE),"Recent efforts to generate renewable energy on a local scale and distributed basis have resulted in renewed interest in converting municipal solid waste (MSW) to energy. In addition, U.S. MSW generation has increased from about 1.1 tons per capita in 1990 to 1.3 tons in 2002, and worldwide, MSW generation is projected to double by 2030. Furthermore, many countries have established very strict limits on materials suitable for landfilling such as completely banning organic material from entering landfills. Typical MSW contains approximately 2800 kWh of heating content and is capable of yielding nearly 700 kWh of electricity in modern waste to energy (WTE) facilities. The composition of MSW has been demonstrated to be about 66% biogenic, thus today's modern WTE facilities avoid 30 million tons per year of CO2 equivalent by avoiding CO2 from fossil fuel power plants and methane from landfills. Finally, research data shows that regions employing WTE facilities have a higher recycling rate. Therefore, increasing the usage of WTE facilities worldwide has the potential to satisfy a large part of the global energy demand while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing a safe waste disposal option. This paper will describe the current situation worldwide with some focus on the U.S. Some description and discussion on the dominant technology, mass burn, as well as other next generation technologies will be included. While all WTE emissions are well below regulations, particular emphasis will be placed on emission reduction schemes and potential for future advancement such as optimal pre-shredding, oxygen enhancement and conversion of MSW to fuels.",Not About Sufficiency
CDM potential of windmill pumps in India,"Purpose - The clean development mechanism (CDM) provides industrialized countries with an incentive to invest in emission reduction projects in developing countries to achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions at lowest cost that also promotes sustainable development in the host country. Windmill pumps could be of interest under the CDM because they directly displace greenhouse gas emissions while contributing to sustainable rural development. This study aims to assess the maximum theoretical as well as the realistically achievable CDM potential of windmill pumps in India. Design/methodology/approach - To estimate the CDM potential of windmill pumps in case of electricity replacement (by the substitution of electric motor pumps) regional baseline(s) has been used whereas in case of diesel replacement (by the substitution of diesel engine pumps) the IPCC emission factor(s) has been used. The authors have analyzed the financial feasibility of five designs of windmill pumps at ten select locations in India to justify the financial additionality of windmill pump-based CDM projects. To analyze the future dissemination levels of windmill pumps logistic growth model has been used. Findings - The annual CO2 emissions mitigation potential through windmill pumps in India could theoretically reach five million tones. Under more realistic assumptions about diffusion of windmill pumps based on past experiences with the government-run programmes, annual CER volumes by 2012 could reach 13,000-46,000 and 0.07-0.3 million by 2020. This would require that the government sets the subsidy level for windmill pumps at a level that allows them to become viable with the CER revenue. From a macro-economic point of view, this makes sense if the sustainability benefits are deemed sufficiently high to warrant promotion of this project type. Originality/value - The paper illustrates the vast theoretical potential of CO2 mitigation by using windmill pumps for irrigation water pumping in India.",Not About Sufficiency
Changing behavior while having climate change in mind? An investigation of social-psychological predictors for specific pro-environmental behaviors in the energy domain,"Social scientists and psychologists who study environmental issues need to improve their measures to capture relevant pro-environmental behaviors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - the main driver of climate change. They also need to identify meaningful predictors for these behaviors, which go beyond mere statistical significance. In this large representative study of the Austrian population (N = 1,083), we aim at addressing both issues. We focus on relevant and specific energy-related behavioral intentions (traveling, electricity consumption and heating) and test a set of preregistered social-psychological predictors in path models, followed by an exploratory machine-learning approach. We show that a combination of some prominent predictors - perceived behavior control, consideration of future and immediate consequences, and willingness to sacrifice - accounts for only 20 to 30% of variance in behavioral intentions. We suggest that future studies confirm our results in other cultures and set even higher qualitative benchmarks for measures and predictors.",Not About Sufficiency
Changing relationships between land use and environmental characteristics and their consequences for spatially explicit land-use change prediction,"Spatially explicit land-use change prediction is often based on environmental characteristics of land-use types, such as soil type and slope, as observed at one time instant.

We argue that such temporal stationarity is uncommon in many land-use systems, and we demonstrate by means of a case study how this may affect the performance of land-use change inference. For this purpose, the spatial distribution of cropland and uncultivated land in Mediterranean Europe in 2000 was studied, as well as recent land-use changes from cropland to uncultivated land and vice versa between 1990 and 2000. Both land-use and land-use change frequencies were captured in regression equations that related them to environmental characteristics. A comparison between these two regression types suggests that many traditional constraints (slope, soil quality, accessibility) have become less important, while climatic variables have gained importance. These results can be explained by lower costs of constraints due to technological and economic developments, and by changes in relative average revenues of different land uses.",Not About Sufficiency
"Characterizing Sockeye Salmon Smolt Interactions with a Hydrokinetic Turbine in the Kvichak River, Alaska","The development of hydrokinetic turbines has been motivated by the desire to reduce fossil fuel reliance, energy production costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. Detailed information about fish interactions with hydrokinetic turbines is limited; therefore, this study sought to characterize the interactions between a turbine (RivGen; Ocean Renewable Power Company) and Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka from one of the most productive populations in the world-that in the Kvichak River, Alaska. By viewing real-time video imagery, our objectives were to quantify the number of Sockeye Salmon smolts that interacted with the turbine and to assess the behaviors/outcomes of these interactions during the species' smolt out-migration. From May 21 to June 10, 2021, a total of 2,374 Sockeye Salmon smolts passed through the field of view of cameras placed immediately downstream of the hydrokinetic turbine. The majority of these observed events occurred over a short (5-d) time period from late May to early June during periods of darkness (0000-0400 hours). Fish were observed passing through the hydrokinetic turbine in both normal and disoriented manners, with the rotational status/speed of the hydrokinetic turbine appearing to influence passage behavior. Blade strikes on fish were also observed, all of which occurred when the turbine was rotating at high ""production"" speeds. After temporally and spatially extrapolating the observed fish interactions to account for our subsampling, the results suggest that when monitoring was conducted, the hydrokinetic turbine interacted with approximately 200,000 Sockeye Salmon smolts during this species' smolt out-migration period. This study adds to the sparse knowledge base on fish interactions with emerging riverine hydrokinetic devices and may inform strategies to mitigate the impacts of developing energy projects on socially and culturally important fisheries.",Not About Sufficiency

The case analysed will be the art scene of the city of Malmo, its policies and metrological devices, with a focus on one community theatre project as an exemplary case. The metrologies, we claim, are the ways in which the policy apparatus opens up to larger concerns of what Michel Foucault calls dispositifs, linking art policy to other policy changes and societal concerns in general, and making art respond to those concerns in managed ways.",Not About Sufficiency
Measuring Eco-Inefficiency: A New Frontier Approach,"Growing social concerns over the environmental externalities associated with business activities are pushing firms to identify activities that create economic value with less environmental impact and to become more eco-efficient. Over the past two decades, researchers have increasingly used frontier efficiency models to evaluate productive efficiency in the presence of undesirable outputs, such as greenhouse gas emissions or toxic emissions. In this paper, we identify critical flaws in existing frontier models and show that these models can identify eco-inefficient firms as eco-efficient. We develop a new eco-inefficiency frontier model that rectifies these problems. Our model calculates an eco-inefficiency score for each firm and improvements in outputs necessary to attain eco-efficiency. We demonstrate through a Monte Carlo experiment that our eco-inefficiency model provides a more reliable measurement of corporate eco-inefficiency than the existing frontier models. We also extend the single-output Cobb-Douglas production function to multiple desirable and undesirable outputs. This extension allows for greater flexibility in the simulation analysis of frontier models.",Not About Sufficiency
Achieve a low carbon supply chain through product mix,"Purpose - In the era of climate change, industrial organizations are under increasing pressure from consumers and regulators to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of product mix as a strategy to deliver the low carbon supply chain under the cap-and-trade policy. Design/methodology/approach - The authors incorporate the cap-and-trade policy into the green product mix decisionmodels by using game-theoretic approach and compare these decisions in a decentralizedmodel and a centralized model, respectively. The research explores potential behavioral changes under the cap-and-trade in the context of a two-echelon supply chain. Findings - The analysis results show that the channel structure has significant impact on both economic and environmental performances. An integrated supply chain generates more profits. In contrast, a decentralized supply chain has lower carbon emissions. The cap-and-trade policy makes a different impact on the economic and environmental performances of the supply chain. Balancing the trade-offs is critical to ensure the long-term sustainability. Originality/value - The research offers many interesting observations with respect to the effect of product mix strategy on operational decisions and the trade-offs between costs and carbon emissions under the cap-and-trade policy. The insights derived from the analysis not only help firms to make important operational and strategic decisions to reduce carbon emissions while maintaining their economic competitiveness, but also make meaningful contribution to governments' policy making for carbon emissions control.",Not About Sufficiency
In-situ Self-transformation Synthesis of N-doped Carbon Coating Paragenetic Anatase/Rutile Heterostructure with Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Activity,"Photocatalytic CO2 reduction can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and convert CO2 into value-added chemical feedstocks and fuels. P25 is one of the most popular photocatalyst, but its high photoinduced charge recombination rate and low CO2 adsorption ability hinder its application in photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to the limited anatase/rutile interface and small specific surface area. Herein, a paragenetic anatase/rutile interface is in-situ formed in one crystal grain via calcination of NH2-MIL-125 in argon atmosphere and the obtained N doped porous carbon layer endows its high specific surface area. The in situ XRD and HRTEM characterization proved the anatase/rutile interface is in situ formed by the phase transformation from anatase (211) plane to rutile (211) plane. The charge separation efficiency of the photocatalyst with N-doped carbon coating paragenetic heterostructure is proved to be enhanced compared with N-doped carbon coating anatase or rutile single phase catalyst. The optimized catalyst S-750Ar with paragenetic anatase/rutile structure shows a 7.6 folds enhanced CO conversion rate than that of P25. These findings provide an in-situ self-transition strategy to regulate charge transfer between phases at the interface and promote the application of heterogeneous catalysts.",Not About Sufficiency
Mineral dissolution and pore alteration of coal induced by interactions with supercritical CO2,"CO2 injection into coal seams can not only enhance the recovery of coalbed methane, but also achieve the goal of CO2 geological sequestration, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 is likely to be stored in the form of supercritical state, when the burial depth of coal seams exceeds 800 m. However, the existing knowledge is still lacking regarding how supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) reacts with coal. In this work, alterations of pore structure and mineral compositions induced by SC-CO2 interactions have been explored. The results show that coal pore volume and porosity are greatly increased after SC-CO2 interactions, which contributes to the increase of gas adsorption. A comparison of pore fractal dimension has been made between raw coal and treated samples, suggesting that SC-CO2 interaction can enhance pore roughness and structure complexity. XRD analysis indicates that mineral content within coal is remarkably changed after SC-CO2 saturation. Carbonate minerals are sensitive to SC-CO2 fluids, and mineral consumption plays a key role in pore alterations. There are multiple effects of SC-CO2 fluids on both mineral compositions and pore distribution. Mineral dissolution, differential swelling, hydrocarbon extraction and migration account for the variations of coal microstructures and mineral content. The increase in pore volume and structure complexity of coal seams after interaction is quite favorable for CO2 adsorption and storage. This result provides powerful support for CO2 geological sequestration and CO2-ECBM. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Land Use Optimization Embedding in Ecological Suitability in the Embryonic Urban Agglomeration,"Healthy and sustainable urban agglomerations development relies heavily on land use optimization. However, there is insufficient scientific basis and reliable quantitative analysis for land use pattern identification and optimal prediction in embryonic urban agglomeration. Therefore, taking the Lanzhou-Xining (LX) region, a typical primary developing urban agglomeration, as the study area, we first assessed the land ecological suitability (LES). Then, we embedded the LES evaluation results in the land optimization process and constructed the MCR-MOP- Dyna-CLUE model framework, simulating and optimizing land use patterns for the year 2035 under ecological optimization and business as usual scenarios, which aimed to explore a sustainable land use pattern for embryonic urban agglomerations. The results indicated that the ecological optimization scenario based on LES had a more rational land use pattern. It appropriately controlled the expansion rate of construction land and effectively alleviated the problems of construction land encroaching on farming land and ecological land. Meanwhile, the ecosystem services increased in value based on adequately addressing the need for food security and economic development. Compared to the business as usual scenario, the construction land under the ecological optimization scenario was 19,622.69 ha less, and the cultivated land was 32,103.29 ha more. Moreover, the ecological benefit and the economic benefit increased by 187,490.4595 million yuan and 151,808,605.1 million yuan from 2020 to 2035, respectively, under the ecological optimization scenario.

A critical comparison of LCA calculation models for the power lithium-ion battery in electric vehicles during use-phase,"Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly prevalent as an effective solution to reduce resource scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions. As the core component of electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a crucial role in energy storage and conversion. When LIBs are used in long-term service, it is essential to carefully consider the impact of modeling methods on both the environmental benefits and burdens associated with their usage. In this study, eight calculation models are chosen, and multiple environmental impacts of battery usephase are compared based on life cycle assessment. The application of different computational models produced widely varying results, and previous conclusions regarding the environmental impacts of battery usage need to be revisited. Moreover, the different models during the battery use-phase exhibits an outstanding contribution to the life cycle carbon footprint and midpoint indicators. Sensitivity analysis reveals that battery efficiency is the most sensitive parameter to environmental indicators during use. Environmental impacts during the battery use-phase should consider the characteristics of different models to ensure the reliability and comparability of the study.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon emission controls and optimal carbon related regulation in oligopoly: Examination of policy effects on competitiveness and entry deterrence,"Carbon related taxation is viewed as a cost-effective price instrument to charge for greenhouse gas emissions, creating certainty costs for economic agents. The costs will naturally influence the market competitiveness. In this paper, we propose the concept of an equivalent emission standard (EES) tax as a complement to traditional standards, linking the tax rate to the abatement cost for firms under the optimal carbon emission standard and providing tax revenue for the government. To study the optimal carbon related regulation mode and the relevant impacts in oligopoly, we compare four potential carbon related regulations: an emission tax (an emission approach tax), a carbon tax (a fuel approach tax), an emission standard and an EES tax. Incorporating a sequential game analysis, we show that policy effects are relevant to the magnitude of carbon pollution and the abatement cost in the short term. In general, the optimal levels of social welfare under emission tax and carbon tax modes are the same. Notably, the EES tax system can not only generate tax revenue but also has a relatively moderate impact on social welfare. If the social damage resulting from carbon emissions is large, the EES tax system will be comparatively more beneficial to society, but the advantage is limited in terms of the relevant abatement cost. In the long term, under certain conditions, excessive firm entry may occur. As a result, carbon related regulation can be an indirect instrument of entry deterrence in the market.",Not About Sufficiency
Does energy-consuming right trading policy achieve a low-carbon transition of the energy structure? A quasi-natural experiment from China,"Introduction The implementation of energy-consuming right trading (ECRT) policy in 2017 is a major measure to promote the construction of ecological civilization and green development, which also aligns with the global trend towards sustainable energy management and carbon emission reduction.Methods Based on energy consumption data in China from 2010 to 2021, this paper utilizes the Difference-in-Differences (DID) method to assess the extent and process of the impact of energy consuming right trading policy on the low-carbon transition of the energy structure. The transmission mechanism of industrial structure upgrading and the new-quality productive forces in the impact process was discussed, and the regulatory role of environmental regulations was tested.Results The findings indicate: 1) ECRT has a strong driving effect on the low-carbon transition of the energy structure. 2) ECRT can promote low-carbon transition of the energy structure through the dual channel of promoting industrial structure upgrading and new quality productive forces. 3) The influence of ECRT on the low-carbon transition of the energy structure is different in different regions, and the higher degree of industrial agglomeration and renewable energy-rich regions are more significantly promoted by new quality productivity. 4) Environmental regulation has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between ECRT and low-carbon transition of the energy structure. 5) Furthermore, the exploratory analysis reveals that the positive impacts of ECRT policies on the low-carbon Transition of the energy structure translates into higher green total factor productivity and lower environmental pollution, which promotes the sustainable development of the low-carbon Transition of the energy structure.Discussion This paper responds to the basic question of whether energy use rights policies can promote the low-carbon Transition of the energy structure, and provides empirical evidence and policy reference not only for the development of China's environmental policy and the direction of energy consumption but also for the international community's efforts in sustainable energy and environmental governance.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of human capital in China's economic development: Review and new evidence,"We carefully utilize empirical methods and measurement, and find that the effect of human capital on China's economic growth may be indirect through physical capital investment. This result is different than that found for OECD countries and has not been suggested by previous studies. In addition, in determining physical capital investment, workers with college education play a more significant role than those with primary and secondary education, suggesting the possibility of capital-skill complementarity. This finding has implications for China's future regional growth inequality: the inequality may increase rather than decrease, because physical capital investment continues to accumulate faster in the eastern area where the human capital stock is larger and thus leads to greater economic growth in the east.

An Evaluation Model of Quantitative and Qualitative Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Approach for Hydroelectric Plant Location Selection,"Over the past few decades, Vietnam has been one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, experiencing a GDP growth rate of more than 6% per year. The energy industry plays an important role in Vietnam's continuous development, so access to reliable and low-cost energy sources will be an important factor for sustainable economic growth. Achieving the goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, as set out in the Paris agreement on climate change, will depend heavily on the development roadmap of emerging economies, such as Vietnam. Currently, developing hydroelectric plants is Vietnam's optimal choice in order to meet its target of renewable energy development. Hydroelectricity in Vietnam is favorable thanks to the high average annual rainfall, about 1800-2000 mm, and the dense river system, with more than 3450 systems. In addition to providing electricity, hydropower plants are also responsible for cutting and fighting floods for downstream areas in the rainy season, at the same time providing water for production and people's daily needs in the dry season. This work proposes the application of a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) model to select the best option for the installation of river hydroelectric plants in Vietnam. The use of MCDM techniques in environmental decision-making, including selecting between various alternatives, is important when this involves complex decisions in several disciplinary fields. The most widely used of these techniques are the fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). As a result, Nghe An (LOC05) is found to be the optimal solution for selecting river portions where hydroelectric plants are viable in Vietnam.",Not About Sufficiency

China energy-water nexus: Assessing the water-saving synergy effects of energy-saving policies during the eleventh Five-year Plan,"Energy and water have become major factors limiting sustainable development in China. Energy efficiency and optimization of water management are critical for the healthy growth of the Chinese economy, Current national energy policies fail to adequately address water use issues. Similarly, current water policies do not consider the impact of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, few studies have investigated the relationship between energy consumption and water use. The present study analyzes the energy-water nexus in Chinese industries using input-output tables. Coefficients that characterize the relationship between energy consumption and water are used to describe the supply-consumption relationship between the water supply and primary energy sectors. Next, we calculate the water-saving effects associated with the enforcement of energy-saving policies in selected industrial sectors during the eleventh Five-year Plan, from 2005 to 2010. These calculations address the ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, petrochemical engineering, building materials, and electricity industries as well as key light industries. Our findings indicate that energy-saving efforts in these industries will result in savings in water consumption. This study suggests that a cooperative relationship between water and energy conservation efforts should be an important factor in creating policies that encourage simultaneous savings of both resources. Additionally, the study indicates that government should promote water- and energy-saving techniques in key industrial sectors to encourage cooperative water and energy conservation.

China's Great Ascendancy and structural risks: consequences of asymmetric market liberalisation,"China's great ascendancy from a poor agrarian economy to an economic superpower is unprecedented. But in the process, structural imbalances, resource inefficiency, and income inequality worsened rapidly. It is argued that the coexistence of China's extraordinary growth and serious structural risks are two sides of the same coin: asymmetric liberalisation of product and factor markets. Distortions in markets for labour, capital, land, energy, and the environment lower production costs, increase corporate profits, raise investment returns, improve the international competitiveness of Chinese goods, and therefore lift China's growth. But they also depress consumption. China needs to accelerate factor market liberalisation in order to complete the transition to a market economy and to lock the economy onto a more sustainable path.",Not About Sufficiency
China's Pro-Poor Growth: Measurement and Implications,"Pro-poor growth has been the preeminent strategic framework of the international development community because it describes relationships between growth, inequality, and poverty. Assessing whether economic growth and income distributional changes are ""pro-poor"" has important policy implications and has become increasingly widespread in academic and policy societies. The article aims to measure the pro-poor growth in rural China from 1989 to 2009 through analyzing the household survey data collected by the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Among the main findings, from 1989 to 2006, China's economic growth in rural areas was relatively weakly pro-poor and poverty reduction mainly relied on the ""trickle-down effect"" of economic growth. However, since 2006, both the ""trickle-down effect"" of growth and changes in income distribution have reduced poverty. During this period, Chinese economic growth was pro-poor.

China's Recent Progresses in Polar Climate Change and Its Interactions with the Global Climate System,"During the recent four decades since 1980, a series of modern climate satellites were launched, allowing for the measurement and record-keeping of multiple climate parameters, especially over the polar regions where traditional observations are difficult to obtain. China has been actively engaging in polar expeditions. Many observations were conducted during this period, accompanied by improved Earth climate models, leading to a series of insightful understandings concerning Arctic and Antarctic climate changes. Here, we review the recent progress China has made concerning Arctic and Antarctic climate change research over the past decade. The Arctic temperature increase is much higher than the global-mean warming rate, associated with a rapid decline in sea ice, a phenomenon called the Arctic Amplification. The Antarctic climate changes showed a zonally asymmetric pattern over the past four decades, with most of the fastest changes occurring over West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. The Arctic and Antarctic climate changes were driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and ozone loss, while tropical-polar teleconnections play important roles in driving the regional climate changes and extreme events over the polar regions. Polar climate changes may also feedback to the entire Earth climate system. The adjustment of the circulation in both the troposphere and the stratosphere contributed to the interactions between the polar climate changes and lower latitudes. Climate change has also driven rapid Arctic and Southern ocean acidification. Chinese researchers have made a series of advances in understanding these processes, as reviewed in this paper.",Not About Sufficiency
Conflict heterogeneity in Africa,"The economic development literature widely concurs that conflicts have adverse economic consequences that contribute to poverty, disinvestment and lower human capital leading to widespread inequality and lower economic growth. As such, understanding the nature of conflict has been an important focus for political leaders, policymakers and researchers alike. However, the existing literature does not typically distinguish between the effects of conflict determinants on conflicts by type of actor or aggressor (i.e. state, group and civilian-based). Using panel data analysis for 46 African countries from 1997 to 2017, and a comprehensive geo-referenced Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) conflict dataset, we find evidence of variation in the determinants' effects on conflicts by actor types. For the full sample of countries, we find that military expenditure decreases civilian-based conflicts; globalisation increases both state- and civilian-based conflicts while state fragility increases group-based conflicts. On the other hand, income per capita increases all three types of conflicts. At regional level, we find variation in the effects of military expenditure and globalisation on state- and civilian-based conflicts. However, we find little variation in the effects of the determinants on group-based conflicts across the regions. The findings highlight the nuances in conflicts by actor types and their causes which need to be accounted for when formulating conflict resolution policies.",Not About Sufficiency

The study sample included community enterprise members, tourism entrepreneurs, community leaders, staff of the local administrative organization and officers from related government agencies in the Ratchaburi province. In this study, 400 participants completed the questionnaires and 40 participants were interviewed. Validity, reliability and discrimination were assessed to measure the quality of the research instrument.

The results showed that the most important factors affecting the participatory behavior of the stakeholders toward solid waste management were public mind, followed by problem perception of solid waste management, servant leadership, well-being and happiness. These variables accounted for 19 percent of the variance of participatory behavior of the stakeholders toward solid waste management. Happiness, wellbeing, public mind and servant leadership accounted for 43 percent of the variance of problem perception of solid waste management.

"Transportation policymaking in Beijing and Shanghai: Contributors, obstacles, and process","With continued motorization and urbanization in Chinese cities, there is a growing demand for innovative transportation policies at the city level to address the challenges of congestion, local air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Using Beijing and Shanghai as case studies, this paper draws on 32 in-depth semi-structured interviews with municipal government officials, academics, and transportation professionals to explore the city-level transportation policymaking process in Chinese megacities. Across the two cities, we identify three common contributors - policy learning, data informatization, and public opinion-and four obstacles-public complaint, unilateral decision-making, inadequate coordination among relevant departments, and lack of adaptiveness in policy implementation practice-to adopting timely and appropriate transportation policies. We then introduce a processual model that connects the contributors and obstacles identified within the flow of transportation policy among key actors in city-level government. This process shows how transportation policymaking in Chinese megacities is often reactive to public outcry over a transportation problem. This problem is investigated by a technical government research center that reports to the municipal transport committee. This committee then assesses public opinion and submits a policy recommendation to city government leadership, who make the final policy decision. Based on both case studies, we discuss potential recommendations for how to better enable transportation policymaking at the city level in China through more formalized processes of policy experimentation and public participation. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and areas of future research.",Not About Sufficiency
Envisioning the future of health systems: Exploratory insights from European countries,"European countries strive to provide people with a timely and appropriate access to care. Different models and approaches are implemented for this purpose. Whilst scholars have proposed various taxonomies to point out the peculiarities of health system types, little is known about patients' satisfaction with the health services provided by such systems. This prevents a vision of the future of health care. The article intends to fill this gap through an empirical analysis of secondary data collected from the Eurofound's database. Adhering to the taxonomy developed by Reibling and colleagues (2019), we investigated the performances of health systems types in terms of: 1) perceived quality of health services; 2) affordability of health care; 3) satisfaction with primary care; 4) satisfaction with secondary care; and 5) equity in the provision of care. Findings suggested that countries characterized by a thin access regulation and imposing a cost-sharing mechanism outperformed other health system types. Countries adopting a national health service scheme implying a strict access regulation and limited cost sharing were considered to be unfair. Health systems' economic and social sustainability relies on the policy makers' ability to stress the strengths of existing health system types, overcoming their weaknesses in terms of equitable and timely access to care. The future of health care will benefit from a contamination of existing health system types, which may lead to hybrid models able to merge fairness with financial sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Circular economy in construction - findings from a literature review,"The paper aims to enable a comprehensive definition for a Circular Economy (CE) that will support its effective introduction in the building and construction sectors. According to the European Commission (EC), the building sector in 2020 accounted for 40 % of the primary energy demand in the European Union (EU) and 37 % of its greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the sector can play a crucial role in decarbonisation and hence in achieving a zero-emissions future in response to climate change. A CE aims to harmonise economic growth with environmental protection and is based on the concept of closing the loop with minimal practical waste as in a natural ecosystem. The adoption of CE concepts is therefore seen as a feasible response to climate change through the deployment of more sustainable construction processes that significantly reduce the need for natural resources by maximising recycling and reuse. However, and despite the recognition of the potential of a CE in relation to sustainability issues, the adoption of a CE model within building and construction sectors is challenging because of the wide range of aspects and priorities which are reflected in the diversity of definition resulting in a narrow and limited adoption. There are currently many definitions of CEs as related to building and construction in the literature, creating confusion and preventing effective implementation. The study presented here intends, using a comprehensive literature review as its basis, to define the key domains of a CE on which to align a concise and accurate definition that will enable effective application in the building and construction sectors. The research also aims to identify current research gaps and barriers to contribute to the future of CE research in the building sector and thus drive the implementation of CE projects to mitigate the effects of climate change and support the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by laying the foundations for a novel and forward-looking approach to circularity based on properly established, defined and understood principles of CEs.",Not About Sufficiency
Classes and Castles: Impact of Social Stratification on Housing Inequality in Post-Socialist States,"Housing conditions form an important part of social stratification in many advanced industrial economies. The objective of this article is to determine the extent to which social stratification is linked to housing inequalities in the post-socialist Czech Republic; and how this relationship has evolved during the course of the economic transformation process. With the fall of socialism the country adopted a market economic system and the Czech society today has a higher level of social stratification and social stratification is similar to the patterns evident in advanced economies. Based on 'classical social stratification perspective' one would expect there to be a greater level of housing inequality and that changes in social stratification and housing inequality have exhibited a positive relationship. The evidence presented reveals that this relationship is too weak to fit with the main prediction of 'classical social stratification perspective'. However, the evidence also revealed that this situation is only a temporal result of unique state interventions that cannot be repeated due to the colossal cost or their unconstitutional nature in the future.",Not About Sufficiency
Classification of cryptocurrency coins and tokens by the dynamics of their market capitalizations,"We empirically verify that the market capitalizations of coins and tokens in the cryptocurrency universe follow power-law distributions with significantly different values for the tail exponent falling between 0.5 and 0.7 for coins, and between 1.0 and 1.3 for tokens. We provide a rationale for this, based on a simple proportional growth with birth and death model previously employed to describe the size distribution of firms, cities, webpages, etc. We empirically validate the model and its main predictions, in terms of proportional growth (Gibrat's Law) of the coins and tokens. Estimating the main parameters of the model, the theoretical predictions for the power-law exponents of coin and token distributions are in remarkable agreement with the empirical estimations, given the simplicity of the model. Our results clearly characterize coins as being 'entrenched incumbents' and tokens as an 'explosive immature ecosystem', largely due to massive and exuberant Initial Coin Offering activity in the token space. The theory predicts that the exponent for tokens should converge to 1 in the future, reflecting a more reasonable rate of new entrants associated with genuine technological innovations.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate Adaptation Heuristic Planning Support System (HPSS): Green-Blue Strategies to Support the Ecological Transition of Historic Centres,"The issue of climate has posed major and urgent challenges for the global community. The European Green Deal sets out a new growth strategy aimed at turning the European Union into a just and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient, and competitive economy, which will no longer generate net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Cities in this context are committed on several fronts to rapid adaptation to improve their resilience capacity. The historic centre is the most vulnerable part of a city, with a reduced capacity for adaptation, but also the densest of values, which increase the complexity of the challenge. This study proposes an integrated tool, Heuristic Planning Support System (HPSS), aimed at exploring green-blue strategies for the historic centre. The tool is integrated with classic Planning Support System (PSS), a decision process conducted from the perspective of heuristic approach and Geographic Information System (GIS). It comprises modules for technical assessment, environmental assessment Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), economic assessment Life Cycle Cost (LCC), Life Cycle Revenues (LCR), and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (DCFA) extended to the life cycle of specific interventions, the Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT) for the assessment of energy, environmental, identity, landscape, and economic values. The development of a tool to support the ecological transition of historic centres stems from the initiative of researchers at the University of Catania, who developed it based on the preferences expressed by a group of decision makers, that is, a group of local administrators, scholars, and professionals.

Specifically, we also show that this negative effect is more profound for state-owned enterprises, carbon-intensive enterprises, and enterprises with lower risk taking. The results also give evidence that the effect of climate policy uncertainty on firm investment can last up to three quarters and disappear within 1 year. Finally, we propose that investment irreversibility is plausible channel through which climate policy uncertainty discourages investment. Overall, these results shed light on the real effects of climate policy uncertainty and the determinants of investment.",Not About Sufficiency

Empirical findings indicate (i) the resilience of green bonds to CPU, (ii) the high sensitivity of the clean energy sector to CPU dynamics, and (iii) the vulnerability of ESG investment to high CPU. The findings have several important implications for investors, financial analysts, and policymakers.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate Sensitivity to Land Use Changes over the City of Brussels,"Prompted with the ongoing and projected climate change, a wide range of cities have committed, not only to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions but also to implement different climate change adaptation measures. These measures serve to ensure the wellbeing of the urban population. In practice, however, the planning of realistic adaptation measures is a complex process. Prior to starting such endeavor, it may therefore be useful to explore the maximum potential benefit that can be gained through adaptation measures. In this work, simple, extreme yet realistic adaptation measures are proposed in terms of changes in albedo and vegetation fraction. The impact of these land-use scenarios is explored by use of the land surface model SURFEX on the summer climate in terms of heat waves and the urban heat island for the city of Brussels. This is done for different periods in the future using the greenhouse gas scenario RCP8.5.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate warming and increasing Vibrio vulnificus infections in North America,"Vibrio vulnificus is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, occurring in warm low-salinity waters. V. vulnificus wound infections due to seawater exposure are infrequent but mortality rates are high (similar to 18%). Seawater bacterial concentrations are increasing but changing disease pattern assessments or climate change projections are rare. Here, using a 30-year database of V. vulnificus cases for the Eastern USA, changing disease distribution was assessed. An ecological niche model was developed, trained and validated to identify links to oceanographic and climate data. This model was used to predict future disease distribution using data simulated by seven Global Climate Models (GCMs) which belong to the newest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Risk was estimated by calculating the total population within 200 km of the disease distribution. Predictions were generated for different ""pathways"" of global socioeconomic development which incorporate projections of greenhouse gas emissions and demographic change. In Eastern USA between 1988 and 2018, V. vulnificus wound infections increased eightfold (10-80 cases p.a.) and the northern case limit shifted northwards 48 km p.a. By 2041-2060, V. vulnificus infections may expand their current range to encompass major population centres around New York (40.7 degrees N). Combined with a growing and increasingly elderly population, annual case numbers may double. By 2081-2100 V. vulnificus infections may be present in every Eastern USA State under medium-to-high future emissions and warming. The projected expansion of V. vulnificus wound infections stresses the need for increased individual and public health awareness in these areas.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate-related development finance and renewable energy consumption in greenhouse gas emissions reduction in the Congo basin,"The global increasing trend in total greenhouse gas emissions in recent decades has triggered the need for climate-related development financing. This study analyzes the effects of climate-related development mitigation finance and renewable energy consumption on greenhouse gas emissions in the Congo Basin. Using panel data from 2002 to 2020, panel regression estimates empirically reveal (1) a minimal significant increase in green-house gas emissions with respect to an increase in climate-related development mitigation finance (2) An in-crease in climate-related mitigation finance significantly promotes the consumption of renewable energy (3) An increase in renewable energy consumption reduces greenhouse gas emissions (4) An increase in renewable en-ergy consumption reduces the effect of climate-related mitigation finance on greenhouse emissions.

Climate-Society Feedback Effects: Be Wary of Unidentified Connections,"Feedbacks within the climate-economy system are complex. The research analyzing the relationship between human activities and the climate is considerable, with particular focus on intra-system feedback effects: environmental tipping points, and climate-triggered social tipping points, like migration, to a lesser extent (Kopp et al., 2016; van Ginkel et al., 2018). Due to their cross-disciplinary nature (Guerrero et al., 2018), two-way interactions between the environment and society, whereby movement in either system can trigger inter-system feedbacks (Lade et al., 2013; Yletyinen et al., 2019) as humans respond to a changing environment thereby further changing the environment, have only recently received attention by a growing inter-disciplinary research community. With the aim of improving climate policy and its tools, such as the social cost of carbon, we describe these social-ecological system (SES) feedbacks and place them in the existing taxonomy for tipping points applied by mainstream climate-economy models. Drawing lessons from SES research and related interdisciplinary literature, we discuss the value of and method by which to modify social-cost integrated assessment models (SC-IAMs), like Nordhaus' Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy. As it is critical that climate policy include these risks to the stability of the climate-economy system, we conclude with a research agenda for the identification, quantification, and integration of climate-society feedbacks into SC-IAMs.",Not About Sufficiency
Climatic shocks associate with innovation in science and technology,"Human history is shaped by landmark discoveries in science and technology. However, across both time and space the rate of innovation is erratic: Periods of relative inertia alternate with bursts of creative science and rapid cascades of technological innovations. While the origins of the rise and fall in rates of discovery and innovation remain poorly understood, they may reflect adaptive responses to exogenously emerging threats and pressures. Here we examined this possibility by fitting annual rates of scientific discovery and technological innovation to climatic variability and its associated economic pressures and resource scarcity. In time-series data from Europe (1500-1900CE), we indeed found that rates of innovation are higher during prolonged periods of cold (versus warm) surface temperature and during the presence (versus absence) of volcanic dust veils. This negative temperature - innovation link was confirmed in annual time-series for France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (1901-1965CE). Combined, across almost 500 years and over 5,000 documented innovations and discoveries, a 0.5 degrees C increase in temperature associates with a sizable 0.30-0.60 standard deviation decrease in innovation. Results were robust to controlling for fluctuations in population size. Furthermore, and consistent with economic theory and micro-level data on group innovation, path analyses revealed that the relation between harsher climatic conditions between 1500-1900CE and more innovation is mediated by climate-induced economic pressures and resource scarcity.",Not About Sufficiency
Clinical advances in kidney autotransplantation: a review,"Kidney autotransplantation is a surgical procedure with multiple indications and advancing technological approaches. Kidney autotransplantation is used to address complex kidney-related diseases including renal vascular lesions, ureteral diseases, tumors, loin pain-hematuria syndrome, and conditions affecting a solitary kidney or both kidneys. Renal artery lesions, including aneurysms and stenoses, often necessitate kidney autotransplantation in cases involving renal artery bifurcation or distant failure of endovascular repair. Complex ureteral lesions such as ureteral avulsions are commonly treated with kidney autotransplantation. Renal tumors, especially centrally located tumors or those involving the renal hilum, are treated using this technique while preserving renal function. It is worth emphasizing that this would be a rarely used last-resort technique in the modern era of minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgery. Kidney autotransplantation may be indicated for the rare condition of loin pain-hematuria syndrome when conservative measures fail. Additionally, individuals with solitary or bilateral kidney disease benefit from kidney autotransplantation to preserve their renal function. Traditional open-kidney autotransplantation involves renal extraction, workbench repair, and renal reimplantation. Technological advancements have introduced minimally invasive techniques including laparoscopic- and robot-assisted kidney autotransplantation, which reduce surgical trauma and recovery times. These techniques have shown promising outcomes, and robotic platforms have the potential to further reduce complications. In this study, we reviewed diverse indications and recent technological innovations in the field of kidney autotransplantation.",Not About Sufficiency

Clonal Evolution of High-Risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: A Contemporary Perspective,"Clonal evolution represents the natural process through which cancer cells continuously search for phenotypic advantages that enable them to develop and expand within microenvironmental constraints. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), clonal evolution underpins leukemic progression and therapeutic resistance, with differences in clonal evolutionary dynamics accounting for its characteristically diverse clinical course. The past few years have witnessed profound changes in our understanding of CLL clonal evolution, facilitated by a maturing definition of high-risk CLL and an increasing sophistication of next-generation sequencing technology. In this review, we offer a modern perspective on clonal evolution of high-risk CLL, highlighting recent discoveries, paradigm shifts and unresolved questions. We appraise recent advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of CLL clonal evolution, focusing on the genetic and non-genetic sources of intratumoral heterogeneity, as well as tumor-immune dynamics. We review the technological innovations, particularly in single-cell technology, which have fostered these advances and represent essential tools for future discoveries. In addition, we discuss clonal evolution within several contexts of particular relevance to contemporary clinical practice, including the settings of therapeutic resistance to CLL targeted therapy and immunotherapy, as well as Richter transformation of CLL to high-grade lymphoma.",Not About Sufficiency
Coal Micro-Pricing: Optimizing the Coal Fuel Supply Chain for Indian Thermal Power Plants,"The energy sector in India is highly dependent on coal as a fuel. At present, most of the domestically produced thermal coal is burned raw or after minimal beneficiation. This practice often results in higher operating and maintenance costs, poorer utilization efficiencies, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To improve the prevailing conditions, the Government of India is taking steps to increase clean coal production by promoting the installation of coal preparation plants across the country. The identification of optimal separation densities and blending protocols for these precombustion cleaning facilities greatly influences the economics of the fuel supply chain and India's quest for additional low-cost energy. Traditionally, preparation plants have utilized float-sink (washability) data to determine suitable density separation set points for their processing circuits. Very often, these set points are based on the cumulative ash content required to meet contract specifications within India's bulk commodity coal markets. Unfortunately, the current study indicates that the optimal separation densities are largely independent of coal washability characteristics. This article demonstrates the use of micro-price optimization to identify optimal density set points that maximize coal production for Indian coal feedstocks. This fundamental optimization technique assigns a unit price to each particle passing through the coal supply chain. This approach is in sharp contrast to the prevailing practice that assigns bulk prices to piles/lots of mixed coal and rock. Case studies for 12 different coal samples from India showed that (1) the historic constant cumulative ash method for determining set points is suboptimal, (2) the separation density of all plants/circuits should be held near-constant irrespective of feed washabilities, and (3) misplacement of high-ash rock and low-ash coal must be prevented to avoid large reductions in the inherent worth of India's coal reserves.",Not About Sufficiency
Coastal carbon cycle changes following mangrove loss,"Global mangrove loss is occurring from deforestation and extreme climatic events, but changes to the coastal carbon cycle following mangrove mortality and/or loss are not well understood. In 2015/2016, a massive climate-driven mangrove dieback event occurred over similar to 1000 km of Australian coastline. To assess carbon loss following mortality, carbon fluxes in adjacent living and dead forest areas were compared 8 and 20 months postforest dieback. Dead areas experienced an increase in soil CO2 efflux by similar to 189%, and a decrease in oceanic dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) outwelling of similar to 50% relative to living areas. DIC outwelling (predominantly carbonate alkalinity) and soil CO2 efflux accounted for 81% and 16% of losses from the living forest, in comparison to 51% and 47%, respectively, from the dead forest. The dieback drove a shift from a dominance of oceanic carbon outwelling to increased atmospheric CO2 emissions and decreased alkalinity exports. This shift was likely driven by increased oxygen sediment permeation and the loss of mangrove net primary productivity. Combining our new observations with literature data, we found a logarithmic relationship between soil carbon loss and time since mangrove loss. Using this relationship, we estimate ongoing global carbon losses from historical mangrove deforestation and dieback could be 13.7 +/- 9.4 Tg C yr(-1), which is eightfold higher than previous estimates and offsets global mangrove carbon burial by similar to 60%. Even if no future deforestation occurred, we estimate ongoing carbon losses to the atmosphere and ocean from current global mangrove losses of 27 Tg C over the next 30 yr.",Not About Sufficiency
New Conceptions of Sufficient Home Size in High-Income Countries: Are We Approaching a Sustainable Consumption Transition?,"Housing plays a significant role in impelling demand for natural resources and driving economic growth in high-income countries. Public policies, commercial prerogatives, and other inducements have encouraged construction and occupancy of ever-larger homes and this pattern has persisted in the face of decreasing household size, declining fertility, ageing populations, and increasing complexity of domestic relationships. This situation has created a perverse mismatch between available housing stocks and residential requirements. Additionally, imperatives to curtail greenhouse-gas emissions and to hasten progress on the United Nations 2030 Agenda demand new planning priorities. Building on the sufficiency turn in the field of sustainable consumption, this paper first formulates parameters for estimating an environmentally tenable and globally equitable amount of per person living area. It then highlights five emblematic cases of ""space-efficient"" housing.

"Colonial History, Indigenous Villagers' Rights, and Rural Land Use: An Empirical Study of Planning Control Decisions on Small House Applications in Hong Kong","The New Territories Small House Policy in Hong Kong has been controversial, in that the interests of male indigenous villagers in terms of housing are prioritized at the expense of the rest of the population. This colonial era policy, currently under the protection of the Basic Law, has profound implications on how rural land outside the village environs should be used, particularly so when development pressures are mounting. How planning control decisions on small house applications are made under these conditions, thus, becomes an important and timely policy research topic. This paper, thus, studies these decisions in Greenbelt zone (GB), Agriculture zone (AGR), and Unspecified zone (UNSP), between January 1st, 1990 and June 30th, 2017, using non-aggregate planning statistics. The findings show that the Town Planning Board (TPB) is more likely to reject small house applications that propose a larger site area for each small house in AGR and GB zones, but not those that essentially propose a small-scale small house development (i.e. up to 5 houses). Also, land-use policies in these three zones are found to vary geographically. Further, the TPB's decisions are flexible in that they are subject to other exogenous factors, such as housing policies and housing market conditions.",Not About Sufficiency
Current and future state of the US nuclear energy industry,"The American renaissance in nuclear energy - in part brought about by liberalization, competition and consolidation - is a good example of what can happen when a dedicated industry embraces change. Liberalization of the American electricity market underscores the economic and strategic value of nuclear energy. It has also helped bring to light how very competitive nuclear energy is compared with other forms of generation. As evidenced by the exciting trend toward license renewal, corporate leaders view nuclear power plants as valuable economic assets. Moreover, the strong public, policymaker and regulator support for license renewal is a strong indication that - to date - adding the functional equivalent of at least 25 new nuclear plants is viewed as an, energy and environmental imperative and we expect more plants to follow in the near future. Concern over greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution underscore nuclear energy's strategic value as a baseload capable, emission-free generation source. As these concerns grow in parallel with increased energy demand, nuclear energy will increasingly be valued as a national asset by the public and policymakers alike. Moreover, when monetized, nuclear energy's emission free-nature will lower substantially its already competitive generation cost.",Not About Sufficiency
"Combined cooling, heat and power for commercial buildings: Optimization for hydrogen-methane blend fuels","Considering the rapid pace of global warming, it is crucial to decarbonize our energy supply to meet both electric power and thermal energy demands. This study evaluates the application of a combined cooling, heat, and power system for commercial applications in a maritime temperate climate to assess the feasibility of meeting thermal and electrical demand with medium-size commercial generators fueled with blends of hydrogen and natural gas. Demand load data analysis has been conducted using open-source datasets to identify building categories with representative thermal and electrical demands. A large hospital was chosen for a representative case study to define system component capacity and operation optimization to minimize estimated costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Along with the generator, the combined cooling, heat, and power system included thermal energy storage and an absorption cooler, supplemented with conventional boiler and an electric (vapor compression) cooling system. The optimized system was compared to a conventional combination of grid electrical supply for power; cooling from an electrical chiller; and heat load from a natural gas boiler. A hierarchical clustering al-gorithm was employed to identify five representative days to cover the entire year while keeping the optimi-zation tractable. The system was sized using nested optimization, where operation over the year was optimized for a given system component sizing, then the sizing was adjusted, and the operation re-optimized in an iterative process. This ensured that the final system specification was optimized for both component size (capacity) and operation. The results show that a combined cooling, heat, and power system can provide economic and greenhouse gas emissions benefits for electricity grids with marginal CO2 intensities greater than 230-260 g/ kWh. Adding up to 50% hydrogen to the natural gas can reduce this break-even intensity by up to 12%. Net cost savings on the order of 5% can also be achieved at the break-even greenhouse gases grid intensity. Depending on the grid CO2 intensity and fuel composition, combined cooling, heat, and power can save more than 14% compared to the conventional system in 20 years.",Not About Sufficiency
"Combined effects of heatwaves and air pollution, green space and blue space on the incidence of hypertension: A national cohort study","Extreme heat exposure has been associated with hypertension. However, its interactive influences with air pollution, green and blue spaces are unclear. This study aimed to explore the interaction between heatwaves, air pollution, green and blue spaces on hypertension. Cohort data enrolled 6448 Chinese older adults aged 65 years and over were derived from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) between 2008 and 2018. Nine heatwave defini-tions, combining three heat thresholds (92.5th, 95th, and 97.5th percentiles of daily maximum temperature) and three durations (>= 2, 3 and 4 days) were used as time-varying variables in the analysis and were the one-year exposure before survival events. Fine particulate matter (PM <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)), the Normalized Dif-ference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the average proportion of open water bodies were used to reflect the air pollu-tion, green and blue space exposures, respectively. PM2.5, green and blue space exposures were time-varying indicators and contemporaneous with heatwaves. Mixed Cox models with time-varying variables were fitted to assess the multiplicative and additive interaction of heatwaves, PM2.5, and green and blue spaces on hypertension, measured by a traditional product term with the ratio of hazard ratio (HR) and relative risk due to interaction (RERI), respec-tively. A positive multiplicative (HRs >1) and additive interaction (RERIs >0) between heatwaves and higher PM2.5 levels was observed. There was a synergistic effect between heatwaves and decreasing greenness levels on hyperten-sion incidence on additive and multiplicative scales. No significant interaction between heatwaves and blue space was observed in the analysis. The combined effects of heatwaves, air pollution, green and blue space exposures on the risk of hypertension varied with age, gender, and educational attainment. This study's findings complemented the existing evidence and revealed synergistic harmful impacts for heatwaves with air pollution and lack of green space on hypertension incidence.",Not About Sufficiency
Combining photovoltaics and sound barriers - A feasibility study,"In the light of global warming, renewables such as solar photovoltaics (PV) are important to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. An important issue regarding implementation of solar panels on large scale, is the limited available area. Therefore, it can be interesting to combine PV with alternative applications, as a ways of not requiring ""additional"" space. One example is a photovoltaic noise barrier (PVNB), where a noise barrier located along a highway or railway is used as substructure for PV modules. Even though a PVNB is not a novel concept, the absence of economic assessments in literature can be a barrier to their wider implementation. In this paper, a feasibility study of a PVNB in Belgium is conducted, using a cost benefit analysis including a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. Besides purely economic aspects, also ecological benefits are monetized. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the ecological benefit of noise reduction, which is valuated using a noise sensitivity depreciation index applied to real estate prices, is of major importance in determining the net present value of the case study. On the contrary, the impact of reducing CO2 emissions seems to be negligible when expressed in monetary terms. The results suggest that the PVNB as a whole and also its separate components -.e. the PV array and the noise barrier can be profitable projects, when ecological benefits are included.

"Combustion behaviors of three bamboo residues: Gas emission, kinetic, reaction mechanism and optimization patterns","This study focused on the assessment of gas emissions and bioenergy potential of the combustions of bamboo leaves (BL), shoot leaves (BSL) and branches (BB) in the air atmosphere. The main combustion stage of the three residues occurred at between 200 and 600 degrees C, with three peaks of mass loss. The pattern of mass loss rate was BSL > BB > BL, with BSL having the best combustion characteristic parameters. The main evolved gases were CO2 and H2O at between 200 and 600 degrees C. Organic gaseous compounds were decomposed in the range of 200-400 degrees C. Air pollutants were produced in the range of 200-500 degrees C. N-containing gas pollutants were 0.01-0.1 times CO2, while SO2 was produced in a very small amount. BL produced more gas pollutants than did BSL and BB, while the controls over the gas pollutants should be more concentrated in the range of 200-400 degrees C. The joint optimizations of derivative thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, remaining mass, and conversion degree showed 653.2 degrees C and 5 degrees C/min as the optimum operational conditions for bioenergy utilization, while BB performed as the best feedstock. Among three iso-conversion methods used to estimate activation energy, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa led to best correlation. The Coats-Redfern method pointed to the second order reaction model (f (alpha) = (1-alpha)(2)) as the most likely reaction mechanism. Overall, the bamboo residues were promising as the environmentally friendly and renewable feedstock. Our findings can provide the basis for bioenergy generation, pollution control, and optimal efficiency when the industrial-scale combustions of the bamboo residues are adopted. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Common metabolic networks contribute to carbon sink strength of sorghum internodes: implications for bioenergy improvement,"Background: Sorghum bicolor (L.) is an important bioenergy source. The stems of sweet sorghum function as carbon sinks and accumulate large amounts of sugars and lignocellulosic biomass and considerable amounts of starch, therefore providing a model of carbon allocation and accumulation for other bioenergy crops. While omics data sets for sugar accumulation have been reported in different genotypes, the common features of primary metabolism in sweet genotypes remain unclear. To obtain a cohesive and comparative picture of carbohydrate metabolism between sorghum genotypes, we compared the phenotypes and transcriptome dynamics of sugar-accumulating internodes among three different sweet genotypes (Della, Rio, and SIL-05) and two non-sweet genotypes (BTx406 and R9188). Results: Field experiments showed that Della and Rio had similar dynamics and internode patterns of sugar concentration, albeit distinct other phenotypes. Interestingly, cellulose synthases for primary cell wall and key genes in starch synthesis and degradation were coordinately upregulated in sweet genotypes. Sweet sorghums maintained active monolignol biosynthesis compared to the non-sweet genotypes. Comparative RNA-seq results support the role of candidate Tonoplast Sugar Transporter gene (TST), but not the Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporter genes (SWEETs) in the different sugar accumulations between sweet and non-sweet genotypes. Conclusions: Comparisons of the expression dynamics of carbon metabolic genes across the RNA-seq data sets identify several candidate genes with contrasting expression patterns between sweet and non-sweet sorghum lines, including genes required for cellulose and monolignol synthesis (CesA, PTAL, and CCR), starch metabolism (AGPase, SS, SBE, and G6P-translocator SbGPT2), and sucrose metabolism and transport (TPP and TST2). The common transcriptome features of primary metabolism identified here suggest the metabolic networks contributing to carbon sink strength in sorghum internodes, prioritize the candidate genes for manipulating carbon allocation with bioenergy purposes, and provide a comparative and cohesive picture of the complexity of carbon sink strength in sorghum stem.",Not About Sufficiency

"Comparative evaluation of multi-scale spatiotemporal variability and drivers of carbon storage: An empirical study from 369 cities, China","Under the background of global climate change, the role of carbon storage in mitigating the increase of atmospheric CO2 concentrations is of paramount importance. However, land use and land cover change (LULC) resulting from urban sprawl disturbs the level and distribution of carbon storage. This study aims to explore the spatiotemporal variability of carbon storage and the correlations between that and urban development for China's 369 cities in 2000, 2010, and 2020. The InVEST model and several multiple linear regression models are employed and the results show that: (1) Cities in western China sequester a large amount of carbon (maximum greater than 2000 TgC) and only some of them, from 2010 to 2020, can maintain a positive change in carbon storage. The rest of China shows a negative change, but a higher carbon storage per area (maximum greater than 0.01 TgC/km2 in the east). Moran's I shows that such variability has a significant spatial autocorrelation. (2) The intensification of the population, the growth of economy, and urbanization are the main factors influencing carbon storage, which are not only reflected on the national scale but also have different local characteristics in different regions. Cities in China's inland regions (e.g., western, some central, and northeastern China), most of which are developing cities, show more diversified impacts of their urban development on carbon storage. However, in developed cities, mostly concentrated in the eastern region, such impacts and variations show a more unified trend. Considering that environmental policy is often a national action, therefore, to strengthen the carbon sequestration capacity of cities, it is necessary to formulate not only a unified leading policy from the national level but also the practical policies of local governments of cities that match their development stages.",Not About Sufficiency
Competitive Potential of Stable Biomass in Poland Compared to the European Union in the Aspect of Sustainability,"Biomass is the primary source of renewable energy in Poland. Its share in renewable energy production in Poland has decreased in recent years, but it still maintains a nearly 70% share. Poland has extensive forest and straw resources, such as pellets, which can be used for stable biomass production. The main objective of this research was to understand the potential of plant biomass production for energy purposes in Poland and other European Union (EU) countries in terms of sustainable development. The period of analysis covered 2000-2022. Secondary data from Statistical Poland and Eurostat were used. The primary research method was the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, which aimed to check the stationarity of stable biomass. Moreover, we calculated the Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model, which was used to develop the forecast. The indigenous production of solid biomass in 2022 decreased to 363,195 TJ, while in 2018, it was 384,914 TJ. Our prognosis confirms that biomass will increase. The prognosis based on the VAR model shows an increase from 365,395 TJ in 2023 to 379,795 (TJ) in 2032. Such countries as France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Finland have a bigger potential for solid biomass production from forests because of their higher area. As a result, Poland's biomass production competitiveness is varied when compared to other EU nations; it is lower for nations with a large forest share and greater for those with a low forest cover. The two main benefits of producing solid biomass are its easy storage and carbon dioxide (CO2) neutrality. The main advantage is that solid biomass preserves biodiversity, maintains soil fertility, and improves soil quality while lowering greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollutants. The ability to leave added value locally and generate new jobs, particularly in troubled areas, is the largest social advantage of sustained biomass production.",Not About Sufficiency

Hence, safeguarding of soil microbial diversity is profoundly significant taking into consideration of the contributions for plant buildups and rhizodeposits into the soil. Improvements in the crop productivity, soil health, and sustainable intensification should be premised on the better understanding of interactions between the cropping systems and soil microbial diversity. In this study, we assessed variations in the microbial communities across the traditional banana-based cropping systems of contrasting monocrop vigor (vigorous or V vs. non-vigorous or NV) and the cropping system (monocrop or MC vs. intercropped or IC) using 16S rDNA (V3-V4) and ITS2 amplicon deep sequencing via Illumina platform. Sequencing results of the bacterial and fungal communities showed high variability among MC and V cropping systems. The abundances of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were significantly higher in NV (non-vigorous) and V (vigorous) cropping systems; and the abundances of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in the MC (monocropping) than IC (intercropping). There were high relative abundances of Pseudomonas (6.1-37.43%), Bacillus (4.5-20.4%), Rhizobium (1.4-6.5%), and Devosia (1.5-6.7%) in the cropping systems. The dominant family of fungal class Incertae_sedis was Mortierellales, which accounted for 8.79-41.12% of total taxa. This result indicated that the cropping systems are vital for supporting the dynamic microbial diversity specifically beneficial for bacterial communities that helps in promoting synergistic plant-soil interactions and total productivity under resource poor conditions of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).",Not About Sufficiency

This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the current trends and advancements in epoxy composites, focusing on mechanical properties and their optimization. Attention is given to technological innovations, including the use of nanotechnologies, hybrid reinforcement, and eco-friendly materials, which are key to enhancing the performance and sustainability of these materials. The analysis shows that the introduction of nanomaterials, such as graphene, titanium dioxide, and silicon dioxide, can significantly improve the strength, fatigue resistance, and electrical properties of epoxy composites, opening new possibilities in advanced technologies. Another significant contribution is the development of hybrid composites, which combine different types of fibers, such as carbon, aramid, and glass fibers, enabling the optimization of key properties, including interlayer strength and delamination resistance. The article also highlights the importance of environmental innovations, such as bio-based resins and self-healing mechanisms, which enable more sustainable and long-term effective use of composites. The combination of theoretical knowledge with practical applications provides valuable guidance for designing materials with precisely defined properties for future industrial use. This text thus offers a comprehensive view of the possibilities of epoxy composites in the context of increasing demands for performance, reliability, and environmental sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Connectionist technique estimates H2S solubility in ionic liquids through a low parameter approach,"Adequate knowledge of solubility of acid gases in ionic liquids (ILs) at different thermodynamic conditions is of great importance in the context of gas processing and carbon sequestration. Thus, a precise estimation of this key parameter seems inevitable in the design prospective of IL-based separation processes. This paper introduces another interesting application of least square support vector machine (LSSVM) to forecast hydrogen sulfide (H2S) solubility in various ILs. Genetic algorithm (GA) is also employed to obtain optimal magnitudes of hyper parameters (including gamma and sigma(2)) which are embedded in the LSSVM technique. Utilizing 465 data samples (e.g., where 11 ionic liquids are included), the new strategy presented in this study demonstrates great predictive performance so that the coefficient of determination (R-2) and mean squared error (MSE) are determined to 0.997594 and 6.6507E-05, respectively. Provided accurate solubility, such a competent tool has high potential to be combined with existing PVT and chemical engineering software packages for the proper design of process equipment in gas sweetening operations.

Consideration of scales in offshore wind environmental impact assessments,"Quality of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) has been criticized, in part due to a lack of accounting in these tools for differing spatial and temporal scales inherent in ecological data. In the United States, leases of outer continental shelf blocks for offshore wind projects and their construction and operation plans require EIAs in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the 1978 Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act. This study evaluated consideration of spatiotemporal scales of stressors, receptors (specifically cetaceans), and effects in eight federal offshore wind energy EIAs against 26 criteria extracted from federal regulations. The criteria analysis determined that EIAs do not consistently or comprehensively address spatiotemporal scales with respect to federal requirements. Deficiencies in addressing spatiotemporal scales may result from imprecise regulations, intent to simplify encyclopedic documents, or lack of data resulting in incomplete assessments, inappropriate mitigation actions, and projects delays. Recommendations to improve compliance with federal regulations include making federal guidance binding, focusing on non-trivial impacts of species, tiering information, and incorporating outcomes of marine spatial planning.",Not About Sufficiency

Consumerism and the rise of balloons in Europe at the end of the eighteenth century,"The history of ballooning has received considerable attention from historians examining the technological innovations behind it as well as from scholars interested in aeronautical anecdotes concerning launches and disasters. The cultural importance of this new machine, however, remains less fully analyzed. This essay explores one facet of that history through a discussion of the commodification of launches in France and Great Britain. These two countries, which have larger middling classes as well as a higher degree of commercialization in general, provided a fertile environment for aeronauts seeking to instruct and entertain an audience willing to fund ballooning. Balloonists had to invent ways to market this scientific discovery and determine how best to attract paying customers.

"Contested notions of energy justice and energy futures in struggles over tar sands development in British Columbia, Canada","This paper explores the articulation and mobilization of competing notions of energy (in) justice and energy future visions in the struggle over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project (TMX) in British Columbia, Canada. The TMX is a controversial fossil fuel project because it leads to the appropriation of First Nations lands, gender violence, and the unequal distribution of the socio-environmental costs of tar sands operations. Despite these impacts, the Canadian state argues that the TMX contributes to economic growth, job creation, and increased tax revenues, thereby legitimizing tar sands expansion on Indigenous lands. Drawing upon literature on Indigenous climate/energy justice, we problematize conventional understandings of energy justice and energy futures by examining multiple, interconnected, and often neglected dimensions of justice in the TMX conflict. Through critical discourse analysis, this paper explores how First Nations opposing this pipeline mobilize different notions of justice to envision alternative energy futures. Our study shows how they challenge Canada's fossil fuel future vision by asserting jurisdiction over the lands crossed by the TMX and demanding the cancellation of this pipeline. Centering counter-hegemonic perspectives in discussions about tar sands development provides a starting point for imagining and building more just energy futures.",Not About Sufficiency
Contesting green technology in the city: techno-apartheid or equitable modernisation?,"In recent decades, heated debate around green technology and its equitable access has aroused the concern of international scholars. This paper provides a review on the exclusion of green technology referred to as 'green techno-apartheid' and examines selected key eco-cities (i.e. Masdar, Songdo IBD and Bangalore) considered in the 2013 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Report on 'City-Level Decoupling' (2013). Metropolitan planning is a crucial instrument in addressing the challenges of urban social sustainability and is thus considered an important mechanism for developing a platform to approach issues of equitable access to green technology. The study reviews five metropolitan plans: the 'London Plan' (London, England), the 'Municipal Plan 2011 for Greater Copenhagen' (Copenhagen, Denmark), the 'Economically Strong and Sustainable Structural Vision: Amsterdam 2040' (Amsterdam, Netherlands), the 'Hong Kong 2030: Planning Vision and Strategy' (Hong Kong, China) and the 'Metropolitan Plan for Sydney 2036' (Sydney, Australia). The results of the study suggest that while all these plans focus on promoting green technology within a framework of ecological modernisation, they lack appropriate tools for achieving equitable modernisation and enhancing social equity. Consequently, it is essential that researchers and planners take further steps and develop effective instruments to improve equitable access to green technologies and achieve long-term urban social sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Continued obstacles to wood-based biomass production in the southeastern United States,"International demand for wood-based biomass for bioenergy production is growing, and private forestlands in the southeastern United States have the potential to supply that demand. The southeastern United States (Southeast) is the world's largest exporter of wood pellets for bioenergy, primarily to the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU). However, wood-based biomass production accounts for only a small share of total wood removals from private forestlands in the Southeast. There is sufficient wood-based biomass in the Southeast to support greater production of wood pellets for domestic and international markets without redirecting timber from sawtimber and pulpwood production. In 2018-19, we conducted 39 semi-structured interviews with private forest landowners, foresters, loggers, and biomass production facility managers in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia to obtain their views on wood-based biomass production in the Southeast. Although landowners were interested in supplying wood for biomass as a byproduct of timber harvesting, they seldom participated in wood-based biomass production because of limited and unreliable access to biomass markets. Loggers and production facility managers had not invested in biomass production because they remain skeptical about the financial viability of wood-based biomass. Continued obstacles to biomass production include: price competition with fossil fuels and conventional wood products; inconsistent domestic government support for biomass production; concerns about meeting the sustainability requirements to export wood-based biomass to the UK and EU; and the high costs associated with harvesting low-grade wood for biomass. The barriers to biomass expansion in the southeastern United States remain primarily economic and political rather than biophysical.",Not About Sufficiency
Controlled electric vehicle charging for reverse power flow correction in the distribution network with high photovoltaic penetration: case of an expanded IEEE 13 node test network,"Over the past years, the penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into the distribution network has experienced significant augmentation as the pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere keeps increasing while the prices of the solar components keep reducing. Despite the benefits PV systems bring to the distribution network, the high penetration of this technology into the distribution network could lead to reverse power flow (RPF) when the PV systems produce more than the local loads require. This RPF could result in the malfunctioning of protective devices and their coordination. This research addresses this problem by utilizing electric vehicles (EVs) that are currently revolutionizing the transport sector. Here, the charging of EVs during the day is intel-ligently controlled to mitigate RPF as a result of the excess power produced by the PV systems. Resolving RPF is achieved through a control system that measures the power flow on each phase of the main grid substation. If at any instance negative power is detected (reverse power), quantified EVs needing recharge are instantly incor-porated into the network for charging through the automatic closure of the power switches of the required number of charging points with EVs whose total power demand equals the amount of reverse power detected. The excess power is hence absorbed and stored by the EVs. The proposed method is tested on an expanded IEEE 13 node test feeder and simulated using ETAP software. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in eliminating RPF which occurs from 10:00 am to 12:00 noon by connecting the required number of EVs during that timeframe. The proposed method involves the distribution network operators working in synergy with the transport sector to effectively solve the problem of RPF in the distribution network.",Not About Sufficiency
Cooperating for circularity? Perspectives of citizen energy cooperative members on circular solar business models,"Solar photovoltaics (PV) play a critical role in advancing the sustainable energy transition, but growing concerns about PV waste highlight the need for circular economy solutions within the solar value chain. Meanwhile, concerns for the social impact of the circular economy call for a circular society, emphasizing social and environmental justice and requiring organisational forms that enable economic democracy. In many European countries, citizen energy cooperatives have successfully promoted renewable energy adoption in a democratically controlled and participatory way. However, evidence on the role of cooperatives in a circular economy remains limited. In this paper, we use survey data from Flanders (Belgium), to investigate perspectives of citizen energy cooperative members and non-members on circular solar business models. Our findings reveal that cooperative members exhibit greater interest and trust in solar Product-Service Systems models and PV reuse, driven not only by financial considerations but also by environmental consciousness and cooperative values. This study provides empirical evidence supporting the role of citizen energy cooperatives in fostering the circular economy and recommends cooperatives to ensure participation of disadvantaged communities to contribute to a circular society. The research identifies avenues for future research and contributes to the broader discourse on organising circular societies.",Not About Sufficiency
COORDINATING DISCIPLINARY AND ORGANIZATIONAL WAYS OF KNOWING,"This article examines how the difficulties in finding sustainable environmental interactions may be rooted in the institutionalized thinking and organizing from which these attempts emerge. A major question addressed is why do agencies and organizations support special interests better than collective ones. There is a long-standing set of political/economic explanations that attribute the structure of agriculture to the political power of established economic interests. The diverse explanations share one conclusion in common: agricultural policy and the structure of agriculture itself in the United States favors the production of commercial food outputs through the use of commercially available inputs instead of promoting the maintenance and enhancement of viable biological, community and food systems. The emphasis on commercial inputs and outputs is compatible with decision-making by individual farmers. Epistemological explanations for why United States agriculture has developed along a path based on individual and commercial inputs and outputs rather than biological and community systems are complementary with political/economic explanations. Current agricultural models and policies are limited in that they are based on mechanical Newtonian assumptions. Discipline boundaries have impeded true implementation of interdisciplinary methodologies and the development of generalized models because the assumptions, cultures, and paradigms within the disciplines have not been overcome. In addition, different organizations have not overcome the differences in the way they transform data into information. This is true of agencies, organizations, and academic disciplines. Can large organizations or agencies handle diversity, given such barriers? For agriculture to play a role in protecting biodiversity, the heterogeneity of agrosystems will have to increase. Recommendations on the structure of organizations to maintain biological diversity in agricultural systems point to resiliency, checks and balances, redundancy, and a substantial research and extension effort to overcome barriers to effectiveness.",Not About Sufficiency
Corporate Environmental Responsibility for a Sustainable Future,"It is an imperative to find a proper way to maintain a balance between the economic development and natural environment's carrying capacity, which is needed for the wellbeing and sustenance of human as well as non-human world.

However, it has also caused unintended environmental degradation. Economic development is necessary to face the need of growing population but it should not add to a deteriorating environment. There is a need for broader ethical responses for environmental sustainability. The search for a sustainable future requires an integration of economic development with ethical objectives and scientific knowledge.

Corporate sustainability commitment in the Middle East and North Africa region: Impact on innovation and firm performance,"This study examines the effects of corporate sustainability factors (CSFs)-specifically gender diversity, energy practices, and environmental practices-on innovation and their subsequent impact on firm performance in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. By integrating Absorptive Capacity Theory, we explore how these CSFs drive innovation, contributing to broader sustainable development goals. We analyze the impact of innovation on firm performance using the resource-based view (RBV). Utilizing secondary data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES), we employ a two-stage instrumental variable regression (IV-2SLS) to address endogeneity and establish causal relationships. Our findings reveal that stakeholder engagement through gender diversity, energy practices, and environmental practices significantly enhances innovation, which, in turn, drives firm performance. Diverse leadership fosters creativity and innovation, while energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable practices reduce costs, improve brand reputation, and align with sustainable development goals. These insights underscore essential policy implications for promoting environmental policy, clean production, and sustainable innovation ecosystems. Encouraging MENA firms to engage stakeholders and adopt sustainable practices can drive economic prosperity and contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",Not About Sufficiency
Correlates of Active School Transportation During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Canadian 7-to 12-Year-Olds: A National Study,"Background: Active school transportation (AST) is an important source of physical activity for children and a potentially important climate change mitigation strategy. However, few studies have examined factors associated with AST in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We used baseline data from a longitudinal survey to investigate correlates of AST during the second wave of COVID-19 (December 2020). We collected survey data from 2291 parents of 7- to 12-year-olds across Canada and linked this information with data on neighborhood walkability and weather from national databases. We assessed potential correlates representing multiple levels of influence of the social-ecological model. We used gender-stratified binary logistic regression models to determine the correlates of children's travel mode to/from school (dichotomized as active vs motorized), while controlling for household income. We examined the correlates of travel mode for both the morning and afternoon trips. Results: Consistent correlates of AST among Canadian children during the COVID-19 pandemic included greater independent mobility, warmer outdoor temperature, having a parent who actively commuted to work or school, living in a household owning fewer vehicles, and living in a more walkable neighborhood. These findings were largely consistent between boys and girls and between morning and afternoon school trips. Conclusions: Policymakers, urban planners, and public health workers aiming to promote AST should focus on these correlates while ensuring that neighborhoods are safe for children. Future research should monitor the prevalence and correlates of AST as COVID-19 restrictions are removed.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental assessment of the recycling process for polyamides-Polyethylene multilayer packaging films,"The plastic packaging, and in particular the multilayer flexible packaging, has several characteristics that make it essential in everyday life. However, the sustainability of used materials is undermined by the difficulties encountered for their recycling. The purpose of this study is to assess both the technical feasibility, and above all the environmental sustainability of an effective process enabling the recycling of polyamides-polyethylene multilayers packaging films. The technique used for the separation of the polymers is based on a selective dissolution, carried out using monoethylene glycol. The experimental tests made possible to identify the best conditions for treating the films and for maximizing yields and final products quality. The Life Cycle Assessment of the recycling process modelled at an industrial level, firstly allowed to determine the main process hotspots (i. e. the energy consumption). The LCA analysis was then extended, examining the life cycle of polyamidespolyethylene films with different end-of-life treatments, i.e. incineration, energy recovery and recycling. The results showed that the recycling process, carried out through the selective dissolution of the films, allows to reduce the overall environmental impacts of these materials along their life cycle. Therefore the recycling process analysed here can be considered an effective approach to increase environmental sustainability and recovery of raw materials.",Not About Sufficiency
Cost-effectiveness analysis of guidelines for antihypertensive care in Finland,"Background: Hypertension is one of the major causes of disease burden affecting the Finnish population. Over the last decade, evidence-based care has emerged to complement other approaches to antihypertensive care, often without health economic assessment of its costs and effects. This study looks at the extent to which changes proposed by the 2002 Finnish evidence-based Current Care Guidelines concerning the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertension (the ACCG scenario) can be considered cost-effective when compared to modelled prior clinical practice (the PCP scenario). Methods: A decision analytic model compares the ACCG and PCP scenarios using information synthesised from a set of national registers covering prescription drug reimbursements, morbidity, and mortality with data from two national surveys concerning health and functional capacity. Statistical methods are used to estimate model parameters from Finnish data. We model the potential impact of the different treatment strategies under the ACCG and PCP scenarios, such as lifestyle counselling and drug therapy, for subgroups stratified by age, gender, and blood pressure. The model provides estimates of the differences in major health-related outcomes in the form of life-years and costs as calculated from a 'public health care system' perspective. Cost-effectiveness analysis results are presented for subgroups and for the target population as a whole. Results: The impact of the use of the ACCG scenario in subgroups (aged 40-80) without concomitant cardiovascular and related diseases is mainly positive. Generally, costs and life-years decrease in unison in the lowest blood pressure group, while in the highest blood pressure group costs and life-years increase together and in the other groups the ACCG scenario is less expensive and produces more life-years. When the costs and effects for subgroups are combined using standard decision analytic aggregation methods, the ACCG scenario is cost-saving and more effective. Conclusion: The ACCG scenario is likely to reduce costs and increase life-years compared to the PCP scenario in many subgroups. If the estimated trade-offs between the subgroups in terms of outcomes and costs are acceptable to decision-makers, then widespread implementation of the ACCG scenario is expected to reduce overall costs and be accompanied by positive outcomes overall.",Not About Sufficiency
COVID-19 and Immigrant Status: A Qualitative Study of Malawian Immigrants Living in South Africa,"Migration to South Africa is motivated by the pursuit of employment, safety, and improved living conditions. However, immigrants encounter significant challenges, such as restricted access to essential services, which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Malawian immigrants in South Africa, addressing the lack of attention given to this immigrant population by highlighting their vulnerabilities. Using a qualitative exploratory and descriptive approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 Malawi immigrants who were over 18 years old and had established residency in South Africa before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Five key stakeholders were also interviewed for additional perspectives and to ensure triangulation and improve data reliability. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis strategies and coding with Nvivo12 software. The study highlighted the exacerbated struggles of Malawian immigrants in South Africa amid the COVID-19 pandemic, uncovering systemic discrimination in healthcare, marked by longer wait times and reluctance from health workers to treat undocumented immigrants. The study also revealed a dire security situation, with immigrants living in high-crime areas and feeling particularly targeted due to their foreign status, a situation worsened by the pandemic's economic effects. Additionally, the economic downturn induced by COVID-19 significantly impacted employment opportunities, with many immigrants facing prolonged unemployment and job losses, especially in sectors where they traditionally found work. The detailed accounts of participants highlight not only the multifaceted challenges imposed by the pandemic but also the critical need for inclusive policies and support systems that ensure healthcare access, safety, and economic resilience for immigrants, particularly during global health emergencies. Future research should focus on effective interventions for socioeconomic integration and well-being, particularly for immigrants from other African countries.",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptation and Mitigation amid the Consequences of Failure,"Societies once could choose between changing direction or dealing with climatic disaster; now it is necessary to do both at once. The best-laid plans for mitigation would be hard enough to fulfill in a stable climate, but they will be vastly harder in the climate chaos ahead. If simultaneous mitigation and adaptation are still achievable, such a difficult balance cannot also take on the burden of supporting unrestrained economic growth. The failing efforts so far have been dominated by a search for synergistic ways to mitigate, adapt, and grow economies at the same time, while wishing away the predictable trade-offs between these goals. Wealthy polluting countries have enforced this optimistic spirit in international climate debates, in part to counter the language of loss and damage, which they have seen as a direct challenge. Key to their effort has been a reframing of adaptation that flips the focus from the vulnerability of exposed populations to their resilience. However, the reality of implementing plans for resilience is running into problems, and those populations are instead taking up the banner of climate justice. Debt- and disaster-plagued Puerto Rico illustrates the failure of both adaptation and mitigation through growth and the promise of climate justice as a means to articulate other forms of balance.",Not About Sufficiency
CRED: A new model of climate and development,"This paper describes a new model, Climate and Regional Economics of Development (CRED), which is designed to analyze the economics of climate and development choices. Its principal innovations are the treatment of global equity, calculation of the optimum interregional flows of resources, and use of McKinsey marginal abatement cost curves to project the cost of mitigation. The unconstrained, optimal climate policy in CRED involves very large capital flows from high-income to developing countries, to an extent that might be considered politically unrealistic. Under more realistic constraints, climate outcomes are generally worse; climate stabilization requires either moderate capital flows to developing countries, or a very low discount rate. In CRED, more equitable scenarios have better climate outcomes; the challenge of climate policy is to persuade high-income countries to accept the need for both international equity and climate protection.

Critiquing Print Media Transformation and Black Empowerment in South Africa: A Critical Race Theory Approach,"South Africa is a country found on extreme forms of inequality along race, gender, and class lines. Thus, transformation addressing these inequalities of the apartheid past became a critical factor in the re-organisation of society at the onset of democracy in 1994. One essential intervention in addressing mainly the economic disparities of the past was Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), introduced by the African National Congress (ANC) government to overcome the economic legacy of apartheid. The BEE programme, renamed the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) in 2007, measures the transformation performance of companies across all sectors of the economy, according to a specified scorecard. In the absence of a media-specific transformation policy, the Act serves as its transformation policy standard. This paper critiques the B-BBEE policy instrument in relation to print media transformation using Critical race theory, and related concepts, such as racial capitalism, and racial liberalism. The paper finds that despite the racial diversification of the racial composition of the media, B-BBEE is largely an illusion. The B-BBEE strategy has not changed the racial character of the economy, and fundamentally resulted in the co-optation of a small black elite into the wealthy white capitalist elite inherited from the apartheid era, where the ""power relationship"" reminiscent of apartheid still exists and white privilege intersects with other forms of subordination such as gender and class.

Cross-Layer Software-Defined 5G Network,"In the past few decades, the world has witnessed a rapid growth in mobile communication and reaped great benefits from it. Even though the fourth generation (4G) mobile communication system is just being deployed worldwide, proliferating mobile demands call for newer wireless communication technologies with even better performance. Consequently, the fifth generation (5G) system is already emerging in the research field. However, simply evolving the current mobile networks can hardly meet such great expectations, because over the years the infrastructures have generally become ossified, closed, and vertically constructed. Aiming to establish a new paradigm for 5G mobile networks, in this article, we propose a cross-layer software-defined 5G network architecture. By jointly considering both the network layer and the physical layer together, we establish the two software-defined programmable components, the control plane and the cloud computing pool, which enable an effective control of the mobile network from the global perspective and benefit technological innovations. Specifically, by the cross-layer design for software-defining, the logically centralized and programmable control plane abstracts the control functions from the network layer down to the physical layer, through which we achieve the fine-grained controlling of mobile network, while the cloud computing pool provides powerful computing capability to implement the baseband data processing of multiple heterogeneous networks. The flexible programmability feature of our architecture makes it convenient to deploy cross-layer technological innovations and benefits the network evolution. We discuss the main challenges of our architecture, including the fine-grained control strategies, network virtualization, and programmability. The architecture significantly benefits the convergence towards heterogeneous networks and enables much more controllable, programmable and evolvable mobile networks.

Qualitative methods used include key informant interviews, transect walks and observation. The application is in the Bugesera District of Rwanda. The main study finding is that there are relationships between minigrids, fuels, values, beliefs and traditions that influence uptake and vice-versa. The emphasis on of productive use is revisited to suggest inclusion of norms such as Agakiriro - making wealth through small scale business enterprises; Ubudehe - mutual assistance welfare practice; new material realities of the modern Rwandan household; local and international technological innovations; old programs - One Laptop Per Child; imihigo - a tradition of goal setting translating to performance contracts, and Made in Rwanda - enhancing the domestic market through value chain development. Inclusion of gender concerns in the push for productive use of electricity and in renewable energy policy can promote sustainable value chain creation and inclusive business model development. Finally, we reflect on policy considerations for stakeholders working in energy development in Rwanda and elsewhere.",Not About Sufficiency
Drivers for economic recovery: analysis of family expenditure on catering services,"Purpose: Catering services play important role in the Spanish economy, accounting for 6.2% of GDP in 2021. To overcome the adverse economic impacts of COVID-19, catering services are considered one of the drivers to stimulate economic growth. Hence, the main aim of this paper is to analyse the sociodemographic profile of the family's main breadwinner who allocates most of his expenditure budget on different catering services before and during the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 in Spain. Design/methodology/approach: The official Family Budget Survey in Spain was used. This offers information on expenditure by families in 2019 and 2020. CHAID multivariate analysis was employed. This has proved a valuable tool in predicting expenditure, as well as determining the cause-effect relationship of this expenditure. Findings: Findings establish the main breadwinner's expenditure on catering services based on predictors such as ""year"" affected by the pandemic; ""type of employment contract""; ""gender""; and ""age"". A gender ""pub-gap"" in consumption in bars and cafes has been revealed, and families with a male breadwinner, on a permanent contract, between the age of 40 and 60 spent the most on catering services. Originality/value: This research presents a new interdisciplinary approach to family breadwinners as a company whose spend on catering is shaping the economic recovery and leading to new answers for hospitality management. Identified factors can lead to improved decision-making and contextualisation of economic models for food service providers in a post-pandemic future.",Not About Sufficiency
Current and future carbon stocks of natural forests in China,"Natural regeneration of forests is the most cost-effective and most technically straightforward strategy to mitigate climate change. Natural forests account for 71% of China's forested area, but their carbon stocks and sequestration potentials remain unclear. Here, we compiled data from 762 natural forest sites across China and found that natural forests had a carbon stock of 9.40 +/- 1.45 Pg C in 2010. When naturally regenerated to the over-mature stage, existing natural forests can additionally sequestrate 8.67 +/- 6.93 Pg C in the next two centuries, accounting for 48% of the carbon carrying capacity of the natural forest ecosystem in China, i.e. 18.07 +/- 6.78 Pg C. Future carbon sequestration potential in natural forests is dominated by the tree layer at 6.88 +/- 6.87 Pg, followed by the shrub layer at 1.02 +/- 0.55 Pg, floor layer at 0.72 +/- 0.74 Pg and herb layer at 0.05 +/- 0.10 Pg. The natural forests are expected to achieve 70% of their future carbon sequestration potential by 2100. We also note that assisted regeneration via tree planting can play a significant role in natural forest restoration, as the carbon densities of natural and planted forests are rarely significantly different at the same age under 60 years old. Therefore, the preservation and expansion of natural forests is the key strategy for achieving long-term carbon sequestration.",Not About Sufficiency
Cyanobacteria decay alters CH4 and CO2 produced hotspots along vertical sediment profiles in eutrophic lakes,"Cyanobacteria-derived organic carbon has been reported to intensify greenhouse gas emissions from lacustrine sediments. However, the specific processes of CH4 4 and CO2 2 production and release from sediments into the atmosphere remain unclear, especially in eutrophic lakes. To investigate the influence of severe cyanobacteria accumulation on the production and migration of sedimentary CH4 4 and CO2, 2 , this study examined the different trophic level lakes along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The results demonstrated that eutrophication amplified CH4 4 and CO2 2 emissions, notably in Lake Taihu, where fluxes peaked at 929.9 and 7222.5 mu mol/m2 & sdot;h, 2 & sdot;h, mirroring dissolved gas levels in overlying waters. Increased sedimentary organic carbon raised dissolved CH4 4 and CO2 2 concentrations in pore-water, with isotopic tracking showing cyanobacteriaderived carbon specifically elevated CH4 4 and CO2 2 in surface sediment pore-water more than in deeper layers. Cyanobacteria-derived carbon deposition on surface sediment boosted organic carbon and moisture levels, fostering an anaerobic microenvironment conducive to enhanced biogenic CH4 4 and CO2 2 production in surface sediments. In the microcosm systems with the most severe cyanobacteria accumulation, average CH4 4 and CO2 2 concentrations in surface sediments reached 6.9 and 2.3 mol/L, respectively, surpassing the 4.7 and 1.4 mol/L observed in bottom sediments, indicating upward migration of CH4 4 and CO2 2 hotspots from deeper to surface layers. These findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying lake sediment carbon emissions induced by eutrophication and provide a more accurate assessment of lake carbon emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
Cyclic deformation and twinning in a semi-solid processed AZ91D magnesium alloy,"To improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, magnesium alloys are being considered for automotive and aerospace applications because of their high strength-to-weight ratio. The structural applications of magnesium components require understanding of low cycle fatigue (LCF) behavior, since cyclic or thermal stresses are frequently encountered in many structural applications. The objective of this study was to examine LCF behavior and the role of twinning on cyclic deformation characteristics in a semi-solid processed (thixomolded) AZ91D magnesium alloy. The semi-solid thixomolded alloy showed a significantly higher fatigue life than its die cast counterpart especially at the lower strain amplitudes. The alloy was cyclically stable at lower strain amplitudes (0.1-0.2%); exhibited cyclic softening followed by cyclic hardening for the remaining life at intermediate strain amplitudes (0.3-0.8%) and cyclic hardening at higher strain amplitudes (1.0-1.2%). As the total strain amplitude increased, the stress amplitude and plastic strain amplitude increased, while the pseudoelastic modulus decreased. Unlike the wrought magnesium alloys reported in the literature, the hysteresis loops of the thixomolded AZ91D alloy were symmetrical in tension and compression. However, a strong non-linear or pseudoelastic stress-strain characteristic remained in both ascending and descending phases especially at higher strain amplitudes due to the occurrence of twinning and detwinning during cyclic deformation. Two types of twins (wider lenticular extension twins and narrower banded contraction twins) were observed in some favorably oriented larger primary alpha-Mg grains near the fracture surface. Fatigue life increased with decreasing strain ratio, and partial mean stress relaxation occurred mainly in the initial 10-20% of fatigue life. Fatigue crack initiation was observed to occur from the specimen surface or near-surface defects, and crack propagation was characterized by striation-like features. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Nitrous oxide emission during denitrifying phosphorus removal process: A review on the mechanisms and influencing factors,"Excessive emissions of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollutants are leading to increased eutrophication of water bodies. Biological N and P removal processes have become a research priority in the field of sewage treatment with the aim of improving sewage discharge standards in countries worldwide. Denitrifying P removal processes are more efficient for solving problems related to carbon source competition, sludge age conflict, and high aeration energy consumption compared to traditional biological N and P removal processes, but they are easy to produce nitrous oxide (N2O) in the process of sewage treatment. N2O is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential approximately 190-270 times that of CO2 and 4-21 times that of CH4, which was produced and released into the environmental in denitrifying P removal systems under conditions of a low C/N ratio, high dissolved oxygen, and low activity of denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms (DPAOs). This paper reviews the emission characteristics and influencing factors of N2O during denitrifying P removal processes and proposes appropriate strategies for controlling the emission of N2O. This work serves as a basis for the development of new sewage treatment processes and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in future wastewater treatment plants.",Not About Sufficiency
Do Kenya's climate change mitigation ambitions necessitate large-scale renewable energy deployment and dedicated low-carbon energy policy?,"In this paper Kenya's climate change mitigation ambitions are analysed from an energy system perspective, with a focus on the role of renewable and other low-carbon energy technologies. At COP-21 in 2015 in Paris, Kenya has committed to a 'nationally determined contribution' of reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in 2030 in comparison to a business-as-usual projection. An efficient exploitation of the country's renewable energy resources is key to achieving this target. We use the TIAM-ECN model to characterize plausible development pathways for the Kenyan energy mix until 2050 under different climate change mitigation scenarios. We conclude that the power sector can expand with mostly renewable energy options even in the absence of stringent greenhouse gas abatement targets. On the contrary, on the demand side a substantial deployment of low-carbon technologies is triggered only when ambitious emission reduction objectives are in place. The introduction of these technologies entails additional energy system costs, ranging in 2050 from 0.5% to 2% of the country's GDP. Our analysis supports the feasibility of Kenyan climate management goals, provided that adequate investments in renewable and other low-carbon energy technologies are timely made available.

A compactness measure of sustainable building forms,"Global population growth and urbanization necessitate countless more buildings in this century, causing an unprecedented increase in energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, waste generation and resource use. It is imperative to achieve maximal efficiency in buildings quickly. The building envelope is a key element to address environmental concerns, as it is responsible for thermal transfers to the outdoors, causing energy demand and carbon emissions. It also requires cladding, thus consuming a significant amount of finite resources. This paper investigates the relationship between surface area and indoor space to unravel the sustainability of building forms. Firstly, we demonstrate what the optimal form is. Secondly, as a single definite form is of little use in practice, we develop a scale-independent metric to measure the degree of optimality of building forms and show its practical use. This newly developed metric can significantly help in early design stages, by quantifying how much a building form deviates from optimality and identifying the domain of alternative geometries to bring us closer to it. This compactness measure also represents a theoretical basis for further research, to explore how optimality changes when additional parameters are factored in. It therefore contributes to both theory and practice to support global efforts towards sustainable built environments.",Not About Sufficiency
EXIT STRATEGIES FOR COVID 19: AN ISM AND MICMAC APPROACH,"COVID 19 pandemic is the worst crisis that mankind has seen since World War-II. It has exposed glaring loopholes in the healthcare system and led to a global health crisis. In absence of any specific treatment or vaccine, countries began to enforce strict lockdown measures leading to a complete shutdown of economic activities. The purpose of this study is to identify key exit strategies that can be implemented to mitigate the impacts of COVID 19. Identification and categorisation of parameters have been achieved using multi criterion decision making techniques of Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and Cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification MICMAC analysis. The study highlights a classification of key strategies based on their driving power and dependence which may enable Government to strengthen the disease surveillance system and effectively reduce the impact of the disease. The findings of the study suggest that Environmental Sustainability and Human Well-being; Online Awareness and Capacity Building Programme; Graded Surveillance-Targeted Restrictions and Stricter norms for Inter-State Mobility; and Harmonization between Centre, State and Local Authorities are the most important strategies that needs to be factored in while planning for the post lockdown economic recovery. With countries eager to resume economic activities, the strategies identified in our study can assist the governments and policymakers across the world in devising their exit plans while giving due consideration to each of the strategies to counter the disruptions brought about by the COVID 19 pandemic.",Not About Sufficiency
Tentative identification of polar and mid-polar compounds in extracts from wine lees by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in high-resolution mode,"Sustainable agriculture has a pending goal in the revalorization of agrofood residues. Wine lees are an abundant residue in the oenological industry. This residue, so far, has been used to obtain tartaric acid or pigments but not for being qualitatively characterized as a source of polar and mid-polar compounds such as flavonoids, phenols and essential amino acids. Lees extracts from 11 Spanish wineries have been analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in high resolution mode. The high-resolution power of LC-MS/MS has led to the tentative identification of the most representative compounds present in wine lees, comprising primary amino acids, anthocyans, flavanols, flavonols, flavones and non-flavonoid phenolic compounds, among others. Attending to the profile and content of polar and mid-polar compounds in wine lees, this study underlines the potential of wine lees as an exploitable source to isolate interesting compounds.

Combining on-road measurements and life-cycle carbon emissions of flex-fuel vehicle,"The impact of the transport sector on global greenhouse gas emissions has triggered the development of regulations to limit carbon dioxide emissions. The measurement process for vehicle emissions is based on laboratory type-approval tests, which results in gap compared with on-road usage profiles. Although recently introduced vehicle technologies have increased energy efficiency, regulatory restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions necessitate additional solutions. The use of biofuels, such as ethanol, fosters carbon dioxide emissions mitigation in developing countries, such as Brazil. Flex-fuel vehicles are an important alternative technology for the transition to zero-emission vehicles. In addition to vehicle emissions, the fuel production chain also has emissions which depend on the efficiency of the process and feedstock origin. Consequently, this study focuses on flex-fuel vehicles by quantifying the gap between certification and real-world driving energy consumption and by calculating the well-to-wheel impacts accounting for user behaviour choices when refuelling the vehicles. The results show 15.1 and 24.2 % higher fuel consumption in real driving conditions compared to laboratory tests using gasoline and ethanol, respectively. The analysis of the impacts on a well-to-wheel basis confirms the effectiveness of ethanol in mitigating the impacts at the energy production stage. Based on the fuels used in this study, first-generation ethanol leads to a 58 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared with gasoline. Considering second-generation ethanol, the difference increases to up to 73 % lower emissions than gasoline. These results contribute to increasing consumer awareness, which plays an important role in mitigating environmental impacts.",Not About Sufficiency

Decarbonizing our environment via the promotion of biomass methanation in developing nations: a waste management tool,"For a long time, fossil fuel has been a part of our everyday lives and has constantly led to the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the environment. The release of methane (CH4) into our surroundings can be caused by the decomposition of organic wastes produced by our daily activities; CH4 produced by human activity is responsible for at least 25 % of global warming. CH4 is a known potent greenhouse gas that can trap about 35 times more heat than CO2. These greenhouse gases play a role in climate change and global warming. It, therefore, becomes important to explore measures for decarbonizing our environment. Biomethane production using our generated waste is a promising decarbonization approach with significant potential for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This paper overviews potential biomass methanation feedstocks and investigates several technologies, such as anaerobic digestion, combined pyrolysis and methanation, and combined gasification and methanation. SWOT analysis of waste conversion to biomethane was conducted, and important points related to the scaling-up of biomethane production processes were outlined. Also, insights into prospects for promoting biomass methanation deployment were provided. In conclusion, biomass methanation has great potential for producing sustainable energy. Hence, collaboration between industrialists, researchers, government agencies, and stakeholders including an understanding of the financial investments, return on investments, or potential subsidies and incentives could enhance the practicality of the proposed solution. Research and development should be continuously carried out as they are necessary to scale up and promote the technology. Also, there should be technical training for stakeholders as it is essential for the smooth development of the sector.",Not About Sufficiency
Deciphering electron-shuttling characteristics of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and ingredients for bioelectricity generation in microbial fuel cells,"Prior studies mentioned that extracts of polyphenolics-abundant edible flora might provide compositions of reversible electron shuttles for bioenergy extraction; however, detailed mysteries behind such phenomena still remained open to be explored. This first-attempt study selected a medicinal herb Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and its main flavonoid ingredients to quantitatively decipher their electron-mediating activities for bioenergy applications. The main ingredients with strong shuttling activities (e.g., baicalin, baicalein and wogonin) were chemical structure-associated to disclose electrochemical and bioenergetics characteristics for comparative analysis. Evidently, baicalin owned the most promising electron shuttling capabilities. Although extract of flavonoids-rich S. baicalensis Georgi also showed promising redox-mediating characteristics, typical ingredient-baicalein still exhibited high biotoxicity to bacterial CO2 respirometric production, thereby resisting fully expression of electron transfer capabilities. Supplementation of baicalin and extract of S. baicalensis Georgi to microbial fuel cells (MFCs) was conducted to quantify such stimulating capabilities of bioelectricity generation. That is, with toxicity attenuation, processed flavonoids-rich medicinal herbs were possibly electroactive for bioenergy extraction due to favorable electron-shuttling activities.

Decommissioning: another critical challenge for energy transitions,"To achieve the dual goals of minimising global pollution and meeting diverse demands for environmental justice, energy transitions need to involve not only a shift to renewable energy sources but also the safe decommissioning of older energy infrastructures and management of their toxic legacies. While the global scale of the decommissioning challenge is yet to be accurately quantified, the climate impacts are significant: each year, more than an estimated 29 million abandoned oil and gas wells around the world emit 2.5 million tons of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. In the US alone, at least 14 million people live within a mile of an abandoned oil or gas well, creating pollution that is concentrated among low-income areas and communities of colour. The costs involved in decommissioning projects are significant, raising urgent questions about responsibility and whether companies who have profited from the sale of extracted resources will be held liable for clean-up, remediation and management costs. Recognising these political goals and policy challenges, this article invites further research, scrutiny and debate on what would constitute the successful and safe decommissioning of sites affected by fossil fuel operations - with a particular focus on accountability, environmental inequality, the temporality of energy transitions, and strategies for phasing out or phasing down fossil fuel extraction.",Not About Sufficiency
Deforestation and Forest Degradation Due to Gold Mining in the Peruvian Amazon: A 34-Year Perspective,"While deforestation rates decline globally they are rising in the Western Amazon. Artisanal-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a large cause of this deforestation and brings with it extensive environmental, social, governance, and public health impacts, including large carbon emissions and mercury pollution. Underlying ASGM is a broad network of factors that influence its growth, distribution, and practices such as poverty, flows of legal and illegal capital, conflicting governance, and global economic trends. Despite its central role in land use and land cover change in the Western Amazon and the severity of its social and environmental impacts, it is relatively poorly studied. While ASGM in Southeastern Peru has been quantified previously, doing so is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of the resulting landscape. Using a novel approach to classify mining that relies on a fusion of CLASlite and the Global Forest Change dataset, two Landsat-based deforestation detection tools, we sought to quantify ASGM-caused deforestation in the period 1984-2017 in the southern Peruvian Amazon and examine trends in the geography, methods, and impacts of ASGM across that time. We identify nearly 100,000 ha of deforestation due to ASGM in the 34-year study period, an increase of 21% compared to previous estimates. Further, we find that 10% of that deforestation occurred in 2017, the highest annual amount of deforestation in the study period, with 53% occurring since 2011. Finally, we demonstrate that not all mining is created equal by examining key patterns and changes in ASGM activity and techniques through time and space. We discuss their connections with, and impacts on, socio-economic factors, such as land tenure, infrastructure, international markets, governance efforts, and social and environmental impacts.",Not About Sufficiency
Delineating transformative value creation through service communications: an integrative framework,"Purpose Transformative value is a central tenet of transformative service research (TSR) because it affects individual and community well-being, quality of life and sustainability. Although transformative value plays a significant role in well-being, the literature suffers from a lack of sound interdisciplinary conceptual frameworks that delineate how transformative value is created in services throughout the service consumption process. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the nature and role of service communications during the various stages of the service consumption process to enable the creation of transformative value for people and the environment. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the above goal, the authors integrate agenda-setting theory (media theory) combined with framing and relational dialectics (communication theories) as well as TSR. Findings In line with the objectives of the study, the authors propose an integrative framework named Transformative Value Creation via Service Communications (TVCSC) that explains how firms set their transformative corporate agendas through their dialectics with consumers, society and media. This transformative agenda is reflected in the marketing mix of their services (7Ps) as communicated with various means, physically and digitally (sales/frontline personnel, advertising, CSR, social media and website). Recommendations for a transformative marketing mix are provided. Furthermore, TVCSC illustrates how value is co-created in all customer-firm interactions via relationship dialectics throughout the service consumption process to result in transformative value outcomes.

Democratic Backsliding and the Instrumentalization of Women's Rights in Turkey,"This article examines the instrumentalization of women's rights and the transformation of the gender rights regime in the context of democratic backsliding in Turkey. I show how the Islamically rooted Justice and Development Party governments and their allies used women's rights in constructing authoritarian rule and promoting a conservative gender agenda. The governing elites had different needs at different political stages and instrumentalized women's rights to meet those needs. First, they needed to legitimize their rule in a secular context, so they expanded liberal laws on women's rights. Second, in the process of backsliding, they sought to construct and legitimize their conservative ideology, so they reinterpreted existing laws to promote conservative goals. Finally, they wanted to mobilize conservative women in support of the newly authoritarian regime, so they built new institutions and marginalized existing women's NGOs.

Optimization of Coke Oven Gas Desulfurization and Combined Cycle Power Plant Electricity Generation,"Many steel refineries generate significant quantities of coke oven gas (COG), which is in some cases used only to generate low pressure steam and small amounts of electric power. In order to improve energy efficiency and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, a combined cycle power plant (CCPP) where COG is used as fuel is proposed. However, desulfurization is necessary before the COG can be used as a fuel input for a CCPP. Using a local steel refinery as a case study, a proposed desulfurization process is designed to limit the H2S content in COG to less than 1 ppmv, and simulated using ProMax. In addition, the proposed CCPP plant is simulated in Aspen Plus and is optimized using GAMS to global optimality with net present value as the objective function. Furthermore, the carbon tax is considered in this study. The optimized CCPP plant was observed to generate more than twice the electrical efficiency when compared to the status quo for the existing steel refinery. Thus, by generating more electricity within the plant gate, the need to purchase electricity reduces, and hence reducing the lifecycle of CO2 emissions considerably.",Not About Sufficiency
Deoxynivalenol and ochratoxin A in German wheat and changes of level in relation to storage parameters,The occurrence of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and ochratoxin A (OTA) in the winter wheat of 1997 and 1998 grown under organic farming conditions was investigated using ELISAs (R-Biopharm(R)) for quantification. The influence of delayed drying of the grain after harvest on the development of DON and OTA was determined in storage trials (moisture: 17% and 20%; temperature: 20 degreesC; duration: four and six weeks). The Tox5 PCR assay was used both to detect Fusarium species with the potential to produce trichothecenes and as a measure of their relative DNA content during the storage trials. The intensity of the PCR signals was correlated with the DON concentration. Fusarium species were identified microscopically by standard methods. All the freshly harvested grain samples were contaminated with DON and showed further increases in the DON concentration during storage. OTA contamination was found in 14.3% of the 1997 samples and in 24.1% of the 1998 samples. OTA increased during storage trials of the 1997 samples but not in the 1998 samples.,Not About Sufficiency
Design for Social Sustainability: Using Digital Fabrication in the Humanitarian and Development Sector,"The demand for humanitarian and development aid has risen to an unprecedented level in recent years. With a pressing need for new solutions, designers have started using digital fabrication (3D printing, CNC milling and laser cutting) to produce life-saving items. However, many organisations are failing to create the impacts they desire, and the social aspect of sustainability has been largely overlooked. This paper addresses this gap in knowledge by investigating guidelines for Design for Social Sustainability, specifically looking at digital fabrication for humanitarian and development projects. Building on existing literature and conducting three in-depth case studies of healthcare related products, the research develops a framework for Design for Social Sustainability. It provides useful guidelines to help plan and evaluate digital fabrication projects in the humanitarian and development sector. The findings show how design can trigger social sustainability at product, process and paradigm levels. Specifically, the case studies reveal the potential for digital fabrication to lead to more systems-focused, radical social sustainability.

Detecting Urban Emissions Changes and Events With a Near-Real-Time-Capable Inversion System,"In situ observing networks are increasingly being used to study greenhouse gas emissions in urban environments. While the need for sufficiently dense observations has often been discussed, density requirements depend on the question posed and interact with other choices made in the analysis. Focusing on the interaction of network density with varied meteorological information used to drive atmospheric transport, we perform geostatistical inversions of methane flux in the South Coast Air Basin, California, in 2015-2016 using transport driven by a locally tuned Weather Research and Forecasting configuration as well as by operationally available meteorological products. We find total-basin flux estimates vary by as much as a factor of two between inversions, but the spread can be greatly reduced by calibrating the estimates to account for modeled sensitivity. Using observations from the full Los Angeles Megacities Carbon Project observing network, inversions driven by low-resolution generic wind fields are robustly sensitive (p<0.05) to seasonal differences in methane flux and to the increase in emissions caused by the 2015 Aliso Canyon natural gas leak. When the number of observing sites is reduced, the basin-wide sensitivity degrades, but flux events can be detected by testing for changes in flux variance, and even a single site can robustly detect basin-wide seasonal flux variations. Overall, an urban monitoring system using an operational methane observing network and off-the-shelf meteorology could detect many seasonal or event-driven changes in near real timeand, if calibrated to a model chosen as a transfer standard, could also quantify absolute emissions.",Not About Sufficiency

"Determining the trade-environment composition effect: the role of capital, labor and environmental regulations","This paper argues that pollution-intensive sectors may be subject to opposing forces of comparative advantage since these sectors are also typically capital intensive, yet regions with low environmental regulations tend to be those that are the least capital abundant.

The contribution of the paper is threefold; first, we provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of the determinants of four common pollutants, paying particular attention to the nature of the trade-induced composition effect; second, we investigate whether the result of Antweiler et al. (Amer. Econom. Rev. 91 (2001) 877), who find evidence that both environmental regulations and capital-labor endowments determine sulfur dioxide concentrations, also holds for sulfur dioxide emissions; third, we examine whether this result holds for altogether different pollutants.

Historically, models of these systems have been developed in isolation, and many agencies have already invested large amounts of time and money into developing these independent models. It is thus often desirable to couple existing models, rather than to develop a completely new integrated model. Coupling together independently developed models introduces many challenges including dealing with different spatial and temporal scales, base datasets and levels of aggregation, as well as bringing up deeper questions around the underlying paradigms, assumptions and limitations of the models. This paper describes the key challenges encountered when coupling an existing integrated model of land use change, economic activity, and population (the 'Integrated Scenario Explorer' model) with an existing transport model (the 'Wellington Transport Strategy Model') for the Wellington region in New Zealand. The case study results show that the coupling produces substantial differences in the urban land use change looking forward to 2041, specifically it affects the location of the urban intensification. The paper summarises the important considerations for modellers when coupling independently developed models, highlights the importance of understanding the underlying theories of the component models, and emphasises the need to develop pragmatic solutions that are guided by the intended use of the resulting integrated model.",Not About Sufficiency
Developing spatial inequalities in carbon appropriation: A sociological analysis of changing local emissions across the United States,"This study examines an overlooked dynamic in sociological research on greenhouse gas emissions: how local areas appropriate the global carbon cycle for use and exchange purposes as they develop. Drawing on theories of place and space, we hypothesize that development differentially drives and spatially decouples use- and exchange-oriented emissions at the local level. To test our hypotheses, we integrate longitudinal, county-level data on residential and industrial emissions from the Vulcan Project with demographic, economic and environmental data from the U.S. Census Bureau and National Land Change Database. Results from spatial regression models with two-way fixed-effects indicate that alongside innovations and efficiencies capable of reducing environmentally harmful effects of development comes a spatial disarticulation between carbon-intensive production and consumption within as well as across societies. Implications for existing theory, methods and policy are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Development and assessment of an integrated wind-solar based energy system for sustainable communities,"In order to address the growing demands for clean energy, coupled with the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this study concerns a newly developed hybrid renewable energy system, which integrates solar and wind energy options, augmented with compressed air energy storage and battery storage solutions. The novelty of this paper stems around the diversification of energy storage solutions, which allows for meeting a highly variable demands in a more efficient and carbon-free manner. The present system is designed to provide a sustainable solution for the communities and is, in this regard, applied to supply the essential energy needs for a small city of about 5000 homes. The electricity is generated through a wind farm as well as power production from the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and stored depending on the demands. The district heating and cooling loads are supplied from parabolic trough dishes, concentrated on a solar tower and processed through heating and refrigeration subsystems. Following the system development, the comprehensive thermodynamic analysis, optimization study and life cycle assessments are comparatively conducted. The proposed energy system ach-ieves the energy and exergy efficiencies of 50.3 % and 44.1 % respectively. The ORC subsystem accounts for the highest exergy destruction in the system. The solar farm achieves an energy efficiency of 85 % and an exergy efficiency of 65 %, respectively. The ORC subsystem accounts for 59.7 % of the environmental impact throughout all impact categories due to the system irreversibilities and heat losses.",Not About Sufficiency
Development and Evaluation of High-Speed Differential Warning Application Using Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication,"Connected vehicle (CV) technology has show in great potential in enhancing safety, mobility, and environmental sustainability of road way transportation system s by enabling vehicles and in frastructure to exchange real-time information through wireless communications. The information available through CV technology has heen used to develop a variety of onboard driver assistance tools and applications. This paper presents an innovative, safety-focused CV application called the high-speed differential warning (HSDW). The application identifies potential hazards resulting from high-speed differentials between HSDW-equipped vehicles (ego-vehicles) and surrounding remote vehicles and then provides alerts to drivers of ego-vehicles to help them take appropriate actions. In this research, real-world scenarios and parameters of the HSDW application are first identified. A driver response strategy for each scenario is then developed in consonance with findings from a public survey on the HSDW application. Next, a comprehensive evaluation of various scenarios is conducted with a well-calibrated Paramics traffic microscopic simulation tool set up for a real-world traffic network. Finally, the safety performance of HSDW-equipped vehicles, unequipped vehicles, and overall traffic is analyzed with the surrogate safety assessment model. Results demonstrate that the proposed HSDW application improves the safety performance of ego-vehicles without com promising the mobility and environmental sustainability performance of the overall traffic.",Not About Sufficiency
Development of a multidisciplinary approach to assess regional sustainability,"There are a number of established, scientifically supported metrics of sustainability. Many of the metrics are data-intensive and require extensive effort to collect data and compute the metrics. Moreover, individual metrics do not capture all aspects of a system that are relevant to sustainability. A pilot project was initiated to create an approach to measure, monitor, and maintain prosperity and environmental quality of a regional system. The goal was to produce a straightforward, inexpensive methodology that is simple to use and interpret. This requires historical data be readily accessible, metrics must be applicable to the relevant scale, and results must meet the needs of decision-makers. Because sustainability is a multidimensional concept, the research group consisted of a multidisciplinary team that identified the major components of an environmental system. We selected metrics to capture the multidimensionality of sustainability in environmental systems and included: (1) emergy to capture the quality-normalized flow of energy through the system; (2) ecological footprint to capture the impact of humans on the system; (3) green net regional product to estimate human prosperity and well being within the system; and (4) Fisher information to capture the dynamic order of the system. We were able to compute metrics for a test geographic region using existing datasets. Preliminary analysis indicates that each metric reveals a somewhat different trend. These preliminary findings support the idea that characterization of sustainability requires a multidisciplinary approach and demonstrate the need to measure multiple aspects of an environmental system.",Not About Sufficiency
Development of a new plant factory concept with sustainable water and energy supply,"As the global population exceeds 8 billion and is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, the demand for sustainable food production has become increasingly pressing. This study investigates the integration of aquaponics into solar-assisted plant factories as an innovative solution to enhance agricultural productivity and minimize environmental impacts. The aquaponics establishes a closed-loop nutrient cycle, utilizing fish waste to nourish plants and optimize water recycling. Employing a two-tiered design, optimized through the Design of Experiments (DOE), the system enables effective resource management and operational efficiency. Operational data reveal the system's ability to maintain favorable temperature and humidity conditions, promoting uniform plant growth. The analysis identifies the mist irrigation method and LED lighting as critical factors that positively influence both root and leaf growth, establishing an optimal combination for sustainable cultivation. These findings underscore the potential of renewable energy-powered plant factories as a viable model for sustainable food production, contributing to local food self-sufficiency and regional economic revitalization. This research highlights the importance of advancing innovative agricultural practices to address the dual challenges of population growth and climate change, advocating for the development and implementation of sustainable technologies to secure future food production.",Not About Sufficiency
Digitally-enabled sustainable supply chains in the 21st century: A review and a research agenda,"While the potential benefits of integrating digital technologies and supply chain management have been widely reported, less is known concerning the current state-of-the-art literature on big data-driven sustainable supply chains. Therefore, this study aims to systematise published studies which address the implications of big data for sustainable supply chain management. Through a systematic literature review, this work makes three significant contributions: (a) it provides an overview of extant literature on this topic in recent years; (b) it proposes seven gaps in the literature in order to foster future investigations on big data-driven sustainable supply chains; (c) it offers four lessons for business practitioners aiming to use big data for sustainable supply chain practices. These lessons suggest that: developing big data analytics capability has to become a business priority in order to effectively build competitive sustainable supply chains; big data has benefits for each of the dimensions of the triple-bottom-line in supply chains; the implementation of big data for sustainability in supply chains presents some challenges for firms; the development of complementary organizational capabilities is needed to overcome challenges and facilitate the benefits of big data technology for sustainable supply chain management.

Pricing strategy of environmental sustainable supply chain with internalizing externalities,"The negative impact of business activities on resources and sustainability include pollution and environmental externalities, which are becoming more severe and attracting worldwide attention. This study investigates a mechanism for motivating supply chain members to collaboratively produce environmentally friendly products (EFPs), with an investment in pollution reduction and prevention and by considering environmental regulations and incentive policies From the perspective of supply chain members, we focus on studying optimal pricing strategies for environmentally sustainable supply chains and the relationship between firm performance and environmental policy incentives. By treating the EFP as an investment project, its economic feasibility can be evaluated in the context of the supply chain. Unlike traditional supply chain models, in our model, government policy incentives are shared within the supply chain through transfer price negotiations between manufacturers and suppliers. This study addresses the impact of government policy incentives on value transition and profit allotment in the collaborative supply chain system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Directions of Changes in the Functioning of Economic Instruments for the Environmental Policy in Poland,"Environmental policy instruments allow incorporating the problem of using the natural resources into the decision-making process of individual agents. One of the most efficient instruments for environmental protection are economic instruments, the indirect methods of influencing agents' behaviour. The aim of the article is to present the state of the Polish system of economic instruments in the light of other European countries' experiences (especially the European Union countries) and prospects for the use of economic instruments in the environmental policy during the oncoming years. The study is based on a subject literature review, reports ordered by the Polish Ministry of Environment and publications published by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Environment Agency (EEA). The analysis suggests that economic instruments are widely used in the Polish environmental policy. The main economic instruments in this policy are environmental charges and fines. Some of these charges and fines have been used in the Polish environmental policy for several dozen years. Revenues from these instruments are earmarked for environmental expenditures. There are also some new, interesting economic instruments applied in the Polish environmental policy, such as: depositrefund systems, tradable energy certificates and emissions trading scheme. There are some opportunities for expanding the use of economic instruments for the environmental policy in Poland. For example, there could be increased the use of some environmental charges or taxes, and the environmental insurance. Poland could also implement an environmental tax reform.",Not About Sufficiency
Discontinuous functions and environmental regulation,Environmental economics generally employs marginal logic. This is often useful for conceptual demonstrations even if not always literally proffered for policy. This paper argues that more realistic discontinuous schedules are suggested by the development economics literature and these have interesting and counter-intuitive policy implications. The cases examined suggest more stringent environmental regulations and the use of continuous fine functions.,Not About Sufficiency
Dissent and descent: tracing Canada's environmental governance from regulatory beginnings to dismissal and reversals by the Harper government,"Since Confederation in 1867, official Canadian settler government policy on the environment has sought to simultaneously preserve ""wilderness"" and exploit natural resources for market gain. In the 1960s, the nascent North American modern environmental movement pushed for stronger regulation on pollution and toxics - and a more institutionalised state-led response to environmental problems emerged. Throughout the last five decades, three principal ""eras"" of federal government reaction have emerged in response to mounting scientific evidence and public pressure to act on environmental issues. The first, from the late-1960s to mid-1980s, saw the development and implementation of early environmental policy and programmes. The second era, from the mid-1980s to mid-2000s co-occurred alongside the rise of the sustainable development paradigm, and is marked by the Canadian government's attempt at leadership on the global stage. The third era, from the mid-2000s to 2015, demonstrates a shift from environmental regime-building and multilateral collaboration toward rollbacks and obstructionism. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the government of Canada reversed decades of progress and cooperation on the environment and sustainable development through its muzzling of government scientists, superficial co-optation of climate policy, rollbacks of environmental legislation and disparagement of environmental activists. In total, by shifting the federal government from a position of ineffective benevolence on environmental issues to one of contention and antagonism, the Harper government's approach represents a departure from Canadian environmental governance norms and sought to remake the identity of Canada as an energy superpower inextricably tied to its oil and gas industry.",Not About Sufficiency
Diversity and Distribution of Methane Functional Microorganisms in Sedimentary Columns of Hongfeng Reservoir in Different Seasons,"Freshwater ecosystem is a significant natural source of CH4 emission in the atmosphere. To fully understand the dynamics of methane emissions in reservoirs, it is essential to grasp the temporal and vertical distribution patterns, as well as the factors that influence the methanogenic bacterial communities within the sediments. This study investigates the methane dynamics, carbon isotope fractionation (delta(CH4)-C-13), and abundance of functional microorganisms along the geochemical gradient in the in situ sedimentary column of Hongfeng Reservoir (China). Notably, the methane concentration in sediment in summer ranged in 15.39-127.22 mu mol/L, which is twice as high as wintertime concentrations in the surface layer near the sediment-water interface (0-10 cm depth). Illumina sequencing of the sediments identified 11 genera affiliated with methanogenic archaea, with dominant genus Methanosaeta reaching a relative abundance of 34.95% in summer. The total carbon (TOC) content in sedimentary columns in different seasons is positively correlated with Methanosarcina (P < 0.05). In addition, seasonal discrepancies are observed in the sediment profiles for total nitrogen (TN), sulfate (SO42-), and ferrous iron (Fe2+) concentrations. The concentration of total nitrogen (TN) is higher in summer than in winter. In summer, sulfate accumulates in the middle layer of the sedimentary column, while in winter, the maximum concentration of sulfate in the surface layer reaches 0.65 mmol/L. These geochemical gradients drive the biological transformation of nitrogen, sulfur, and iron, may also be linked to the consumption of methane. Thus, it is established that the temporal and spatial dynamics of methanogenic communities in sediments significantly influence the fluctuations in methane release fluxes within reservoirs, highlighting the necessity to account for seasonal biological variations when assessing greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs.",Not About Sufficiency
Do electricity flows hamper regional economic-environmental equity?,"Inter-regional electricity flows have mitigated the mismatch between electricity generation and demand. How-ever, not only environmental impact transfers but also economic benefits are embodied in electricity flows. Whether electricity flows affect the equity of regional economic-environmental sustainability, the exploration is not sufficient. In this paper, a multi-model framework has developed to trace the transfers of electricity envi-ronmental impacts (measured by metal-water-carbon) and economic benefits (measured by valued added) and the degree of equity in the economic-environmental sustainability embodied in electricity flows of China. The results reveal significant asymmetry between where the electricity metal-water-carbon and the electricity value added embodied in electricity flows are transferred. In total, 15.0%, 17.4% and 13.1% of consumption-based electricity metal-water-carbon were outsourced through the electricity flow network, respectively, while only 9.3% of consumption-based electricity value added was outsourced. Wealthier provinces (e.g., Beijing and Guangdong) outsourced a large share of electricity metal-water-carbon to other provinces through the electricity flow network but retained a large share of electricity value added. The REI index between the electricity metal -water-carbon and the electricity value added indicates that money and environmental impacts flowing in the opposite directions have higher inequity. Some provinces, including Shaanxi (the highest REI value at 2.02 was observed for Shaanxi-Gansu), have gained economic benefits from electricity flows, exploiting the advantages of their electricity structures. This study offers insights into helping policymakers better address the potential environmental and economic implications of electricity flows to ensure the sustainable growth of electricity production and consumption.",Not About Sufficiency
Do the Consumer Price Index's Utilities Adjustments for Owners' Equivalent Rent Distort Inflation Measurement?,"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important social index number, central to monetary policy, well being measurement, optimal pricing, and tax and contract escalation. Shelter costs have a large weight in the CPI, so their movements receive much attention. The CPI incorporates two shelter indexes: Rent, covering renters, and Owners' Equivalent Rent (OER), covering owners. Between 1999 and 2006, Rent and OER inflation twice diverged markedly; this occurred again recently. Because these indexes share a common data source-a large sample of market rents-such divergence often prompts questions about CPI methods, particularly the OER utilities adjustment. (This adjustment is necessary to produce an unbiased OER index, because many market rents include utilities, but OER is a rent-of-shelter concept.) The utilities adjustment procedure is no smoking gun. It was not the major cause of these divergences, and it generates no long-run inflation measurement bias. Nonetheless, it increases OER inflation volatility and can drive OER inflation far from its measurement goal in the short run. This article develops a theory of utilities adjustment and outlines a straightforward improvement of Bureau of Labor Statistics procedures that eliminates their undesirable properties. The short-run impact on inflation measurement can be very sizable.",Not About Sufficiency

Does climate policy uncertainty impair or improve corporate investment efficiency?,"Climate policy uncertainty (CPU) has been a topical issue given its widespread impacts, but its effect on corporate investment efficiency is arguable. Based on a sample of Chinese listed firms, we find that higher CPU results in lower investment levels while higher investment sensitivity to investment opportunities. This suggests that CPU improves investment efficiency by pushing firms to reduce investment expenditures and align their investment decisions more in line with investment opportunities. We name this finding as the pushback effect of CPU and find that it is more pronounced for firms with overinvestment or tight financial conditions.",Not About Sufficiency
Does digitalization mitigate regional inequalities? Evidence from China,"Regional inequality significantly infiuences sustainable development and human well-being. In China, there exists pronounced regional disparities in economic and digital advancements; however, scant research delves into the interplay between them. By analyzing the economic development and digitalization gaps at regional and city levels in China, extending the original Cobb-Douglas production function, this study aims to evaluate the impact of digitalization on China's regional inequality using seemingly unrelated regression. The results indicate a greater emphasis on digital inequality compared to economic disparity, with variable coefficients of 0.59 for GDP per capita and 0.92 for the digitalization index over the past four years. However, GDP per capita demonstrates higher spatial concentration than digitalization. Notably, both disparities have shown a gradual reduction in recent years. The southeastern region of the Hu Huanyong Line exhibits superior levels and rates of economic and digital advancement in contrast to the northwestern region. While digitalization propels economic growth, it yields a nuanced impact on achieving balanced regional development, encompassing both positive and negative facets. Our study highlights that the marginal utility of advancing digitalization is more pronounced in less developed regions, but only if the government invests in the digital infrastructure and education in these areas. This study's methodology can be utilized for subsequent research, and our findings hold the potential to the government's regional investment and policy-making.",Not About Sufficiency
Does environmental policy stringency reduce CO2 emissions? Evidence from high-polluted economies,"The main objective of this study is to get the asymmetric effects of environmental policy stringency on CO2 emissions in top emitter's economies named China, USA, India, Russia, and Japan by using non-linear panel ARDL approach. The non-linear model infers that an increase in environmental policy stringency improves the environmental quality by reducing CO2 emissions in the long run. While a negative change in environmental policy stringency is also reducing the CO2 emissions in the long run. Indeed the asymmetric effects between positive and negative change in the environmental policy stringency are also confirmed in magnitude only in the long-run, thus the policymakers should consider positive as well as negative changes while devising the rules and regulations related to the environment. The study suggests that the high polluted economies need to revisit green environmental regulations policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Does gender diversity moderate the relationship between CSR committees and Sustainable Development Goals disclosure? Evidence from Latin American companies,"Purpose - This study aims to investigate the association between the presence of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) disclosure, as well as the moderating role of gender diversity in this relation. Design/methodology/approach - The sample consists of 897 annual observations from 238 firms from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru for 2018-2020. The data were collected from the Refinitiv database. The proposed model and hypotheses were tested using the feasible generalized least squares estimation technique with heteroscedasticity and panel-specific AR1 autocorrelation. Findings - The results reveal that the presence of CSR committees positively influences the SDGs. Gender diversity positively moderates the relationship between CSR committees and SDGs. Leverage and firm size also positively impact the SDGs. On the other hand, board size and CEO duality negatively affect SDGs disclosure. Research limitations/implications - This study extends the scope of stakeholder theory by suggesting that CSR committees and gender diversity enable a better relationship for the firm with its stakeholders.Practical implications - The findings support policymakers and managers in improving sustainability disclosure. In addition, the results demonstrate the importance of CSR committees and gender diversity to meet the stakeholders' demands.Social implications - This study demonstrates how firms can improve sustainability issues through gender diversity and CSR committees.Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study complements previous literature by being the first to examine the moderating effect of gender diversity on the association between CSR committees and SDGs disclosure in the Latin American context.",Not About Sufficiency
Does Good Governance Enhance Happiness: A Cross Nation Study,"The purpose of this paper is to analyze the efficiency of the countries over the period of 10 years by applying data envelopment analysis (DEA). Based on rational and factual parameters such as freedom of press, freedom of religion, percentage of export in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), index of globalization, life expectancy at birth, gender ratio etc., this paper attempts to measure the efficiency of happiness. A combination of social and economic factors has been used to measure technical efficiency. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it measures the relative efficiency of all the countries included in the study. The nations have been ranked as per their relative efficiency and the peer group has been formed. Second a comparison between the rich and the poor countries have been done to test empirically whether the economic growth enhances the happiness among people. Presently, more than 3,000 studies have been published on happiness and Veenhoven in 2004 created a database called World Database of Happiness. The World Database of Happiness has attempted to present the available research findings on happiness. Part of the findings on happiness in nations is available in 'States of nations'. For the research purpose, States of Nations and the data published by have been considered. Although happiness has been quantified and the existing literature has sufficient empirical evidences of the same, in the present context, the relative efficiency has been calculated for the countries on basis of objective and subjective happiness parameters. As per the literature, happiness has two aspects (1) objective and (2) subjective. Objective parameters are external to the individuals and covers material living parameters viz. GDP growth, income, nutrition, mortality rate, literacy etc. However, Subjective indicators measure the quality of life of the individuals. These are summarized as ''subjective well-being''. The various parameters considered in the study capture different aspects of happiness. The result shows how the government can increase the happiness of the people by analyzing the behavior and expectations. People express their preference explicitly about political parties, religion believes, law and order situation, trust in official institutions etc. Although, the behavior of people largely depends upon availability of goods and services in the market, the government can make budgets according to priority or preferences of people. Another way to increase happiness can be done by analyzing the peer group, which is an outcome of DEA. This shows the nations which are similar in terms of their economic and social conditions. The government can compare the prevailing conditions in different countries that improve the condition in their respective country. This could be an effective method as some of the parameters can be replicable in order to make people happier. The limitation of this study is lack of availability of data for many countries. As the number of countries increases, a change in the relative efficiency can be observed. Therefore, a future study can be conducted where the relevant data can be collected and a more global result can be obtained.",Not About Sufficiency
Does renewable energy proactively contribute to mitigating carbon emissions in major fossil fuels consuming countries?,"The success of global climate initiatives (SDG-13, COP28) heavily depends on the actions of major fossil fuels consuming countries, as their continued reliance on these energy sources greatly impedes progress towards global climate objectives. Transitioning from the dominance of fossil fuels to the expansion of renewable energy is crucial for ensuring Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Conference on Parties (COP) objectives under UN climate change initiatives, as well as for achieving environmental sustainability. This study investigates the proactive role of renewable energy in enhancing environmental sustainability and evaluates the impact of fossil fuel consumption, real gross domestic product (RGDP), square of RGDP, and patents on carbon emissions in major fossil fuels consuming countries from 1990 to 2020 after considering and disregarding the EKC model. Two-way additive and interactive fixed effect models demonstrate a statistically significant negative effect of renewable energy on carbon emissions. A method of moments quantile regression endorses the asymmetric negative effects of renewable energy across different quantiles of CO2 emissions. According to the quantile regression, a low CO2 emitting country's environmental quality is largely sensitive to the consumption of renewable energy. Also, after considering heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence and endogeneity issues, the effect of renewable energy remains unchanged. On the contrary, unlike renewable energy, fossil fuel consumption, real GDP, square of real GDP, and patents have positive effects in most cases, worsening environmental quality by increasing CO2 levels. Therefore, based on these findings, our study emphasizes pivotal policy implications aimed at fostering a better environment in major fossil fuels consuming countries.",Not About Sufficiency
Does the regional atmospheric quality punishment incentive mechanism (AQPI) promote environmental regulation? Subordinate government as an agent of superior environmental policies,"Subordinate governments act as both agents of superior environmental policies and economic development leaders of the areas under their jurisdiction. The effectiveness of superior-level environmental policy is determined by the degree the subordinate governments are motivated to strengthen environmental regulation. Bottom-up punishment is introduced in the traditional top-down financial rewards to form a two-way atmospheric quality punishment incentive mechanism for the subordinate governments to improve environmental regulation. We take the atmospheric quality punishment incentive implemented in Shandong Province as a case, and the results show that the prefectural governments were encouraged to improve environmental regulation. However, the emission reductions were observed along with the decreased economic output in pollution intensive firms, not based on decreased intensity of key atmospheric pollutant emissions. In this case, the weighting and penalty price established for key pollutants should be increased, so that the subordinate governments can better assume the role of superior environmental policy agent.",Not About Sufficiency
Domestic Sources of Transnational Climate Governance,"Transnational climate governance (TCG) is an example of complex governance in which national governments no longer serve as reliable gatekeepers between nonstate and subnational actors and global governance. The articles in this special issue demonstrate that TCG and complex governance do not eliminate the importance of domestic political institutions and actors in explaining national variation in engagement with TCG. Rich democracies provide the most favorable political setting for participation in TCG. National policies that favor climate change mitigation produce greater engagement with TCG on the part of nonstate and subnational actors. The same political ecology that produces favorable national policies supports TCG participation: NGO presence and activism, affluent consumers that encourage corporations to engage with TCG, subnational governments with political incentives and fiscal space to undertake cross-border activism. Although direct effects by TCG on greenhouse gas emissions may be limited, TCG may have longer-run and second-order effects that are larger, particularly if commitments are more precise and binding. Overall, TCG illustrates a complementary rather than competitive relationship between national governments and complex governance, a relationship that should be investigated in other issue areas.",Not About Sufficiency
Driving factors of global carbon footprint pressure: Based on vegetation carbon sequestration,"Carbon sequestration capacity of vegetation plays an important role in global carbon emission reduction. Based on vegetation carbon sequestration, this paper establishes a carbon footprint pressure index to evaluate the carbon foot-print pressure in 60 sample countries, and discusses the driving factors that influence carbon footprint pressure in various countries through IPAT equation and Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index decomposition approach. The results indicate that the global carbon footprint pressure shows an upward trend from 2000 to 2015, mainly owing to population growth and rapid socioeconomic development; technological progress has a certain inhibitory effect on the rise of carbon footprint pressure. Furthermore, the overall carbon footprint pressure in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries shows a downward trend, while the carbon footprint pressure in non-OECD countries is rising, even exceeding the economic growth rate, which is probably related to the transfer of a large number of implied carbon emissions from OECD countries to non-OECD countries.",Not About Sufficiency
A 449 year warm season temperature reconstruction in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau and its relation to solar activity,"There is a close relationship between solar activity and the Earth's surface temperature, but this relationship has weakened with recent global warming. To better understand this puzzle, temperature records need to be extended, and the relationship between long-term variation in temperature and solar activity needs to be examined. In this study, we reconstruct April-September temperature variation back to 1563 using tree ring maximum late wood density (MXD) data from Balfour spruce in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). Spatial correlation analysis indicates that our reconstruction is representative of temperature variability over the large-scale TP. On the 22 year time scale, the reconstructed April-September temperature corresponds generally to solar activity over the past three centuries. Spectral analyses also indicate that the significant periodicities of similar to 11years, 54years, and 204years observed in the MXD chronology correspond to the Schwabe cycle, the fourth harmonic of the Suess cycle, and the Suess solar cycle, respectively. However, disparities between temperature change and solar activity are identified in two periods, the 1880s-1900s and the 1980s-present. These results suggest that solar forcing is the critical driver for long-term temperature variability in the TP, but other factors may uncouple surface temperature and solar activity in some periods. One possible cause of the weak effect of solar activity on temperature during the 1880s-1900s is internal climate variability, while human-activity-induced greenhouse gas emissions have likely superseded solar forcing as the major driver of the rapid warming observed since the 1980s.",Not About Sufficiency
Teacher and youth priorities for education for environmental sustainability: A co-created manifesto,"What would it mean to put environmental sustainability at the heart of education? This article describes a process of inclusive, participatory manifesto-making to identify young people's (aged 16-18 years) and teachers' priorities for education for environmental sustainability across the UK. Drawing on analysis of qualitative data from over 200 teachers and young people who participated in futures and visualisation workshops, we identify key educational priorities at the levels of classroom, school, community and policy, based on consensus between teacher and youth perspectives. Whilst consensus-seeking comes with a risk of favouring 'soft' actions which reinforce unsustainable practices and systems, the process of identifying more desirable futures and immediate barriers that must be negotiated to reach them has the potential to create spaces for more critical pedagogies and practices. There is a need for policy makers and school leaders to recognise the interests of teachers and young people to enable greater participation in decision making at different scales, and to ensure that those with the greatest capacity bear their burden of responsibility for education for environmental sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Durability of silica aerogels dedicated to superinsulation measured under hygrothermal conditions,"Energy efficiency in buildings is a crucial lever for lowering greenhouse gas emissions and a mass market for silica aerogel as retrofitting material. Their durability is therefore a major concern. When applying the precautionary principle, industrial companies have difficulties in estimating the service lifetime of innovative materials such as aerogel. Thus, their costs remain high and market penetration low until the durability of the materials they produce is confirmed. In this paper, commercial silica aerogels were exposed to accelerated ageing over long periods. Microstructural evolutions were tracked by nitrogen and water sorption while thermal conductivities were characterized by heat fluxmeter measurements. 96 and 384 days at 70 degrees C and 90%RH were sufficient to produce noticeable changes in the physico-chemical properties of certain products but almost none in others. The first change observed was an increase of hydrophilicity, followed by a loss of specific surface area, and a shifted and enlarged pore size distribution. The measurements confirmed that microstructure changes induce higher thermal conductivities. Depending on the specific type of aerogel product, the accelerated ageing tests lead to a significant, but limited increase of thermal conductivity of up to 2,5 mW/(m.K). The main hypotheses for explaining this phenomenon are the growth of neck size between two silica particles and the presence of water in the pores. In addition, it is shown for the first time for a wide range of aerogels that pore size distribution and hydrophobization are the key parameters for tuning aerogel durability in severe conditions. Consequently, the mesoporous community has a framework of tests and mechanisms to design aerogels for their specific efficiency/cost/durability requirements.",Not About Sufficiency
Dynamic Energy Control for Energy Efficiency Improvement of Sustainable Manufacturing Systems Using Markov Decision Process,"Greenhouse gas emissions and global warming have become vital problems to human society. About 40% of the carbon dioxide is emitted from electric power generation in the United States. Due to the lack of consideration in the system design and the lack of a real time systematic management method for energy consumption, the energy efficiency of industrial manufacturing systems is extremely low. Most of the existing research work related to energy efficiency improvement only focuses on a single-machine manufacturing system while little work has been done to achieve the optimal energy efficiency for a typical system with multiple machines and buffers. In this paper, an analytical model is developed to establish a systems (or holistic) view of energy efficiency in typical manufacturing systems with multiple machines and buffers that dynamically control energy consumption considering both energy states and production constraints.

"Dynamic modelling, validation and analysis of coal-fired subcritical power plant","Coal-fired power plants are the main source of global electricity. As environmental regulations tighten, there is need to improve the design, operation and control of existing or new built coal-fired power plants. Modelling and simulation is identified as an economic, safe and reliable approach to reach this objective. In this study, a detailed dynamic model of a 500 MWe coal-fired subcritical power plant was developed using gPROMS based on first principles. Model validations were performed against actual plant measurements and the relative error was less than 5%. The model is able to predict plant performance reasonably from 70% load level to full load. Our analysis showed that implementing load changes through ramping introduces less process disturbances than step change. The model can be useful for providing operator training and for process troubleshooting among others. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Dynamic simulation of a microcogeneration system in a Spanish cold climate,"Microcogeneration systems guarantee the reduction of primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in residential sector, by reducing fossil fuels demand and grid losses with respect to conventional energy conversion systems. Energy, environmental and economic benefits can be obtained sharing the cogenerated thermal and electric energy among different end-users to increase the operating hours of the microcogeneration plant with respect to the scenario in which energy demand of each end-user is satisfied by a single cogeneration system. This paper analyses a microcogeneration system used to satisfy electric, space heating and domestic hot water demands of two separate residential buildings located in Spain in a load sharing approach. It consists of a natural gas fuelled internal combustion engine with a thermal and electric power of 12.5 kW and 5.5 kW, respectively. An auxiliary boiler with a nominal thermal power of 24 kW, is also included. The domestic hot water and the heating requirements are managed by means of two different thermal energy storages. The proposed energy conversion systems were experimentally analysed in a test facility in Vitoria Gasteiz (Spain). The models representing the components and the buildings have been implemented in TRNSYS 17. The energy, environmental and economic performance of proposed system are compared with those achieved by a traditional system based on separated energy production. The results highlight that the load sharing between users with different load profiles leads to better environmental and thermo-economic results with respect to the conventional system. The microcogeneration plant works for about 3000 hours per year achieving a primary energy saving of 12.1% and a reduction of equivalent CO2 emissions equal to 27.8%. The payback period of the analysed solution is equal to 11.9 years unless economic support mechanisms are considered. The results of this study show that the introduction of a microcogeneration system in load sharing approach leads to energy, environmental and economic benefits even considering two separate residential buildings, occupied by users with different behaviour.",Not About Sufficiency
Dynamic Simulation of Energy Scenarios in the Transition to Sustainable Mobility in the Ecuadorian Transport Sector,"In Ecuador, the growth of the transportation sector has significantly increased greenhouse gas emissions. According to experts, this sector currently contributes to 49.8% of total greenhouse gas emissions in this country. This poses significant challenges for environmental sustainability, emphasizing the urgent need for effective strategies to mitigate these emissions and promote environmentally friendly practices. Therefore, this study focuses on developing a dynamic simulation of energy scenarios for the year 2035 in the transportation sector, with the goal of transitioning to sustainable mobility, as fossil fuels are the main pollutants in the country. This study proposes system dynamics models using VENSIM 6.0b software to estimate the total energy demand and pollutant emissions in the transportation sector. The results suggest that if Ecuador aligns with global mobility trends and implements public policies promoting the use of electric vehicles, total CO2 emissions could potentially decrease from 50,161,432 kilobarrels of oil equivalent (kBOE) to 20,589,720 kBOE by the year 2035.",Not About Sufficiency
Dynamic soil properties for soil health (DSP4SH) database 1.0 - Phase 1 and 2 datasets,"The dynamic soil properties for soil health (DSP4SH) is a Science of Soil Health Initiative that was designed to collect, process, and publicize scientifically rigorous datasets that inform sound indicators and interpretations. The Soil and Plant Science Division of the United States Department of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) and university cooperators collected a suite of standardized soil health metrics across eight states (Oregon, Washington, Kansas, Minnesota, Illinois, Connecticut, North Carolina, and Texas) within five soil survey regions (Northwest, North Central, Northeast, Southeast, and South Central). The DSP4SH database provides a substantial dataset of soil health metrics assessed. The dataset is composed of dynamic soil properties (DSP) data collected from each management system or ecological state represented by one to three independent plot replicates. Each plot has a minimum of three pedons. Nine groups from the DSP4SH monitoring network provided datasets used in developing the database. The submitted data includes 37 laboratory measured parameters, 60 variables of layer/horizon descriptions, 41 variables for laboratory analysis conducted at the Kellogg Soil Survey laboratory, and 12 variables for the management systems. An additional 31 variables were developed for site or plot description. Additional variables were developed to normalize the dataset. In preparation for DSP assessment, all tables (except for dataset from KSSL lab) were categorized by management system or ecological state. The categories were business as usual (BAU), the reference condition (Ref) and the soil health management (SHM). The overarching goal of DSP4SH phase 1 and 2 dataset publication is to promote increased accessibility, further analysis of the data, and overall understanding of the benefits of surveying dynamic soil properties for soil health.

Early detection of changes in the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation: Implications for the design of ocean observation systems,"Many climate models predict that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions may cause a threshold response of the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC). These model predictions are, however, uncertain. Reducing this uncertainty can have an economic value, because it would allow for the design of more efficient risk management strategies. Early information about the MOC sensitivity to anthropogenic forcing (i.e., information that arrives before the system is committed to a threshold response) could be especially valuable. Here the focus is on one particular kind of information: the detection of anthropogenic MOC changes. It is shown that an MOC observation system based on infrequent (decadal scale) hydrographic observations may well fail in the task of early MOC change detection. This is because this system observes too infrequently and the observation errors are too large. More frequent observations and reduced observation errors would result in earlier detection. It is also shown that the economic value of information associated with a confident and early prediction of an MOC threshold response could exceed the costs of typically implemented ocean observation systems by orders of magnitude. One open challenge is to identify a feasible observation system that would enable such a confident and early MOC prediction across the range of possible MOC responses.",Not About Sufficiency
Earnings inequality and the informal economy,"We analyse the extent and evolution of informality and inequality in the Serbian labour market between 2002 and 2007, using data from the Living Standard Measurement Surveys. Two surprising results emerge. First, the level of informal employment has risen significantly over the period, despite strong economic growth and the introduction of a range of market-oriented reforms. Secondly, the level of inequality in earnings seems to have remained more or less constant over the period, in contrast to the experience of other countries at a similar stage of transition. We show that informal employees earn significantly less than those in the formal sector, controlling for a range of other variables, and informality plays an increasingly important role in explaining earnings inequality.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable supply chain integration: An exploration of South African fast-moving consumer goods manufacturers,"Background: Manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) are facing new challenges that compel them to outperform their competitors economically, and to consider environmental and social impacts. Customer demands regarding sustainability are channelled upstream to these manufacturers through retailers. This resulted in manufacturers being very conscious of the sustainability of their production processes, as well as their packaging. To that extent, FMCG manufacturers are encouraged to integrate sustainability, with other supply chain partners, to improve sustainability performance across the supply chain. Aim: The purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which FMCG manufacturers in South Africa apply sustainability to their supply chain integration. Setting: The study was conducted among South African FMCG manufacturers. Method: The study applied a generic qualitative research design. Altogether 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted with middle to senior supply chain managers. Results: Having a clear sustainability focus, supported by leadership and embedded into the corporate culture, is key to integrating sustainability internally and thus improving the sustainability performance. The findings indicate that customers do not pressure firms to adhere to their sustainability expectations. Instead, sustainability expectations are driven internally. Firms find it difficult to align the three sustainability aspects equally, due to the local variables and context in which they operate. Therefore, economic sustainability is considered most important and firms act on environmental and social sustainability aspects within strict economic constraints. Conclusion: Academically, the study adds to the literature by creating an understanding of sustainable supply chain integration (SSCI) from a South African perspective. For practitioners, the study encourages firms to collaborate with supply chain partners on sustainability, as this opens up opportunities to create shared value through joint sustainability problem-solving.",Not About Sufficiency
Eco-friendly utilization of sawdust: Ionic liquid-modified biochar for enhanced Li<SUP>+</SUP> storage of TiO2,"In China, forestry logging and wood processing produce hundreds of thousands of tons of sawdust every year, which is either discarded or burned. These nonecofriendly practices result in some challenges associated with greenhouse gas emissions. Sawdust-based biochar tailored for anodes of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) can effectively realize value-added utilization of sawdust. The purpose of the current work is to prepare TiO2/biochar nanocomposites to improve the electrical conductivity and structural stability of the anode. However, poor interfacial interaction between TiO2 and carbon in the TiO2/C composites arising from their heterogeneous nature leads to structural deformation of the composites used as anodes of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). A strategy of constructing ionic liquid-coupled biochar/TiO2 interfaces is proposed to obtain chemically bonded interfaces between TiO2 and sawdust-derived biochar. In this study, TiO2/C-880 composites are prepared by one-step carbonization of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and sawdust at 880 degrees C previously dissolved in 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium ([Bmim]H2PO4)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The morphologies of TiO2/C-880 demonstrate that the TiO2 is encapsulated by porous biochar with intimate interfaces, and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate the formation of N-Ti-O/N-O-Ti and Ti-O-P bonds that bridge the two components. TiO2/C-880 electrodes have high reversible specific capacities (404 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)) and desirable long-term cyclic stability (100 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) throughout 2500 cycles). Moreover, large diffusion coefficients (DLi+) ranging from 5.9 x 10(-11) to 1.2 x 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1) are obtained from galvanostatic intermittent titration (GITT) curves. The N-Ti-O/N-O-Ti and Ti-O-P bonds at the interfaces offer routes for fast Li+/electron transport, which account for the high performance of the TiO2/C-880 electrodes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

"Ecological significance of marcescence in Himalayan plants: Why is standing dead phytomass more important in demanding, resource-limited environments?","Understanding mechanisms allowing plants to thrive in challenging conditions is critical for predicting their responses to global environmental change. An often overlooked ecological adaptation is marcescence, where leaves and stems are retained beyond their typical shedding time, with implications for nutrient recycling and carbon sequestration. Marcescence can be expected in plants with conservative resource-use strategies, especially in environments with limited resources and marked seasonality, such as deserts and alpine regions. However, the extent to which marcescence occurs in different taxa across different habitats and its relationship to seasonality and plant functioning as reflected in ecophysiological traits remains understudied. We studied 600 individuals across 40 Himalayan herb species found in desert, steppe, alpine and subnival habitats, spanning 3000-5400 m elevation. Marcescence was observed in 37 of the 40 species evaluated, with 57% of the sampled individuals displaying dead phytomass, indicating the widespread nature of this phenomenon in Himalayan ecosystems. Environment and plant traits emerged as significant factors influencing the amount of dead-standing biomass. These findings remained robust after accounting for intraspecific variation and phylogenetic inertia. Desert and steppe species exhibited greater marcescent biomass, characterized by 10-fold more dead stem biomass than alpine and subnival plants. In contrast, the proportion of dead phytomass increased with elevation due to increased dead leaf fraction. Taller desert species with heavily lignified stems and limited nitrogen and phosphorus content had high levels of stem marcescence, which not only may aid litter photodegradation and nutrient recycling but also deter herbivory and promote seed dispersal (tumbleweed). Conversely, slow-growing alpine and subnival plants with higher water-use efficiency, foliar C:N ratios and parenchymatic storage tissue rich in mobile carbohydrates had a high proportion of marcescent leaves, which may aid survival in these resource-limited environments by providing delayed nutrients through moisture-conserving mulch that also provides insulation and protection from frost. This study provides new insights into the complex interplay of habitat, seasonality and plant traits in dead phytomass retention in Himalayan plants. Marcescence is prevalent in resource-conservative species in highly seasonal, resource-limited habitats and may significantly shape the functioning and biodiversity of Himalayan ecosystems.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

Economic and social effects analysis of mineral development in China and policy implications,"Mineral development has contributed greatly to China's economic and social development. Many challenges remain, however, including environmental pollution and resource waste in practice, as well as a dearth of systematic theoretical research. The goal of this study is to analyze the economic and social effects of various mineral developments in China from diversified perspectives, so as to provide the basis for the formulation of China's mineral development policy. The input-output effects, industrial linkage effects and income distribution effects of different mining industries are quantitatively analyzed by adopting basic hypotheses of input-output economics, industrial linkage model and income distribution antitheses based on the latest available official data from China Statistical Yearbook from 2004 to 2010 and the 2007 Input-Output Table of China. The empirical results obtained in this study indicate that all mineral development industries, especially coal mining and washing, and petroleum and natural gas extraction industries, have given a strong impetus to the increase of China's fixed asset investment and GDP. Moreover, they have provided a large number of jobs, thereby alleviating ongoing employment pressure, and they have also played a positive role in promoting China's technology investment. The analysis of industrial linkages demonstrates that mining industries are basic to the national economy and produce a significant impetus to its downstream industries, but create weak pull effects in terms of national economic development. From the perspective of income distribution, mining industries play an important role in increasing China's fiscal revenue and per capital income. Hence, China's mineral development policy should (1) encourage additional investment in technology for exploration and development to insure sufficient supply and expand the input effects; (2) attract additional talent to work in remote regions; (3) optimize the industrial structure and promote the industrial transformation in resource regions; (4) adjust the interest distribution between the central and local governments to enable the local regions to become more self-sufficient; and (5) enhance the legal environment so that companies can more readily undertake their social responsibilities voluntarily.

Economic growth and basic human needs,"An enduring debate in the political economy of development turns upon the question of whether trade-offs exist between economic growth and the equitable provision of basic human needs (such as adequate nutrition, shelter, and education) in poor areas. Much of the empirical work on this ""growth-welfare"" debate has supported the argument that improvements in basic welfare and enhanced economic performance are mutually reinforcing processes. But if the relationships between improved welfare and factors of growth have been fruitfully examined, the effects of growth and growth-oriented policies upon subsequent levels of poverty and inequality are less clear, In a past issue of this journal, political scientists Bruce E. Moon and William J. Dixon argue that higher rates of economic growth do not improve a nation's ability to meet the basic needs of its population. However, two problems undermine Moon and Dixon's analysis and cast doubt upon the accuracy of their conclusions. I address this concern, constructing and estimating a dynamic model of the impact of growth upon basic welfare that tries to account for these problems. The findings confirm Moon and Dixon's general conclusion, but suggest that the impact of growth related factors upon basic needs outcomes may be less enduring than they had supposed, with beneficial consequences of either positive externalities or effective government intervention (or both) soon out-weighing any detrimental effects of sustained growth.",Not About Sufficiency
Economic policy uncertainty and industrial pollution: The role of environmental supervision by local governments,"This paper explores the effect of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on industrial pollution using China's real-time pollution data and a novel news-based EPU index constructed by Davis, Liu, and Sheng (2019). Empirical results suggest that EPU can significantly promote sulfur dioxide (SO2) readings in cities experiencing higher ex-ante fiscal pressure, and this effect is more profound during the daytime. Given that SO2 is the main contributor to industrial pollution, and local governments have less incentive to monitor illegal pollutant discharges during the nighttime period, our findings indicate that rising EPU will harm the environment by motivating local authorities to reduce environmental supervision and thus increase industrial pollution. We also find that promoting regional innovation and strengthening external environmental regulations can mitigate the pollution effect of economic policy uncertainty.",Not About Sufficiency
Economic theories of eco-innovations: a comparison between the neoclassical and evolutionary approaches,"The present paper contributes to the debate on eco-innovations (EIs) by comparing their role within the framework of two contrasting theoretical perspectives: the neoclassical vs. the evolutionary viewpoint. In the neoclassical approach, EIs play a crucial role in achieving the goal of environmental sustainability mainly through their contribution to the technological progress that can offset the negative effects of the exhaustion of natural resources. By contrast, evolutionists analyse EIs in their dynamic and multi-dimensional nature, recognising the important role played by organisational, social, and institutional innovations for environmental sustainability. In this framework, the deterministic neoclassical perspective seems to be particularly useful to investigate specific characteristics of EIs, such as efficiency and role of environmental regulation. By contrast, the evolutionary theories are suitable to investigate radical innovations and to avoid any technology bias, by stressing the need for consideration of social and institutional dimensions.",Not About Sufficiency
Economic Value of Salt Marshes under Uncertainty of Sea Level Rise: A Case Study of the Narragansett Bay,"Salt marshes are an integral part of coastal ecosystems that are changing rapidly with sea level rise (SLR). Because marshes provide important ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration and shoreline protection, it is critical to understand how their economic benefit values are likely to be affected by SLR. Such change, however, depends on the capacity of marshes to adapt to flooding by migrating inland. This study provides the economic value of changes in carbon and non-carbon benefits using predicted changes in salt marsh coverage in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island under three SLR scenarios and two marsh adaptation conditions. We apply regional carbon prices and a value function transfer approach to value other salt marsh service values. Results indicate an average annual value of $1,863/acre for carbon and $2,537/acre for non-carbon ecosystem services. This yields a mean discounted value of $592 million (M) (+14% compared to no change) over 90 years. We discuss alternative management strategies to enhance marshes' capacity to migrate inland, which may accrue as much as $659 M.",Not About Sufficiency
Economics and Public Health: Two Perspectives on Firearm Injury Prevention,"Firearm injury is a major cause of death, disability, and other harms to community well-being across the U.S. Economics and public health offer two complementary perspectives to conceptualize gun violence and formulate strategies to mitigate related harms.

Economics' focus on incentives, trade-offs, and resources constraints provides useful mechanisms for understanding illegal firearm markets and firearm use that can inform crime reduction efforts. Public health methods and interventions help to measure patterns of illness and disease, identify risks and protective factors, and inform prevention efforts for the most vulnerable individuals and communities.

"Ecosystem services of poplar at long-term phytoremediation sites in the Midwest and Southeast, United States","Short rotation woody crops (SRWCs) including Populus species and their hybrids (i.e., poplars) are ideal for incorporating biomass production with phytotechnologies such as phytoremediation. To integrate these applications, 15 poplar plantings from nine long-term phytoremediation installations were sampled from 2012 to 2013 in the Midwest (Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin) and Southeast (Alabama, Florida, North Carolina) United States. In this review, we report summary results of this sampling and how performance at each site compared with comparable phytoremediation systems in the literature. We review significant genotypic differences from each planting within the context of provisioning (i.e., biomass production) and regulating (i.e., carbon sequestration) ecosystem services and how they relate to the need for a cleaner environment during times of accelerated ecological degradation. Overall, the contaminated poplar sites provided these ecosystem services comparable to noncontaminated poplar sites used for bioenergy and biofuels feedstock production. For example, phytoremediation trees at the Midwestern sites had biomass values ranging from 4.4 to 15.5 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), which was 20% less relative to bioenergy trees (p = .0938). Results were similar for diameter and carbon, with some genotype x environment interactions resulting in phytoremediation trees exhibiting substantially greater growth and productivity (i.e., +131% at one site). As illustrated in the current review, phytoremediation success can be increased with the identification and deployment of genotypes tailored to grow well and tolerate a broad diversity of contaminants (generalists) (i.e., 'DN34', 'NM6', '7300501') versus those that significantly outperform their counterparts under unique site conditions (specialists) (i.e., '220-5', '51-5', 'S13C20').

Ecosystem services: Urban parks under a magnifying glass,"Urban areas' population has grown during the last century and it is expected that over 60% of the world population will live in cities by 2050. Urban parks provide several ecosystem services that are valuable to the wellbeing of city-dwellers and they are also considered a nature-based solution to tackle multiple environmental problems in cities. However, the type and amount of ecosystem services provided will vary with each park vegetation type, even within same the park. Our main goal was to quantify the trade-offs in ecosystem services associated to different vegetation types, using a spatially detailed approach. Rather than relying solely on general vegetation typologies, we took a more ecologically oriented approach, by explicitly considering different units of vegetation structure and composition. This was demonstrated in a large park (44 ha) located in the city of Almada (Lisbon metropolitan area, Portugal), where six vegetation units were mapped in detail and six ecosystem services were evaluated: carbon sequestration, seed dispersal, erosion prevention, water purification, air purification and habitat quality. The results showed that, when looking at the park in detail, some ecosystem services varied greatly with vegetation type. Carbon sequestration was positively influenced by tree density, independently of species composition. Seed dispersal potential was higher in lawns, and mixed forest provided the highest amount of habitat quality. Air purification service was slightly higher in mixed forest, but was high in all vegetation types, probably due to low background pollution, and both water purification and erosion prevention were high in all vegetation types. Knowing the type, location, and amount of ecosystem services provided by each vegetation type can help to improve management options based on ecosystem services trade-offs and looking for win-win situations. The trade-offs are, for example, very clear for carbon: tree planting will boost carbon sequestration regardless of species, but may not be enough to increase habitat quality. Moreover, it may also negatively influence seed dispersal service. Informed practitioners can use this ecological knowledge to promote the role of urban parks as a nature-based solution to provide multiple ecosystem services, and ultimately improve the design and management of the green infrastructure. This will also improve the science of Ecosystem Services, acknowledging that the type of vegetation matters for the provision of ecosystem services and trade-offs analysis.",Not About Sufficiency

Effect of C/N ratio on the denitrifying enzymes activity and global warming potential,"The greenhouse gases generated in the wastewater treatment process based on heterotrophic denitrification technology have become a dilemma between water environment protection and carbon emission reduction. Therefore, balancing the removal of nitrate pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions has become a key issue in ""green denitrification"".

This study indicates that when the initial C/N is below 6.82, it leads to a decrease in the nitrous oxide reductase specific activity concentration by 0.11 similar to 12.45 %, but an increase in the nitric oxide reductase specific activity concentration by 5.96 similar to 22.01 %. In addition, when the initial C/N was between 2.34 similar to 6.82, the GWP caused by every complete reduction of 1 mg NO3--N has a better cost-effectiveness, with 0.09 similar to 0.13 mmol CO2-eq/mg NO3--N.

Effectiveness of wind turbine blades waste combined with the sewage sludge for enriched carbon preparation through the co-pyrolysis processes,"Co-pyrolysis can enhance the sewage sludge sequestrated carbon quantity through the introduction of other carbon containing precursors. In this work, wind turbine blade waste (WTBW) was used to perform a co-pyrolysis system of sludge at 600 degrees C, in presence of activating agent KOH. The optimum mass proportion of WTBW was 40% for carbon material preparation in terms of surface area, and the apparent activation energy. The apparent activation energy was observed to decrease from 53.5 kJ/mol to 33.1 kJ/mol as the WTBW mass proportion increased from 0 to 40%. The maximum BET surface area was found to be 498.3 m(2)/g, whereas, 36% more micro-pores were generated in the carbon mateirals. The major functional groups in the co-pyrolysis carbon material were found to be hydroxyl and aldehydes.

Effects of African dust deposition on phytoplankton in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean off Barbados,"Bioassay incubation experiments conducted with nutrients and local atmospheric aerosol amendments indicate that phosphorus (P) availability limited phytoplankton growth in the low-nutrient low-chlorophyll (LNLC) ocean off Barbados. Atmospheric deposition provides a relatively large influx of new nutrients and trace metals to the surface ocean in this region in comparison to other nutrient sources. However, the impact on native phytoplankton is muted due to the high ratio of nitrogen (N) to P (NO3:SRP>40) and the low P solubility of these aerosols. Atmospheric deposition induces P limitation in this LNLC region by adding more N and iron (Fe) relative to P. This favors the growth of Prochlorococcus, a genus characterized by low P requirements and highly efficient P acquisition mechanisms. A global three-dimensional marine ecosystem model that includes species-specific phytoplankton elemental quotas/stoichiometry and the atmospheric deposition of N, P, and Fe supports this conclusion. Future increases in aerosol N loading may therefore influence phytoplankton community structure in other LNLC areas, thereby affecting the biological pump and associated carbon sequestration.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of building height on the sound transmission in cross-laminated timber buildings-Airborne sound insulation,"Buildings constructed with cross-laminated timber (CLT) are increasing in interest in several countries. Since CLT is a sustainable product, it can help the building industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, buildings constructed with CLT are increasing in building height, thereby increasing the load on the junctions and structural building elements further down in the building. Several studies have investigated how the load impacts the sound transmission between apartments. The majority found that an increasing load could have a negative effect on the vertical sound insulation. However, the findings are limited to a few measurements or building elements, and the studies only investigate junctions with resilient interlayers. This article aims to investigate if the building height, and thereby the load, affect the vertical airborne sound insulation between apartments on different stories in different cross-laminated timber buildings, with or without the presence of viscoelastic interlayers, and to quantify the effect. Four CLT buildings with different building systems, building heights, and the presence of viscoelastic interlayers in the junctions were measured. The airborne sound insu-lation between different apartment rooms was measured vertically for stories on the lower and higher levels. The difference in airborne sound insulation was calculated separately for each building, and the measurements indicate that the vertical airborne sound insulation reduces further down in the buildings. Therefore, results show that increasing load, by an increasing number of stories, has a negative effect on the vertical airborne sound insulation.",Not About Sufficiency

"Effects of lichen biomass on winter diet, body mass and reproduction of semi-domesticated reindeer Rangifer t. tarandus in Finland","Winter food supply very likely influences the life history of reindeer Rangifer t. tarandus. We therefore examined how lichen biomass affects winter diet composition, body mass and reproduction in 14 herds of semi-domesticated reindeer in northern Finland. Diet composition was assessed microhistologically on faeces collected from the actual winter feeding sites of reindeer. When lichen was scarce at these sites reindeer included vascular plants and mosses in their diet. Calf dressed weight depended on both ground lichen biomass and the intensity of supplemental feeding, doe dressed weight depended on lichen biomass alone. One explanation for this difference between calves and does is the connection between food supply and calf mortality: low lichen biomass may promote newborn mortality, which, in turn, frees breeding females from investing further in current reproductive investment. Relative offspring weight (calf/female weight ratio) depended on both lichen biomass and supplemental feeding. Low lichen availability appeared to enhance the impact of density-independent factors on reproduction, because the annual variation in reproductive rate increased with decreasing lichen biomass.",Not About Sufficiency

Effects of Money Priming on Sustainable Consumption Attitudes,"Recognizing the importance of sustainable consumption in addressing the grave challenge of climate change, the present study investigates the effects of non-conscious exposure to money (""money priming"") on Sustainable Consumption Attitudes (SCAs). In two experiments we examine money priming's impact on SCAs and assess the role of materialism and altruism as mediating factors. In Experiment I money priming was found to increase materialism and decrease SCAs, although materialism did not mediate this relationship. Experiment II demonstrated that money priming decreased altruism and SCAs, with altruism mediating the effect of money priming on SCAs. We explain how these new research findings extend the existing body of knowledge on the role of money priming in shaping individual values and SCAs and discuss the implications of our results for consumer decision making, marketing strategy, and public policy.

Efficient photocatalytic reduction of CO2 using Fe-based covalent triazine frameworks decorated with in situ grown ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles,"The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into high-value chemicals is an ideal pathway to adjust the energy structure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this work, we reported a facile synthetic strategy of new photocatalyst (ZnFe2O4/FeP-CTFs), where ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) was in situ growth on iron porphyrin covalent triazine-based frameworks (FeP-CTFs) via one-pot ionothermal method. Such strategy can effectively prevent ZnFe2O4 from agglomerating and blocking the pore structure of CTFs. Notably, a series of experiments demonstrated that anchoring sites of FeP-CTFs can effectively promote the crystal-plane ratio of high catalytic performance, in the assistance of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), promoting higher photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity (178 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) for CO) of the as-prepared ZnFe2O4/FeP-CTFs under visible light compared with pure ZnFe2O4, FeP-CTFs, and their physical mixtures. A combination of experimental measurements and density functional theory calculation reveals that the strong interactions between ZnFe2O4 NPs and FeP-CTFs support can facilitate the charge separation of photogenerated carriers and thereby benefit to photocatalytic CO2 reduction.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying the optimum operating conditions for the integration of a solar loop to power an industrial flash dryer: Combining an exergy analysis with genetic algorithm optimization,"With the objective to reduce fossil fuels consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the integration of solar thermal energy into energy-intensive processes represents the most effective solution. This paper investigates the best solar integration scenarios to an industrial dryer unit through an exergy analysis. The exergetic balance for each subsystem is conducted, and a sensitivity parametric analysis was carried out. The optimization using the Genetic Algorithm was then conducted to define the optimum solar operating conditions. The exergetic evaluation showed an important exergy destruction at the dryer and combustion chamber, accounting for 58% and 42% of the inlet exergy flow, respectively. The sensitivity analysis outcomes showed that the exergy efficiency is clearly increased by increasing both drying temperature, decreasing the inlet moisture content, with preheating the combustion air temperature. Considering these variables, the optimization problem enabled enhancing the exergy efficiency by 40% and 30% for the overall process and flash dryer, respectively, when increasing drying temperature to 850 degrees C, an inlet moisture content of 14.9% and a preheated air combustion of 150 degrees C. Finally, the solar field could be integrated to the industrial dryer to preheat the ambient air for the combustion chamber to the setpoint temperature of 150 degrees C.

Electric Vehicle and Renewable Energy Sources: Motor Fusion in the Energy Transition from a Multi-Indicator Perspective,"Energy transition requires actions from different sectors and levels, mainly focused on achieving a low-carbon and high-renewable integration society. Among the different sectors, the transport sector is responsible for more than 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, mostly emitted in cities. Therefore, initiatives and analysis focused on electric vehicles integration powered by renewables is currently a desirable solution to mitigate climate change and promote energy transition. Under this framework, this paper proposes a multi-indicator analysis for the estimation of CO2 emissions combining renewable integration targets, reduction emission targets and realistic renewable resource potentials. Four scenarios are identified and analyzed: (i) current situation with conventional vehicles, (ii) replacement of such conventional by electric vehicles without renewable integration, (iii) and (iv) integration of renewables to fulfill emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 respectively. The analysis is evaluated in the state of Maine (United States). From the results, a minimum renewable penetration of 39% and 82%, respectively, is needed to fulfill the emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 by considering 100% conventional vehicle replacement. Different combinations of available renewable resources can reduce emissions by more than 35%.",Not About Sufficiency
"Electrified Process Heating in Textile Wet-Processing Industry: A Techno-Economic Analysis for China, Japan, and Taiwan","The textile industry accounts for approximately 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. There is a significant opportunity to decarbonize the textile industry by electrification of process heating where low- or zero-carbon electricity is used. Electrified process heating can be achieved through cross-cutting technologies without modifying the textile process equipment and/or through replacing the existing equipment with technologies that employ electromagnetic or resistance heating techniques for specific end-use applications. This paper aims to investigate the potential for electrification of process heating in the textile wet-processing industry in three of the top textile-producing and exporting regions in the world. To do this, two separate technology pathways, i.e., electrification through (a) industrial heat pumps and (b) textile end-use processes are developed and analyzed. The results show that the total potential final energy and CO2 savings due to electrification in both scenarios could be substantially large due to the lower energy intensity of the electrified heating systems. Moreover, the costs per unit of textile production are found to be lower in the case of industrial heat pumps compared to other systems. It is concluded that wide-scale electrification of process heating in the textile wet-processing industry will require major changes to the electricity system and individual sites, and the coordination efforts among different stakeholders to plan these changes must be intensified.",Not About Sufficiency
Electron shuttling mediated by humic substances fuels anaerobic methane oxidation and carbon burial in wetland sediments,"Key pathways for the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) have remained elusive, particularly in organic rich ecosystems. In this work, the occurrence of AOM driven by humus-catalyzed dissimilatory iron reduction was investigated in sediments from a coastal mangrove swamp. Anoxic sediment incubations supplied with both goethite (alpha-FeOOH) and leonardite (humic substances (HS)) displayed an average AOM rate of 10.7 +/- 0.8 mu mol CH4 cm(-3) day(-1), which was 7 and 3 times faster than that measured in incubations containing only goethite or HS, respectively. Additional incubations performed with C-13-methane displayed Pahokee Peat HS-mediated carbonate precipitation linked to (CH4)-C-13 oxidation and ferrihydrite reduction (similar to 1.3 mu mol carbonate cm(-3) day(-1)). These results highlight the role of HS on mitigating greenhouse gases released from wetlands, not only by mediating the AOM process, but also by enhancing carbon sequestration as inert minerals (calcite, aragonite and siderite).

Embodied energy in buildings: wood versus concrete - reply to Borjesson and Gustavsson,"We analyse the wood and concrete designs of the Walludden building described by Borjesson et al.

We illustrate the complexity of the inter-industry supply chains underlying the upstream energy requirements for the building options. Land demonstrate that higher-order inputs are difficult to capture in a conventional process analysis. Our Calculations show that Borjesson and Gustavsson's estimates of energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions are underestimated by a factor of about 2, and that corresponding greenhouse gas balances are positive at about 30 t C-eq. Nevertheless, Borjesson and Gustavsson's general result the concrete-framed building causing higher emissions still holds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Emissions and Fire Risk Assessment of Nitrocellulose as a Sustainable Alternative in Pyrotechnic Compositions,"The use of fireworks as a sign of celebration is a common practice in many countries. During the last few years, this sector has been subjected to various social criticisms that have even led to a ban on their use in different places. One of the main causes is the environmental pollution they generate, due to emissions from combustion reactions associated with the use of pyrotechnic devices. Nitrate ester-based compounds as propellants are used in other solid rockets such as ammunition, but their use in pyrotechnics is currently limited to a small number of fireworks. This research analyses the substitution of black powder with nitrocellulose ([C6H7(NO2)3O5]n) as a propellant for aerial articles, as well as to the use of nitrocellulose as a perchlorate-free compound. In addition to achieving better clarity effects due to less smoke, the use of nitrocellulose reduces greenhouse gas emissions. However, this nitrogen-rich compound is more unstable, and the ignition sensitivity is higher. Therefore, the benefits and risks associated with this alternative compound need to be evaluated, but the evidence shown suggests a promising direction for the sustainable evolution of pyrotechnic compositions.",Not About Sufficiency
Empirical evaluation of preferences by ecological factors of individual welfare of Ukrainians,"Based on polling of citizens of different age groups living in Kyiv, Ternopil, Donetsk, Sumy, Zaporizhia, Poltava and Volyn regions of Ukraine, we tested the hypothesis that there is a low demand for the public good ""a clean environment"". We found that 60% of citizens are not satisfied with the level of awareness about the ecological situation in their places of residence, and that the Internet is the main source of information for respondents under 45 years old, while for the older generation its place is taken by TV. In general, young people are ready to engage in solving environmental problems and are well informed about the existence of international environmental organizations and movements. Up to 90% of the population is concerned about the threat of the global environmental crisis, and as the main threats they named transport and industry. Approximately 80% of citizens recognize ecology as a public good, but more than 90% are skeptical of the authorities' actions regarding the resolution of environmental problems, and more than 40% of citizens believe that the environmental situation in their places of residence has deteriorated in recent years. Up to 80% of the respondents consider it appropriate to invest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but only 9% of respondents are ready to make a significant personal contribution to this. The vast majority of the population is ready to make contributions of not more than 1% of income to ensure a high quality environment, and only 35% of respondents are trying to buy environmentally friendly products. In general, the study confirms the hypothesis that there is a low level of demand among Ukrainian citizens for environmentally friendly products and a clean environment.

Employee Motivation as a Tool to Achieve Sustainability of Business Processes,"Employee performance and their new ideas, as well as their efforts to promote the company in positive ways help build the values of an enterprise. Properly motivated managers, white-collar, and blue-collar workers use their performance to affect the business efficiency, and therefore the success and sustainability of the enterprise. Selecting the right structure of motivation factors, especially those aimed at job category and gender, is the main role of enterprise management. The aim of this study is to analyze and define differences in the perception of the preferred level of motivation in terms of gender and job category. The questionnaires were given to randomly selected employees working in Slovak enterprises in order to ensure variability and randomness of respondent selection which is necessary for relevant data acquisition. Following the average, the order of the importance of motivation factors of 3720 respondents was defined. The Student's t-test and Tukey's HSD test were used. We confirmed that there are statistically significant differences in the perception of the motivation in terms of job category. Moreover, we proved the significant differences between genders in the job category of blue-collar workers. We did not observe differences between genders in the other job categories studied.

Energy efficiency barriers in commercial and industrial firms in Ukraine: An empirical analysis,"Improvement in energy efficiency is one of the main options to reduce energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. However, large-scale deployment of energy-efficient technologies is constrained by several factors. Employing a survey of 509 industrial and commercial firms throughout Ukraine and a generalized ordered logit model, we quantified the economic, behavioral, and institutional barriers that may impede the deployment of energy-efficient technologies. Our analysis shows that behavioral barriers resulted from lack of information, knowledge, and awareness are major impediments to the adoption of energy-efficient technologies in Ukraine, and that financial barriers may further impede investments in these technologies especially for small firms. This suggests that carefully targeted information provisions and energy audits will enhance Ukrainian firms' investments in energy-efficient technologies to save energy consumption, improve productivity, and reduce carbon emissions from the productive sectors.

Energy Efficiency in Subtropical Homes: Replacing Asbestos-Cement Roofs with Sustainable Alternatives,"This study evaluates the impact of building orientation, typology, and envelope characteristics on energy efficiency and CO2 emissions in urban dwellings in subtropical climate, with a focus on Cartagena, Colombia. North-facing dwellings consistently demonstrate superior energy performance, achieving an average efficiency increase of 4.27 +/- 1.77% compared to south-facing counterparts. This trend is less pronounced near the equator due to the sun's high zenith angle. Semi-detached homes exhibit 23.17 +/- 9.83% greater energy efficiency than corner houses, attributed to reduced exterior wall exposure, which lowers energy demand and CO2 emissions by 2.16 +/- 0.74 kg CO2/m2 annually. Significant disparities in emissions are observed across socioeconomic strata; homes in strata 3 and 4 show the lowest emissions (6.69 +/- 1.42 kg CO2/m2 per year), while strata 5 and 6 have the highest (10.48 +/- 1.42 kg CO2/m2 per year), due to differences in construction quality and glazing ratios. Roofing materials also play a key role, with thermoacoustic (TAC) roofs reducing emissions by up to 5.80% in lower strata compared to asbestos-cement roofs. Furthermore, sandwich panels demonstrate substantial potential, achieving CO2 emissions reductions of up to 51.6% in strata 1 and 2 south-facing median homes and a minimum saving of 9.4% in strata 5 and 6. These findings underscore the importance of integrating energy performance criteria into public housing policies, promoting construction practices that enhance sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving occupant comfort and property value.",Not About Sufficiency

Energy saving potential of a simple control strategy for heat exchanger network operation under fouling conditions,"A real-life benchmark system comprising a Heat Exchanger Network operated as part of Crude Distillation Unit is considered. In such systems, the crude oil stream is typically split into parallel branches and the oil mass flows through the branches are kept in constant proportion, i.e., at constant split ratio, by the process control system. In this paper, linear control systems (proportional-integral-derivative controllers) are considered and the proposed control strategy is to adjust the parallel flows so that identical temperature values are maintained at the outlets from two parallel branches and consequently, the heat recovery in the network is maximized. The aim is to enhance the energy efficiency of the system and minimise greenhouse gas emissions. A mathematical model of the heat exchanger network was built and validated on the basis of real-life data recorded during operation of the crude distillation unit. Using MATLAB/Simulink, closed-loop control was simulated to enable comparative evaluation of the studied strategy of proportional-integral-derivative control and its potential to achieve energy savings in the operation of the distillation unit under fouling conditions. Compared to the strategy of constant split ratio, the proposed strategy of equal outlet temperatures from the network branches was found to increase the total heat recovery by about 1.5%. In the studied operation period, the heat-recovery increase fluctuated in the range 150-1100 kW and the average daily energy saving was estimated at 18 MWh.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy systems planning: A survey on models for integrated power and natural gas networks coordination,"Over the last years, gas-fired power capacity investments in electricity networks have increased in many countries due to its low-rate of greenhouse gas emissions and the continuous reduction in the natural gas price. Besides, new power-to-gas technologies have attracted attention in the sector as an alternative for harvesting large shares of renewable generation. Thus, the coupling between power and gas networks is becoming more critical. New complementarities arise from the synergies of the co-optimization of both power and natural gas systems operation in terms of reliability, sustainability, and economic efficiency. In this regard, jointly planning of power and natural gas systems could leverage potential benefits for the optimal coordination of both grids. In this survey, we present a comprehensive investigation of recent literature in the contexts of coordinated planning of the gas and electricity systems. We first provide a thorough study of energy systems planning. Later, the planning issues of both power and gas grids are investigated, including modeling aspects, typical operational constraints, and objectives that drive investments, as well as uncertainties associated.

Enhancing Sustainability in Renewable Energy Innovation: The Role of Peer Dynamics and Firm Characteristics Amid Climate Crises,"This study investigates peer influence on a firm's pursuit of renewable energy innovation following climate change-induced disasters. While mimetic pressures and competitive dynamics have been recognized as drivers of green innovation, the impact of external uncertainties, such as climate change-induced disasters, on these dynamics remains underexplored. This study fills this gap by revealing how firms pursue renewable energy innovation amid competitive pressures and environmental challenges. Utilizing the behavioral theory of the firm and the threat rigidity model, we analyze US firms' pursuit of renewable energy innovation following climatological disasters from 2013 to 2018 through a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach. Our findings reveal that peers' pursuit of renewable energy innovation can dampen a firm's own pursuit of renewable energy innovation postdisaster, and this effect is less pronounced among multinational enterprise subsidiaries. Theoretically, this study deepens our understanding of how climatological disasters shape competitive dynamics and innovation, challenging the view that competition invariably drives innovation. Practically, it provides insights into effective resource allocation and prioritizing collaborations for sustainability. For policy-makers, the findings highlight the need for regulatory environments that encourage collaborative innovation and enhance resilience, directly contributing to Sustainable Development Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy) by promoting sustainable energy use.",Not About Sufficiency
Entrepreneurship and Ethics in the Sharing Economy: A Critical Perspective,"The advent of the sharing/gig economy has created new forms of employment embedded in new labor practices. Advocates of the sharing economy frame it in salutary terms, lauding its sustainability, decentralization, and employment-generation capabilities. The workers of the gig economy are seen as independent contractors under law rather than employees, and the owners of the gig economy platforms celebrate this categorization as a form of entrepreneurship. In this paper, we use insights from the entrepreneurship literature to examine this claim critically. Taking Uber as an exemplar, we look at the arguments behind the company's contention that its drivers are actually ""partners"" who are engaged in entrepreneurship, and demonstrate why these claims are problematic. We utilize a stakeholders' theory framework that initiates a dialogue between ethics and entrepreneurship in order to focus on the mechanisms that help ensure ethical practices in the sharing economy and to examine the efficacy of these mechanisms. We also discuss the role of the entrepreneurship literature in promoting entrepreneurial behaviors that lead to income inequality. We conclude by arguing that the sharing economy reflects the intensification of an ongoing neoliberal trend that misuses the concept of entrepreneurship in order to justify certain forms of employment practices, and make a case for regulatory oversight.",Not About Sufficiency
"Environmental benefits of new waste management facilities in Manchester, UK","In 2002, the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority drew up a long term strategy for improving recycling rates, providing waste processing and achieving resource and energy recovery. This strategy recognises the imperative to reduce disposal of biodegradable waste to landfill and thereby to reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and the carbon dioxide footprint arising from the conventional disposal of municipal waste. To implement the strategy, a 3-8 pound billion, 25-year private finance initiative contract was developed and awarded in April 2009 for the construction and operation of waste disposal facilities to process domestic refuse arising from nine of the ten boroughs within Greater Manchester.

Environmental life-cycle assessment of transit buses with alternative fuel technology,"The paper presents a life-cycle assessment of costs and greenhouse gas emissions for transit buses deploying a hybrid input-output model to compare ultra-low sulfur diesel to hybrid diesel-electric, compressed natural gas, and hydrogen fuel-cell. We estimate the costs of emissions reductions from alternative fuel vehicles over the life cycle and examine the sensitivity of the results to changes in fuel prices, passenger demand, and to technological characteristics influencing performance and emissions. We find that the alternative fuel buses reduce operating costs and emissions, but increase life-cycle costs. The infrastructure requirement to deploy and operate alternative fuel buses is critical in the comparison of life-cycle emissions. Additionally, efficient bus choice is sensitive to passenger demand, but only moderately sensitive to technological characteristics, and that the relative efficiency of compressed natural gas buses is more sensitive to changes in fuel prices than that of the other bus types.

Environmental optimization of the charge of battery electric vehicles,"The battery electric vehicle's environmental impacts are highly influenced by the emissions attributed to the electricity used to recharge the battery. The electricity generation's environmental assessment, however, is mainly based on static yearly mean shares of primary energy sources. To overcome this uncertainty, we develop a mixed-integer linear programming model to couple variable, hourly environmental impacts of electricity generation with representative user behavior in Germany. The model is then used to quantify and optimize the mitigation potential of environmental impacts for 2019, 2025, 2030, and 2050. Focusing on one method that minimizes the overarching environmental impacts could lead to ambiguous results. Instead, we aim to optimize charging behavior regarding each midpoint category and reveal the conflicting objectives among all the environmental categories that arise when aiming to minimize environmental impacts holistically. Considering greenhouse gas emissions, a reduction of 38% can be achieved through optimized demand timing for 2019. This charging strategy, however, increases the depletion of material resources by 72% compared to an optimal reference charging profile. The results for the future energy generation scenarios show that deviation between environmental impact categories can deviate and differences increase over the investigated time horizon. Nevertheless, by analyzing the differences between all impact category pairs, we found six categories, including climate change, within which differences are found to be less than 10%.",Not About Sufficiency
"Environmental perspectives on the impacts of trade and natural resources on renewable energy utilization in Sub-Sahara Africa: Accounting for FDI, income, and urbanization trends","Trade has remained a pivotal ingredient to the economic prosperity of many resources rich Sub-Sahara African (SSA) states over the years. However, an examination of the environmental aspects of trading activities amidst vast natural resources is critical to positioning Sub-Sahara African states on environmental sustainability path in their quest for economic prosperity. Unlike most extant studies that only focused on fossil energy facets of energy consumption, this study provides a synthesis of the impacts of trade and natural resources on renewable energy consumption in a bid to address environmental sustainability challenges in the SSA region. The empirical dissection hinges on the ARDL approach for available renewable energy consumption data while incorporating other relevant factors like the SSA's income level, FDI, and urbanization trends among the countries. From the results, the duo of openness to trade and urbanization posits significant detrimental impacts on the level of renewable energy consumption in the SSA region, while the impacts created by resources rent on renewable energy consumption level were insignificant. Conversely, a rise in income level alongside higher FDI was observed to be leading to a significant positive effect on renewable energy utilization with estimated long-run elasticity of -0.126 and -0.105 respectively. This implies that poverty reduction and foreign capital inflow can significantly boost the adoption and use of renewables in the SSA. As such, policy frameworks to harness essential FDI inflow for environmental benefits in view of clean energy consumption amidst vast resources were highlighted for the SSA authorities, while also emphasizing the need to guide against potential regional pollution haven tendencies.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental regulation and its influence on energy efficiency and environmental performance: do technology innovation and financial efficiency matter?,"Global warming has recently become a significant concern for world leaders.

To that end, the study relies on the ARDL-PMG model, which can provide both short- and long-run estimates simultaneously. The findings of the model imply that environmental innovation and regulations helps improve energy efficiency and environmental quality in the long run. In contrast, financial development deteriorates the environmental quality and improves energy efficiency.

Environmental Regulation Design: Motivating Firms' Clean Technology Investments With Penalties and Subsidies,"The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes a number of incentive-based programs (e.g., tax credits) designed to motivate firms to develop new clean technologies for fighting climate change. However, the IRA also includes a fee firms incur for excessive methane emissions. This represents the first time the United States government has ever levied a fee on greenhouse gas emissions, and it raises an interesting research question-how should a budget-constrained regulator balance the use of both incentive and penalty-based levers for stimulating investment in clean technology development? In this paper, we examine a regulator's optimal penalty and subsidy decisions for motivating firms to invest in clean technology development. We illustrate how the level of competitive intensity in the market can influence a budget-constrained regulator with multiple competing objectives-the environment, firm profits, and consumer welfare. We find that a subsidy is always beneficial, irrespective of the regulator's objective. While imposing a firm penalty always benefits the environment, it always negatively impacts the sum of firm profits and consumer welfare. However, depending on the level of competition in the market, instances can occur where imposing a high penalty actually benefits total firm profits or consumer welfare (separately). Interestingly, a regulator that cares about all three dimensions of its objective equally, should always set the penalty to either its minimum or maximum value, depending on whether the environmental cost of the harmful product is high or low.",Not About Sufficiency
Environment-growth nexus and corruption in the MENA region: Novel evidence based on method of moments quantile estimations,"This study contributes to the environment-growth nexus literature by examining corruption's effect on envi-ronmental quality in 17 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries between 1984 and 2018. We use four different indicators of environmental degradation (ecological footprint, carbon dioxide emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon emission intensity) to gain a comprehensive view of the relationship. This study's methodological value added is the application of the method of moments quantile regression, which enables us to account for different relationships between the independent variables and environmental quality at different levels of environmental degradation. The results indicate that corruption worsens environmental quality based on three of the four indicators of environmental degradation, while the impact appears to become less severe at higher levels of environmental deterioration. The results also indicate that traditional mean-based panel data estimation methods provide an incomplete picture of the factors behind environmental problems: The explan-atory variables' impacts tend to vary at different levels of environmental quality, and the impact's sign can even change when moving from the lowest to the highest environmental degradation quantiles. Overall, the results highlight the importance of curbing corruption to enable enforcement of more stringent environmental regulations.",Not About Sufficiency
Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Improving Air Quality: Two Global Challenges,"There are many good reasons to promote sustainable development and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other combustion emissions. The air quality in many urban environments is causing many premature deaths because of asthma, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and dementia associated with combustion emissions. The global social cost of air pollution is at least $3 trillion/year; particulates, nitrogen oxides and ozone associated with combustion emissions are very costly pollutants. Better air quality in urban environments is one of the reasons for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. There are many potential benefits associated with limiting climate change. In the recent past, the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have been increasing and the number of weather and climate disasters with costs over $1 billion has been increasing.

"Environmental and energetic analysis of coupling a biogas combined cycle power plant with carbon capture, organic Rankine cycles and CO2 utilization processes","Greenhouse gas emissions from power plants that use fossil fuels cause a serious impact to the environment, for this reason the use of renewable energy technologies is an important alternative as a way of combatting climate change. The production of power via biomass is considered as a carbon neutral energy resource, but it is well known that the non-fossil CO2 emitted from this type of processes can also be captured. In order to do so, in this work it is proposed a match between a Biogas combined cycle power plant and postcombustion carbon capture process, to capture the CO2 produced by the biogas combustion, and also it considered a match with an organic Rankine cycle that uses the wasted energy of the combustion gases. Additionally, it is considered that the captured carbon is used to produce some value-added chemicals and fuels. Environmental and energetic evaluations were carried out for the coupling of those technologies. The implementation of the carbon capture plant, results on a diminution of the 87% of the emission of the combined cycle power plant. The life cycle analysis results show that the study case of Syngas production via dry reforming of methane, presents the lower global warming potential (0.088 CO2-eq kg/kg) and it was also found that the global warming potential has a reduction with the help of the mass integration between the different alternatives of CO2 utilization.

In every case, the story has been told through technological innovations, as if changes in technology were alone responsible for the development of new sound strategies. The approach offered here differs markedly from these previous treatments of sound. Instead of concentrating on technological shifts, this article stresses technical decisions made by the soundmen and directors responsible for developing Hollywood's standard approach to sound. Through succinct analysis of two key films, The First Auto (Warner, 1927) and It Happened One Night (Columbia, 1934), along with briefer treatment of The Big Trail (Fox, 1930), a distinction is made between ""shot-by-shot"" treatment of sound and ""scene-by-scene"" treatment of sound. The systematic use of sound in It Happened One Night to establish and maintain a coherent sense of place gives rise to recognition of the increasingly common use of what the article terms ""establishing sound."" Parallel to Hollywood's familiar technique of introducing each scene with an ""establishing shot,"" the use of establishing sound offers filmmakers an additional method of locating auditors and maintaining their relationship to the film.",Not About Sufficiency
Establishing the value of community energy storage: A comparative analysis of the UK and Germany,"Both UK and Germany have committed to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and tackling climate change. In the past decade, a surge of residential solar and storage applications has been accelerated by subsidies, cost reduction of the system and increasing energy prices. Many advantages of community energy storage have been identified and its applications have been widely investigated. However, its profitability is still questionable, and more work is needed to improve its accessibility. Here we compare and contrast community energy storage using lithium-ion batteries in the UK and Germany - two countries with different solar profiles and different electricity tariffs. Results indicate that the primary impacting factor on self-sufficiency is the solar generation, meaning that communities in Germany can be up to 30% more self-sufficient than their UK counterparts. Additionally, the profitability of households in Germany is also higher (achieving a simple payback time of less than 10 years) due to the subsidies for storage and on-site generation. The results highlight the importance of using a location-specific approach for system planning. For example, households in Germany should aim to fully exploit on-site generation, whilst UK households should improve generation output, for example by using a hybrid PV plus wind turbine system. In addition, more financial and regulatory support is needed in the UK to improve project feasibility.",Not About Sufficiency
Estimating carbon sequestration potential and optimizing management strategies for Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) forests using machine learning,"Estimating the carbon sequestration potential of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) forests and optimizing management strategies play pivotal roles in enhancing quality and promoting sustainable development. However, there is a lack of methods to simulate changes in carbon sequestration capacity in Moso bamboo forests and to screen and optimize the best management measures based on long-term time series data from fixed-sample fine surveys. Therefore, this study utilized continuous survey data and climate data from fixed sample plots in Zhejiang Province spanning from 2004 to 2019. By comparing four different algorithms, namely random forest, support vector machine, XGBoost, and BP neural network, to construct aboveground carbon stock models for Moso bamboo forests. The ultimate goal was to identify the optimal algorithmic model. Additionally, the key driving parameters for future carbon stocks were considered and future aboveground carbon stocks were predicted in Moso bamboo forests. Then formulated an optimal management strategy based on these predictions. The results indicated that the carbon stock model constructed using the XGBoost algorithm, with an R-2 of 0.9895 and root mean square error of 0.1059, achieved the best performance and was considered the optimal algorithmic model. The most influential driving parameters for vegetation carbon stocks in Moso bamboo forests were found to be mean age, mean diameter at breast height, and mean culm density. Under optimal management measures, which involve no harvesting of 1-3 du bamboo, 30% harvesting of 4 du bamboo, and 80% harvesting of bamboo aged 5 du and above. Our predictions show that aboveground carbon stocks in Moso bamboo forests in Zhejiang Province will peak at 36.25 +/- 8.47 Tg C in 2046 and remain stable from 2046 to 2060. Conversely, degradation is detrimental to the long-term maintenance of carbon sequestration capacity in Moso bamboo forests, resulting in a peak aboveground carbon stock of 29.50 +/- 7.49 Tg C in 2033, followed by a continuous decline. This study underscores the significant influence of estimating carbon sequestration potential and optimizing management decisions on enhancing and sustaining the carbon sequestration capacity of Moso bamboo forests.",Not About Sufficiency
Estimating soil turnover rate from tree uprooting during hurricanes in Puerto Rico,"Soil turnover by tree uprooting in primary and secondary forests on the island of Puerto Rico was measured in 42 study plots in the months immediately after the passage of a Category 3 hurricane. Trunk basal area explained 61% of the variability of mound volume and 53% of the variability of mound area. The proportion Of uprooted trees, the number of uprooted trees, or the proportion of uprooted basal area explained 84-85% of the variation in hurricane-created mound area. These same variables explain 79-85% of the variation in mound volume. The study indicates that the soil turnover period from tree uprooting by Puerto Rican hurricanes is between 1600 and 4800 years. These rates are faster than soil turnover by landslides and background treefall in the same area and provide a useful age constraint on soil profile development and soil carbon sequestration in these dynamic landscapes.

Estimating the global risk of anthropogenic climate change,"The three recent Special Reports of the IPCC provide an opportunity to understand overarching climate risk, as they cover a wide diversity of risks to natural and human systems. Here we develop a scoring system to translate qualitative IPCC risk assessments into risk scores that, when aggregated, describe global risk from climate change. By the end of this century, global climate risk will increase substantially with greenhouse gas emissions compared to today (composite risk score increase of two- and fourfold under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively). Comparison of risk levels under +1.5 degrees C and +2 degrees C suggests that every additional 0.5 degrees C of global warming will contribute to higher risk globally (by about a third). Societal adaptation has the potential to decrease global climate risk substantially (by about half) under all RCPs, but cannot fully prevent residual risks from increasing (by one-third under RCP2.6 and doubling under RCP8.5, compared to today). Different frameworks, most notably expert assessments from the IPCC, have been developed to determine risk from climate change over this century. Estimated risk scores quantified from the IPCC assessments show a substantial increase in global composite risk by 2100 for low and high emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
"Estimating the macroeconomic determinants of total, renewable, and non-renewable energy demands in Bangladesh: the role of technological innovations","Bangladesh is well on course to become one of the leading emerging market economies in the world. Hence, it can be expected that the economic growth of Bangladesh would substantially increase over the next decade. This, in turn, is likely to boost the energy consumption levels of the nation whereby meeting the surge in the energy demand would be a crucial agenda of the government. Therefore, it is important to understand the factors that influence the nation's energy demand. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to evaluate the macroeconomic determinants of total, renewable, and non-renewable energy demands in Bangladesh between 1980 and 2014. Besides, the analysis is conducted for both primary energy and electricity consumption levels. The econometric methods used in this study controlled for the structural break issues in the data. The key findings, in a nutshell, show that economic growth and household consumption expenditure positively influence the overall primary energy and electricity demands in Bangladesh while income inequality exerts opposite effects. Besides, technological innovations are found to be reducing the total and non-renewable energy demand in Bangladesh while increasing the demand for renewable energy. On the other hand, positive oil price shocks are found to be ineffective in influencing the renewable energy demand but slightly reducing the non-renewable energy demand. Finally, the causality estimates portray the feedback hypothesis in almost all the cases to highlight the inter-relationships between economic growth and energy demand in Bangladesh. Hence, in line with these findings several critically important policy implications are suggested for managing the overall energy demand in Bangladesh.",Not About Sufficiency
Estimation of primary forest harvest residues and potential bioenergy production from fast-growing tree species in NW Spain,"Around 50% of the wood harvested annually in Spain for industrial purposes is produced in the north-western region of Galicia. In this study, species-specific equations were developed for estimating dry harvest residues (kg) from stem volume (m3) in the fast-growing Pinus pinaster Ait., Pinus radiata D. Don and Eucalyptus spp., which generate around 95% of harvested wood. The presence of heteroscedasticity was taken into account in model fitting. Regional dry harvest residues were estimated using the equations and regional harvested volume records (m3), by assuming a mean harvested tree of diameter at breast height of 45 cm for pines and 25 cm for eucalyptus. A moisture content (M) of 25% was assumed for direct combustion of harvest residues; therefore, wet values were calculated from dry estimates, and a lower heating value (M = 25%) was used. The bioenergy potentially produced from the estimated harvest residues (M = 25%) was 377 ktoe year-1 in the period 2018?2019, equivalent to 4.7% of the total primary energy consumption in Galicia in 2018. Currently 70% of potential bioenergy production is concentrated in a sub-region representing 40% of the whole region. The approach used provides a direct link between regional or local harvested volume (registered or simulated) and accurate estimation of potential bioenergy from direct combustion of harvest residues, thus supporting decisionmaking related to climate change targets and to decreasing dependence on fossil fuels. However, further research that takes into account environmental, economical and social constraints in removing harvest residues is required.",Not About Sufficiency
Economic impacts and risks of climate change under failure and success of the Paris Agreement,"The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) represent the world's first effort toward the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperature increase well below 2 degrees C and pursuing 1.5 degrees C. Little is known about how much the proposed mitigation efforts can reduce the risks and economic damages from unabated climate change and about the consequences if key emitters drop the Paris Agreement. Here, we use CLIMRISK, an integrated assessment model designed to support climate policy at the global, national, and subnational scales where mitigation and adaptation policy decisions are made. We characterize the consequences of unabated climate change and the benefits of current climate policy proposals by means of probabilistic estimates of the economic damages of climate change and uni- and multivariate dynamic climate risk indices at a detailed spatial resolution. The results presented reveal that the economic costs and risks are highly unequally distributed between and within countries and larger than previously estimated when warming in urban areas and temporal persistence of impacts are accounted for. Costs and risks can be significantly limited by strict implementation of NDCs, but increase noticeably under noncompliance by large emitters, like the United States.",Not About Sufficiency
Ethnobiology's Contributions to Sustainability Science,"Progress toward the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is insufficient at a global scale. A thorough and interdisciplinary understanding of barriers and levers to sustainability, including synergies and trade-offs between SDGs, is utterly important but still limited. Ethnobiology is often advocated as a key discipline to address this research gap. We conducted a systematic literature review to explore (i) the visibility of ethnobiology within sustainability science, (ii) how ethnobiology understands the notion of sustainability, (iii) if ethnobiology literature on sustainability issues engages differently with nonacademic knowledge and people compared to other types of ethnobiology research, and (iv) which SDGs are addressed (explicitly or implicitly) by ethnobiology. Our study reveals a minimal overlap between sustainability science and ethnobiology literature. The articles reviewed never mention the SDGs explicitly, but often address them implicitly. Reviewed ethnobiological articles addressed themes of relevance to almost all SDGs, especially the linkages between SDGs 1-3 and 15, but always implicitly. Biodiversity's understanding (SDG 15) provides the basis for culture and Indigenous and local knowledge and ensures communities' food security (SDG 2), health and well-being (SDG 3), and prosperity (SDG 1). We found that ethnobiology does not examine sustainability through the lens of the global sustainability agenda, and that knowledge coproduction processes are rarely reported. While ethnobiology demonstrates its relevance to address SDGs and contribute to transformative change, this potential is not fully realized because of a persisting decoupling between place-based research and global sustainability frameworks.",Not About Sufficiency
EU Green Transition in Times of Geopolitical Pressures: Accelerating or Slowing the Pace Towards Climate Neutrality?,"The current climate emergency and the war in Ukraine have placed climate action and energy security at the top of the EU's agenda. The 'Fit for 55' legal package and REPowerEU Plan set out short- and medium -term measures to end EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels and address climate change. The new targets and policy instruments have the potential to accelerate decarbonization of the continent. However, from the perspective of the environment and social equity, serious concerns remain as to the sustainability of the transformation. For example, difficulties in achieving immediate independence from Russian fuels has led some EU countries to increase their use of coal. The accelerated roll -out of renewable energies has increased the demand for materials and land, sparking territorial conflicts and impacting biodiversity. Support from the Social Climate Fund will not meet all the demands of the most vulnerable sections of society for assistance with the costs derived from the energy transitions, such as cleaner heating systems and transport.

Evaluating Beijing +25: The Case of Joint Programming in Prevention and Response to Violence against Women in Uganda,"This article is a response to the global Beijing +25 call to take stock of the status of women and the assessment of current challenges to gender equality and women's empowerment. It presents a case study of the coordination capacity of government and civil society organisations in meeting the Beijing Platform for Action's strategic objectives in tackling gender-based violence (GBV) against women in Uganda through a multi-level coordinated and implemented programme. Drawing on established sectoral and district gender-mainstreaming policy and practices led by the women's ministry, the programme demonstrated what is possible in a collaborative partnership involving several stakeholders in prevention and response to GBV. The joint GBV programme created alliances that resulted in established services such as community guidelines for GBV prevention, legal services to support survivors, shelters for the temporary protection of women and children, and counselling services. Community groups that were created facilitated dialogues and initiated action on discussing power, inequality and behaviour change. In sum, the programme's high-level political commitment, technical and cultural leadership partially guaranteed the continuation of the GBV interventions and sustainability of the impacts. The major challenge was the enforcement of gender-sensitive public resources allocation that would engender planning and budgeting cultures. The renewed Beijing +25 bid for bold actions and commitments to end violence against women, needs to bolster support that beefs-up State-level concerns of inadequate technical skills, capabilities, and financial support to investigate cases of GBV against women. It needs to multiply actions to finance State-level measures that seek fundamental gender norms change. The article draws on qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques.

Evaluating CO2 emissions from continuous flow and batch growth systems under autotrophic mode: Implications for GHG accounting of biological nutrient removal,"The oxidation of ammonia by autotrophic bacteria is a central part of the nitrogen cycle and a fundamental aspect of biological nutrient removal (BNR) during wastewater treatment. Autotrophic ammonia oxidation produces protons and results in net-CO2 production due to the neutralizing effect of bicarbonate alkalinity. Attention must be paid to the propensity for this produced CO2 to be transferred to the atmosphere where it can act as a greenhouse gas (GHG). In the context of BNR systems, bicarbonate-derived CO2 emissions should be considered distinct from the biogenic CO2 that arises from cellular respiration, though this distinction is not made in current GHG accounting practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of two experimental systems operated under autotrophic mode and buffered with bicarbonate, to investigate the relationship between ammonia removal and gaseous CO2 emissions. The first system consisted of continuously aerated lab-scale batch reactors, which were effective in demonstrating the important link between ammonia oxidizer activity, pH, and gaseous CO2 production. Depletion of the buffer system always led to a rapid decline in system pH and cessation of CO2 emissions when the pH fell below 7.0. The second system was a tubular continuous-flow biofilm reactor which permitted comparison of ammonia removal and CO2 emission rates. A linear relationship between ammonia removal and CO2 emissions was demonstrated and the quantified CO2 production was relatively close to that which was predicted based on the stoichiometry of nitrification, with this CO2 being detected in the gas phase. It was apparent that this system offered minimal resistance to the mass transfer of CO2 from the liquid to gas, which is an important factor that determines how much of the bicarbonatederived CO2 may contribute to greenhouse gas emissions in engineered systems such as those used for BNR.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating Development of Empirical Estimates Using Two Top-Down Methods at Midstream Natural Gas Facilities,"To align with climate initiatives, multiple reporting programs are transitioning from generic activity-based emission factors to site-specific measured emissions data to estimate greenhouse gas emissions at oil and gas facilities. This study contemporaneously deployed two top-down (TD) aerial methods across 14 midstream facilities, building upon previous research in the field. The methods produced multiple whole-facility estimates at each facility, resulting in 773 individual paired estimates (same facility, same day), and robust mean estimates for each facility. Mean estimates for each facility, aggregated across all facilities, differed by nearly 2:1 (49% [32% to 69%]). At 6 of 14 facilities, the methods produced mean estimates that differed by more than a factor of two. These data suggest that one or both methods did not produce accurate facility-level estimates at a majority of facilities and in aggregate across all facilities. The overall results are augmented with two case studies where TD estimates at two pre-selected facilities were coupled with comprehensive onsite measurements to understand the factors driving the divergence between TD and bottom-up (BU) emissions estimates. In 3 of 4 paired comparisons between the intensive onsite estimates and one of the TD methods, the intensive onsite surveys did not conclusively diagnose the difference in estimates. In these cases, our work suggests that the TD methods mis-estimate emissions an unknown fraction of the time, for unknown reasons. While two methods were selected for this study, it is unlikely that the issues identified here are confined to these two methods; similar issues may exist for other similar whole-facility methods on midstream and/or other facility types. These findings have important implications for the construction of voluntary and regulatory reporting programs that rely on emission estimates for reporting fees or penalties, or for studies using whole-facility estimates to aggregate TD emissions to basin or regional estimates.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating microalgal integrated biorefinery schemes: Empirical controlled growth studies and life cycle assessment,"Two freshwater and two marine microalgae species were grown under nitrogen replete and deplete conditions evaluating the impact on total biomass yield and biomolecular fractions (i.e. starch, protein, and lipid). A life cycle assessment was performed to evaluate varying species/growth conditions considering each biomass fraction and final product substitution based on energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and eutrophication potential. Lipid for biodiesel was assumed as the primary product. Protein and carbohydrate fractions were processed as co-products. Composition of the non-lipid fraction presented significant trade-offs among biogas production, animal feed substitution, nutrient recycling, and carbon sequestration. Maximizing total lipid productivity rather than lipid content yielded the least GHG emissions. A marine, N-deplete case with relatively low lipid productivity but effective nutrient recycling had the lowest eutrophication impacts. Tailoring algal species/growth conditions to optimize the mix of biomolecular fractions matched to desired products and co-products can enable a sustainable integrated microalgal biorefinery.

"Evaluation of different substrates on the life history parameters of African palm weevil, Rhynchophorous phoenicis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in Ghana","African palm weevil (Rhynchophorus phoenicis) larvae are widely consumed in Ghana and most countries in Africa because of their high-quality protein and low greenhouse gas emissions than conventional livestock. However, the consumption of the larvae is hindered by the identification of viable agricultural by-products or artificial diets for production. To address this challenge, Rhynchophorus phoenicis was evaluated on three substrates, namely cassava, sugarcane, and palm yolk, to determine the fecundity and hatchability of eggs. Completely Randomized Design was used to assign substrates with four replications each. Overall, adults reared on palm yolk laid average of 76.2 eggs while the cassava and the sugarcane substrate recorded averages of 73.0 eggs and 63.3 eggs, respectively.

Evaluation of Life Cycle Assessment of Jatropha Biodiesel Processed by Esterification of Thai Domestic Rare Earth Oxide Catalysts,"The Thai domestic rare earth oxides, including cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium oxides, with the effects of calcination temperatures (500-1000 degrees C), were utilized as catalysts for twelve Jatropha biodiesel alternatives via an esterification reaction. This study applied life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology from well-to-wheel analysis to assess energy efficiency and the global warming impact with and without land use change. The results of the life cycle analysis showed that the Jatropha biodiesel alternatives using the La2O3 catalyst in all conditions (0.89-1.06) were found to be potential fuel substitutes for conventional diesel (0.86) in terms of net energy ratios; however, the results showed that they generated a higher global warming impact. Considering the improvement process of Jatropha biodiesel in the utilization of waste heat recovery, the Jatropha biodiesel reduced the impacts of the net energy ratios and the global warming impact by 22-24% and 34-36%, respectively. The alternative Jatropha biodiesel using the La2O3 catalyst with a calcination temperature of 600 degrees C was shown to be the most environmentally friendly of all the studied fuels; relatively, it had the highest energy ratios of 1.06-1.37 (with and without waste heat recovery) and the lowest total global warming impact of 47.9-70.7 kg CO2 equivalent (with land use change).

Evaluation of River Health and Human Well-Being in the Heihe River Basin Using the SMI-P Method: A Case Study of the Zhangye City,"Oasis cities are central to the economic and social development as well as ecological sustainability in the arid region in Northwest China. This study aims to explore the balance between river health and human well-being of local residents in the Hexi River oasis, while also enhancing the effectiveness of water resource management within the basin. Utilizing the SMI-P method, we construct a 'Happy River' evaluation system that integrates goals, criteria, and indicators. We analyze the evaluation index system for 'Happy River' construction in the study area, specifically the Zhangye City section of the Heihe River Basin, and derive a comprehensive evaluation value for the 'Happy River' initiative. Additionally, we assess the fit attribute of the evaluation system using the coupled coordination degree model and harmony degree theory, thereby enhancing the rationality of the evaluation method and ensuring a more thorough examination process. The results indicate that from 2017 to 2021, the urban wastewater treatment rate and the degree of water quality excellence in the Zhangye City section of the Black River Basin represent the highest and lowest weights, respectively, within the evaluation system. This suggests that improving the quality of the urban water environment has emerged as the primary factor influencing the assessment of the Happy River during the construction of the Happy River and Happy Lake. Moreover, ecological health is identified as the most significant criterion in the evaluation system, serving as the main factor affecting residents' perceptions of happiness related to rivers and lakes. Over the five-year period, the happiness level in the study area improved from ""relatively happy"" to ""very happy"", while the coupling coordination degree increased from 0.605 to 0.687, indicating a gradual progression toward coordinated development. Simultaneously, the harmony degree rose from 0.527 to 0.601, suggesting a tendency towards a condition of basic harmony. Additionally, the happiness index increased from 76.71 to 81.97, transitioning from a state of happiness to one of very high happiness. The composite index also improved, rising from 0.459 to 0.526, which demonstrates the preliminary success of the 'Happy River' construction efforts in the study area. The evaluation system and model of the 'Happy River', along with the final results of this study, can serve as theoretical references for the development of similar initiatives in typical characteristic rivers within the arid region of Northwest China.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluation of the effects of forest management strategies on carbon sequestration in evergreen broad-leaved (Phoebe bournei) plantation forests using FORECAST ecosystem model,"In the context of global climate change, it is critical to study how different forest management practices affect forest carbon sequestration. This is especially important for forest managers and policy makers who will have to design and implement appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies. Previous research has focused on coniferous plantations with rare examination of plantations of evergreen broad-leaved species. Phoebe bournei (Hemsley) Yang, as one of the representative species of subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests in Asia, has a unique potential to increase forest carbon sink. In this study, field data were combined with the forest ecosystem management model FORECAST to estimate the impacts of different forest management strategies (combinations of planting densities from 1000 to 4000 trees ha(-1), rotation lengths from 20 to 80 years, and different harvesting intensities: stem-only, whole-tree and complete-tree) on carbon sequestration of P. bournei plantations in south-eastern China. Field and previously published data were used to calibrate the model for stand biomass pools accumulation, stand density and mortality, light response curves, photosynthetic efficiency, and data on soil nutrient pools, for three different site conditions. The results showed that the most suitable planting density to maximize carbon sequestration in P. bournei plantations is 2000-3000 trees ha(-1). Longer rotations (e.g., 80 years) are better than shorter rotations (20 or 30 years) for the long-term maintenance of site productivity, though the recommended rotation length for maximizing carbon sequestration and maintaining forest productivity is 40-60 years. As for harvesting intensity, stem-only harvesting is the most suitable strategy to manage for carbon sequestration when maintaining long-term site productivity, with whole-tree and complete-tree harvesting constituting less optimal options. Our modeling exercise indicates that P. bournei plantations have great potential for carbon sequestration if they are managed under sustainable and ecologically-based strategies. Given that forests are important in the global carbon cycle, it is recommended that afforestation efforts in relevant subtropical regions use appropriate broad-leaved species that can help resolve ecological and socio-economic challenges.

Evaluation of Three Antimicrobial Peptides Mixtures to Control the Phytopathogen Responsible for Fire Blight Disease,"Fire blight is a severe bacterial plant disease that affects important chain-of-value fruit trees such as pear and apple trees. This disease is caused by Erwinia amylovora, a quarantine phytopathogenic bacterium, which, although highly distributed worldwide, still lacks efficient control measures. The green revolution paradigm demands sustainable agriculture practices, for which antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have recently caught much attention. The goal of this work was to disclose the bioactivity of three peptides mixtures (BP100:RW-BP100, BP100:CA-M, and RW-BP100:CA-M), against three strains of E. amylovora representing distinct genotypes and virulence (LMG 2024, Ea 630 and Ea 680). The three AMPs' mixtures were assayed at eight different equimolar concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 6 mu M (1:1). Results showed MIC and MBC values between 2.5 and 4 mu M for every AMP mixture and strain. Regarding cell viability, flow cytometry and alamarBlue reduction, showed high reduction (>25%) of viable cells after 30 min of AMP exposure, depending on the peptide mixture and strain assayed. Hypersensitive response in tobacco plants showed that the most efficient AMPs mixtures and concentrations caused low to no reaction of the plant.

"Evolution, reconfiguration and low-carbon performance of green space pattern under diverse urban development scenarios: A machine learning-based simulation approach","Ecological restoration, green space morphology, and carbon emissions are intricately interconnected. Previous research utilizing case studies and econometric modeling has demonstrated that effective ecological restoration and well-structured green space configurations can significantly enhance carbon sequestration, reduce carbon emissions, and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change during urbanization. However, as urban land-use patterns become increasingly complex and development trajectories more diverse, the relationship between green space morphology and carbon dynamics (emissions and sequestration) reveals notable heterogeneity and non-linear characteristics. Understanding these complex, non-linear relationships and the underlying mechanisms is both theoretically and technically innovative, with profound implications for urban planning, policy formulation, climate change mitigation, and ecological conservation. In this study, we applied machine learning algorithms to model the non-linear relationships and threshold effects between green space evolution and carbon emissions/sequestration at different stages of ecological restoration in the Yangtze River Basin, China. Furthermore, we simulated the low-carbon performance of green spaces under various urban development scenarios. The key findings include: (1) Wetlands, particularly those composed of shallow water bodies and land-water interfaces such as marshes and mangroves, are critical determinants of the low-carbon performance of green spaces, with their effects on carbon emissions and sequestration exhibiting significant temporal dynamics throughout different stages of ecological restoration. (2) The fragmentation and shape complexity of green spaces substantially influence carbon efficiency. Preserving the connectivity and integrity of green spaces, particularly in large-scale forests and wetlands, while minimizing fragmentation and reducing shape complexity, can enhance carbon sequestration capacity. (3) Carbon performance varies markedly across different urban development trajectories. In cities prioritizing ecological restoration, future carbon emissions tend to stabilize, whereas in rapidly growing megacities, despite recent declines in carbon emissions, further optimization of green space configurations is required to effectively manage emissions and bolster sequestration. In summary, this study provides robust scientific evidence for ecological restoration and green space planning in the Yangtze River Basin, offering valuable insights for carbon management and ecological restoration in similar regions globally. These findings contribute to global environmental governance efforts and the ongoing fight against climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
Examining the benefits of using bio-CNG in urban bus operations,"Public service fleets offer an attractive option for introducing new renewable fuels on a large scale, which allow for the reduction of both greenhouse gas emissions and exhaust air pollutants.

Examining the Role of Aguas Frescas in Assessment of Sugary-Drink Intake among Mexican and Mexican American Adults,"Background: Aguas frescas are Mexican drinks that are typically made with water, sugar, and fruit. Aguas frescas may be a significant fi cant component of sugary-drink intake among Mexican and Mexican-American (MA) adults. However, it is unclear whether survey respondents report aguas frescas consumption when it is not specifically fi cally queried in standardized beverage frequency instruments. Objectives: This study examined the prevalence of aguas frescas consumption, the sociodemographic correlates of aguas frescas intake, and how specifically fi cally querying aguas frescas intake affects sugary-drink estimates among Mexican and MA adults. Methods: Cross-sectional, online surveys were conducted in 2021 with 5377 Mexican and 3073 MA adults as part of the International Food Policy Study. Past 7-d consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), sugary drinks, and aguas frescas were assessed along with relevant covariates. Weighted analyses included logistic and linear regression, including models with correlation structure. Results: An estimated 61.7% of Mexican and 28.7% of MA adults consumed aguas frescas. . In Mexico, consumption was associated with females, low education, perceiving oneself as having about the right weight, being good to excellent health, and consuming an unhealthy amount of sugary drinks. For MAs, intake was associated with being younger, speaking Spanish, and perceiving oneself as being underweight or about the right weight. Among Mexican adults who consumed aguas frescas but did not report them unless specifically fi cally queried, the volume of SSB intake was 67.9% higher for females and 64.3% higher for males when aguas frescas were included. Among MAs, SSB intake was 56.9% higher for females and 44.1% higher for males. Most participants (79.9%-85.2%) - 85.2%) remained in the same sugary-drink tertiles when including compared with excluding aguas frescas. . Conclusions: Aguas frescas should be queried during beverage intake assessments, as they contribute a nontrivial amount of added sugars to the diets of many Mexican and MA adults.",Not About Sufficiency
Ex-ante reminders: The effect of messaging strategies on reducing non-sustainable consumption behaviors in access-based services,"Users' non-sustainable consumption behaviors are affecting the sustainability of access-based services (ABSs), but ABS firms can utilize messaging strategies (ex-ante reminders) to persuade users to curtail their non-sustainable consumption behaviors. Through two online scenario-based experiments in China, this study determined that: (1) Compared with rational appeal messaging, emotional appeal messaging is better able to persuade consumers to curtail non-sustainable consumption behaviors. Furthermore, loss-framed messages are more effective than gain-framed ones. (2) Message appeal and message framing have an interactive persuasive effect on reducing such consumer behaviors. Loss-framed rational appeal messages are more persuasive at reducing non-sustainable consumption behaviors than gain-framed rational appeal messages, and gain-framed emotional appeal messages persuade consumers to reduce non-sustainable consumption behaviors more than loss-framed ones. (3) Consumers' psychological ownership moderates the persuasive effect of messaging. Among consumers with a high level of psychological ownership of shared goods, only gain-framed emotional appeal messaging is effective at reducing non-sustainable consumption behaviors, whereas among consumers with low psychological ownership, the persuasive effect of loss-framed rational appeal messaging is more effective than gain-framed emotional appeal messaging. This study extends the research on non-sustainable consumption behavior management in ABSs and provides important inspiration for the management of ABSs consumer behavior.",Not About Sufficiency
Exergoenvironmental analysis of bioenergy systems: A comprehensive review,"Bioenergy systems are expected to expand over the coming decades due to their potential to address energy security and environmental pollution challenges. Nevertheless, any renewable energy project can only survive if approved environmentally superior to its conventional counterparts. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an internationally standardized and validated methodology to evaluate and quantify the environmental impacts of bioenergy systems. However, due to its methodological scope, the LCA method measures only the environmental consequences of the target products of energy systems. The LCA approach can neither allocate the environmental impacts at the component level nor measure the environmental impacts of intermediate products. These challenges can be substantially resolved by systematically integrating the LCA approach with the thermodynamically-rooted exergy, offering a powerful environmental sustainability assessment tool known as ""exergoenvironmental analysis"". Due to the unique methodological and conceptual characteristics of exergoenvironmental analysis in revealing the possibilities and trends for improvement, it has recently received increasing attention to mitigate the environmental impacts of bioenergy systems. Therefore, this review is aimed to thoroughly summarize and critically discuss the evaluation of sustainability aspects of bioenergy systems based on exergoenvironmental analysis. The pros and cons of using exergoenvironmental analysis in bioenergy research are also outlined to identify possible future directions for the field. Overall, exergoenvironmental analysis can offer more detailed information on the environmental consequences of each flow and component of bioenergy production plants, thereby diagnosing the breakthrough points for additional environmental improvements.",Not About Sufficiency
EXPERIMENTAL BASIN STUDIES - AN INTERNATIONAL AND HISTORICAL-PERSPECTIVE OF FOREST IMPACTS,"The long tradition of catchment studies in hydrology results from the need to understand the water balance operating in basins, the processes controlling water movements and the impacts of land-use change on water quantity and quality. The interactions between physical, chemical and biological behaviour have become an increasingly dominant theme in recent years, and this has been boosted by global environmental problems such as acid rain and climatic change. After a historical summary of catchment studies, a brief review is given of some of the most influential experiments and their underlying objectives and results, concentrating on those concerned with one land-use change in particular - to/from forestry. In interpreting the effects of a change in forest cover, it is necessary also to consider impacts of the associated site disturbance, including possible soil compaction and road construction as a result of logging and any artificial drainage before tree planting. The recent tendency to link basin studies into networks is discussed, with examples of currently active networks.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploration of Short-Term Vehicle Utilization Choices in Households with Multiple Vehicle Types,"With the growing concerns of energy sustainability, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change, there is an increasing interest in understanding vehicle ownership and utilization decisions better so that effective policies can be implemented to reduce the negative impacts of private automobile usage. Although there is a rich body of literature on the long-term decisions of vehicle ownership and the composition of vehicles, the short-term choices of which vehicle to use from the household's vehicle holdings and what distance will be traveled to access opportunities, as well as the interrelationship between the two, are less understood. The purpose of this study was to contribute to the literature on short-term vehicle utilization decisions with the use of data collected in 2009 from the National Household Travel Survey. A latent class segmentation model was estimated with alternate interrelationship structures as the latent classes. Within each latent class, the choices were modeled consistently with the interrelationship structure through the introduction of the first choice as an explanatory variable in the model of the second choice. Additionally, scale was introduced to account for differences in the choices and interrelationships across regions. Most of the model estimation results were behaviorally plausible and consistent with expectations. A significant finding was that interrelationships in both latent classes were insignificant. It was also found that the latent model, even with the insignificant interrelationships, outperformed the alternate model formulations in terms of model fit. This finding shows that the latent segments may capture unobserved heterogeneity beyond the interrelationships.",Not About Sufficiency
"Exploring Connections among Ecosystem Services Supply, Demand and Human Well-Being in a Mountain-Basin System, China","Stakeholder perception and supply-demand relations are the main challenges and future directions for research on ecosystem services (ES). Based on spatial data and statistical data, we mapped eight key ES supply between 2005-2015 in the Huailai mountain-basin area. Using data from 507 survey questionnaires, we identified the ES demand and the public perceptions of the changes in ES. In addition, we also reveal the characteristics of the spatial distribution of ES demand, analyze the spatial supply-demand matching of ES, and explore the relationships between ES supply-demand and human well-being. From 2005 to 2015, a general upward trend was observed in the supply of four types of product provisioning services, which is different from the trend perceived by the stakeholders. An increasing trend was observed for carbon sequestration and forest recreation, which was in line with the perceptions of change. A spatial mismatch existed between the ES demand and supply, whereby the supply of carbon sequestration, soil conservation, habitat quality, and forest recreation services exceeded the demand in townships in the mountainous and hilly regions. On the other hand, townships located in the valley plains experienced a high imbalance between the demand and the supply. For the four types of product provisioning services, most towns and villages showed a balance in demand and supply. Linking ES supply-demand and human well-being showed that a threshold may exist in the supply-demand imbalance of regulating and supporting services before it begins to impact human well-being. Our study would enrich the theory and methodology research on relationships between ecosystem services and human well-being, and support knowledge to land allocation and management.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring diffusion of innovation adoption attributes: a cross-disciplinary literature analysis,"Diffusion of innovations is a theory that revolves around the process of introducing technological innovations into a system through the many available different channels of communication. The purpose of this paper is to undertake a systematic review of the literature available for this theory to gain an insight into the spread of the attributes that regulate the diffusion process of an innovation in question. ISI Web of Knowledge (R) and Google Scholar were the two search engines deployed for extracting the data relevant to this review. These engines fetched 2,073 publications in total that had cited the Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation theory. At the completion of the screening process only 223 publications were shortlisted as relevant. The analysis of these publications will be mainly carried out across the demographic features. These features have been typically categorised into seven demographic trends - frequency, year of publication, journals, conferences, authors, country, and number of citations. A cross sector analysis will be carried out to essentially place discussions over the sector specific innovations. These will then depict the informative trends emerging from these features which will be highlighted as the findings, along with the presentation of limitations and suggestions from this review.",Not About Sufficiency
"Exploring potential pathways towards urban greenhouse gas peaks: A case study of Guangzhou, China","Cities are key to global greenhouse gas emissions management. To explore urban greenhouse gas peak pathways, a city-level Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emission Analysis model was developed by using Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning model framework. Using the city of Guangzhou as a case study, this research compiled a overall energy balance sheet of base year and simulated future CO2 emission trends from 2015 to 2030 under three scenarios. Results show that CO2 emissions in Guangzhou will peak around 2023 under the current policy scenario. In order to advance the CO2 emissions peak to 2020, the more stringent emissions-reduction policies and measures need to be adopted under the peaking scenario and enhanced peaking scenario, with the peak emission value of 125-127 Mt CO(2)e. The industrial sector is the only sector in which CO2 emissions have peaked in Guangzhou, the building sector's CO2 emissions will not peak by 2030 under any of the three scenarios, while the transportation sector, which will contribute 50 percent of emission reduction potential, is the key to achieve its goal of peaking CO2 emissions on time. In the short term, stringent reduction strategies on the transportation, industrial, and power sectors are needed, including transport mode adjustment, industrial structure adjustment, electrification level improvement, clean-up transformation of thermal power, and energy efficiency improvement. However, in the long term, reduction strategies for the building sector, like energy efficiency improvement and large-scale application of renewable energy, will be essential for Guangzhou.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring potential diffusion pathways of biorefinery innovations-An agent-based simulation approach for facilitating shared value creation,"In many European countries with plentiful forest resources, novel forest-based businesses play a key role in the transition from our current fossil-based economy towards a circular bioeconomy. For example, kraft lignin, a by-product from the pulping industry, is produced in large amounts globally. To date, however, it is still only offered on the market by a small number of pulping companies. The successful innovation diffusion of related new technologies and businesses requires establishing a collective effort among multiple societal actors to motivate the sharing of value creation processes. In this paper, potential innovation diffusion pathways are modeled and simulated by means of an agent-based approach (Biorefinery Products Innovation Diffusion model, BioPID). The paper investigates the conditions needed to encourage the diffusion of kraft lignin innovations as a (partial) replacement for fossil-based feedstock in selected applications. The results reveal the basic mechanisms behind potential innovation diffusion pathways. The major barriers were found to be the high level of uncertainty surrounding the additional costs arising in lignin processing, the small number of lignin providers, and the presence of relatively homogeneous pricing strategies based on opportunity and basic preparation costs. The analysis of two product categories revealed different patterns in terms of innovation diffusion and potential greenhouse gas emissions. A novelty of BioPID is that it allows for iterative technology evaluation and technology foresight analysis of biorefinery projects (e.g., by combining techno-economic, socio-technical, and environmental aspects). This produces knowledge for diverse stakeholders involved in the lignin innovation ecosystem, thus enabling better communication on shared values and furthering innovation diffusion.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the Impact of Green Finance and Green Innovation on Resource Efficiency: The Mediating Role of Market Regulations and Environmental Regulations,"Green finance, innovation, and resource efficiency have gained significant traction recently, particularly in resource-rich countries. This study investigates the role of green finance and innovation in resource efficiency with the mediating lens of environmental regulations and market rules. The study employs a structural equation model on a panel of 15 resource-rich countries from 1995 to 2023. The findings illustrate a complicated interplay between the variables. First, the findings show that green financing positively and negatively affects resource efficiency. In contrast, green innovation constantly improves resource efficiency. Market rules have a favorable impact on resource efficiency. Environmental laws, however, hurt resource efficiency. Furthermore, the study reveals that green financing favors market regulations, implying that financial expenditures in green initiatives might strengthen regulatory frameworks that promote market efficiency. In contrast, green finance harms environmental rules, and green innovation harms both market and environmental regulations. In addition, we divided the sample into developed and developing nations and offered a sub-group analysis to take into consideration the variations in the degree of national development and green advances to further improve the analysis. Overall, the study emphasizes the multifaceted role of green finance and innovation in increasing resource efficiency within regulatory frameworks. These findings are critical for policymakers and stakeholders in resource-rich countries seeking to reconcile economic growth with sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency
Export of Recyclable Materials: Evidence from Japan,"In this paper, we study the waste haven hypothesis, which predicts that waste materials will be exported from high-income developed countries with stringent environmental regulations to developing countries with less rigorous environmental protection. Using data on Japanese export of recyclable waste resources (plastic waste, waste paper, iron and steel scrap, and nonferrous metal scraps), we find evidence from our econometric analysis that Asian countries provide a waste haven for Japan. In particular, Japan exports waste materials to Asian countries with low per capita incomes and large markets. We suggest that environmental regulation should be tightened to reduce waste trade in Asia.",Not About Sufficiency
"Extensive microphytobenthos mats of invasive Vaucheria aff. compacta and abiotic environmental factors influencing its abundance in Adventfjorden tidal flat, Svalbard","Arctic coastline ecosystems are affected by current sea level rise together with increasing anthropogenic and environmental physical and biogeochemical pressures. Changes in nutrient concentrations followed by changes in primary productivity and biodiversity are also connected with the growth of global trade, urbanization, and travel activity. All these anthropogenic activities create biotic homogenization. The occurrence of massive extensive mats of the yellow-green alga Vaucheria aff. compacta is a unique phenomenon in the High Arctic tidal flat ecosystem. The objective of this study was to outline which physicochemical conditions are connected with the massive presence of V. aff. compacta mats across the Adventfjorden tidal flat. The Adventfjorden tidal flat is a very dynamic system. Fine silt sediment (68% to 80%) dominates across the studied tidal flat. The sediment cover of V. aff. compacta mats was always very thin and felt-like coatings can grow out. Beneath the V. aff. compacta mats a second distinct layer of dead filaments were observed in the black and anoxic mud layer. V. aff. compacta area cover was positively correlated with water salinity, pH, temperature, and sediment Na and organic carbon content. In addition, potential abiotic factors related with the local distribution and abundance of V. aff. compacta showed positive correlations between area cover and N-nitrate and P-phosphate. N-nitrate concentration appears to significantly promote V. aff. compacta abundance. V. aff. compacta distribution and abundance in the Adventfjorden tidal flat is influenced by a wide spectrum of environmental and structural variables including anthropogenically induced micronutrients.",Not About Sufficiency
Extraction of gully erosion using multi-level random forest model based on object-based image analysis,"Gully erosion cause soil organic matter loss, which poses a grave threat to food security and regional ecological sustainability. Remote sensing monitoring and information extraction of gully erosion are of great significance to protect cultivated land resources and agricultural production. To improve the extraction accuracy of gully erosion, multi-level random forest (RF) extraction model based on object-based image analysis (OBIA) is proposed to extract gully erosion information. The Gaofen-2 (GF-2) image was selected as the main data source, supplemented by topographic data, to segment the features in Dehui City based on multi-scale segmentation method. Fusing spectral, textural and geometric feature information, the RF Gini index (GI) was used for feature optimization. Gully erosion extraction based on feature classes was performed using multi-level RF model based on OBIA in the southwestern part of Dehui City, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 96.71% and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.865.

Willingness to Pay in Tourism and Its Influence on Sustainability,"Financial support for environmental causes is more urgent than ever before. Thus, understanding consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for tourism is vital for policymakers, businesses, and researchers. This bibliometric study examined the trend of research on willingness to pay and tourism using 428 articles published in the Scopus indexed database between 1994 and 2023. The articles were extracted using the keywords ""Willingness to pay tourism"". A Microsoft Excel sheet was used in the descriptive analysis, and a VOSviewer version 1.6.20 was used for the citation and co-occurrence analysis. The study found that willingness to pay is a complex aspect of environmental economics and tourism behaviour that is shaped by various aspects. Amongst other things, willingness to pay is shaped by aspects such as tourist biogeography, amongst others is the level of environmental awareness, environmental sensitivity, and education. In many respects, it is shaped by demographic factors such as age, gender, income bracket, and area of origin. Even though the major thrust of willingness to pay was anchored on sustainability and environmental protection, recent events in the mold of climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and technological innovation have played major roles in shaping tourists' behaviour. Given the emerging thrust and focus, there is a need to respond to geographic knowledge gaps in tourism hotspots to understand how this will shape tourism sustainability from a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) perspective going forward. In doing so, it will be critical to ensure continued fostering and understanding of how tourists' willingness to pay for tourism destinations can lead to better design, marketing, and managed services to create memorable experiences that drive consumer loyalty.",Not About Sufficiency
Fabrication of a cost-effective metal oxide-based adsorbent from industrial waste slag for efficient CO2 separation under flue gas conditions,"Efficient and affordable adsorbents for CO2 capture are essential in implementing carbon capture technology to mitigate the negative impact of greenhouse gas emissions. This study focuses on synthesizing new nanoporous adsorbents from industrial waste slag using a simple and cost-effective coprecipitation method. In this method, raw slag was milled for 48 h and used as a benchmark for comparing two newly synthesized adsorbents. Selectivity and pure gas isotherm experiments were conducted for all adsorbents in the 25-65 degrees C temperature range and under harsh industrial conditions of 65 degrees C and 15 % CO2. This study utilized the response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the CO2 adsorption parameters. Specifically, the optimized adsorption conditions were determined for the 15/85 % CO2/N-2 condition, and the optimal values for pressure and temperature were found to be 5 bar and 45 degrees C, resulting in CO2/N-2 selectivity of 5.65. The NH3-slag adsorbent was identified as the superior choice based on its selectivity and maximum adsorption capacity. The maximum adsorption capacity and cyclic efficiency were determined to be 4.15 mmol/g and 98.1 %, respectively, at a temperature, pressure, and composition of 45 degrees C, 5 bar, and 15 % CO2. Isotherm and thermodynamic models were employed to further investigate the adsorption process. The isotherm results indicated that the adsorption of CO2 by adsorbents occurred heterogeneously in patch-wise sites. Meanwhile, the thermodynamic parameters showed that the process was exothermic and spontaneous, with Delta H degrees falling below 20 (kJ/mol), showing physisorption phenomena.",Not About Sufficiency
Facilitating Photovoltaic Cell Performance Improvement through Deployment of Engineered Organic Nanomaterials,"This research work provides concise insights into fossil fuel consumption challenges, and the factors contributing to global warming, and evaluates the significance of photovoltaic (PV) materials in achieving net-zero-CO2 emissions. The article categorizes constraints in the development of PV cells into four main areas: technical factors, leadership impact, political instability, and financial aspects. Primarily, the study delves into technical factors, focusing on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and power density of PV cells. Theoretically, approximately 67% of solar energy is dissipated in various forms:- 47% as heat, 18% as photons, and 2% in local combination loss. Commercially available mono-crystalline silicon (c-Si) and polycrystalline silicon (poly-c-Si) PV cells typically demonstrate a range of PCEs between 15%-22% and 13%18%, respectively, presenting an efficiency considerably lower than the potential maximum of 100%. The study highlights organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) as promising third-generation PV modules due to their relatively high power conversion efficiency (HPCE) and eco-friendly attributes. However, their commercial feasibility is under scrutiny owing to constraints such as a limited lifespan, high production costs, and challenges in mass production. Ongoing research and development (R&D) in PV cell technologies aim to enhance PCE and power density, establish cost-effective production methods, and create more reliable and sustainable supply chains. Additionally, the study explores the role of nanotechnology in developing high- power conversion efficiency cells, identifies research gaps and priorities in engineered organic material PV cells, and discusses the potential of OPVs in the R&D of high-efficiency, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly PV cells.",Not About Sufficiency
Factors Affecting the Adoption of Gamified Smart Tourism Applications: An Integrative Approach,"Considering that the core concerns in sustainability are threats to the survival of humankind and the ecosystems that humans depend on, changing the consumption and production behaviors of individuals and society is inevitable. However, people are reluctant to change their own behavior in support of sustainability goals. This tendency seems to be especially strong in tourism because the main value of tourism is hedonic utility. Thus, the tourism industry is now introducing gamification and smart tourism to shift tourist behavior toward sustainability, but most of studies and practices only focus on the performance and application of gamification without considering customer adoption patterns and perceptions during the process. This study empirically investigated what factors affect the adoption of smart tourism applications that incorporate game elements, using the Google Maps tourist guide program. As an initial approach, we incorporated diverse theoretical approaches: perceived usefulness; perceived ease of use; perceived enjoyment from technology acceptance model; information and interaction motivations from the uses and gratifications theory; the network effect; distributive justice; flow as responses to the game characteristics of smart tourism applications; and information privacy concerns as a negative factor for diffusion. The result showed that hedonic characteristics of the gamified smart tourism application (GSTA) are strong in adoption. Perceived enjoyment had a significant influence on the intention to use, but information quality, related to cognitive experience, did not. The flow and perceived distributive justice associated with the game content were not significant, but the interaction motivation was significant in the research model. The results of this study show that individuals regard a GSTA as a low-level game tool. Also, it is important to preoccupy the smart tourism application market in terms of marketing strategy because the network effect is relevant to both perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment. We also found that the need to provide personal information would negatively affect the adoption of a gamified smart tourism application.",Not About Sufficiency
A novel approach for co-producing positive scenarios that explore agency: case study from the Canadian Arctic,"The planet's social-ecological systems are expected to change in rapid and surprising ways in the coming decades, with consequences for ecosystems, ecosystem services, and human well-being. One way to support local communities and decision-makers at higher scales in addressing such surprising changes is to develop scenarios that are locally actionable and that can inform understanding of social-ecological dynamics across scales. This study focuses on three areas that require advances for developing globally relevant scenarios that support local action: (1) mobilizing Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) in scenarios; (2) using scenarios to explore agency to affect the future; (3) probing a vast range of plausible positive futures. For scenarios to be relevant to communities in supporting positive change, approaches that engage with ILK to explore how human action, or agency, can shape the future are needed, as well as positive scenarios that feature a wide range of good outcomes for nature and people to inspire and guide action. We propose a novel set of methods for participatory scenario planningdeveloped and tested through a case study in the Canadian Arcticdesigned to carefully explore what positive futures' could mean to different populations faced with growing impacts from environmental and social change, and how positive outcomes can be achieved even in light of these changing dynamics. This scenario approach provides direction to engage multiple ways of knowing in developing knowledge about future changes that can direct sustainable action.",Not About Sufficiency

Feasibility study of a Great Lakes bioenergy system,"A bioenergy production and delivery system built around the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway (GLSLS) transportation corridor was assessed for its ability to mitigate energy security and climate change risks. The land area within 100 km of the GLSLS and associated railway lines was estimated to be capable of producing at least 30 Mt(dry)yr(-1) of lignocellulosic biomass with minimal adverse impacts on food and fibre production. This was estimated to be sufficient to displace all of the coal-fired electricity in Ontario plus more than 620 million L of green diesel (equivalent to 5.3% of diesel consumption in GLSLS provinces). Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions were 88% and 76% lower than coal-fired power and conventional diesel, respectively. Production costs of $120 MWh(-1) for power and up to $30 GJ(-1) ($1.1L(-1)) for green diesel were higher than current market prices, but a value for low-carbon energy would narrow the price differential.

A Lifecycle Assessment of a Low-Energy Mass-Timber Building and Mainstream Concrete Alternative in Central Chile,"While high-rise mass-timber construction is booming worldwide as a more sustainable alternative to mainstream cement and steel, in South America, there are still many gaps to overcome regarding sourcing, design, and environmental performance. The aim of this study was to assess the carbon emission footprint of using mass-timber products to build a mid-rise low-energy residential building in central Chile (CCL). The design presented at a solar decathlon contest in Santiago was assessed through lifecycle analysis (LCA) and compared to an equivalent mainstream concrete building. Greenhouse gas emissions, expressed as global warming potential (GWP), from cradle-to-usage over a 50-year life span, were lower for the timber design, with 131 kg CO2 eq/m(2) of floor area (compared to 353 kg CO2 eq/m(2)) and a biogenic carbon storage of 447 tons of CO2 eq/m(2) based on sustainable forestry practices. From cradle-to-construction, the embodied emissions of the mass-timber building were 42% lower (101 kg CO2 eq/m(2)) than those of the equivalent concrete building (167 kg CO2 eq/m(2)). The embodied energy of the mass-timber building was 37% higher than that of its equivalent concrete building and its envelope design helped reduce space-conditioning emissions by as much as 83%, from 187 kg CO2 eq/m(2) as estimated for the equivalent concrete building to 31 kg CO2 eq/m(2) 50-yr. Overall, provided that further efforts are made to address residual energy end-uses and end-of-life waste management options, the use of mass-timber products offers a promising potential in CCL for delivering zero carbon residential multistory buildings.",Not About Sufficiency

"Tool to assess the technical, economic, and environmental feasibility study for the concession of urban solid waste management services","Intermunicipal consortia have proven to be an alternative in managing urban solid waste (USW), mainly for small municipalities seeking solutions both for treatment and final disposal of waste and for scale gain and resources optimization. This study aimed to propose a tool to assess the Technical, Economic, and Environmental Feasibility Study (EVTEA) applied in an intermunicipal public consortia in Minas Gerais, which was selected for the implementation of a pilot project by the Federal Government to hire specialized technical services necessary for structuring concession projects in the area of solid waste management. The methodology was structured in two stages: analysis of management, and billing mechanisms in the consortia municipalities; proposition and application of an EVTEA assessment tool for the management services applied in the consortia. The results of the first stage indicated that the small and small/medium-sized consortia municipalities need to advance in waste management by applying the principles of non-generation, reduction, reuse, and recycling, and promoting the social inclusion of collectors to achieve their sustainability. In the second stage, the assessment tool applied in a consortia made it possible to quantify the performance in the preparation of the study through the use of proposed indicators related to service and sufficiency of information to meet the analysis of the study.

Robust paths to net greenhouse gas mitigation and negative emissions via advanced biofuels,"Biofuel and bioenergy systems are integral to most climate stabilization scenarios for displacement of transport sector fossil fuel use and for producing negative emissions via carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, the net greenhouse gas mitigation benefit of such pathways is controversial due to concerns around ecosystem carbon losses from land use change and foregone sequestration benefits from alternative land uses. Here, we couple bottom-up ecosystem simulation with models of cellulosic biofuel production and CCS in order to track ecosystem and supply chain carbon flows for current and future biofuel systems, with comparison to competing land-based biological mitigation schemes. Analyzing three contrasting US case study sites, we show that on land transitioning out of crops or pasture, switchgrass cultivation for cellulosic ethanol production has per-hectare mitigation potential comparable to reforestation and severalfold greater than grassland restoration. In contrast, harvesting and converting existing secondary forest at those sites incurs large initial carbon debt requiring long payback periods. We also highlight how plausible future improvements in energy crop yields and biorefining technology together with CCS would achieve mitigation potential 4 and 15 times greater than forest and grassland restoration, respectively. Finally, we show that recent estimates of induced land use change are small relative to the opportunities for improving system performance that we quantify here. While climate and other ecosystem service benefits cannot be taken for granted from cellulosic biofuel deployment, our scenarios illustrate how conventional and carbon-negative biofuel systems could make a nearterm, robust, and distinctive contribution to the climate challenge.",Not About Sufficiency
Fire-related carbon emissions from land use transitions in southern Amazonia,"Various land-use transitions in the tropics contribute to atmospheric carbon emissions, including forest conversion for small-scale farming, cattle ranching, and production of commodities such as soya and palm oil. These transitions involve fire as an effective and inexpensive means for clearing. We applied the DECAF (DEforestation CArbon Fluxes) model to Mato Grosso, Brazil to estimate fire emissions from various land-use transitions during 2001-2005. Fires associated with deforestation contributed 67 Tg C/yr (17 and 50 Tg C/yr from conversion to cropland and pasture, respectively), while conversion of savannas and existing cattle pasture to cropland contributed 17 Tg C/yr and pasture maintenance fires 6 Tg C/yr. Large clearings (>100 ha/yr) contributed 67% of emissions but comprised only 10% of deforestation events. From a policy perspective, results imply that intensification of agricultural production on already-cleared land and policies to discourage large clearings would reduce the major sources of emissions from fires in this region.

Enforcement data from Norway presented here appears, at first glance, to confirm this ""stylized fact"": firms are inspected less than once a year, detected violators are seldom fined, but still, serious violations seem relatively rare. However, at a closer look, the pattern seems less paradoxical: enforcement of minor violations is lax, but such violations do flourish; serious violations, on the other hand, are subject to credible threats of harsh punishment, and such violations are more uncommon. This seems quite consistent with predictions from standard theory. We argue that the empirical existence of the Harrington paradox is not well documented in the international literature. The claim that firms' compliance with environmental regulations is generally higher than predicted by standard theory should thus be regarded as a hypothesis rather than an established fact.",Not About Sufficiency
"Floodplain environmental change during the Younger Dryas and Holocene in Northwest Europe: Insights from the lower Kennet Valley, south central England","Many lowland rivers across northwest Europe exhibit broadly similar behavioural responses to glacial-interglacial transitions and landscape development. Difficulties exist in assessing these, largely because the evidence from many rivers remains limited and fragmentary. Here we address this issue in the context of the river Kennet, a tributary of the Thames, since c. 13,000 cal BP. Some similarities with other rivers are present, suggesting that regional climatic shifts are important controls. The Kennet differs from the regional pattern in a number of ways. The rate of response to sudden climatic change, particularly at the start of the Holocene and also mid-Holocene forest clearance, appears very high. This may reflect abrupt shifts between two catchment scale hydrological states arising from contemporary climates, land use change and geology. Stadial hydrology is dominated by nival regimes, with limited winter infiltration and high spring and summer runoff. Under an interglacial climate, infiltration is more significant. The probable absence of permafrost in the catchment means that a lag between the two states due to its gradual decay is unlikely. Palaeoecology, supported by radiocarbon dates, suggests that, at the very start of the Holocene, a dramatic episode of fine sediment deposition across most of the valley floor occurred, lasting 500-1000 years. A phase of peat accumulation followed as mineral sediment supply declined. A further shift led to tufa deposition, initially in small pools, then across the whole floodplain area, with the river flowing through channels cut in tufa and experiencing repeated avulsion. Major floods, leaving large gravel bars that still form positive relief features on the floodplain, followed mid-Holocene floodplain stability. Prehistoric deforestation is likely to be the cause of this flooding, inducing a major environmental shift with significantly increased surface runoff. Since the Bronze Age, predominantly fine sediments were deposited along the valley with apparently stable channels and vertical floodplain accretion associated with soil erosion and less catastrophic flooding. The Kennet demonstrates that, while a general pattern of river behaviour over time, within a region, may be identifiable, individual rivers are likely to diverge from this. Consequently, it is essential to understand catchment controls, particularly the relative significance of surface and subsurface hydrology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

"Devilfish bone char, an alternative material to be used as bioanode in microbial fuel cells","This work aimed to evaluate the devilfish bone char as an alternative material to be used as a bioanode in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) applied in bioenergy production from the pantoprazole biodegradation. The devilfish is an invasive species in Mexico and other countries, so its control and eradication are based on the integral use of its biomass. In addition, the bones are unusable waste and could be used as a raw material to manufacture the bioanode. Two MFCs with an anaerobic anode single chamber of 125 mL were operated independently using the fabricated bioanode and the carbon felt (conventional anode). Both MFCs were fed with 1 g/L of pantoprazole as substrate with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 210 +/- 1.3 mg/L and 1.2 g of soil as inoculum. The two MFCs were characterized electrochemically, and the COD removal percentage was measured as an indicator of the pantoprazole biodegradation. The results showed that the MFC operated with the bioanode had a better performance than the conventional anode, since it reached a maximum power density of 1.22 mW/m2, being 156% higher than carbon felt. These values were consistent with the COD removal percentages reached in 10 days with values of 47.17 +/- 0.23 and 43.34 +/- 0.41%, respectively. Therefore, these findings provide a low-cost alternative carbonaceous material for the sustainable construction of MFC applied to produce bioenergy from the biodegradation of pharmaceutical products.",Not About Sufficiency
Fluid-phase-equilibrium prediction of fluorocompound-containing binary systems with the predictive E-PPR78 model,"In order to reduce the overall emissions of greenhouse gases and to be in compliance with the current environmental regulations, a new class of refrigerants has appeared. Such refrigerants are generally multi-component systems that contain a fluorocompound mixed with CO2 and/or an alkane. In order to design processes involving such blends or to implement a product-design approach aimed at identifying new refrigerant mixtures, an equation of state (EoS) able to predict the properties of fluorocompound-containing systems is required. In order to reach this goal, it was decided in this study to add six fluorinated groups to the Enhanced-PPR78 model which combines the Peng-Robinson EoS and a group contribution method aimed at estimating the binary interaction parameters, k(ij)(T), involved in Van der Waals one-fluid mixing rules.

Flying rebound: consequences of the imposed flying sufficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Political measures during the COVID-19 pandemic forced consumers to cancel flights, resulting in significant decreases of their individual greenhouse gas emissions. This paper introduces the concept of imposed flying sufficiency and asks whether this could lead to a flying rebound. Imposed flying sufficiency describes that external factors, such as political measures during the pandemic, force consumers to reduce their flights. The term flying rebound refers to the gap between the emissions that could be potentially saved due to flying sufficiency and the actualized emissions savings due to adjusted flying behavior. A major contribution of this paper is combining the economic mechanisms with moral-psychological aspects of rebound effects in an experimental study. In a 2 (with/without economic hint) x 2 (with/without ecological hint) between-subjects experimental study, this paper analyzes how the awareness of monetary savings and the awareness of ecological consequences affect consumers' flying intentions. The study reveals an interaction effect of these two aspects: While awareness of the monetary savings will increase flying intentions, awareness of the ecological consequences will buffer this effect. Furthermore, the degree to which consumers feel flight shame, strongly moderates the economic and ecological hints' impact. Finally, the paper provides implications for managers and policymakers.",Not About Sufficiency
Food consumption by bathyal decapod crustacean assemblages in the western Mediterranean: predatory impact of megafauna and the food consumption food supply balance in a deep-water food web,"Estimates of the daily ration consumed by decapod assemblages were obtained from 2 continuous sampling cycles conducted over the middle and lower slope (610-710 m and 1178-1240 m depth respectively) of the Catalan Sea (NW Mediterranean). Annual food consumption by decapods decreased from 82.2 mg dry weight (DW) m(-2) yr(-1) on the middle slope to 20.4 mg DW m(-2) yr(-1) on the lower slope. Additionally, from literature sources, the food consumption by fishes and the secondary production of macrobenthos and macroplankton were assessed for our deep-sea area. Combining the food consumption of megafauna (decapod crustaceans plus fishes), a model of the food supply-food consumption balance was proposed for the middle slope, the only depth stratum for which adequate information exists. On the middle slope, annual food consumption by megafauna amounted to 160 mg DW m(-2) yr(-1) while secondary production by the dominant macrobenthic taxa (suprabenthos, epibenthos and infauna) was estimated at 150 mg DW m(-2) yr(-1). Benthos was the main contributor to the food supply in our megafaunal mid-slope communities. The mean annual contribution of macroplankton was secondary, although it can be seasonally important. Euphausiids were the dominant macroplankton taxon over the middle slope, and only 10.6% of their secondary production (7.3 mg DW m(-2) yr(-1)) was estimated to be consumed by decapods, whereas the total estimated euphausiid production consumed by our mid-bathyal community hardly attained 20%. Our results showed a tight equilibrium between food consumption and food supply on the middle slope. Estimated food consumption by mid-slope megafauna (0.059 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) is equivalent to calculated Values for production by benthic and suprabenthic macrofauna. This value is also consistent with estimates of mid-slope organic carbon through sedimentation (1.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), after correcting for metabolism by benthos (from macrofauna to sediment bacteria). These results are consistent with the commonly accepted idea that food is the main limiting factor in deep-sea trophic webs.",Not About Sufficiency
Food supply and provisioning behavior of parents: Are small hoopoe nestlings condemned to die?,"Parents might use signals of need or of quality to decide food provisioning among their offspring, while the use of one or another signal might depend on food availability. Begging success of nestlings of different quality (i.e., body size) would also depend on food availability, and we here explore the effect of experimental food supply in begging success of nestlings and in provisioning of female hoopoes (Upupa epops), a species with extreme hatching asynchrony and nestlings size hierarchy. We video-recorded food allocation of females, begging success of nestlings of different size, and the social context (i.e., the size category of the other nestlings that were begging for food) during periods when experimental food supply was or was not available in the same nests. We found that when experimental food supplementation was present, begging success of the intermediate, but not that of large or small-sized nestlings, increased. The experiment, however, did not affect the feeding preferences of females toward nestlings of different size. Moreover, when small nestlings were the only ones that were begging for food, their begging success decreased in the experimental period, and females used supplemented prey to feed themselves. Those results, on one hand, confirm the importance of food availability for the begging success of nestlings of particular sizes and, on the other, indicate that females prefer to use extra food for their own rather than for the smallest nestlings. We discuss possible mechanisms explaining the detected experimental effects and the adaptive and nonadaptive explanations of mothers ignoring the small nestlings. Theoretically, parents should feed offspring that are begging for food; at least in situations of abundant resources. In accordance, during events of experimental food supply, medium-sized nestlings where feed more often. However, the begging behavior of small hoopoe nestlings were ignored by mothers even when only them were begging for food. In these situations, females used available prey to feed themselves. Possible functions of the existence of these condemned to die nestlings are discussed.",Not About Sufficiency
Foraging Arena Size and Structural Complexity Affect the Dynamics of Food Distribution in Ant Colonies,"Food acquisition by ant colonies is a complex process that starts with acquiring food at the source (i.e., foraging) and culminates with food exchange in or around the nest (i.e., feeding). While ant foraging behavior is relatively well understood, the process of food distribution has received little attention, largely because of the lack of methodology that allows for accurate monitoring of food flow. In this study, we used the odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile (Say) to investigate the effect of foraging arena size and structural complexity on the rate and the extent of spread of liquid carbohydrate food (sucrose solution) throughout a colony. To track the movement of food, we used protein marking and double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, DAS-ELISA. Variation in arena size, in conjunction with different colony sizes, allowed us to test the effect of different worker densities on food distribution. Results demonstrate that both arena size and colony size have a significant effect on the spread of the food and the number of workers receiving food decreased as arena size and colony size increased. When colony size was kept constant and arena size increased, the percentage of workers testing positive for the marker decreased, most likely because of fewer trophallactic interactions resulting from lower worker density. When arena size was kept constant and colony size increased, the percentage of workers testing positive decreased. Nonrandom (clustered) worker dispersion and a limited supply of food may have contributed to this result. Overall, results suggest that food distribution is more complete is smaller colonies regardless of the size of the foraging arena and that colony size, rather than worker density, is the primary factor affecting food distribution. The structural complexity of foraging arenas ranged from simple, two-dimensional space (empty arenas) to complex, three-dimensional space (arenas filled with mulch). The structural complexity of foraging arenas had a significant effect on food distribution and the presence of substrate significantly inhibited the spread of food. Structural complexity of foraging arenas and the resulting worker activity patterns might exert considerable influence on socioecological processes in ants and should be considered in laboratory assays.",Not About Sufficiency
Forecasting the Mitigation Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Shenzhen through Municipal Solid Waste Treatment: A Combined Weight Forecasting Model,"As a significant source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the municipal solid waste sector's greenhouse gas emission mode remains unknown, hampering effective decision-making on possible greenhouse gas emission reductions. Rapid urbanization and economic growth have resulted in massive volumes of municipal solid trash. As a result, identifying emission reduction routes for municipal solid waste treatment is critical. In this research, we investigate the potential of municipal solid waste treatment methods in lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Shenzhen, a typical Chinese major city. The results showed that the combined treatment of 58% incineration, 2% landfill, and 40% anaerobic digestion (AD) had the lowest greenhouse gas emissions of about 5.91 million tons under all scenarios.

Forecasting the transportation energy demand with the help of optimization artificial neural network using an improved red fox optimizer (IRFO),"Transportation energy demand has a significant impact on worldwide energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Accurate transportation energy demand predictions can help policy -makers develop and implement successful energy policies and strategies. In this study, a novel approach to predict transportation energy demand using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on the Improved Red Fox Optimizer (IRFO) has been suggested. The proposed method utilizes the ANN model to solve the complex nonlinear relationships between transportation energy demand and its effective parameters including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population, and vehicle numbers. Also, the IRFO algorithm was utilized to modify the ANN model's parameters to improve the prediction accuracy. The experimental findings demonstrate the ANN-IRFO model performs better than the other method in terms of accuracy and effectiveness. It predicts the growth of GDP, population, and vehicles number by 5.5 %, 4.8 %, and 4.2 %, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the suggested method can provide accurate forecasts for transportation energy demand, which can help decision-makers to make informed decisions and policies regarding energy management and sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Foreign direct investments and environmental quality in sub-Saharan Africa: the merits of policy and institutions for environmental sustainability,"This study investigates the association between foreign direct investment (FDI) and environmental quality, taking into account policies and institutions for environmental sustainability across 23 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries.

Furthermore, policies and institutions for environmental sustainability and domestic investment improve environmental quality in both the long and short run. The study concludes that policies and institutions for environmental sustainability in SSA are important as they improve environmental quality. The study also finds policies and institutions for environmental sustainability complements with FDI to improve environmental quality in the long run. Finally, the study further establishes that domestic investment is important to improve environmental quality in SSA.

FCS appears to be a relatively cheap way of reducing carbon in the atmosphere, relative to alternatives such as fuel switching. But FCS is not without problems. Economists' estimates of the cost-effectiveness of FCS are highly variable. Verification is difficult. And policy design is complex - not only because of the characteristics of forests themselves, but because of the limitations of current U.S. policy. Existing regulatory tools - predominantly the Clean Air Act - are largely incompatible in providing incentives for FCS.

"Forest cover dynamics in the Selva Maya of Central and Southern Quintana Roo, Mexico: deforestation or degradation?","Forest cover dynamics (1993-2018) was assessed in two regions on the Yucatan Peninsula: Zona Maya (ZM), 67% indigenous with shifting cultivation and community forestry; and Bacalar-Rio Hondo (BRH), mainly commercial agriculture and pastureland. Degradation (12,915 ha y(-1)) exceeded deforestation (5882 ha y(-1)) and was worse in BRH. In BRH there was a net forest loss (-1.6% y(-1)) associated with pastureland and commercial agriculture. In ZM, mature forest recovery (1.4% y(-1)) and dynamic forest cover (continuous loss and gain) were associated with shifting cultivation. Changes were more intense during 2011-2018 and gains of mature forest in ZM and deforested areas in BRH targeted secondary vegetation. Fragments of mature and secondary vegetation decreased, and connectivity improved in ZM, but opposite trends occurred in BRH.

"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) plasma concentrations in residents of Paritutu, New Zealand: Evidence of historical exposure","An assessment of community exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was undertaken in Paritutu, New Zealand. The suburb lies adjacent to an agrichemical facility that produced 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), between 1962 and 1987. Soil TCDD measurements from 73 nearby addresses demonstrated a pattern of TCDD deposition consistent with an aerial plume following the prevailing local wind patterns and the agrichemical plant as the point source. Blood samples were taken from 52 volunteers having lived for three or more years in Paritutu between 1962 and 1987. Candidate selection focused primarily on individuals who were most likely to show elevated TCDD blood lipid levels when compared to age and gender stratified national average blood concentrations, and secondarily on individuals that provided additional information about specific exposure periods, potential exposures of younger age groups, and specific dietary patterns. A multipathway exposure model was used to estimate serum TCDD levels in each participant. Age and gender-specific TCDD elimination kinetics were also considered. Historical TCDD environmental concentrations were back-calculated from soil concentrations at each residence assuming TCDD releases occurred pre-dominantly between 1962 and 1975. Serum was analysed for chlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans, and a subset was analysed for dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls. TCDD in serum lipid exceeded two standard deviations above national background levels for 14 participants, and 3 standard deviations for 10 participants. The highest TCDD lipid concentration was 33.3 ng/kg-lipid, or 11 times higher than the comparative 1997 national average. Elevated TCDD concentrations were observed primarily, but not exclusively, in the older study participants who had been in residence in Paritutu before 1968. The study demonstrated TCDD exposure in this community, occurring most likely through the aerial route, and most probably from fugitive emissions during manufacture. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Green or Greed? An Alternative Look at CEO Compensation and Corporate Environmental Commitment,"This study relies on environmental stewardship, a stakeholder-enlarged view of stewardship theory, and institutional theory to analyze the relationship between CEO compensation and firms' environmental commitment in a worldwide sample of 520 large listed firms. Our findings show that environment friendly firms pay their CEOs less total compensation and rely less on incentive-based compensation than environment careless firms. This negative relationship is stronger in institutional contexts where national environmental regulations are weaker. Our findings have important theoretical meaning and practical implications. Results show that CEOs do not necessarily act opportunistically; rather some of them may be willing to act as stewards of the natural environment and accept a lower, less incentive-based compensation from environment friendly firms. This study also provides evidence of the important influence of the institutional context in setting-up CEO compensation as the relationship is stronger when national environmental regulations are weaker. Our findings question the universal validity of agency theory in explaining CEO compensation. Compensation based on pecuniary incentives might be less indicated to motivate CEOs who feel rewarded by playing a stewardship role for environment friendly firms. When designing compensation for CEOs, compensation committees and external compensation advisors should consider psychological and institutional factors that might affect CEO motivation.",Not About Sufficiency

Freshwater eDNA reveals dramatic biological shifts linked to deforestation of New Zealand,"Deforestation is considered a major threat to biodiversity across many parts of the globe, but the biological impacts of this dramatic ecosystem disturbance often remain incompletely understood. In New Zealand - the world's last major landmass to be colonised by humans - widespread deforestation over recent centuries has left a highly fragmented suite of relict forest stands, ideal for assessing anthropogenic biological change. We hypothesise that this widespread environmental disturbance has underpinned repeated and predictable ecological shifts across distinct rivers and regions. Here we use freshwater environmental DNA (eDNA) data (113 samples across 38 locations; 89 insect taxa) to test for concordant biological shifts linked to this deforestation. eDNA analyses highlight consistent compositional and functional differentiation between forested versus deforested assemblages, including turnover of 'cryptic' congeneric taxa that are morphologically similar yet ecologically and genetically distinct. These dramatic biological shifts are evident even over fine spatial scales within streams, emphasising the widespread emergence of a novel 'deforested' assemblage. Our results illustrate that environmental change can drive predictable biological shifts across broad geographic regions, and highlight the power of eDNA for assessing anthropogenic ecosystem change over large geographic scales.",Not About Sufficiency
Crises as Catalyst: A New Social Contract Grounded in Worker Rights,"Three crises-climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and extreme economic and social inequality intersect and have had devastating impacts on workers' rights to health, as well as the right to decent work, an underlying determinant of health.

Frontiers in quantifying wildlife behavioural responses to chemical pollution,"Animal behaviour is remarkably sensitive to disruption by chemical pollution, with widespread implications for ecological and evolutionary processes in contaminated wildlife populations. However, conventional approaches applied to study the impacts of chemical pollutants on wildlife behaviour seldom address the complexity of natural environments in which contamination occurs. The aim of this review is to guide the rapidly developing field of behavioural ecotoxicology towards increased environmental realism, ecological complexity, and mechanistic understanding. We identify research areas in ecology that to date have been largely overlooked within behavioural ecotoxicology but which promise to yield valuable insights, including within- and among-individual variation, social networks and collective behaviour, and multi-stressor interactions. Further, we feature methodological and technological innovations that enable the collection of data on pollutant-induced behavioural changes at an unprecedented resolution and scale in the laboratory and the field. In an era of rapid environmental change, there is an urgent need to advance our understanding of the real-world impacts of chemical pollution on wildlife behaviour.

Fuelwood and fodder extraction and deforestation: mainstream views in India discussed on the basis of data from the semi-arid region of Rajasthan,"The assumption that fuelwood and fodder extraction leads to deforestation has so far been the dominant mainstream view in deforestation discourses accepted by researchers, state agencies and conservationists. These mainstream views on deforestation ignore the local-specific strategies, which include substitution of crop residues and animal dung for fuelwood, changing livestock composition that reduces dependency on natural forest and local informal institutions that regulate the resource exploitation. Communities adjacent to forests mostly use dry wood as fuelwood and grasses for fodder that normally does not involve cutting of trees. Household fuelwood and fodder extraction patterns in villages in and out of the Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR), Rajasthan, India, were therefore analyzed. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire administered to 180-sample households, followed by field observations and focus group discussions in 37 villages. Certain household characteristics and distance to the source of fuelwood and fodder point to the role of opportunity cost as a determinant of biomass extraction. Fuelwood and fodder extraction may not be the major reason for deforestation. However, state agencies find it convenient to use the mainstream views related to deforestation and exclude local communities from forests and protected areas. Local people would prefer that their access rights to resources should continue. Co-management of forests involving local people and institutions, and restoration of their rights may help to resolve conflicts related to resource use and lead to a better management of natural resources.

Future European shale gas life-cycle GHG emissions for electric power generation in comparison to other fossil fuels,"The carbon footprint of shale gas combusted in Europe was estimated from nine European shale gas plays as potential production regions. Greenhouse gas emission sources during shale gas production, such as fugitives from hydraulic fracturing or combustion emissions from horizontal drilling, were added to emissions occurring for conventional gas extraction. Greenhouse gas emissions are expressed as g CO2-equivalents per MJ delivered, and calculated for a kWh of electricity generated. Estimated total GHG emissions from the use of European shale gas for electricity production range from 0.42 to 0.75 kg CO2-eq/kWh when the combustion in the power plant is included. This is within the range reported in the literature. The cumulative carbon footprints for a number of fossil electricity generation scenarios for Europe were also calculated. The results indicate an advantage of gas over other fossil sources in a wide range of scenarios. These results are only reversed with very high (10%) upstream losses for shale gas.

Future global offshore wind energy under climate change and advanced wind turbine technology,"Offshore wind energy provides a promising option for substituting conventional energies due to its low greenhouse gas emissions, cost-effectiveness, and abundant wind resources at seas. The installed capacity, available area, technological advancements, and wind resource development under climate change drive the offshore wind potential. Thus, the goal is to develop 28 techno-climatic wind energy expansion scenarios, considering installed capacity expansion paths and potential wind farm sites to estimate the national and global wind energy yield in 2025-2054. The study tests the hypothesis that technological advancements are more influential for future offshore wind energy yield compared to climate-related wind resource changes. Globally, at more than 80 % of studied sites, the capacity factors significantly decrease under all evaluated climate change scenarios in 2025-2054. However, it should not hinder future offshore wind expansion since the climate change-induced wind resource change is far less than the capacity factor variability of the potential wind farm sites within the exclusive economic zones. This study also found that if the wind energy expansion continues at the same pace as in 2019-2023 until 2030, China could gain the highest average energy yield at 280.9 TWh annually. Besides, the results indicate that the wind turbine type is more critical to the capacity factor than the climate change impact.

Future Impacts of Distributed Power Generation on Ambient Ozone and Particulate Matter Concentrations in the San Joaquin Valley of California,"Distributed power generation electricity generation that is produced by many small stationary power generators distributed throughout an urban air basin has the potential to supply a significant portion of electricity in future years. As a result, distributed generation may lead to increased pollutant emissions within an urban air basin, which could adversely affect air quality. However, the use of combined heating and power with distributed generation may reduce the energy consumption for space heating and air conditioning, resulting in a net decrease of pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. This work used a systematic approach based on land-use geographical information system data to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of distributed generation emissions in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin of California and simulated the potential air quality impacts using state-of-the-art three-dimensional computer models. The evaluation of the potential market penetration of distributed generation focuses on the year 2023. In general, the air quality impacts of distributed generation were found to be small due to the restrictive 2007 California Air Resources Board air emission standards applied to all distributed generation units and due to the use of combined heating and power. Results suggest that if distributed generation units were allowed to emit at the current Best Available Control Technology standards (which are less restrictive than the 2007 California Air Resources Board standards), air quality impacts of distributed generation could compromise compliance with the federal 8-hr average ozone standard in the region.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy rating system for climate conscious operation of multi-unit residential buildings,"Residential sector accounts for 17% of domestic energy use and 14% of the greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. Improving the energy performance of the Canadian residential building stock is vital in achieving climate action goals. A comprehensive review of popular building energy rating systems noted their lack of life cycle thinking. The scope of the popular rating systems is limited to operational performance, ignoring the condition of the assets. This paper proposes a condition assessment framework for the energy system of existing multi-unit residential buildings (MURB), which combines the concepts of asset rating and operational rating. Indicators were identified to define energy, environmental, economic, and asset performance of MURB. A life cycle assessment was conducted to quantify the overall environmental impacts of energy technologies from point of generation. A fuzzy logic-based approach was used to overcome the challenges due to data uncertainty and impreciseness. A case study was conducted for a residential building at UBC Okanagan, Canada. The weights at indicator level and category level were defined based on stakeholder consultation, while also considering different decision scenarios. A fuzzy rule-based approach was used to combine the different performance categories to obtain an overall condition rating. The results indicate that the performance of the case study building can be rated as ""good"" under operational, asset, and overall categories.

Biodiversity and Activity of Gut Fungal Communities across the Life History of Trypophloeus klimeschi (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae),"We comprehensively investigated the biodiversity of fungal communities in different developmental stages of Trypophloeus klimeschi and the difference between sexes and two generations by high throughput sequencing. The predominant species found in the intestinal fungal communities mainly belong to the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Fungal community structure varies with life stage. The genera Nakazawaea, Trichothecium, Aspergillus, Didymella, Villophora, and Auricularia are most prevalent in the larvae samples. Adults harbored high proportions of Graphium. The fungal community structures found in different sexes are similar. Fusarium is the most abundant genus and conserved in all development stages. Gut fungal communities showed notable variation in relative abundance during the overwintering stage. Fusarium and Nectriaceae were significantly increased in overwintering mature larvae. The data indicates that Fusarium might play important roles in the survival of T. klimeschi especially in the overwintering stage. The authors speculated that Graphium plays an important role in the invasion and colonization of T. klimeschi. The study will contribute to the understanding of the biological role of the intestinal fungi in T. klimeschi, which might provide an opportunity and theoretical basis to promote integrated pest management (IPM) of T. klimeschi.",Not About Sufficiency

Gender Diversity on Boards and Firms' Environmental Policy,"This paper tests the relationship between gender diversity on boards and firms' environmental policy. Based on prior research, we predict that gender diversity on boards of directors should have a positive relationship with firms' environmental policy. Moreover, firm character in terms of pollution creation likelihood moderates the relationship between gender diversity on boards and firms' environmental policy. Analyzing data from 865 publicly listed firms in the United States, we found direct and significant empirical evidence for our predictions. According to the findings, we highlight the importance of gender diversity for the development of good firm environmental policy as well as for the improvement of corporate governance. Moreover, the more likely firms in a given industry are to cause environmental pollution, the more salient will be the beneficial effect of gender diversity on boards on firms' environmental policy in the industry.

"Gender inequality in Russian Academia: dynamics, insights, and explanations","While operating under different names, both Europe and Russia are currently going through a period of social change in academia. Europe is pursuing reforms and transformation of academia in the context of the New Public Management, while Russia operates in similar settings of modernization, thus addressing excellence and effectiveness of academic work. In both cases, the processes underlying social change in academia result in a similar impact on female scholars' occupational advancement. By doing so, they reproduce the existing gender inequalities and create new ones. Russia finds itself in a paradoxical situation: while women represent the majority of (scientific) staff in academia, they face persistent discrimination at the hands of their colleagues - both male and female. Still, our knowledge of gender disparities and discrimination in Russian academia is fragmented and needs extensive investigation. In order to establish the necessary foundation for further systematic analysis, this paper aims to reduce the existing gap by examining gender inequalities from a historical perspective.",Not About Sufficiency
"Gender, class, and access to water: Three cases in a poor and crowded delta","Water plays a pivotal role in economic activity and in human well-being. Because of the prominence of water in production (primarily for irrigation) and in domestic use (drinking, washing, cooking), conflict over water and the effects of gender-influenced decisions about water mall, have far-reaching consequences on human well-being, economic growth, and social change. At the same time, social conflicts and social change arc shaped and mediated, often in unexpected ways, by the natural conditions in which water occurs. The social relations of water are poorly understood. This article introduces a framework for disaggregating conditions of access to water and uses it to examine three pressing questions in Bangladesh. First, extraction of groundwater for irrigation has made manY drinking-water hand pumps run dry. Second, increasing use of groundwater for drinking has been associated with the poisoning of at least 20 million people through naturally occurring arsenic in groundwater. Third, the article examines some of the ways access to water has been changed by the rise of shrimp aquaculture for export. This article highlights new directions for the analysis of interactions among water, class, and gender. The existing literature has tended to focus on the implications of gender analysis for government policy, especially development projects and water resources management, and for women's organization. In this article we begin to sketch some questions that arise from a concern to understand the broader context of social change.",Not About Sufficiency
"Gender, quality of life, and growth in Asia 1970-90","This paper examines the gender distribution of the benefits of economic growth in several Asian economies from 1970-90. Using Borda rank ordering, we compare the progress made in these countries towards closing the gender gap in well-being. In addition to commonly-used indicators, trends in the ratio of females to males in the population are examined. We explore determinants of changes in this ratio, using regression analysis. The results indicate that gender equity in quality-of-life ratings is highest in those Asian economies that grew the slowest over the period in question. Further, the data indicate that economic growth does not have a significant effect on the female-to-male population ratios for this set of countries. Variables that affect women's bargaining power do, however, have a positive effect on relative female life chances, as does spending on public education.",Not About Sufficiency
Gender-job satisfaction differences across Europe - An indicator for labour market modernization,"Purpose - The primary objective of this study is to test whether gender differences in job satisfaction are assignable to variations in labour market and welfare state regimes in the light of gender-related labour market modernization. Design/methodology/approach - Using data derived from the European Household Community Panel (EHCP) and covering 14 member states of the European Union the study constructs a series of summary statistics to lay the foundation for the analysis. An ordinary ordered-probit regression model is employed to test for the (non-) emergence of a gender-job satisfaction paradox. Findings - The results suggest that objective (socio-economic and institutional) determinants of labour market status and subjective (assessed and evaluated) perspectives are mutually complementary. The more restrictive the labour market access and process is for women, the more likely a gender-job satisfaction paradox is to emerge in any country. Equal opportunities for women and men (such as those observed in Scandinavian countries) indicate that the gender-job satisfaction paradox does not appear anymore due to a fading-out process over past decades, which was driven by appropriate institutional labour market interventions. Originality/value - The gender-job satisfaction paradox was confirmed for the UK, whereas little has been done to test this hypothesis on a cross-national basis. This investigation thus fills the gap in the empirical literature.",Not About Sufficiency
"Genetic Variation for Biomass Yield and Predicted Genetic Gain in Lowland Switchgrass ""Kanlow""","Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a warm-season, perennial grass valued as a promising candidate species for bioenergy feedstock production. Biomass yield is the most important trait for any bioenergy feedstock. This study was focused on understanding the genetics underlying biomass yield and feedstock quality traits in a ""Kanlow"" population. The objectives of this study were to (i) assess genetic variation (ii) estimate the narrow sense heritability, and (iii) predict genetic gain per cycle of selection for biomass yield and the components of lignocelluloses. Fifty-four Kanlow half-sib (KHS) families along with Kanlow check were planted in a randomized complete block design with three replications at two locations in Tennessee: Knoxville and Crossville. The data were recorded for two consecutive years: 2013 and 2014. The result showed a significant genetic variation for biomass yield (p < 0.05), hemicellulose concentration (p < 0.05), and lignin concentration (p < 0.01). The narrow sense heritability estimates for biomass yield was very low (0.10), indicating a possible challenge to improve this trait. A genetic gain of 16.5% is predicted for biomass yield in each cycle of selection by recombining parental clones of 10% of superior progenies.",Not About Sufficiency
Habitat improvement and effects on brown hare Lepus europaeus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus:: a case study in northern Italy,"After the Common Agricultural Policy reform of 1992 and the application of ago-environmental measures, most EU countries have introduced specific measures for wildlife habitat improvement. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of two habitat improvement actions on brown hare Lepus europaeus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus populations in two study areas in the hills of Emilia-Romagna in Italy. The study was carried out from October 1996 to October 1997. Data on brown hares were collected at night using spotlights. Density was estimated at 26 (area A) and 29 (area B) sampling sites. Data on roe deer were collected at 17 sampling sites (fields observed) during 2-hour periods, before sunset and after sunrise, respectively, using binoculars. We recorded 736 brown hares. Brown hare density was higher in study area A (0.27 individuals/ha) than in study area B (0.23 individuals/ha). We counted 153 roe deer during the diurnal surveys. The highest roe deer density was observed in February-March 1997 (0.306 individuals/ha). We used Bonferroni confidence intervals, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the densities in different habitats. Brown hares avoided uncultivated fields in both study areas, while they selected habitat improvements in area A and forage crops in area B. Roe deer selected habitat improvements and secondarily forage crops, but avoided uncultivated fields. Our study demonstrates that extensive cultivated fields (maintained or reintroduced according to EU agro-environmental regulations) can play an important role in territories with agriculture retirement and abandonment, acting primarily as a source of food (mostly green forage) for several herbivorous wildlife species.",Not About Sufficiency
Giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) in the UK: carbon storage potential and growth rates,"Giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum) are some of the UK's largest trees, despite only being introduced in the mid-nineteenth century. There are an estimated half a million giant sequoias and closely related coastal redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) in the UK. Given the recent interest in planting more trees, partly due to their carbon sequestration potential and also their undoubted public appeal, an understanding of their growth capability is important. However, little is known about their growth and carbon uptake under UK conditions. Here, we focus on S. giganteum and use three-dimensional terrestrial laser scanning to perform detailed structural measurements of 97 individuals at three sites covering a range of different conditions, to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) and annual biomass accumulation rates. We show that UK-grown S. giganteum can sequester carbon at a rate of 85 kg yr-1, varying with climate, management and age. We develop new UK-specific allometric models for S. giganteum that fit the observed AGB with r 2 > 0.93 and bias < 2% and can be used to estimate S. giganteum biomass more generally. This study provides the first estimate of the growth and carbon sequestration of UK open-grown S. giganteum and provides a baseline for estimating their longer-term carbon sequestration capacity.",Not About Sufficiency

Economic development and climate change: Achieving a sustainable balance,"This review analyzes the effects of economic growth and technological progress on the environment, exploring how modern technology and human behaviors are adapted to minimize environmental impact and promote sustainable development. It examines the role of economic networks and input-output models in understanding intersectoral connections and trade flows, particularly in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Special emphasis is placed on carbon sequestration technologies and carbon accounting methodologies, which are essential for monitoring emissions, assessing carbon footprints, and formulating effective climate policies. Over the past decade, researchers have extensively studied the relationship between economic growth and climate change using various econometric methodologies. The Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis suggests that at a certain stage of development, further economic growth can lead to reduced pollution levels. Sector-specific approaches highlight potential solutions for climate change mitigation, emphasizing the need for synergy between technological innovations and human behavior. Carbon sequestration, carbon capture and utilization, and pro-environmental practices play pivotal roles in this transition. By integrating policy support, community engagement, and awareness programs, societies can foster a transformation towards a sustainable future, balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility. This review highlights the intricate relationships between economic systems, technological advancement, and environmental sustainability, offering insights into effective strategies for addressing climate challenges.",Not About Sufficiency
GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE WASTE MANAGEMENT SECTOR,"The Member States of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are required to periodically publish their national inventories of anthropogenic emissions in National Inventory Reports. The data used in this paper was extracted from these reports and applied to generate a study of the development of greenhouse gas emissions in the waste management sector. The results show a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for developed contries/regions from 1990 to 2016 due to improved collection and treatment of landfill gas, a shift from landfilling to biological and thermal treatment, as well as a shift to separate waste collection and treatment. The developing countries and regions show another development of greenhouse gas emissions. On the one hand, their greenhouse gas emissions from the waste sector strongly increased due to higher generation of waste. And on the other hand, they increased due in most cases to unorganized and technically insufficent disposal of mixed waste on dumpsites along with better observation of disposal sites and therefore better registration of emissions. Nevertheless, the per capita emissions in developed countries/regions are with approx. 500 kg CO2-eq./a much higher than for developing and emerging countries/regions, which just emit around 100 kg CO2-eq./a.",Not About Sufficiency
"Globalisation, ecological modernisation and New Labour","Ecological modernisation (EM) provides the principal framework within which environmental policy reform projects are understood. However, writers using the approach, neglect to explain the political contexts within which it is possible to pursue such projects. Specifically, they ignore how discourses of globalisation structure the attempts of states to introduce environmental policy measures consistent with EM agendas. Through an analysis of the UK government's attempts to introduce policies consistent with an EM approach, we show that New Labour's discourse of globalisation acts to create opportunities for EM in some policy arenas and hinder them in others. We examine the development of a renewable energy strategy, the case of genetically modified foods, and transport policy. By specifying conditions under which EM may be pursued, the analysis reveals the potential, but also the limits, of this approach, which attempts to ignore the deep political questions raised by environmental degradation.",Not About Sufficiency
Fair Trade's Dual Aspect The Communications Challenge of Fair Trade Marketing,"Effective communication strategies are fundamental to achieving sustainable consumption, yet there is a gap in the literature with respect to their design. Moreover, there is considerable debate with respect to the starting point for such strategies: whether the shift to sustainable consumption can be achieved within the dominant social paradigm or whether a new paradigm is required. Fair trade (FT) marketing presents a valuable case study of these issues in practice. Case analysis of a campaign by the Divine Chocolate Company suggests the importance of transcending the polarization of the radical and pragmatic visions of FT and also the within or without dichotomy of macromarketing in terms of moving consumers along a pathway to sustainable development. The campaign's synergism further has significant implications for the design of communication strategies to effect sustainable consumption.

An international comparison of the outcomes of environmental regulation,"Whilst there is much discussion about the stringency of environmental regulations and the variability of industrial environmental performance in different countries, there are very few robust evaluations that allow meaningful comparisons to be made. This is partly because data scarcity restricts the ability to make 'like for like' comparisons across countries and over time. This paper combines data on benzene emissions from Pollution Release and Transfer Registers with data on industrial production from oil refineries to generate normalized measures of industrial environmental performance across eight Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries and the EU-15. We find that normalized emissions levels are improving in nearly all countries, and that there is some convergence in emissions performance between countries, but that there are still very significant variations across countries. We find that average emissions levels are lower in Japan and Germany than in the USA and Australia, which in turn are lower than in Canada and the EU-15, but we note that average emissions in the EU-15 are significantly affected by particularly high emissions in the UK. These findings have significant implications for wider debates on the stringency of environmental regulations and the variability of industrial environmental performance in different countries.",Not About Sufficiency
Governance assessment of UAV implementation in Kenyan land administration system,"The 'fit-for-purpose' (FFP) approach was developed to respond to the challenges that the creation of a sustainable land administration system (LAS) faces. FFP has proved its value in integrating technological innovations such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in LAS. Technological innovations need to consider the governance context when being implemented. Understanding the relevance of the FFP approach and acknowledging the importance of the governance context, this research applies the 'Fit-for-purpose governance assessment framework' (FGAF). FGAF helps to understand the challenges that the implementation of UAVs can face in the LAS in Kenya. This governance assessment is based on 16 semi-structured in-depth interviews, three one-day workshops with local stakeholders and UAVs pilot studies to test the technology. The findings suggest that there are major and minor challenges concerning different attributes of FFP qualities. The governance context across counties is fragmented with a high degree of uncertainty and uneven capacity conditions. There are overlapping responsibilities and trust issues among the different actors. Participation of private and non-governmental actors is limited. Yet, steps have been taken toward the adoption of innovative approaches.

Governance effects of pollution reduction and carbon mitigation of carbon emission trading policy in China,"China's carbon emission trading policy plays a crucial role in achieving both its ""3060"" dual carbon objectives and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13) on climate action. The policy's effectiveness in reducing pollution and mitigating carbon emissions holds significant importance. This paper investigated whether China's carbon emission trading policy affects pollution reduction (PM2.5 and SO2) and carbon mitigation (CO2) in pilot regions, using panel data from 30 provinces and municipalities in China from 2005 to 2019 and employing a multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) model. Furthermore, it analyzed the heterogeneity of carbon market mechanisms and regional variations. Finally, it examined the governance pathways for pollution reduction and carbon mitigation from a holistic perspective. The results indicate that: (1) China's carbon emission trading policy has reduced CO2 emissions by 18% and SO2 emissions by 36% in pilot areas, with an immediate impact on the ""carbon mitigation"" effect, while the ""pollution reduction"" effect exhibits a time lag. (2) Higher carbon trading prices lead to stronger ""carbon mitigation"" effect, and larger carbon market scales are associated with greater ""pollution reduction"" effects on PM2.5. Governance effects on pollution reduction and carbon mitigation vary among pilot regions: Carbon markets of Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin show significant governance effects in both ""pollution reduction"" and ""carbon mitigation"", whereas Guangdong's carbon market exhibits only a ""pollution reduction"" effect, and Hubei's carbon market demonstrates only a ""carbon mitigation"" effect. (3) Currently, China's carbon emission trading policy achieves pollution reduction and carbon mitigation through ""process management"" and ""end-of-pipe treatment"". This study could provide empirical insights and policy implications for pollution reduction and carbon mitigation, as well as for the development of China's carbon emission trading market.",Not About Sufficiency
"""We Like That It Matters!"": Towards a Socially Sustainable Retail Store Brand Experience","Social sustainability is a topic that is gaining increased attention and yet has not been overly discussed, in particular with reference to the fashion industry. There is a shift in consumer demands, where brands are urged to stand for values, affect change in the industry, and have a clear purpose and positive impact over society. At the same time, brands are struggling to provide offers beyond products, or product-related experiences, at the risk of dissatisfying consumers expectations. Part of such dissatisfaction is clearly represented by the lack of footfall in retail stores and the fast-pace abandonment of the high-street by brands that cannot afford empty stores. This paper suggests an opportunity to rethink the retail store functionality as a space for brands to provide consumers with educational initiatives related to important societal issues, hence build their socially responsible profile. A netnographic exploratory analysis of Patagonia platforms was conducted in order to pinpoint potential positive reaction to a purpose-driven brand and its educational initiatives. The brand was chosen due to its value-committed strategy and constant educational effort towards consumers, both offline (product-related) and online (societal-related). This paper suggests that brands such as Patagonia, purpose and value driven in positively impacting society, should bring their activism and educational efforts on the high-street and in the retail spaces. By doing so, brands would concurrently provide consumers with experiences beyond product consumption, could revitalise our high-street, and could reinstate a sense of community belonging while raise their socially sustainable profile. This paper contributes to the existing literature of consumer education in retailing by expanding into the specific domain of fashion, a domain in which many social issues could be successfully addressed through a socially-driven consumer education at the moment still overlooked by researchers and brands.",Not About Sufficiency

US oil dependence 2014: Is energy independence in sight?,"The importance of reducing U.S. oil dependence may have changed in light of developments in the world oil market over the past two decades. Since 2005, increased domestic production and decreased oil use have cut U.S. import dependence in half. The direct costs of oil dependence to the U.S. economy are estimated under four U.S. Energy Information Administration Scenarios to 2040. The key premises of the analysis are that the primary oil market failure is the use of market power by OPEC and that U.S. economic vulnerability is a result of the quantity of oil consumed, the lack of readily available, economical substitutes and the quantity of oil imported. Monte Carlo simulations of future oil market conditions indicate that the costs of U.S. oil dependence are likely to increase in constant dollars but decrease relative to U.S. gross domestic product unless oil resources are larger than estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Reducing oil dependence therefore remains a valuable goal for U.S. energy policy and an important co-benefit of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Techno-economic analysis and global warming potential of a novel offshore macroalgae biorefinery,"The success of a large scale macroalgae-based biorefinery is dependent on the demonstration of favorable system economics and environmental sustainability. This study uses detailed process modeling to quantify the mass and energy flows through the various unit operations required for a novel free-floating macroalgae biorefinery concept. The modular process model served as the foundation for the techno-economic and global warming potential analyses used to quantify the sustainability of the proposed concept. This work includes detailed techno-economic results for a complete macroalgae cultivation and conversion system with multiple hatchery configurations and several emerging technologies. System optimization was achieved through the evaluation of various technology options for each unit operation. Technologies considered include traditional twine and textile substrate hatchery configurations, drone assisted seeding and biomass transport, mechanized line seeding and harvesting, adhesive spore mixtures that simplify seeding operations and improve hatchery energetics, and hydrothermal liquefaction to produce upgradable biocrude. Outputs from the system include renewable diesel (R100), naphtha, biochar, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers, and aqueous/solid waste streams. Three different system pathways were explored, yielding a biomass production cost ranging from $210 to $565 per dry metric ton and a minimum fuel selling price from $1.35 to $2.91 per liter of gasoline equivalent. Stochastic manipulation of the process model and sensitivity analyses support these results. The global warming potential analysis shows net greenhouse gas emissions ranging from 14 to 29 gCO(2)-eq MJ(-1), supported by stochastic and sensitivity analyses.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Southward Transplanted Wetlands During Freezing-Thawing Periods in Northeast China,"Freezing-thawing in mid-high latitudes is an important factor controlling nutrient dynamics. We transplanted peatland columns (TQ) and freshwater marsh columns (SJ) in different latitudes into south seasonal frozen regions to determine the responses of greenhouse gas emissions from different wetlands to the freezing-thawing under climate warming. The decrease in CO2 and CH4 emissions during freezing stage were interrupted by a short emission peak. While N2O uptake rate reduced with decreasing temperature. In the thawing stage, all the three greenhouse gases exhibited emission peaks. CO2 were 159.83 mg m(-2) h(-1) (TQ) and 86.83 mg m(-2) h(-1) (SJ); CH4 were 1.32 mg m(-2) h(-1) (TQ) and 4.07 mg m(-2) h(-1) (SJ); N2O were 72.14 ug m(-2) h(-1) (TQ) and 22.15 ug m(-2) h(-1) (SJ). Meanwhile, N2O transferred from sink into source. With temperature increase, the emission rate of CO2 increased fast, while CH4 and N2O decreased. CO2 emission during freezing-thawing periods was significantly correlated with soil temperature and CH4 emission. Soil active organic carbon also played important roles in greenhouse gases emissions. Our study suggested that more greenhouse gases may release from wetlands into atmosphere in the context of global warming, and the potential release of CO2 and N2O during freezing-thawing periods was much higher in peatlands of permafrost zone.",Not About Sufficiency

This paper examines the greenhouse gas emissions, or ""carbon footprint,"" of recycling systems before and after the transition from DS to SS. This investigation aims to assess the environmental impact of trends in the recycling industry from a holistic perspective. In our analysis we consider several communities around the U.S. on the bases of tonnage and type of material recycled, fuel and electricity consumed in collection and separation, and avoided virgin materials consumption. By examining data from a small range of communities and MRF, we arrive at three main conclusions. First, a change from DS to SS results in approximately a 50% increase in production of recyclable commodities. Second, the net result of the DS-SS transition is approximately 710 kg CO2-equiv. avoided per metric ton of collection. Third, the emissions associated with collection and MRF operation are small in comparison to avoided emissions from avoided consumption of virgin materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Greening plans as (re)presentation of the city: Toward an inclusive and gender-sensitive approach to urban greenspaces,"Cities around the world are increasingly expanding their sustainability agendas and adopting urban green and blue infrastructure planning as a strategy to become more resilient, healthy and sustainable. However, the development of urban greening governance often lacks a holistic vision that considers social inequities within the planning, implementation and management of green and blue spaces. Further, gender inequities have been a specific dimension particularly overlooked in urban greening planning, despite gender concerns gaining increasing political relevance in recent years. In this research, we assessed the extento to which social and gender equity are being considered in urban greening plans and projects at the local level. We chose Barcelona (Spain) as main case study due to its pioneering role in implementing crosscutting equity and gender policies at the municipal level. Building on document analysis and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, we examined how social justice and gender are understood and operationalized in practice, from the design phase to implementation and maintenance of greening projects. Our findings suggest a shift in the role of urban greening which evolved from an ornamental role to a multifunctional vision of greening and is recently incorporating equity and inclusivity concerns. We identified three action areas of inclusive, gender-sensitive urban green planning practices: first, the incorporation of inclusivity and care as guiding visible values to recognize multiple needs of city residents; second, urban design for different uses and perceptions of greenspaces, particularly in relation to accessibility and autonomy; and third, the awareness and expertise from municipal staff vis-`a-vis the consideration of social and gender equity in green planning and participatory approaches. Finally, we provide practical examples of the strategies that the City of Barcelona is implementing in each area and discuss some challenges and limitations, including what we identify as ad hoc intersectional greening.",Not About Sufficiency
Greenland's contribution to global sea-level rise by the end of the 21st century,"The Greenland ice sheet holds enough water to raise the global sea level with similar to 7 m. Over the last few decades, observations manifest a substantial increase of the mass loss of this ice sheet. Both enhanced melting and increase of the dynamical discharge, associated with calving at the outlet-glacier fronts, are contributing to the mass imbalance. Using a dynamical and thermodynamical ice-sheet model, and taking into account speed up of outlet glaciers, we estimate Greenland's contribution to the 21st-century global sea-level rise and the uncertainty of this estimate. Boundary fields of temperature and precipitation extracted from coupled climate-model projections used for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, are applied to the ice-sheet model. We implement a simple parameterization for increased flow of outlet glaciers, which decreases the bias of the modeled present-day surface height. It also allows for taking into account the observed recent increase in dynamical discharge, and it can be used for future projections associated with outlet-glacier speed up. Greenland contributes 0-17 cm to global sea-level rise by the end of the 21st century. This range includes the uncertainties in climate-model projections, the uncertainty associated with scenarios of greenhouse-gas emissions, as well as the uncertainties in future outlet-glacier discharge. In addition, the range takes into account the uncertainty of the ice-sheet model and its boundary fields.",Not About Sufficiency
Reconstructing long term annual deforestation dynamics in Para and Mato Grosso using the Landsat archive,"Remote sensing based monitoring of deforestation in the tropics is crucial to better understand global land use change and related changes in ecosystem service provision and to inform governments and civil society on the effectiveness their forest protection policies. In Brazil, deforestation has been closely coupled to the expansion of grazing and cropping systems primarily in the tropical forest, but no spatially explicit high resolution database on deforestation exists that captures tropical forest clearing prior to 2000. The open Landsat archive provides > 45 years of imagery and is well suited for wall-to-wall assessments of historic deforestation dynamics which are valuable to policy development and environmental impact assessments. Image analysis procedures for reconstructing long-term deforestation dynamics over large areas need to cope with regions and time periods for which the archive contains heterogeneous data densities on a yearly and decadal basis. We create for the first time yearly 30 m maps of long term, annual deforestation dynamics (LTAD) covering the period from 1984 to 2014 for Path and Mato Grosso, two Brazilian federal states that cover much of the Brazilian arc-of-deforestation. Our results provide valuable insights into historic deforestation trends, with annually increasing deforestation from 1990 to 1999 for both Para and Mato Grosso. Peak deforestation occurred in 2004 after which deforestation leveled off - with a more pronounced decrease in Mato Grosso than in Path. Contrary to Mato Grosso, Para again experienced increasing annual forest clearing in recent years. For the time period after 2000, we provide an indepth comparison with two widely used products, the Brazilian PRODES and the Global Forest Change maps (GFC, Hansen et al., 2013). Our deforestation estimates (407,000 +/- 42,000 km(2) at 95% confidence level) are above those provided by PRODES, while GFC results are closer to our estimates for the comparison period. Recent PRODES estimates are consistently below our and the GFC results. Overall, our results exemplify the potential of open image archives for multi-decadal, wall-to-wall and fine grain reconstruction of forest change. The presented approach prototypes similar assessments of tropical forest dynamics globally faced with issues of data scarcity.",Not About Sufficiency
"Growth of Indian cement industry, its environment impact and emerging alternatives","The present study provides a detailed review on growth of Indian cement industry, its environmental implications of cement production and its significant influence on the future trajectory of the Indian concrete industry. The Indian cement sector, a vital contributor to the nation's economy, faces a dual challenge of meeting the growing demand for construction materials while mitigating its environmental footprint. The study delves into the industry's current status as the world's second-largest cement producer and its impact on various sectors, including employment, GDP contribution, and dependence on real estate and infrastructure. The paper identifies key obstacles hindering the Indian concrete industry's full potential, such as a slowdown in real estate development, low industrial investment, regulatory changes, and constraints on resource extraction. Despite the industry's promising growth, the looming threats from emerging technologies and increasing environmental concerns, particularly related to greenhouse gas emissions, necessitate a strategic shift towards sustainability. A central focus of the research is the urgent need for the Indian concrete industry to address its environmental impact, specifically the 7% contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. The study explores the industry's role in creating carbon-neutral concrete by 2050 and emphasizes the importance of collaboration with policymakers, financial institutions like the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and end users in achieving this ambitious goal. The study reveals the comprehensive resource for industry stakeholders, and researchers interested in understanding the environmental implications of cement production and charting a sustainable course for the future of the Indian concrete industry and emerging alternatives.",Not About Sufficiency
GTAP-Power Data Base: Version 11,"This paper provides an overview of the version 11 of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Power Data Base, which covers 141 individual countries, 19 composite regions and 76 sectors, reporting data for five reference years - 2004, 2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017. The newly constructed database builds on the previous efforts, introducing several new features and updates. First, by extending the coverage across reference years, GTAP-Power 11 Data Base uses updated levelized costs of electricity generation estimates. Second, the database updates the shares of transmission and distribution costs across countries. Finally, the newly constructed database includes complementary accounts of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. In an application of the database, changes in greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in each country are decomposed into changes in (1) the amount of electricity generated, (2) the mix of technologies, and (3) the emissions intensity of each technology.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantitative modeling and assessment of CO2 storage in saline aquifers: A case study in Switzerland,"The global temperature rise necessitates urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with Geological Carbon Storage (GCS) emerging as a promising strategy. GCS involves injecting CO2 into deep geological formations, particularly saline aquifers. However, ideal reservoir conditions, such as stable caprock and adequate storage capacity, are rare in regions like Switzerland. This study assesses the CO2 storage potential in the saline aquifer at Triemli, Switzerland, aiming to explore the feasibility of decentralized, small to medium-scale storage with multiple injection points in geologically unfavorable areas. Through numerical simulations, we investigate CO2 injection, migration, and long-term reservoir stability, bridging the gap between theoretical estimates and practical feasibility. Our findings highlight the potential of deep saline aquifers in the Swiss Molasse Basin and Folded Jura for CO2 storage, with the study area capable of storing approximately 2 million tons of CO2 over 30 years. Advanced injection techniques could increase this capacity to 3 million tons. These results underscore the importance of reservoir properties in optimizing CO2 storage and provide crucial insights for guiding future GCS efforts in Switzerland and beyond, supporting informed decision-making and the implementation of decentralized storage projects.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying excess deaths related to heatwaves under climate change scenarios: A multicountry time series modelling study,"Background Heatwaves are a critical public health problem. There will be an increase in the frequency and severity of heatwaves under changing climate. However, evidence about the impacts of climate change on heatwave-related mortality at a global scale is limited. Methods and findings We collected historical daily time series of mean temperature and mortality for all causes or non-external causes, in periods ranging from January 1, 1984, to December 31, 2015, in 412 communities within 20 countries/regions. We estimated heatwave +/- mortality associations through a two-stage time series design. Current and future daily mean temperature series were projected under four scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions from 1971 +/- 2099, with five general circulation models. We projected excess mortality in relation to heatwaves in the future under each scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, with two assumptions for adaptation (no adaptation and hypothetical adaptation) and three scenarios of population change (high variant, median variant, and low variant). Results show that, if there is no adaptation, heatwave-related excess mortality is expected to increase the most in tropical and subtropical countries/regions (close to the equator), while European countries and the United States will have smaller percent increases in heatwave-related excess mortality. The higher the population variant and the greenhouse gas emissions, the higher the increase of heatwave-related excess mortality in the future. The changes in 2031 +/- 2080 compared with 1971 +/- 2020 range from approximately 2,000% in Colombia to 150% in Moldova under the highest emission scenario and high-variant population scenario, without any adaptation. If we considered hypothetical adaptation to future climate, under high-variant population scenario and all scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions, the heatwave-related excess mortality is expected to still increase across all the countries/regions except Moldova and Japan. However, the increase would be much smaller than the no adaptation scenario. The simple assumptions with respect to adaptation as follows: no adaptation and hypothetical adaptation results in some uncertainties of projections. Conclusions This study provides a comprehensive characterisation of future heatwave-related excess mortality across various regions and under alternative scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions, different assumptions of adaptation, and different scenarios of population change. The projections can help decision makers in planning adaptation and mitigation strategies for climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
Factors Determining the Potential of Biochar As a Carbon Capturing and Sequestering Construction Material: Critical Review,"Biochar is relatively well understood as a soil enhancement. Recently, it has been explored as a construction material. While works had been conducted on deploying biochar for road construction, there is an emerging trend of using biochar as concrete admixture. In comparison, using biochar this way will reduce more greenhouse gas emissions than if carbon is captured and sequestered through mineralization and deployment in construction. The use of biochar-containing construction materials to capture and then lock atmospheric carbon dioxide in buildings and structures can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 25%. In this review, attention was focused on evaluating biochar's capability for carbon adsorption, which depends on factors such as pyrolysis conditions (specifically, pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, and pressure) and activation methods (and without surface modification). Gaps in the current literature were identified and important areas for future research proposed. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Not About Sufficiency
"Carbon sequestration in engineered lightweight foamed mortar - Effect on rheology, mechanical and durability properties","Enhancing carbon sequestration in Portland cement-based foamed mortar is a potential means to reduce carbon emissions associated with lightweight building components. This research aims to investigate the influence of biochar, prepared from wood waste, in enhancing carbon sequestration in foamed mortar of three target densities - 1150 kg/m(3) and 1300 kg/m(3) and 1450 kg/m(3) respectively through accelerated carbonation (CO2 concentration of 2%) technique. Effect of biochar on rheology, and influence of carbonation on micro-structure, compressive strength, water absorption and shrinkage are investigated. Based on thermogravimetry analysis, carbon dioxide uptake of 26.80% and 30% by mass of cement are achieved in foamed mortar containing biochar, silica fume and fly ash after 7 days and 28 days respectively, which is higher by 3% compared to control (without biochar). Adding biochar to replace 3% by mass of fly ash (density of 1150 kg/m(3)) and 20% by mass of silica fume (density 1450 kg/m(3)) improves the workability of foamed mortar mixtures, evident from the 32% and 44% reduction in yield stress up to 35 min from the time of wet mixing. For density groups of 1300 kg/m(3) and 1450 kg/m(3), addition of biochar reduces water-accessible porosity by 2 - 3%, leading to 17% and 23% higher compressive strength compared to the controls after 28 days of water curing. After carbonation biochar-foamed mortars retain 20-38% higher strength than the respective controls, although reduction in strength by 40 - 60% compared to water curing is observed, ascribed to degradation of hydration products during prolonged carbonation. Addition of biochar results in 10-12% higher shrinkage under an air-drying regime, while it reduces chemical shrinkage associated with carbonation by 15-20% than control. Overall, this study demonstrates a promising potential for developing biochar-enhanced low-carbon lightweight building products.",Not About Sufficiency
"Behaving Clean without Having to Think Green?

The project studied in the first category was focused on eco-technological innovations undertaken by a municipal housing company. The case in the second category was a dialogue-based program with selected citizens willing to test a climate-friendly lifestyle. The latter approach faced strong barriers when going from words to deeds, lacking the large-scale favors of massive eco-technological investments. Highlighting one particular project in each category, we illustrate the potentials and barriers of each approach. It is concluded that policymakers have to find ways to combine the two, otherwise there is a risk that low-carbon committed individuals will become disillusioned or that eco-technological gains will be spoiled by rebound consumption.",Not About Sufficiency
"GUYANA IN THE EYE OF THE STORM IN 2021: CONVERGENCE, STASIS AND REVERBERATION","Guyana, a small oft-forgotten country in South America, has seen its prospects shift markedly in recent years. Previously lauded as a world leader in environmental conservation and avoided deforestation initiatives, Guyana recently made international headlines when significant oil discoveries were made in its territorial waters. Using a model of convergence, stasis and reverberation, this article positions these developments historically and politically. In it, I argue that Guyana's shifting fortunes are reflective of broader regional and international shifts and contestations around post-colonial development and climate policy. The article shows how different forms of vulnerability coalesced over time to position Guyana as both vulnerable and as agential. The state's vulnerability lies in its susceptibility to natural disasters through climate change, imperialism in the wake of colonialism, and ethnic strife through race-based politics. Its agency, on the other hand, lies in its deployment of its natural resources and its geographic location to negotiate changing geo-political arrangements and efforts to address climate change. In developing this argument, the article views, and positions Guyana as a microcosm of several pressing and overlapping global crises - a metaphorical eye of the storm.",Not About Sufficiency

H2NG (hydrogen-natural gas mixtures) effects on energy performances of a condensing micro-CHP (combined heat and power) for residential applications: An expeditious assessment of water condensation and experimental analysis,"In order to accomplish significant primary energy saving and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reduction, CHP (combined heat and power) technology can be adopted largely for industrial and civil sectors. Waiting for the cutting-edge appliances (i.e. Fuel Cell) wide deployment, ICEs (internal combustion engines) fuelled with an environmentally-friendly fuel, such as H(2)NG (hydrogen-natural gas mixtures) could represent the bridge technology towards the forthcoming pure hydrogen economy. This paper deals with the results of an experimental campaign carried out on a Single Cylinder ICE, fuelled with NG (natural gas) and H(2)NG @ 15% vol. In detail, energy performances were assessed at rated and partial loads. From data analysis, it emerged that the electrical efficiency increased up to 2.28%, at the expense of the heat recovery one, having added hydrogen. Additionally, due to the higher water content in exhaust gas when H(2)NG is burned, it was investigated on how heat recovery efficiency has been affected by condensing operating conditions. Finally, to estimate this benefit, an expeditious procedure was developed building three maps for H(2)NG blends condensing properties from 0% up to 30% vol. of H-2. Their outputs provided the condensation efficiency value and the absolute gain of heat recovery one with varying exhaust gas temperatures and hydrogen fraction in the mixture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Habitat suitability for primate conservation in north-east Brazil,"Brazil has a high diversity of primates, but increasing anthropogenic pressures and climate change could influence forest cover in the country and cause future changes in the distribution of primate populations. Here we aim to assess the long-term suitability of habitats for the conservation of three threatened Brazilian primates (Alouatta belzebul, Sapajus flavius and Sapajus libidinosus) through (1) estimating their current and future distributions using species distribution models, (2) evaluating how much of the areas projected to be suitable is represented within protected areas and priority areas for biodiversity conservation, and (3) assessing the extent of remaining forest cover in areas predicted to be suitable for these species. We found that 88% of the suitable areas are outside protected areas and only 24% are located in areas with forest cover. Although not within protected areas, 27% of the climatically suitable areas are considered priority areas for conservation. Future projections, considering a severe climate change scenario, indicate that A. belzebul, S. flavius and S. libidinosus may lose up to 94, 98 and 54% of their suitable range, respectively. The establishment of primate populations and their long-term survival in these areas are at risk.

Liability rules for international trading of greenhouse gas emissions quotas,"To reduce the costs of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Kyoto protocol, international trades of emissions quotas are allowed. The revenue from the sale of quotas may exceed the sanctions for non-compliance if these penalties are weak or poorly enforced. Under these circumstances emissions trading enables a country to benefit financially through non-compliance. To counter non-compliance due to trading a range of liability proposals have been suggested. Using a simple global model, we analyze the economic and environmental performance of these proposals for the first commitment period. In addition, the proposals are tested for their sensitivity to national circumstances and to market power. We find that penalties are sufficient to deter non-compliance if they are high enough and are effectively enforced. If the non-compliance penalties are weak or poorly enforced, the permanent reserve proposal is best able to ensure compliance by sellers at a cost similar to the competitive market equilibrium. While not sufficient to ensure compliance on their own, eligibility requirements and annual retirement of AAUs equal to actual emissions contribute to compliance at little or no cost. Hence, such provisions could complement other liability proposals.",Not About Sufficiency
Monitoring Deforestation at Sub-Annual Scales as Extreme Events in Landsat Data Cubes,"Current methods for monitoring deforestation from satellite data at sub-annual scales require pixel time series to have many historical observations in the reference period to model normal forest dynamics before detecting deforestation. However, in some areas, pixel time series often do not have many historical observations. Detecting deforestation at a pixel with scarce historical observations can be improved by complementing the pixel time series with spatial context information. In this work, we propose a data-driven space-time change detection method that detects deforestation events at sub-annual scales in data cubes of satellite image time series. First we spatially normalised observations in the local space-time data cube to reduce seasonality. Subsequently, we detected deforestation by assessing whether a newly acquired observation in the monitoring period is an extreme when compared against spatially normalised values in a local space-time data cube defined over reference period. We demonstrated our method at two sites, a dry tropical Bolivian forest and a humid tropical Brazilian forest, by varying the spatial and temporal extent of data cube. We emulated a ""near real-time"" monitoring scenario, implying that observations in the monitoring period were sequentially rather than simultaneously assessed for deforestation. Using Landsat normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series, we achieved a median temporal detection delay of less than three observations, a producer's accuracy above 70%, a user's accuracy above 65%, and an overall accuracy above 80% at both sites, even when the reference period of the data cube only contained one year of data. Our results also show that large percentile thresholds (e.g., 5th percentile) achieve higher producer's accuracy and shorter temporal detection delay, whereas smaller percentiles (e.g., 0.1 percentile) achieve higher user's accuracy, but longer temporal detection delay. The method is data-driven, not based on statistical assumption on the data distribution, and can be applied on different forest types. However, it may face challenges in mixed forests where, for example, deciduous and evergreen forests coexist within short distances. A pixel to be assessed for deforestation should have a minimum of three temporal observations, the first of which must be known to represent forest. Such short time series allow rapid deployment of newly launched sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2) for detecting deforestation events at sub-annual scales.",Not About Sufficiency

Happiness inequality has a Kuznets-style relation with economic growth in China,"Happiness studies generally investigate average levels of happiness rather than happiness inequality between regions, and studies of social inequality usually measure it based on the distribution of life opportunities (e.g., income) rather than life results (e.g., happiness). Inspired by the Kuznets curve, which illustrates the inverted U-shaped correlation between income inequality and economic growth, this study investigates whether there is a subjective wellbeing Kuznets curve. It uses data from ten waves of the Chinese General Social Survey to construct a panel data set and runs panel data models to investigate the hypothesized curvilinear relationship between happiness inequality and economic growth. The results show that happiness inequality, measured as the standard deviations of respondents' self-reported happiness, first increases and then decreases as per-capita GDP increases in Chinese provinces. These findings strongly support the subjective wellbeing Kuznets curve hypothesis and suggest that strategies for reducing happiness inequality must consider stages of economic development.",Not About Sufficiency
Estimation of greenhouse gas emissions from ferroalloy production using life cycle assessment with particular reference to Australia,"Ferroalloys are defined as iron-bearing alloys with a high proportion of one or more other elements manganese, chromium, silicon, molybdenum, etc., mainly used by the iron and steel industries. Life cycle assessment methodology was used to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of a number of these ferroalloy production processes. The results of the study showed that GHG footprint for ferroalloy production in Australia was 1.8 t CO(2)e/t FeMn, 2.8 t CO(2)e/t SiMn and 3.4 t CO(2)e/t FeSi alloy metal. These results compare with GHG footprints for ferronickel and ferrochromium of 13.9 t CO(2)e/t and 3.0 t CO(2)e/t, respectively revised from an earlier study. These GHG footprint estimates were calculated using the Tasmanian electricity greenhouse gas emission factor since these ferroalloy industries are located in Tasmania, Australia. The major difference in greenhouse gas emissions between the various ferroalloys is largely due to their respective amounts of electricity use and coke/coal consumption. These results are not too different to the results from a limited number of studies reported in the literature when compared on a similar electricity source basis. The LCA results also showed that coke and coal usage contributed close to 60% or more of the total GHG emissions from the various ferroalloy production processes. In light of this finding, there would appear to be an opportunity to reduce GHG emissions from ferroalloy production if fossil fuel-based coal is replaced with biomass based renewable carbon.

Harmonising the land-use flux estimates of global models and nationalinventories for 2000-2020,"As the focus of climate policy shifts from pledges to implementation, there is a growing need to track progress on climate change mitigation at the country level, particularly for the land-use sector. Despite new tools and models providing unprecedented monitoring opportunities, striking differences remain in estimations of anthropogenic land-use CO2 fluxes between, on the one hand, the national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) used to assess compliance with national climate targets under the Paris Agreement and, on the other hand, the Global Carbon Budget and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports, both based on global bookkeeping models (BMs). Recent studies have shown that these differences are mainly due to inconsistent definitions of anthropogenic CO(2 )fluxes in managed forests. Countries assume larger areas of forest to be managed than BMs do, due to a broader definition of managed land in NGHGIs. Additionally, the fraction of the land sink caused by indirect effects of human-induced environmental change (e.g. fertilisation effect on vegetation growth due to increased atmospheric CO2 concentration) on managed lands is treated as non-anthropogenic by BMs but as anthropogenic in most NGHGIs. We implement an approach that adds the CO2 sink caused by environmental change in countries' managed forests (estimated by 16 dynamic global vegetation models, DGVMs) to the land-use fluxes from three BMs. This sum is conceptually more comparable to NGHGIs and is thus expected to be quantitatively more similar. Our analysis uses updated and more comprehensive data from NGHGIs than previous studies and provides model results at a greater level of disaggregation in terms of regions, countries and land categories (i.e. forest land, deforestation, organic soils, other land uses). Our results confirm a large difference (6.7 GtCO2 yr(-1)) in global land-use CO2 fluxes between the ensemble mean of the BMs, which estimate a source of 4.8 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for the period 2000-2020, and NGHGIs, which estimate a sink of -1.9 GtCO(2) yr(-1) in the same period. Most of the gap is found on forest land (3.5 GtCO(2) yr(-1)), with differences also for deforestation (2.4 GtCO(2) yr(-1)), for fluxes from other land uses (1.0 GtCO(2) yr(-1)) and to a lesser extent for fluxes from organic soils (0.2 GtCO(2) yr(-1)). By adding the DGVM ensemble mean sink arising from environmental change in managed forests (-6.4 GtCO(2) yr(-1)) to BM estimates, the gap between BMs and NGHGIs becomes substantially smaller both globally (residual gap: 0.3 GtCO(2) yr(-1)) and in most regions and countries. However, some discrepancies remain and deserve further investigation. For example, the BMs generally provide higher emissions from deforestation than NGHGIs and, when adjusted with the sink in managed forests estimated by DGVMs, yield a sink that is often greater than NGHGIs. In summary, this study provides a blueprint for harmonising the estimations of anthropogenic land-use fluxes, allowing for detailed comparisons between global models and national inventories at global, regional and country levels. This is crucial to increase confidence in land-use emissions estimates, support investments in land-based mitigation strategies and assess the countries' collective progress under the Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement.",Not About Sufficiency
Multimodal SuperCon: classifier for drivers of deforestation in Indonesia,"Climate change can have a serious impact on human life and occurs due to the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.

Identifying Opportunities for Nonpotable Water Reuse Based on Potential Supplies and Demands in the United States,"Water scarcity threatens the well-being of individuals, the natural environment, and economic systems that function within society. Faced with growing and evolving water supply concerns, many utilities and industries have relied on nontraditional water sources to mitigate severe shortages and combat water quality concerns. Treated municipal wastewater can serve as a reliable supply of water at a predictable quality and quantity and is especially well-suited for nonpotable end uses. In this work, we identify areas within the contiguous United States where water reuse projects are possible on the basis of existing supplies of treated wastewater at known qualities and quantities, estimated nonpotable demands, and state-level policies that outline water quality requirements for reuse. We use publicly available data to develop a geographic information system-based supply-demand assessment that identifies spatial trends and areas of interest for locally focused water reuse analysis. We find that the feasibility of water reuse is highly sensitive to existing state-level policies and the level of wastewater treatment currently in place. Nonpotable recycled water can potentially offset significant water withdrawals within communities where specific policy and technical criteria are met.",Not About Sufficiency
How Political Ambitions Replace Teacher Involvement: Some Critical Perspectives on the Introduction of ICT in Norwegian Schools,"This article draws attention to the basic reflections related to new technologies as they are presented in key policy documents in Norway. One of the primary aims is to throw light on some of the dilemmas associated with the pedagogical use of technological innovations. This applies not least to the substantial discrepancy between expectations and results that has also been shown internationally. The most important conclusion in the article is that the investment in new technologies seems to have been founded on misleading premises. The documents analysed are characterized by one-sided pupil and learning perspectives in which teachers and pedagogical craftsmanship have been sidelined. Pedagogical reflections have come to be replaced by diffuse political visions that have left the field almost wide open to the technological enthusiast. Computers have increasingly been perceived as a contribution to efficiency and simplification. The industrial society's view of technology has thus been perpetuated.

"Annual Dynamics of Bird Community at a Coastal Wetland and Their Relation to Habitat Types: The Example of Beidagang Wetland, Northern China","In order to provide more scientific guidance for wetland bird protection, this study addressed the dynamics of the bird community sorted by ecotypes, classifications and threat categories from 2015 to 2019, and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis, generalized additive models and the Mantel test were used to examine the relationships between bird communities and habitat types. The results showed that: (1) The abundance of birds peaked in 2017 at 88,258 individuals and then declined. Moreover, there was an inverse trend between species richness and abundance of birds, meaning greater abundance is associated with fewer species. (2) Swimming birds were dominant ecotypes and Anseriformes possessed the highest abundance. It was noteworthy that the abundance of critically endangered birds (Aythya baeri and Grus leucogeranus) and the species richness of endangered birds increased. (3) Building land and farmland had dominant impacts on the composition of bird community. Wading birds and birds in Gruiformes were significantly impacted by building land and farmland, and near threatened species were substantially influenced by farmland. Therefore, maintaining good connectivity between protected areas and surrounding areas is one of the best ways to effectively manage biodiversity of the target area. This research may provide a broader insight for coastal wetland bird habitat management and bird diversity preservation.",Not About Sufficiency
"HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND SUSTAINABLE HOUSING","Sustainability of the built environment is an increasingly prominent concern in academic and policy discussions in the UK and EU. Initiatives such as the Code for Sustainable Homes in the UK have been developed to aid integration of sustainability principles into housing developments. Primary focus in this field has been largely on environmental sustainability (particularly energy efficiency) with less attention paid to social and economic factors. This article argues that health and well-being issues need greater consideration within current sustainable housing policy and developments. Three key reasons are presented in support of this argument: (i) Creation of greater market demand; public demand for sustainable buildings could be enhanced through greater promotion of the health and well-being benefits of sustainable housing: (ii) Time-scales; given the longevity of buildings, health considerations should be of paramount importance to avoid any possible future adverse effects: (iii) Indirect societal benefits; enhanced health and well-being can lead to wider societal and economic benefits such as lower healthcare costs. The paper then presents some of the seminal findings from health and housing literature review, outlining how these can be used to enhance sustainable housing policy and developments. The paper concludes by presenting the next stages of research.",Not About Sufficiency
Heavy Metal Pollution in the Ganga River Enhances Carbon Storage Relative to Flux,"This study evaluated the relationships between metal pollution and carbon production at six sites along a 285 km length of the Ganga River. Metal contaminated sites did show a significant reduction in microbial biomass, substrate induced respiration, fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic assay (FDAase) and beta-d-glucosidase. Concordantly, despite a high concentration of total organic carbon at these sites, CO2 emission at the land-water interface remained low. We found a strong positive correlation between CO2 emission and TOC (r = 0.92; p < 0.001). However, this relationship weakens when the sum of total heavy metal ( n-ary sumation THM) exceed 400 mu g g(-1). Also, CO2 emission did show a positive correlation (r = 0.85; p < 0.001) with FDAase. The study shows that metal accumulation in riverbed sediment could potentially lead to better carbon sequestration on account of reduced microbial/enzyme activities. This carries significance for riverine carbon budget and modeling.",Not About Sufficiency
Globalization and forest resurgence: Changes in forest cover in El Salvador,"Globalization is often associated with deforestation, but its impacts on forest recovery are less known. We analyzed socioeconomic data, land-use surveys, and satellite imagery to monitor changes in woody cover in El Salvador from the early 1990s to the presen't. Even where rural population density exceeded 250 people per square kilometer, we documented a 22% increase in the area with more than 30% tree cover, and a 7% increase in the area with more than 60% tree cover. Woodland resurgence reflected processes including civil war, retraction of the agricultural frontier, and international migration and associated remittances. Agrarian reform, structural adjustment, and emerging environmental ideas also played a role in woodland dynamics. Remittances may be especially important for woodland recovery in El Salvador, enabling people in rural areas to buy food without all of them needing to grow and sell it. This study adds to our understanding of the complexity of land-use change in emerging globalized economies and of potential conservation approaches for inhabited landscapes.",Not About Sufficiency
An empirical estimate of the land footprint of nickel from laterite mining in Indonesia,"Nickel is one of the main industrial metals and an essential element for the energy transition towards renewable sources. The metal is increasingly sourced from surficial laterite-type deposits, especially in Indonesia where large investments have been made in its mining and processing infrastructure. The direct land use and land cover (dLUC) change associated with this kind of mine development is not accurately known, although this parameter plays an important role as a master variable in modelling of various environmental effects such as impacts on biodiversity, water quality and greenhouse gas emissions. We have measured the growth of the total land occupied by the booming Indonesian nickel industry over the last two decades and have linked the obtained dLUC change to the country's declared ore production. Our methodology is based on simple visual interpretation of mine areas using Google Earth Pro, allowing for easy verification. The analysis indicates a land transformation factor of 0.7 +/- 0.1 m2 per ton of nickel ore, which is up to 20 times larger than previous estimates. Our revision of this factor might be of importance in discussions about the socio-ecological impact of nickel mining in Indonesia and for management policies designed to mitigate its consequences.",Not About Sufficiency
Humanising urban development in India: call for a more comprehensive approach to social sustainability in the urban policy and design context,"Social sustainability is gaining importance in the international urban development context; however, in India, the concept is unclear and under-represented. New approaches and tools at the level of urban policy, design and implementation are highly biased towards environmental sustainability focussing on ""smart"" technological innovations. This scant focus, coupled with massive and inequitable urban growth, is resulting in social crises that not only pose danger to the country's stability but also represent some of the fundamental challenges to its sustainable future. Based on a detailed review of the literature on social sustainability, this paper explores its meaning and sets out its core components. It calls for humanising Indian cities and argues that a more comprehensive approach to the constituent but neglected ""social"" dimension of sustainable development which goes beyond the technical aspects of solving infrastructure-focused social issues to creating built environments that nurture strong urban communities is necessary. Analytical findings are translated into the social sustainability framework, which suggests a combination of (micro-level variables of) bottom-up and (macro-level variables of) top-down approaches in its implementation, because nurturing social sustainability in cities needs both, planned context and emergent actions.",Not About Sufficiency
Getting a balance in the life satisfaction determinants of full-time and part-time European workers,"This paper explores the trade-offs between four different aspects of European workers' life satisfaction (satisfaction with education, the present work, family life and social life), to reach balanced optimal levels across these features. This analysis was performed separately for different profiles of workers, i.e. full-time and part-time workers in 34 different European countries, differentiated by gender. The methodology employed for this purpose couples econometric and multiobjective interval programming approaches, enabling to assess the compromises of specific aspects of workers' personal and working conditions. Our findings indicate that current full-time working environments do not enable to foster higher levels of workers' life satisfaction with more than one child. Moreover, full-time (unlike part-time) working activities allow reaching worse levels across all measures of life satisfaction under analysis in a best-case scenario. This outcome suggests a change of paradigm where workers are keen on sacrificing other aspects of life satisfaction (namely their earnings and benefits) if this means having a better compromise of their personal and working lives. It is clear that promoting one-sided policies that only account for workers' satisfaction with their jobs and careers, without explicitly encompassing family values, affects fertility rates and population ageing, raising awareness of the importance of family work in policy-making.

"Diminishing marginal returns and sufficiency in health-care resource use: an exploratory analysis of outcomes, expenditure, and emissions","Background Increasing health expenditure in low-income countries is associated with rapid gains in health status. Less attention has been paid to the possibility of diminishing marginal returns to health expenditure at high levels of spending, or to the relationship between health-care greenhouse gas emissions and outcomes. Our study aimed to investigate the existence, scale, and implications of diminishing marginal returns to health-care expenditure and emissions. Methods Segmented (piecewise) regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between two measures of health outcome from the Global Burden of Disease project (mortality amenable to health care [MAH] and health-adjusted life expectancy [HALE]), four aggregates of health expenditure per capita from the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database, and health-care sector greenhouse gas emissions per capita derived from a 2020 study by Lenzen and colleagues. Turning point knots-points at which the elasticity or velocity of increasing returns to expenditure and emissions changed substantially-were estimated and countries in the vicinity of these knots identified. Findings Rapidly increasing returns (improvements in population health as measured by MAH and HALE) to health expenditure were estimated in low-income and lower-middle-income countries; at levels of spending above approximately US$500 per capita, these returns start to slow. At levels of spending above those seen in high-income countries such as Italy (approximately US$3400), there is little or no evidence of further health returns to additional spending or to increasing health-care greenhouse gas emissions. Interpretation Dramatic improvements in population health outcomes could be achieved by additional investment in health expenditure in low-income countries. Conversely, continuing growth in health expenditure in high-income countries will, by itself, be unlikely to yield rapid improvements in health outcomes. Our findings inform the emerging debate on the importance of sufficiency within planetary boundaries-low-income countries need rapid growth in health expenditure, whereas high-income countries could potentially achieve better health outcomes at substantially lower levels of resource use.",Not About Sufficiency
The Frontier Myth in US Offshore Wind Energy Communication,"Increased penetration of low-carbon energy technologies, such as wind and solar, into the U.S. energy system has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, facilitate transmission of energy to remote regions, and increase opportunities for public participation in energy system change. It also offers a window of opportunity to observe the social dynamics of rapid socio-technical system change. Studying internal, yet informal, communication among energy professionals enables communication researchers to probe processes and practices of identity composition, which may, in turn, suggest opportunities to shift the relationship between energy professionals and energy consumers away from alienation and toward consubstantiation. With this goal in mind, we analyzed communication among U.S. offshore wind professionals-specifically energy scientists and engineers-at professional conferences. Textual analysis of conference presentations and ethnographic interviews indicates that scientists and engineers working with the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry are composing an identity inspired by the frontier myth. We suggest that these evocations of the frontier myth might be strategically used to cultivate consubstantiality between technically-oriented energy professionals and publics. Awareness of a common connection to frontier myth may contribute to public engagement with offshore wind energy specifically, and more generally, with low-carbon energy technologies.",Not About Sufficiency
"RACE, POLLUTION, AND THE MASTERY OF NATURE","Racial environmental inequities, documented in research over the past ten years, have deep cultural sources in the connections between the concept of social pollution as it has operated in U.S. race relations and the pollution of minority communities, both of which are, in part, the expression of our dominant cultural ethic and project of mastering nature. The project of mastering nature requires the disciplining of ''human nature'' in a context of social power in order to dominate ''outward'' or ''external'' nature for the purposes of production and consumption. In disciplining human nature, our ethics and practices of work and gender have fostered the repression and projection of sensuality, widely construed, onto African-Americans in particular. This racial ''other'' has been historically segregated in our society through social pollution taboos. Social pollution practices, in turn, facilitate the disproportionate environmental pollution of minority communities by rendering such pollution, like the communities themselves, less visible and therefore less of a threat to white centers of power. This fit between social and environmental pollution is expressed in the notion of ''appropriately polluted space.'' Attempts to understand and correct racial environmental inequities will founder unless these deeper cultural connections are recognized and challenged. Moreover, attempts to redefine an environmentally benign ''self'' in the American context require that the historical ''other'' of race be confronted and transcended.",Not About Sufficiency
(Trans)forming gender: Social change and transgender citizenship,"This paper aims to contribute to recent sociological debates about gendered identity constructions and formations, and gendered citizenship, by exploring gender transformation through an analysis of new femininities and masculinities as they are variously articulated by transgender women and men. The paper charts the ways in which transgender has emerged as a subject of increasing social and cultural interest in recent years. Shifting attitudes towards transgender people are also evident through recent legislative changes brought by the Gender Recognition Act ( 2005). These social, cultural and legislative developments reflect the ways in which gender diversity is acquiring visibility in contemporary society, and suggest that gender diverse people themselves are experiencing greater levels of social inclusion. Such developments mark transgender as an important and timely area of sociological study. The paper argues that while the Gender Recognition Act marks a significant shift in socio- legal understandings of 'gender' as distinct from ' sex', it problematically remains tied to a medical perspective of transgender that continues to marginalise practices of gender diversity. The paper thus proposes caution against an assured trajectory of ( trans) gender transformation and social change. Rather, normative binary understandings of ' gender' underpin recent social and legislative shifts, giving way to individual and collective tensions around the desirability of assimilation. In turn these issues produce divergent ways of living as ' new' women and men.",Not About Sufficiency
Legislation and pollination: Recommendations for policymakers and scientists,"Global biodiversity declines and concomitant increases in diseases and calamities indicate the need for well-founded measures to provide sustainable development, guaranteeing material progress and social welfare, while safeguarding biodiversity. Public policies are important in this context as they provide norms for actions to deal with economic and socio-ecological problems. Nevertheless, scientists and legislators have conflicting opinions; perhaps due to lack of knowledge on both sides. Scientists provide information that is never used by legislators and legislators provide laws that do not provide biodiversity protection. Review and understanding of local legislation are thus crucial to understand those relationships and to provide robust suggestions for change. Here, we review Brazilian legislation concerning pollinator-relevant policies to show how these subnational policies fit calls from the science community. We also compared Brazilian legislation related to pollinator and biome protection to legislation in other countries. We found 314 national, state, and municipal laws on apiculture, meliponiculture, economic incentives, pesticides, pollinator awareness, and city planning. Although scientists are producing high-quality science to provide information for legislative standards, that information is not being used. Brazilian policies are numerous, but, in general, lack the standards to provide sustainable conservation. The main flaws are related to the lack of knowledge about non-bee pollinators, integrated pest management and GM crop risks, and lack of long-term monitoring of pollinators and pollination. More comprehensive and interdisciplinary legislation is needed to accomplish crop and biodiversity protection. Brazilian scientists should be consulted more often and participate in proposals for laws relating to pollinator conservation. (C) 2021 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

History of Brazil's tobacco control policy from 1986 to 2016,"This study analyzes Brazil's tobacco control policy from 1986 to 2016, seeking to describe the policy's history and discuss its achievements, limits, and challenges. The study adopted a political economics approach and contributions from public policy analysis. Data were based on a search of the literature, documents, and secondary sources and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in the policy. Factors related to the domestic and international contexts, the political process, and the policy's content influenced the institutional characteristics of tobacco control in the country. The study emphasizes the consolidation of Brazil's social rejection of smoking, government structuring of the policy, action by civil society, and Brazil's prestige in the international scenario. Intersector tobacco control measures like price and tax increases on cigarettes, the promotion of smoke-free environments, and the enforcement of health warnings contributed to the important reduction in prevalence of smoking. Implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in Brazil, beginning in 2006, contributed to the expansion and consolidation of the national policy. However, tobacco-related economic interests limited the implementation of some strategic measures. The challenges feature the medium-and long-term sustainability of tobacco control and the solution to barriers involving crop diversification on current tobacco-growing areas, the fight against the illegal cigarette trade, and interference in the policy by the tobacco industry.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating public health in European climate change adaptation policy and planning,"The study assesses the extent to which public health is integrated into European national and urban climate change adaptation policy and planning. We analyse national adaptation documents from the 27 European Union member states and interview city-level experts (n = 17) on the integration of three categories of adaptation efforts: general efforts to minimize health impacts related to climate change, targeted efforts to enhance resilience in health systems, and supportive efforts to foster the potential of the first two categories. At a national level, general efforts to address vector-borne diseases and heat-related illness are covered comprehensively, whereas efforts addressing several climate-related health risks are neglected (e.g. water-borne diseases, injuries from extreme weather and cardiopulmonary health) or overlooked (e.g. malnutrition and mental health). Targeted efforts to inform policy decisions, such as carrying out research, risk monitoring and assessments, are often described in detail, but efforts to manage day-to-day health care delivery and emergency situations receive little attention. At the urban level, health issues receive less attention in climate adaptation policy and planning. If health topics are included, they are often described as indirect benefits of adaptation efforts in other sectors and not perceived as the priority of the involved authorities. This effectively means that general and targeted efforts are the responsibility of other sectoral departments, while supportive efforts are the responsibility of the national government or external organizations. As a result, at an urban level, climate-related health system adaptation is not a policy aim in its own right, and many potentially high health risks are being ignored. In order for health risks to be better integrated into adaptation policy and planning, it is critical to interconnect national and urban levels, reduce sectoral thinking and welcome external expertize and facilitate large-scale data collection and sharing of health and climate indicators.Key policy insightsWe recommend focussing on cooperatively drafting strategies for integrating health issues into climate policy and planning with stakeholders at the national and urban levels, in different policy sectors and in society.Policy planners can build on the strengths of adaptation documents from other countries or cities and take note of any weaknesses.We advocate to foster co-benefits for health and climate action of various adaptation measures (e.g. by promoting active mobility and urban greenery, health impacts related to heat, (mental and physical) stress and air pollution are reduced).Large-scale data collection and sharing of health and climate indicators should be facilitated to support learning and pro-active decision-making.",Not About Sufficiency
THE ENVIRONMENT-TOURISM NEXUS Influence of Market Ethics,"Society is at a critical juncture in its relationship with the natural environment, a relationship in which tourism has growing significance. Yet, twenty years after the Brundtland Report, environmental policy has to date had little influence upon the workings of the tourism market, the supply and demand elements of which determine the 'use' or 'non-use' of nature. Inherent to the market is its environment ethic, that is, the extent of our recognition of nature's rights to existence. The thesis of this article is that whilst environmental policy may possibly have a greater influence in the future, it is the environmental ethics of the market that will be deterministic to the balance of the tourism-environment relationship.",Not About Sufficiency
Holocene Atmospheric Mercury Levels Reconstructed from Peat Bog Mercury Stable Isotopes,"Environmental regulations on mercury (Hg) emissions and associated ecosystem restoration are closely linked to what Hg levels we consider natural. It is widely accepted that atmospheric Hg deposition has increased by a factor 3 +/- 1 since pre-industrial times. However, no long-term historical records of actual atmospheric gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) concentrations exist. In this study we report Hg stable isotope signatures in Pyrenean peat records (southwestern Europe) that are used as tracers of Hg deposition pathway (Delta Hg-200, wet vs dry Hg deposition) and atmospheric Hg sources and cycling (delta Hg-202, Delta Hg-199). By anchoring peat-derived GEM dry deposition to modern atmospheric GEM levels we are able to reconstruct the first millennial-scale atmospheric GEM concentration record. Reconstructed GEM levels from 1970-2010 agree with monitoring data, and maximum 20th Century GEM levels of 3.9 +/- 0.5 ng m(-3) were 15 +/- 4 times the natural Holocene background of 0.27 +/- 0.11 ng m(-3). We suggest that a -0.7 parts per thousand shift in delta Hg-202 during the medieval and Renaissance periods is caused by deforestation and associated biomass burning Hg emissions. Our findings suggest therefore that human impacts on the global mercury cycle are subtler and substantially larger than currently thought.",Not About Sufficiency
Hotter and sicker: External energy expenditure and the tangled evolutionary roots of anthropogenic climate change and chronic disease,"Background The dual crises of climate change and chronic, or non-communicable, disease (NCD) have emerged worldwide as the global economy has industrialized over the past two centuries. Aims In this synthesis I examine humans' dependence on external (non-metabolic) energy expenditure (e.g., fire, fossil fuels) as a common, root cause in these modern crises. Materials and Methods Using fossil, archeological, and historical evidence I show that the human lineage has been dependent on external energy sources since the control of fire in the Paleolithic. This reliance has grown with the development of agriculture, the use of wind- and water-power, and the most recently with industrialization and the transition to fossil fuels. To place industrialization in context I develop a Rule of 50, whereby individuals in industrialized economies consume roughly 50-times more external energy and manufacture roughly 50-times more material than do hunter-gatherers. Results Industrialization and mechanization, powered by fossil fuels, have promoted centralization and processing in food production, reduced physical activity, and increased air pollution (including greenhouse gas emissions). These developments have led in turn to NCD and climate change. Discussion and Conclusion Climate change and NCD are connected both to one another and to our species' deep evolutionary dependence on external energy. Transitioning to carbon-free energy is essential to reduce the existential risks of climate change, but will likely have only modest effects on NCD. With the impending exhaustion of oil, coal, and natural gas reserves, developing replacements for fossil fuels is also critical to maintaining our species' external energy portfolio.",Not About Sufficiency
Alloying vanadium in MnBi2Te4 for robust ferromagnetic coupling and quantum anomalous Hall effect,"The intrinsic antiferromagnetic (AFM) interlayer coupling in the two-dimensional magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 places a restriction on realizing a stable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) [Y.

Through density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate the possibility of tuning the AFM coupling to the ferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4 films by alloying about 50% V with Mn. As a result, the QAHE can be achieved without alternation with the even or odd septuple layers. This provides a practical strategy to get a robust QAHE in ultrathin MnBi2Te4 films, rendering them attractive for technological innovations.",Not About Sufficiency

The association between household food insecurity and pregnancy-related weight gain and complications is not well understood. Objective To identify whether an independent association exists between household food insecurity and pregnancy-related complications. Design Data from the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition prospective cohort study were used to assess household food insecurity retrospectively using the US Department of Agriculture 18-item Core Food Security Module among 810 pregnant women with incomes <= 400% of the income/poverty ratio, recruited between January 2001 and June 2005 and followed through pregnancy. Main outcome measures Self-reported pregravid body mass index, gestational weight gain, second trimester anemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and gestational diabetes mellitus. Statistical analyses performed Multivariate linear, multinomial logistic, and logistic regression analyses. Results Among 810 pregnant women, 76% were from fully food secure, 14% were from marginally food secure, and 10% were from food insecure households. In adjusted models, living in a food insecure household was significantly associated with severe pregravid obesity (adjusted odds ratio 2.97, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 1.44 to 6.14), higher gestational weight gain (adjusted beta coefficient 1.87, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.62), and with a higher adequacy of weight gain ratio (adjusted beta .27, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.50). Marginal food security was significantly associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio 2.76, 95% CI 1.00 to 7.66). Conclusions This study highlights the possibility that living in a food insecure household during pregnancy may increase risk of greater weight gain and pregnancy complications.

Housing managers key to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of multi-family housing companies? A mixed method approach,"The building industry is facing a huge challenge as the industry sector carries much responsibility of the anthropogenic climate change: activities associated with housing alone account for as much as 30% of global annual energy demand. This demand derives not only from the physical characteristics of the buildings, but from the actions of the users, both end-users and professional managers. Even the best designed low-energy buildings will not perform is planned, if they are not operated properly. This study focuses on the role of professional managers in the energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of existing urban and suburban housing. Several different types of housing companies with different housing managers are studied by both quantitative (input-output based hybrid life cycle analysis to estimate building performance) and qualitative I:interviews to determine manager awareness and attitudes) means. It can be inferred from the study that housing managers through their attitudes and practices have a significant impact on the energy performance of buildings. Notwithstanding, managers feel as though they do not either have the responsibility or the power to make energy conservation a priority. Financial (long payback time) and even social (occupant discomfort) arguments are used to justify the lack of action. While housing managers readily hold the data, and have the professional skills for effective energy management, managers appear not to have an ethical motive for practicing energy-efficiency. In other words, managers have the potential to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of housing companies, but the potential is currently not fully exploited. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Textile and clothing is a labour-intensive industry and presents serious challenges to adopting social sustainability at various stages of the supply chain. The objective of this research is to analyse the perspectives of brands, clothing manufacturers (tier-1) and textile manufacturers (tier-2) on the barriers to social sustainability in multitier textile and clothing supply chains operating in India. Twenty barriers have been shortlisted through an exhaustive search of extant literature followed by a survey among textile and clothing supply chain practitioners. Seven barriers related to consumers, regulation and norms, and financial aspects are found to be common cause-group barriers for all three stages of the supply chain. Lack of top management commitment, lack of competitive pressure and lack of policy on social sustainability are omnipresent as effect-group barriers. However, the relational barriers between the partners (low price offered and pressure for further cost reduction from the brands) reveal the existence of conflicting perceptions at different stages of the textile and clothing supply chain. This implies a lack of synergy and symbiotic dependence, which has been analysed through the lenses of three different organisational theories. This article contributes by underpinning the tire-wise perspectives of barriers to social sustainability in the textile and clothing supply chain. The policymakers and supply chain managers would find the results helpful for making strategies to adopt and implement social sustainability leading to achieving SDGs.",Not About Sufficiency

How do system-wide net-zero scenarios compare to sector model pathways for the EU? A novel approach based on benchmark indicators and index decomposition analyses,"The use of scenarios and quantitative modelling to identify pathways for energy system transformations in line with the Paris targets is well established in the field of energy and climate policy. The resulting decarbonization pathways depend on both assumptions and the type of model used (e.g., integrated assessment models, energy system, macro-econometric or bottom-up sector models). The objective of this article is to analyze how energy demand sectors in system-wide net-zero scenarios for the EU compare to the results of sector-specific models. To this end, a novel approach referred to as ""sectoral benchmarking"" is developed and applied, combining the application of standard indicators such as energy intensity, electrification rate or carbon intensity with an index decomposition analysis. The combined approach allows visualizing how system-wide decarbonization pathways differ from the sector models' pathways by bringing the model output in a harmonized format for an efficient comparison. The analysis compares pathways from four different modelling tools: two European system models, one of which is an energy system model (EU TIMES) and the other a macro-econometric model (NEMESIS); as well as two sector-specific models, for transport (ALADIN) and for the industry and building sectors (FORECAST). We evaluate the system model's net-zero scenarios by comparing them to a corridor given by the sector models' current policy and net-zero emission scenarios. This corridor represents what the sector models deem as plausible from their bottom-up perspective within the boundaries of current policies and ambitions to reach net-zero.Our results show that the system model net-zero pathways differ substantially from the sectoral perspective in all sectors. In the industry and building sectors, both system models' decarbonization ambitions are within the sector corridor, but the employed mitigation levers differ. In the industry sectors, the sectoral model achieves substantial CO2 emission reductions with electrification, while the system models use more bioenergy (EU TIMES) or more energy efficiency (NEMESIS). In the building sector, both system models rely mostly on electrification, while the sector models relies on biomass and some district heat and electrification. In the transport sector, both system models' decarbonization ambition is substantially lower than the sector model's.The observed differences are caused by a variety of factors, which we evaluate in this article. One reason is the system models' lower ambition to decarbonize the end-use sectors due to their ability to compensate with negative emission technologies across sectors. In addition, employed mitigation levers differ due to the models' differing capabilities to consider technologies as well as differences in the allocation of bioenergy to sectors.Our findings can be used to determine how the different types of models can inform each other and to make the diverging decarbonization pathways more transparent to policy-makers and other relevant stakeholders.",Not About Sufficiency

The most important synergies concern SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth (score: 10) and SDG 3: Good health and well-being (score: 5) since formalizing the recycling sector is expected to create jobs, economic productivity is expected to improve as a result of increased resource efficiency in industry, and declining pollution is expected to increase health through adequate waste management in landfills. On the other hand, the most important trade-off pertains to SDG 1: No poverty (score: 3) because the incomes of informal workers are expected to decrease, affecting financially vulnerable families. In conclusion, despite being the least emitting sector globally, the waste sector is a promising avenue for mitigating climate change because of its synergistic effects with the SDGs. Circular economy policies in line with the 3Rs: reduce, reuse and recycle hold the most potential for synergies in developing countries. This case study generated momentum for policy implementation by highlighting policy synergies and ideas for the next revision of the NDC. Central to this was the process of fostering dialogue and learning among otherwise siloed policy actors.",Not About Sufficiency
"How Do We Value Our Reefs? Risks and Tradeoffs Across Scales in ""Biomass-Based"" Economies","This review examines how local and regional coral reef management can be better informed by economic valuations. Results from the Western Indian Ocean show that supporting services are underrepresented, while cultural and provisioning services, where clear markets exist, are overrepresented in both the number of studies conducted and values assigned. These services are generally assessed using different methods meaning comparisons cannot be made across services. The largest number of services flows to beneficiaries at a local scale, consequently the cumulative value of ecosystem services is largest at this scale. However, the average value of a single service appears greatest, when flowing to beneficiaries at a global scale, creating biases in ecosystem service assessments. Furthermore, inconsistencies in classification and definition, particularly concerning regulating and option services exist. Findings suggest that if regional managers are to base their decisions on current valuation studies, their choices are likely to result in unexpected and undesirable tradeoffs. There is a need for (1) new and standardized methods that adequately account for supporting services; (2) studies to consider multiple ecosystem services simultaneously and across scales; and (3) a greater interdisciplinary understanding of how and why ecosystem services contribute to human well-being, under differing social contexts.",Not About Sufficiency
How has the 2013 decoupled payment reform affected farmland rental values in Northern Ireland?,"The degree of capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into land rents has been mainly determined by different payment implementation systems and land markets. The 2013 EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform introduces a transition of Single Farm Payment towards a flat rate system and entitlement reallocation. Based on 2009-2017 Farm Business Survey data, we used the Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data estimation technique to estimate the capitalisation impact of the 2013 CAP reform to decoupled payments (DP) in Northern Ireland (NI) where a short term conacre land rental system is dominant. Our estimates suggest that under the 2013 CAP reform in NI, the capitalisation of DP into land rental prices has continued even when entitlements are less than eligible land areas. Specifically, the marginal effect on rental rates of an additional pound of the DP is 22 pence, increasing to 43 pence following the 2013 CAP reform but only in the first year. Given that about one-third of land area is rented in NI, land capitalisation will be of particular relevance in designing more efficient future subsidy policies.",Not About Sufficiency
How human health and well-being depends on healthy marine habitats in the Mediterranean: A review,"Human health and well-being, and how they are affected by terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems have been the subject of numerous studies. In contrast, there are very few such studies relating to marine ecosystems. Here, in the context of the Mediterranean Sea, we assess evidence of the broad interplay of relationships between marine habitats and human health and well-being. Our review shows that the major Mediterranean marine habitats provide various provisioning, cultural and regulating services that improve physical and mental health in a number of different ways. These include: (i) the provision of seafood rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help to reduce the risk of developing certain types of illnesses; and also, species that produce bioactive compounds that are potential sources of new drugs; (ii) the provision of blue spaces - areas of water suitable for leisure and recreational activities able to inspire, educate, and appeal to the aesthetic senses - that not only increase physical and psychological health, but also foster an individual and collective sense of place and identity and contribute to improving social relations; and (iii) the regulation of climate change, and of water quality and pollution, for example via sequestration of carbon and heavy metals, thus reducing the associated health risks. Our results show that Mediterranean marine habitats are valuable for health and well-being, thus highlighting the need to conserve as much of these habitats as possible (particularly through marine protected areas) and to carry out new studies to determine the specific causal pathways by which certain characteristics of marine habitats - including biotic (e.g. marine biodiversity) and abiotic (e.g. water quality) factors - affect human health and well-being.",Not About Sufficiency
How payments for ecosystem services can undermine Indigenous institutions: The case of Peru?s Ampiyacu-Apayacu watershed,"Payments for ecosystem services have come to dominate international policies for addressing tropical deforestation. Political ecologists, degrowth scholars, and Indigenous activists have critiqued these approaches on the grounds that by centering economic growth, they can disrupt local conservation systems and compromise forestdwelling communities' ability to protect forests and live well. Meanwhile, Indigenous groups have developed positive alternatives to 'green growth' strategies, including buen vivir (good living) in Latin America. In Peru, the National Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) serves as the state's flagship initiative to address tropical deforestation in Indigenous communities by paying communities for demonstrated reductions in deforestation, so long as they invest those funds according to an agreed up on management plan. We analyzed how the NFCP has interacted with quality-of-life plans, Indigenous planning tools rooted in buen vivir. Our findings suggest that the NFCP has eroded local systems for conservation, including the minga, an Amazonian tradition of mutual aid and shared labor for subsistence livelihoods, pushing communities to replace these systems with commodity production and employer-employee relationships. We argue that instead of imposing onerous conditions and steering communities towards evermore commodity production, conservation initiatives should support the implementation of quality-of-life plans. We suggest that climate justice organizers, political ecologists, and degrowth scholars explore and advocate for such initiatives.",Not About Sufficiency

How to Build Collective Capabilities: The 3C-Model for Grassroots-Led Development,"Capabilities need to be built from the bottom-up. Social innovations at the grassroots seek to present new solutions to existing social problems. However, since the poor suffer from limitations on their individual capabilities and agency, they engage in acts of collective agency to generate new collective capabilities that each individual alone would not be able to achieve. The question is: how can these acts of collective agency be initiated, supported and sustained in practice? What roles can development actors (such as the state, donors and NGOs) play in supporting these acts of collective agency? Drawing on the literature on social innovation, the capability approach, participation and empowerment, the paper argues that three crucial C-processes are integral conditions for promoting successful, scalable and sustainable social innovations at the grassroots, namely: (1) Conscientization; (2) Conciliation and (3) Collaboration. By linking the individual, collective and institutional levels of analysis, the paper demonstrates the importance of individual behavioural changes, collective agency and local institutional reforms for the success, sustainability and scalability of social innovations at the grassroots. The paper acknowledges conflict, capture and cooptation as potential limitations and recognizes the role of contextual factors in initiating, implementing and sustaining social innovations at the grassroots.",Not About Sufficiency
How to move from conflict to opportunity in the not-in-my-backyard dilemma: A case study of the Asuwei waste incineration plant in Beijing,"Environmental Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) conflicts pose significant challenges to environmental sustain-ability and governance capacity, particularly in transition economies like China. However, existing literature has largely overlooked the potential for transforming environmental NIMBY conflicts into opportunities, leaving a gap in our comprehension of the underlying mechanisms facilitating such transformations. Building upon the traditional conflict transformation theory, we develop a theoretical framework of Environmental NIMBY Conflict Transformation (ENCT) specifically tailored to environmental NIMBY conflicts. To validate and enrich ENCT empirically, we employ the theory-testing process tracing approach, utilizing the case study of the Asuwei waste incineration plant as a representative case of the successful transformation of an environmental NIMBY conflict. Our findings reveal that intricate environmental NIMBY conflicts are not inherently destructive, but rather, when approached with suitable strategies, they possess the potential to be transformed into opportunities. Further-more, environmental NIMBY conflicts can undergo transformation through the underlying mechanisms of five main categories: actor transformation, structure transformation, mode transformation, issue transformation, and situation transformation. In addition, we further link the relationship between conflict and opportunity from ten subcategories. These insights are expected to encourage environmental regulators to adopt conflict-shifted perspectives when dealing with potential environmental justice movements, thereby improving the effective-ness of environmental governance.",Not About Sufficiency
Off-grid hybrid wind-diesel power plant for application in remote Jordanian settlements,"Wind penetration into existing diesel systems to meet the load of a remote Jordanian village was assessed. Techno-economical analysis and thousands of hourly simulations were performed to design an optimal hybrid wind-diesel power plant to serve the loads of the village. The hybrid plant with 24% of wind-energy penetration, and comprised of five wind turbines and three diesel generators was found to be the optimal plant and it becomes feasible for wind speeds in the order of 5 m/s and more regardless of the diesel fuel cost. Utilizing this plant for electricity generation decreased the operational hours of the diesel generators by 10.3% in comparison with the diesel only situation. This led to a decrease of 21.3% in the diesel consumption. Consequently, 13.25 tons of greenhouse gas emissions can be avoided annually utilizing the proposed hybrid power plant for electricity generation in place of the existing diesel only system. Based on the obtained results, the studied village in particular and the remote Jordanian settlements in general are prospective candidates for deployment of the proposed hybrid wind-diesel power plant for electricity generation.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental regulation and energy efficiency: evidence from daily penalty policy in China,"To achieve the twin aims of environmental improvement and economic progress, some cities in China have implemented a stringent environmental regulation, Daily Penalty Policy (DPP). Compared with previous environmental regulations, DPP dramatically increases the cost of environmental pollution, but it is unclear whether DPP can effectively control environmental pollution and improve economic development together. This study evaluates the environmental and economic effects of DPP by estimating the relationship between DPP and energy efficiency in time-varying difference -indifferences (Time-varying DID) models. Our results show that DPP increases the firm-level energy efficiency (beta =0.07, p < 0.01) as well as confirm the twin effects of DPP on environmental pollution (decline in coal consumption and pollution emissions) and economic development (increase in production output).",Not About Sufficiency
Comparison of leading-industrialisation and crossing-industrialisation economic growth patterns in the context of sustainable development: Lessons from China and India,"Various economic growth patterns differ in sustainability. Taking China and India as examples, this study parses the connotation of leading-industrialisation and crossing-industrialisation economic growth patterns. In addition, a theoretical framework of sustainable development, including economic, social, environmental and demographic sustainability, is constructed. Furthermore, the comparative analysis and case study method are used to compare the sustainability of the two patterns. Results demonstrate that the leading-industrialisation pattern relies on abundant and skilled human resources to promote the manufacturing industry, thereby achieving rapid and high-quality economic growth at the expense of the environment. Although it is superior in social sustainability, such as poverty proportion, employment rate, price stability and health condition, the pattern can lead to a gap in wealth and an imbalance in urbanisation. By contrast, we reveal that the crossing-industrialisation pattern depends on the elite talents and technological progress to promote the service industry with high economic potential, which is resource-efficient and environment-friendly. Meanwhile, it is characterised by a small gap between the rich and the poor, relatively balanced urbanisation and future demographic dividends. However, it cannot guarantee adequate employment, public health and stable prices with serious poverty. This study enriches the multidimensional framework of sustainable development and proposes several practical implications for the sustainable development of the two economic growth patterns.",Not About Sufficiency
"SPATIOTEMPORAL CHANGES IN DAILY MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM TEMPERATURES AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH A LARGE-SCALE ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION PATTERN: A CASE STUDY IN THE WEI RIVER BASIN, CHINA","The long-term mean air temperature has increased with continued greenhouse-gas emissions in the past decades in the Wei River Basin (WRB) (China), with little understanding of the changes in extreme temperatures. In this study, the change characteristics of both maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures at daily, monthly, and annual scales were fully examined, and their relations with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) were also explored. The modified Mann-Kendall trend test method (MMK) and heuristic segmentation method were employed to detect the trends and change points of the Tmax and Tmin at multiple scales, respectively. Subsequently, the cross wavelet transform was adopted to reveal the correlations between Tmax/Tmin and AO. Results indicated: (1) both monthly and annual Tmax and Tmin showed significantly increasing trends, whilst at daily scale they generally exhibited no obvious trends; (2) change points were found in monthly, seasonal, and annual Tmax and Tmin, implying that the stationarity of Tmax and Tmin series in the WRB has been ineffective; (3) AO had strong impacts on Tmax and Tmin changes in the WRB.

Human Dimensions of Coral Reef Social-Ecological Systems,"Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on the planet but are declining because of human activities. Despite general recognition of the human role in the plight of coral reefs, the vast majority of research focuses on the ecological rather than the human dimensions of reef ecosystems, limiting our understanding of social relationships with these environments as well as potential solutions for reef recovery. General frameworks for social-ecological systems (SESs) have been advanced, but system-specific approaches are needed to develop a more nuanced view of human-environmental interactions for specific contexts and resource systems, and at specific scales. We synthesize existing concepts related to SESs and present a human dimensions framework that explores the linkages between social system structural traits, human activities, ecosystem services, and human well-being in coral reef SESs. Key features of the framework include social-ecological reciprocity, proximate and underlying dimensions, and the directionality of key relationships and feedback loops. Such frameworks are needed if human dimensions research is to be more fully integrated into studies of ecosystem change and the sustainability of linked SESs.",Not About Sufficiency
Human-environment interactions in China: Evidence of land-use change in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Metropolitan Region,"This paper aims to investigate human-environment interactions in the Chinese context by studying land-use change in terms of agglomeration of human activities.

"Income inequality, economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions nexus: empirical evidence from Ethiopia","The relationship between income inequality, economic growth, and CO2 emissions is ambiguous both theoretically and empirically. Hence, this study examines the link between income inequality, economic growth and CO2 emissions in Ethiopia for time span covering 1979-2014 using ARDL bounds test and DOLS approach to cointegration. The Zivot-Andrews unit root test and Clemente-Montanes-Reyes unit root test reveal that some of the variables under consideration are stationary at level while others become stationary after first differencing. Both ARDL and DOLS approaches confirm that there is a long-run relationship among the series during the study period. The long-run empirical results show that a 1% increase in economic growth accounts for a 1.05% increase in CO2 emissions while a 1% increase in economic growth squared reduces CO2 emissions by 0.11%. The U-test result reveals that the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth confirms existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. The effect of income inequality on CO2 is not robust to alternative estimation techniques; it is statistically insignificant under the ARDL estimation, but DOLS estimates show that a 1% increase in income inequality increases CO2 emissions by 0.21% in the long-run during the study period. In the long-run, a 1% rise in urbanization, population size, energy intensity, and industrialization each positively contribute to environmental degradation in Ethiopia by 0.38%, 0.22%, 0.07%, and 0.11% respectively. Results from the Toda-Yamamoto Granger causality show a bidirectional causal relationship between CO2 emissions and all other variables except economic growth. CO2 emissions Granger causes economic growth with no feedback effect.

CSR and sustainable development: are the concepts compatible?,"Purpose - In France, an application decree from February 2002 enumerates a series of operational indicators that companies must offer, including a number of accounting and financial items. The information expected notably includes working time organisation, gender equality, health and safety, disability policies, subcontractor arrangements, water, raw material and energy consumption and biodiversity efforts. The present study aims to account for the diversity of the social and environmental information that companies supply by focusing on three stakeholder categories: suppliers; customers; and employees. It also seeks to highlight possible variations among different sectors of activity; influence of three pillars of sustainability (economic, social and environmental); timeframe (short-term, long-term, analytical); and type of discourse (situational or action variables). Design/methodology/approach - Based on 40 French companies as a qualitative approach, the purpose of the present communication is to offer a discussion of the structuring modes applied to the information found in sustainability reports targeting stakeholders for all the companies belonging to the CAC 40 index. Findings - Mobilizing a structural contents analysis, its findings identify differentiated communications practices among the 40 companies in question. The study also unveils the existence of shorter-term approaches to sustainability action, contrasting to more long-term and/or analytical orientations. Finally, the reports in question all emphasized sustainability's ""economic"" dimension, with its ""social"" dimension being considered secondary and its ""environmental"" dimension coming last.

Hydrogen mobility from wind energy - A life cycle assessment focusing on the fuel supply,"In the current debates on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the mobility sector, hydrogen produced via water electrolysis from renewable electricity is commonly regarded to be a sustainable energy carrier with large potential for decarbonisation of the mobility sector. Directly produced at the refueling stations site, hydrogen greenhouse gas emissions are presently defined to be zero in e.g. the Directives of the European Union since emissions arising from the facilities construction are defined to be negligible. In order to check the validity of this assumption with respect to the latest technical developments in hydrogen supply, the present article aims to report the environmental performance of hydrogen being produced and compressed for mobility purposes. To this end, a state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling station (HRS) with an on-site alkaline electrolyser is assessed, which was built and operated in Berlin. Assuming electricity supply from wind energy generation, a life cycle assessment for the complete value chain was carried out where primary data for the build-up of electrolyser and HRS were obtained during decommissioning of the station. The results show that the construction of HRS and on-site electrolyser requires higher material and energy expenditures compared to previous investigations on similar but technically less advanced systems. These expenditures generate a significant footprint in the specific e.g. greenhouse gas emissions if the electrolyser is operated at a reduced load factor as it may be foreseen for grid stabilisation purposes. To ensure a strong reduction of emissions compared to conventional fuels, this load factor should be sufficiently high and should be defined to not fall under a certain threshold in upcoming directives. Besides, excessive use of supplies should be avoided and the refueling station should be operated with renewable electricity to the largest extent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

I don't Want to be Green: Prosocial Motivation Effects on Firm Environmental Innovation Rejection Decisions,"Although the political and consumer consciousness has turned increasingly green, many firms continue to resist the adoption of environment-friendly technological innovations-even in the face of higher costs, negative health effects, and stricter government oversight. This article examines how business owners weigh the trade-offs associated with environment-friendly innovations by examining the role of prosocial motivation in their decision-making process. We use primary data to overcome a common restriction in studying environmental innovations-the scarcity of relevant data-to analyze how business owners' expectations, perceptions, and motivations affect innovation in organizational processes and, consequently, the level of environmental friendliness of their products or services. We found that prosocial motivation had a significant negative impact on innovation adoption and that it is expressed differently under high and low levels of customer compatibility-possibly because business owners have a larger number of competing social objectives and priorities. Our results further showed that the innovation's ability to satisfy downstream customer demands has the greatest impact on environment-friendly innovation adoption decisions by business owners. This study enhances our understanding of how business owners make innovation decisions based on competing business, environmental and social objectives and provides a foundation for future research in this area.",Not About Sufficiency
An ecosystem report on the Panama Canal:: Monitoring the status of the forest communities and the watershed,"In 1996, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Republic of Panama's Environmental Authority, with support from the United States Agency for International Development, undertook a comprehensive program to monitor the ecosystem of the Panama Canal watershed. The goals were to establish baseline indicators for the integrity of forest communities and rivers. Based on satellite image classification and ground surveys, the 2790 km(2) watershed had 1570 km(2) of forest in 1997, 1080 km(2) of which was in national parks and nature monuments. Most of the 490 km(2) of forest not currently in protected areas lies along the west bank of the Canal, and its management status after the year 2000 turnover of the Canal from the U.S. to Panama remains uncertain. In forest plots designed to monitor forest diversity and change, a total of 963 woody plant species were identified and mapped. We estimate there are a total of 850-1000 woody species in forests of the Canal corridor. Forests of the wetter upper reaches of the watershed are distinct in species composition from the Canal corridor, and have considerably higher diversity and many unknown species. These remote areas are extensively forested, poorly explored, and harbor an estimated 1400-2200 woody species. Vertebrate monitoring programs were also initiated, focusing on species threatened by hunting and forest fragmentation. Large mammals are heavily hunted in most forests of Canal corridor, and there was clear evidence that mammal density is greatly reduced in hunted areas and that this affects seed predation and dispersal. The human population of the watershed was 113 000 in 1990, and grew by nearly 4% per year from 1980 to 1990. Much of this growth was in a small region of the watershed on the outskirts of Panama City, but even rural areas, including villages near and within national parks, grew by 2% per year. There is no sewage treatment in the watershed, and many towns have no trash collection, thus streams near large towns are heavily polluted. Analyses of sediment loads in rivers throughout the watershed did not indicate that erosion has been increasing as a result of deforestation, rather, erosion seems to be driven largely by total rainfall and heavy rainfall events that cause landslides. Still, models suggest that large-scale deforestation would increase landslide frequency, and failure to detect increases in erosion could be due to the gradual deforestation rate and the short time period over which data are available. A study of runoff showed deforestation increased the amount of water from rainfall that passed directly into streams. As a result, dry season flow was reduced in a deforested catchment relative to a forested one. Currently, the Panama Canal watershed has extensive forest areas and streams relatively unaffected by humans. But impacts of hunting and pollution near towns are clear, and the burgeoning population will exacerbate these impacts in the next few decades. Changes in policies regarding forest protection and pollution control are necessary.",Not About Sufficiency

Identifying Dietary Patterns Associated with Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Korean Adults Using Reduced Rank Regression,"Diet plays a crucial role in cognitive function. Few studies have examined the relationship between dietary patterns and cognitive functions of older adults in the Korean population. This study aimed to identify the effect of dietary patterns on the risk of mild cognitive impairment. A total of 239 participants, including 88 men and 151 women, aged 65 years and older were selected from health centers in the district of Seoul, Gyeonggi province, and Incheon, in Korea. Dietary patterns were determined using Reduced Rank Regression (RRR) methods with responses regarding vitamin B6, vitamin C, and iron intakes, based on both a one-day 24-h recall and a food frequency questionnaire. Cognitive function was assessed using the Korean-Mini Mental State Examination (K-MMSE). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between dietary pattern score and the risk of mild cognitive impairment. A total of 20 (8%) out of the 239 participants had mild cognitive impairment. Three dietary patterns were identified: seafood and vegetables, high meat, and bread, ham, and alcohol. Among the three dietary patterns, the older adult population who adhered to the seafood and vegetables pattern, characterized by high intake of seafood, vegetables, fruits, bread, snacks, soy products, beans, chicken, pork, ham, egg, and milk had a decreased risk of mild cognitive impairment compared to those who did not (adjusted odds ratios 0.06, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.72) after controlling for gender, supplementation, education, history of dementia, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), and duration of sleep. The other two dietary patterns were not significantly associated with the risk of mild cognitive impairment. In conclusion, high consumption of fruits, vegetables, seafood, and protein foods was significantly associated with reduced mild cognitive impairment in older Korean adults. These results can contribute to the establishment of dietary guidelines targeting older Korean adults to reduce mild cognitive impairments. Future prospective cohort studies are warranted to examine the effect of the seafood and vegetable dietary pattern on reducing mild cognitive impairment to prove the cause-effect relationship between dietary patterns and cognitive function.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying Ecological Priority Areas for Synergistic Conservation across Scales in the Asian Water Tower Region,"The region containing 17 Asian countries located on and around the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Asian Water Tower) is experiencing a serious ecological crisis, representing a major challenge for both Asian and global ecological conservation. Identifying and synergizing multiscale ecological conservation priorities for this region can promote progress toward the goals proposed by the post-2020 global biodiversity framework (e.g., protecting 30% of the planet) and Sustainable Development Goal 15 (life on land). We mapped the importance of and interactions among 5 key ecosystem services (ESs) (water conservation, carbon sequestration, sand fixation, soil conservation, and biodiversity conservation) across this region and identified areas where synergistic ESs were present. We further identified synergistic national-and regional-scaled conservation priority areas. The areas with ""high importance"" of the composite ESs accounted for 18.9% of the total region. Seventy-two percent of this area was found to have an overlap of at least 2 ESs. Approximately 33.3% of the study region was identified as a regional-scaled conservation priority area, which can be implemented synergistically in each country. Approximately 22.5% of the land in the priority area was nonecological land, which can seriously compromise the importance of ESs.

Identifying green citizen typologies by mining household-level survey data,"Some impactful but unfavorable results of rapid urbanization are human-nature disconnection, waste of energy/ water resources, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To save the future of our planet, a transition to a more sustainable urban life is a must. However, there is no single sustainable city model because cities differ in terms of their assets. Hence, locally customized sustainable actions linked to global sustainability should be developed, such as a change in individual behaviors leads to a sustainable society, city, and country. This research investigated green citizen profiles and variables affecting the profiles in the context of environmental behavior and sustainability. For this purpose, survey research was done at the household level in a metropolis in Turkey. Measurement scales about environmental concern, human-nature connections, and sustainable consumption behavior were used for collecting data. A data analysis approach was proposed as the survey dataset contains mixed-type variables. It amalgamates statistics with machine learning algorithms, namely two-stage clustering with multilayered self-organizing maps, k-medoid clustering algorithm, factor analysis, permutational multivariate analysis of variance, principal component analysis and classification and regression trees algorithm. The results reveal that (i) five distinct profiles, namely unconscious greens, risky greens, economic greens, potential greens, and wasters are identified, none of which is entirely green; (ii) district, family life-cycle, household size, number of rooms, altruistic and biocentric environmental concerns are the most critical variables in distinguishing profiles; (iii) the proposed approach enables processing socio-demographic, psychographic, behavioral and consumption variables together.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying hotspots of deforestation and reforestation in Colombia (2001-2010): implications for protected areas,"The conversion of natural areas to human-dominated land uses has been the major cause of global biodiversity decline and ecosystem degradation. Protected areas have been the most common strategy for reducing habitat and species loss. Effective conservation planning requires current information on land change dynamics, and the factors driving these changes. Therefore, our main goal was to assess the implications of land change on present and future protected areas. Specifically, we identified hotspots of reforestation and deforestation in Colombia between 2001 and 2010, and we determined the factors that explained land change within these hotspots. We identified four reforestation hotpots located mainly in the highlands of the Andes, and four deforestation hotpots that were located in the lowlands. Environmental and armed conflict variables explained most of the variation in the woody vegetation and agriculture/pasture classes, respectively. Although protected areas cover 12% of the country, only 4% of the reforestation and deforestation hotspots included protected areas. In Colombia, as well as the rest of the world, the majority of protected lands occur in remote regions where there are little to no economic activities and threats. Although we recognize the importance of this conservation approach, particularly for long-term conservation of large areas, we believe that complementary approaches that incorporate current land change dynamics are essential for future protected area planning. These approaches would place higher value on establishing new protected areas in regions that are undergoing rapid land change or regions where agricultural activities have been abandoned and ecosystems are beginning to recovery. The first approach would have immediate conservation benefits, while the second approach could bring ecosystem benefits in the short to intermediate-term and biodiversity benefits in the medium to long-term. These complementary approaches can provide helpful information for protected area conservation planning in a world with rapid land change.",Not About Sufficiency
"Identifying the factors affecting citizens' willingness to participate in urban forest governance: Evidence from the municipality of Palermo, Italy","Urban and peri-urban forests provide a wide range of benefits especially by providing the inhabitants with numerous ecosystem services that contribute to maintaining and improving the quality of life and environment in urban areas. Studies on urban and peri-urban forests have mainly focused on analyzing citizens' perception of benefits provided by urban green spaces. However, less attention has been paid to the influence that a positive perception of urban and peri-urban forests benefits has on citizens' willingness to play an active part in the planning and management process of green urban spaces. This study aims to explore the willingness of the citizens of the city of Palermo, in Italy, to devote time in the planning, design and management of urban forestry projects and identify which factors (perception, socio-demographic, and attitudinal factors) affect this choice. Results highlight that the socio-demographic characteristics (e.i. gender, income, number of family members) and frequency of visits are the main predictors of an individual's intention to commit time to urban forest projects. Our results also reveal a moderate impact of perception and psycho-attitudinal factors on citizens' intention to participate in urban forestry plans. It is thus evident that knowledge of urban and peri-urban forest characteristics and of the ecosystem services they are able to provide are the key factors to promoting effective conservation and management of green spaces, and to motivate citizens' participation through effective engagement strategies put in place by local governments.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying the terrestrial carbon benefits from ecosystem restoration in ecologically fragile regions,"Ecosystem restoration is an urgent and vital measure to restore degraded land in ecologically fragile regions. The terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity is important to indicate the effectiveness of ecosystem restoration, which has attracted the interest of many researchers. Ecologically fragile regions cover a large area in China, but few studies have focused on the carbon benefit of ecological restoration in these regions. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal changes in the carbon benefit, indicated by net primary productivity (NPP), in ecologically fragile regions in China. We evaluated the contributions of ecological restoration and climate change to terrestrial ecosystem carbon sink changes. The results showed that the ecological restoration projects significantly improved the carbon sequestration capacity in most of the ecologically fragile regions. From 2001-2017, the annual NPP of the entire study region was 460.1 +/- 5.4 Tg C yr(-1), and more than 70 % of the ecologically fragile region experiencing a significant (p < 0.05) increase. The effect of ecological restoration projects significantly intensified and was the main driver of the NPP growth in 87 % of the study region. The land use and land cover (LULC) change pattern indicates that the restoration project-induced conversion of agricultural land contributed to nearly 10 % of the total carbon sequestration after 2010. However, some extreme climatic conditions weakened the effectiveness of ecological restoration projects, highlighting the need for stricter management. Finally, this study identified the key area for effective ecological restoration in ecologically fragile regions in China.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying where nature-based solutions can offer win-wins for carbon mitigation and biodiversity across knowledge systems,"Managing nature-based solutions (NBS) in urban areas for carbon mitigation and biodiversity outcomes is a global policy challenge, yet little is known about how to both assess and weave diverse knowledge systems and values into carbon-biodiversity trade-off assessments. This paper examines the spatial relationships between biophysical and social values for carbon sequestration potential (measured as carbon dioxide, CO2, flux) and biodiversity in Helsinki, Finland, using integrated valuation. The approach combines methods from carbon sequestration modelling, expert scoring approaches to biodiversity assessment and public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS). Results indicate strong spatial associations between biophysical assessment of CO2 flux and biodiversity priorities, and weaker associations between biophysical and social values. Integration of social and biophysical values leads to multiple pathways for protection of NBS to achieve carbon mitigation and biodiversity outcomes, as well as options for the spatial targeting of education and capacity building programs to areas of local concern.",Not About Sufficiency
Human adaptation to extreme environmental conditions,"Modern humans inhabit most of earth's harshest environments and display a wide array of lifestyles. Biological adaptations, in addition to technological innovations, have enabled these geographical and cultural explorations. The study of these adaptations helps not only to fundamentally understand our evolution as a species, but also may have increasing relevance as genomics transforms fields such as personalized medicine. Here we review three cultural and environmental shifts that have brought about adaptations in modern humans; the arctic, high altitudes, and a subsistence dependent on breath-hold diving.",Not About Sufficiency
Impact evaluation and analysis at a river basin scale under projected climate and land-use change,"This study evaluated the individual as well as integrated impacts of climate and land use change on streamflow over Meenachil river basin, Kerala, India. The hydrological model SWAT was used to simulate future streamflow simulations under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios for the medium term (2025-2055) and long term (2056-2086). The land use land cover change was projected using land change modeler (LCM) of TerrSet software for the future period. Climate model simulations were taken to predict future streamflow at the regional scale, and an attempt was made to reduce the uncertainty associated with future predictions. According to the findings, streamflow was influenced by climate change (68.07%) and land use change (31.92%), with climate change having a higher contribution rate. The findings suggest that the combined impact of climate and land use change would increase streamflow in the future. The annual average streamflow is expected to decline (5.9%) in the medium term (2025-2055) under RCP 4.5 scenario and rise by 5.3% under RCP 8.5 scenario compared to the observed streamflow for the period 1987-2017. However, in the long term, it is expected to rise by 10.56% under RCP 4.5 and 22.61% under RCP 8.5.",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of climate change on water management in Dutch peat polders,"A spatially explicit dynamic model was developed that combines water quantity and quality processes for an average Dutch peat polder. The model has been used to calculate the consequences of climate change for surface water level, groundwater level and nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes, based on time series (2036-2065) of the two most extreme climate change scenarios for the Netherlands (G and W+) developed by the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute. It was calibrated using measured data from two existing polders. The results suggest that surface water levels will not change much in both scenarios. Hence, the current practice of letting extra water in during dry summer periods to maintain sufficient water levels will probably remain a viable solution to temporary summer droughts in the near future as the required water volumes are not likely to increase greatly. Late summer groundwater levels decrease substantially in the W+ scenario but not in the moderate G scenario. This drop in groundwater level would accelerate the on-going process of peat oxidation, resulting in increased soil subsidence, greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient release from mineralisation. The W+ scenario also led to higher nitrogen concentrations and lower phosphorus concentrations in the ditch network Probably the reduced stream velocity in the W+ scenario results in an increased sedimentation of (adsorbed) phosphate. Sedimentation is a less important process in the nitrogen cycle, and the increased nitrogen concentrations anticipated in summer according to the W+ scenario are therefore probably the consequence of a reduced outlet of water due to increased evaporation. Additionally, an increased delivery of nitrogen through mineralisation could also contribute to the increased nitrogen concentrations in summer. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Impact of climate change on Spanish electricity demand,"This paper evaluates the influence that climate change could exert on electricity demand patterns in Spain conditioned on the level of warming, with special attention to the seasonal occurrence of extreme demand days. For this purpose, assuming the currently observed electricity demand-temperature relationship holds in the future, we have generated daily time series of pseudo-electricity demand for the recent past and the twenty-first century by using simulated temperatures from statistical downscaling of global climate model experiments. We show that both the frequency and severity of extreme electricity demand days at the national level are expected to increase, even for low levels of regional warming. Moreover, the occurrence of these extremes will experience a seasonal shift from winter to summer due to the projected temperature increases in both seasons. Under a RCP8.5 scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, the extended summer season (June-September) will concentrate more than 50% of extreme electricity demand days by the mid-century, increasing to 90% before the end of the century. These changes in electricity demand have considerable spatial heterogeneity over the country, with northwestern Spain experiencing the seasonal shift later than the rest of the country, due to the relatively mild summer temperatures and lower projected warming there.",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of food insecurity on cognitive health in older adults: insights from the NHANES 2011-2014 data,"Purpose To investigate the relationship between food insecurity and cognitive decline among elderly Americans.Methods Utilizing NHANES 2011-2014 data, we examined cognitive function via the Immediate Recall Test (IRT), Delayed Recall Test (DRT), Animal Fluency Test (AFT), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and assessed food security through the US Food Security Survey Module.

Impact of land use change on hydrological systems: A review of current modeling approaches,"Hydrologic modeling plays a very important role in assessing the seasonal water availability, which is necessary to take decisions in water resources management. Both climate and land use and land cover change have great influence on the hydrological response of a watershed. The main aim of this study is to provide a detailed review of studies which have been carried out to analyze the hydrological impacts of land use change, and also to evaluate different scenario modeling approaches. In addition, a brief description of basic hydrologic models which are used to simulate the stream flow is provided. This review paper tried to explain the importance of model comparison and performance evaluation in modeling studies. The following conclusions may be drawn from this review: (1) it is necessary to model the possible impacts of land use change and climate change in order to proceed with effective water resources management, (2) it is important to analyze the variation in hydrological response in catchments with different land use characteristics and climatic conditions and also under climate scenarios, and (3) integration of different models with hydrologic models can be considered as an efficient method to forecast future trends in hydrological response.",Not About Sufficiency
"Impact of Reservoir Permeability, Permeability Anisotropy and Designed Injection Rate on CO2Gas Behavior in the Shallow Saline Aquifer at the CaMI Field Research Station, Brooks, Alberta","Carbon capture and storage is part of Canada's climate change action plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Containment and Monitoring Institute Field Research Station contributes to scientific and technological progress that ensures the secure underground storage of CO2. In this study, the process of shallow CO(2)gas injection (300 m) and subsequent plume development at the FRS was investigated using numerical simulation. Due to reservoir uncertainties, various sensitivity analyses were performed to illustrate their effects on CO(2)saturation, plume distribution and CO(2)dissolution in a saline reservoir in response to variations in horizontal permeability (k(h)),k(v)/k(h)ratio and CO(2)injection rate. The distance of horizontal migration of the plume post-injection was predicted analytically, and the result was validated against the numerical simulation prediction. Results show that increases ink(v)/k(h)ratio resulted in increases in both vertical and lateral plume migration and in decreases in dissolution rate and CO(2)solubility. It was also indicated that the subsequent post-injection CO(2)migration rate was independent of bothk(v)/k(h)and previous injection rate. Dissolution varied significantly with changes in horizontal permeability. The model shows that increased horizontal permeability facilitated plume migration vertically and horizontally. Modeled permeability variations in horizontal permeability (k(h)) andk(v)/k(h)ratio had a progressively decreasing effect on plume vertical migration with time, while lateral migration effects increased with time.",Not About Sufficiency
Impacts of future nuclear power generation on the international monitoring system,"Many countries are considering nuclear power as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the IAEA (IAEA, 2022) has forecasted nuclear power growth rates up to 224% of the 2021 level by 2050. Nuclear power plants release trace quantities of radioxenon, an inert gas that is also monitored because it is released during nuclear explosive tests. To better understand how nuclear energy growth (and resulting Xe emissions) could affect a global nonproliferation architecture, we modeled daily releases of radioxenon isotopes used for nuclear explosion detection in the International Monitoring System (IMS) that is part of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty: 131mXe,133Xe,133mXe, and 135Xe to examine the change in the number of potential radioxenon detections as compared to the 2021 detection levels. If a 40-station IMS network is used, the potential detections of 133Xe in 2050 would range from 82% for the low-power scenario to 195% for the high-power scenario, compared to the detections in 2021. If an 80-station IMS network is used, the potential detections of 133Xe in 2050 would range from 83% of the 2021 detection rate for the low-power scenario to 209% for the high-power scenario. Essentially no detections of 131mXe and 133mXe are expected. The high growth scenario could lead to a 2.5-fold increase in 135Xe detections, but the total number of detections is still small (on the order of 1 detection per day in the entire network). The higher releases do not pose a health issue, but better automated methods to discriminate between radioactive xenon released from industrial sources and nuclear explosions will be needed to offset the higher workload for people who perform the monitoring.",Not About Sufficiency
Impacts on South America moisture transport under Amazon deforestation and 2 °C global warming,"The increase in greenhouse gasses (GHG) anthropogenic emissions and deforestation over the last decades have led to many chemical and physical changes in the climate system, affecting the atmosphere's energy and water balance. A process that could be affected is the Amazonian moisture transport in the South American continent (including La Plata basin), which is crucial to the southeast Brazilian water regime. The focus of our research is on evaluating how local (i.e. Amazon deforestation) and global forcings (increase of atmospheric GHG concentration) may modify this moisture transport under climate change scenarios. We used two coupled landatmosphere models forced by CMIP6 sea surface temperatures to simulate these processes for two scenarios: i) increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) - RCP8.5 atmospheric levels (00DEF), and ii) total Amazon deforestation simultaneous with atmospheric CO2 levels increased (100DEF). These scenarios were compared with a control simulation, set with a constant CO2 of 388 ppm and present-day Amazon Forest cover. The 30 -year Specific Warming Level 2 (SWL2) index evaluated from the simulations is set to be reached 2 years earlier due to Amazon deforestation. A reduction in precipitation was observed in the Amazon basin (-3.1 mm & sdot;day- 1) as well as in La Plata Basin (-0.5 mm & sdot;day-1) due to reductions in the Amazon evapotranspiration (-0.9 mm & sdot;day-1) through a stomatal conductance decrease (00DEF) and land cover change (100DEF). In addition, the income moisture transport decreased (22 %) in the northern La Plata basin in both scenarios and model experiments. Our results indicated a worse scenario than previously found in the region. Both Amazon and La Plata hydrological regimes are connected (moisture and energy transport), indicating that a large-scale Amazon deforestation will have additional climate, economic and social implications for South America.",Not About Sufficiency
Implementation of new technologies for reducing fuel consumption of automobiles in Brazil according to the Brazilian Vehicle Labelling Programme,"The consumption of fossil fuels by motor vehicles has increased greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. The automotive industry has invested in environmental technologies to reduce these emissions. This study aimed to determine whether in light-duty vehicles deploying environmental technologies met the energy efficiency ratings of the Brazilian Vehicle Labelling Programme (BVLP) in 2013, 2015, and 2017. In 2013, Brazil implemented the 'INOVAR-AUTO' regulation to improve vehicle energy efficiency. Based on information from the BVLP database, the actual efficiencies of light-duty vehicles were compared with those mandated by the regulation. The effectiveness of the regulation was assessed using the growth rates of the energy consumption and annual A ratings. The results showed that certain powertrain technologies increased the energy efficiency, resulting in many vehicles with A ratings from the BVLP. The use of three-cylinder engines and variable valve timing (VVT) had the highest positive effects on improving the energy efficiency. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Implementation of the New European Bauhaus Principles as a Context for Teaching Sustainable Architecture,"Due to the presentation of the European Green Deal (EGD) on 11 December 2019, it is important to introduce a new context for the education of architects corresponding to the objectives set by the European Union. These include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, designing buildings in accordance with the principles of the circular economy, using renewable energy, as well as promoting ecological food and protecting biodiversity. As part of the design course Environmentally Friendly Housing Architecture, inspired by, among others, the design of the New European Bauhaus and the former Bauhaus art school, both of which are compared in the first part of this article, we identify a number of new, assessed design indicators related to the achievement of the above objectives, in line with the trend of sustainable architecture. The indicators are divided into four main categories: energy, environment, indoor climate, and society, where, for example, the environmental category includes the following criteria: embodied energy (MJ/m(2)), embodied carbon footprint (CO(2)eq/m(2)), use of rainwater and gray water (% of demand), use of mains water (% of demand), local production of vegetables and fruit (% of demand). During the design process, changes were made to achieve better indicators, and the final designs were described using radar charts. The paper presents a statistical summary of the achieved values for individual indicators, the progress achieved, exemplary design solutions, and the assessment of the methodology used. The design course Environmentally Friendly Housing Architecture was assessed by the participants by means of a questionnaire.</p>",Not About Sufficiency
Implications of sustainability constraints on UK bioenergy development: Assessing optimistic and precautionary approaches with UK MARKAL,"Bioenergy is an important renewable energy resource. However, assessments of the future of bioenergy are beset with uncertainty and contested values, suggesting that a precautionary approach to bioenergy resource development may be warranted. This paper uses UK MARKAL to examine the implications of adopting a precautionary approach to bioenergy development in the UK. The paper reports a detailed review of UK bioenergy resources and sustainability constraints, and develops precautionary and optimistic resource scenarios. The paper then examines the implications of these scenarios using the energy systems model MARKAL, finding that a precautionary approach adds to the cost of decarbonisation, but does not significantly alter the optimal technology mix. In particular, biomass and co-firing CCS emerge as optimal technologies across scenarios. The question of UK land availability for bioenergy production is highlighted within the paper. With less land available for bioenergy production, the costs of decarbonisation will rise; whereas if more land is available for bioenergy, then less land is available for either food production or ecosystem conservation. This paper quantifies one side of this trade-off, by estimating the additional costs incurred when UK land availability for bioenergy production is constrained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Improving recovery efficiency by CO2 injection at late stage of steam assisted gravity drainage,"The high recovery performance of steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) makes it a popular option for heavy oil resources. Currently, most of the heavy oil reservoirs developed by SAGD in China are in the late development phase, with high energy consumption due to reduced thermal efficiency. The use of SAGD wind-down processes involving CO2 in combination with steam for heavy oil recovery is considered as a viable alternative to limit energy consumption, and also reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by leaving CO2 behind in the reservoir. Study reveals that the dissolution and demulsification of CO2 in crude oil can reduce the viscosity of emulsified heavy oil by more than 50%. When the steam chamber temperature reaches 200 degrees C, the amount of solid phase deposition induced by CO2 extraction is only 0.016 kg/m(3), the rock wettability changes from lipophilic to hydrophilic, and the higher the reservoir temperature, the stronger the hydrophilicity is, which reduces the adhesion power of the oil phase and facilitates the stripping of crude oil from the rock surface. Numerical simulation studies have been carried out utilizing STARS to obtain energy efficient utilization and improved steam chamber characteristics. Heat loss from SAGD baseline is 1.77 times that with CO2 injection process, but the recovery factor is only 2.48% higher. At the initial stage with CO2 injection, the steam chamber continues its lateral expanding, which increases the recovery factor at the initial stage of CO2 injection by about 6%. One year after CO2 injection, gas channeling results in lower recovery than traditional SAGD process, and 38.4% of the injected CO2 is stored in the reservoir from this study.",Not About Sufficiency

Incorporating Sustainability Concerns in the Better Life Index: Application of Corrected Convex Non-parametric Least Squares Method,"The OECD recently released a comprehensive set of 11 well-being indicators, the so-called Better Life Index (BLI), for 36 countries. The BLI covers a wide range of socio-economic aspects of life, which are essential to well-being. This well-being dataset allows us to compare countries' overall well-being. However, in spite of the BLI's wider coverage of variables, it fails to consider sustainability concerns. This study provides a practical proposal for comparing overall well-being by incorporating sustainability concerns. Using the World Bank's adjusted net savings data as a sustainability indicator, we add an extra dimension to the BLI. Then, we apply a composite indicator and aggregate these 12 indicators for each country into a single number. Moreover, we improve the current method for constructing composite indicators by adopting corrected convex non-parametric least squares ((CNLS)-N-2). It is a typical problem in a non-parametric approach based on linear programming for countries' scores of composite indicators to become equal and their performance cannot be distinguished. This becomes even more severe if the number of sample countries is small or the number of aggregated indicators is large, which is the case of the present study dealing with 12 indicators for 36 countries. The use of (CNLS)-N-2, which is based on quadratic programming, overcomes this problem and allows us to order all countries in the sample completely. The empirical results show that the introduction of a sustainability indicator for comparisons does not change countries' overall rankings significantly. However, it certainly changes the ranking of some countries in both directions.",Not About Sufficiency
Incorporating waste to develop environmentally-friendly concrete mixes,"The inclusion of various waste products in concrete mixes was studied, with the intent of being used in an aviation construction project. The waste products investigated were waste plastic aggregates, fly ash and recycled glass powder as supplementary cementitious materials, waste glass sand as fine aggregate partial replacement, and waste latex paint as a polymeric admixture. The objective of the mix design testing was to develop three concrete mixes which met specific design requirements set by the project whilst reducing greenhouse gas emissions and landfill mass when compared with standard mix designs provided by the concrete plant. A three phase trial mix design process was followed, where the influence of plastic aggregate as a natural aggregate binder replacement was investigated, in conjunction with the addition of fly ash as a supplementary cementitious material, glass sand and waste paint. Through testing for the hardened properties of the concrete mixes, and microscopic analysis of cross-section samples, mix designs which achieved the structural performance objectives were developed. A Life Cycle Assessment to compare the potential environmental impact reduction of the recycled material mix designs was conducted, focusing on the product stage considering the variation in quantity of raw materials (A1) across mixes, and their transport (A2) to batching plant located in Auckland.

Conclusions are drawn on the merits of different design features to improve the environmental performance of agreements, including reporting, monitoring, and the use of legal and financial sanctions to ensure compliance with agreed targets.",Not About Sufficiency
Inequalities of urban green space area and ecosystem services along urban center-edge gradients,"Rising inequality threatens the improvement of human well-being. As an important type of green infrastructure within cities, urban green spaces provide ecosystem services and contribute to human health. The inequalities of per capita urban green space area and ecosystem services are critical environmental justice and public health issues but are not well understood. Based on the spatial patterns of green spaces, land rent, and the population of 20 cities in China, we assessed the inequalities of per capita green space area and ecosystem services by using the Gini coefficient. Results showed that, (1) the Gini coefficient (an indicator to measure inequality) of per capita available ecosystem services was 0.430, which was greater than that of per capita green space area (0.357), (2) the inequality of per capita ecosystem services had a negative relationship with city size measured by population and GDP, and (3) the inequality of green space area was negatively related to the subjective quality of life, while the inequality of ecosystem services was negatively related to the economic competitiveness of cities. We suggest that urban planners comprehensively consider multiple indicators (such as per capita green space area, Gini coefficients of per capita green space area and ecosystem services) to simultaneously evaluate the efficiency and equality of green space construction.",Not About Sufficiency
Influence of display cabinet cooling on performance of supermarket buildings,"Energy demand attributable to the operation of supermarkets is thought to be responsible for 1% of UK greenhouse gas emissions. Current building regulations in the UK require the building related energy use of new commercial buildings to comply with particular requirements. Supermarket buildings are therefore modelled in considerable detail, according to these protocols to establish their predicted energy demand. Lighting, occupancy, and small electrical energy impacts are included in this modelling. However, a large gap is found between the design outputs of this modelling and the energy performance of the store in operation. One reason for this is that thermal interactions at the refrigeration cabinets are not included in this modelling, as refrigeration is classified as process energy rather than building related. This paper explores the comparative energy demands of supermarket retail floors simulated both with and without the cooling effect of refrigeration cabinets included in the simulation. The retail floor of a recently built supermarket is modelled using EnergyPlus. Practical applications: It has been shown that the energy demand of the retail floor of a new store could be reduced by 25% by improvement of the envelope, by halving ventilation rates and doubling insulation levels. This has been shown by simulation of the building energy flows with refrigeration cabinets included in the modelling (whereas these are currently excluded as process energy). Changes in modelling protocols, and regulations, to encompass refrigeration energy transfers, could reduce the national load, due to supermarkets, by at least 140MW in 5 years. Energy costs to the retailer would be reduced by 20%. Additionally, the simulation has shown the contribution of rooflights to the reduction of energy demand to be lower than previously predicted, saving only around 1/3 of design expectations.",Not About Sufficiency
Influence of nutrient availability on the interaction between spotted knapweed and bluebunch wheatgrass,"Centaurea maculosa (Lam.) (spotted knapweed) reduces wildlife and livestock habitat biodiversity and increases erosion. Nutrient availability to plants may be used to accelerate succession away from spotted knapweed. Early-successional plant communities often have high nutrient availability, whereas late-successional communities are often found on lower nutrient soils. We hypothesized that removal of nutrients would change the competitive advantage from spotted knapweed to Pseudoroegneria spicatum (bluebunch wheatgrass) (late seral). In two addition series matrices, background densities of Secale cereale (annual rye) and Elymus elimoides (bottle-brush squirreltail) (3,000 seedS/m(2)) were used to remove nutrients from the soil. In another set of addition series matrices, nitrogen (33 kg/ha) or phosphorus (33 kg/ha) were added to the soil. Nutrient analysis of soil and vegetation indicated that annual rye and bottle-brush squirreltail reduced nutrient availability in soils. In another matrix, neither a background density nor nutrients were added. Data were fit into Watkinson's curvilinear model to determine the competitive relationship between bluebunch wheatgrass and spotted knapweed. This allowed comparison of the equivalence ratios (C) generated from each addition series. The C parameters are the per-plant equivalent of bluebunch wheatgrass or spotted knapweed and can be interpreted as the ratio of intra-to-interspecific competition. The C parameters are also the equivalence ratio of the number of spotted knapweed it takes to have equivalent effect on bluebunch wheatgrass or the number of bluebunch wheatgrass having the equivalent effect on spotted knapweed. Without nutrient manipulation, spotted knapweed was more competitive than bluebunch wheatgrass. The C for bluebunch wheatgrass was 0.17, indicating that 0.17 knapweed plants were competitively equivalent to one wheatgrass. Annual rye changed the competitive balance in favor of bluebunch wheatgrass (C = 9.9). Addition of nitrogen, phosphorus, or the mid-seral species did not change the competitive relationship between the two species. This preliminary study suggests that succession from spotted knapweed to late-seral bluebunch wheatgrass community may be accelerated by altering resource availability.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon Footprint and Variable Costs of Production Components for a Container-grown Evergreen Shrub Using Life Cycle Assessment: An East Coast US Model,"The production components of an evergreen shrub (Ilex crenata Bennett's Compacta') grown in a no. 3 container in an east coast U.S. nursery were analyzed for their costs and contributions to carbon footprint, as well as the product impact in the landscape throughout its life cycle. A life cycle inventory was conducted of input materials, equipment use, and all cultural practices and other processes used in a model production system for this evergreen shrub. A life cycle assessment (LCA) of the model numerated the associated greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), carbon footprint, and variable cost of each component. The LCA also included the transportation and transplanting of the final product in the landscape as well as its removal after a 40-year useful life. GHG from input products and processes during the production (cutting-to-gate) of the evergreen shrub were estimated to be 2.918 kg CO(2)e. When considering carbon sequestration during production weighted over a 100-year assessment period, the carbon footprint for this model system at the nursery gate was 2.144 kg CO(2)e. Operations, combining the impact of material and equipmerit use, that contributed most of GHG during production included fertilization (0.707 kg CO(2)e), the liner and transplanting (0.461 kg CO(2)e), the container (0.468 kg CO(2)e), gravel and ground cloth installation (0.222 kg CO(2)e), substrate materials and preparation (0.227 kg CO(2)e), and weed control (0.122 kg CO(2)e). The major contributors to global warming potential (GWP) were also major contributors to the cutting-to-gate variable costs ($3.224) except for processes that required significant labor investments. Transporting the shrub to the landscaper, transporting it to the landscape site, and transplanting it would result in GHG of 0376, 0.458, and 0 kg CO(2)e, respectively.

In this article, we propose an ecosystem analysis approach by extending the technology ecosystem paths of influence model (Adomavicius et al., 2008a) to incorporate stakeholder actions, considering both supply-side and demand-side forces for technological change. Our ecosystem model brings together three original core elements: technology components, technology-based services, and technology-supported business infrastructures. We also contribute a fourth new element to this approach involving stakeholder analysis. We investigate innovations in the area of high-frequency trading (HFT) technologies as a basis for empirically validating the existence of several different patterns in the historical path of technology evolution. Our analysis results suggest that supply-side and demand-side forces influenced HFT technology innovations and contributed to changes in the financial markets. This research represents some of the first work that investigates financial market technology innovations at the technology and stakeholder levels. It also offers a useful and practical tool to help managers and analysts to understand the nature of technology-based financial innovations and the relationships between technology and financial markets that support their emergence.

Innovative waste heat valorisation technologies for zero-carbon ships - A review,"The growing intensity of international commerce and the high share of total global greenhouse gas emissions by the maritime sector have motivated the implementation of regulations by the International Maritime Organisation to curtail vessel emissions. In this context, waste heat recovery (WHR) is an effective way to improve ship energy efficiency, lower amounts of wasted energy rejection to the environment, and therefore ultimately curb green-house gas emissions. Presently, there exists a heterogeneity within the body of literature concerning WHR technologies for on-board applications, study scope and results, complicating the interpretation and cross comparison of the outcomes. Sporadic attempts have been made to review and systematise this landscape, leaving some key areas uncovered. Therefore, the present article aims at filling these gaps by providing and holistic review of WHR technologies development and on-board applications. Further, the energy systems and available waste heat characteristics in large vessel types are overviewed, before both existing and developmental on-board waste heat recovery technologies for maritime applications are reviewed. Emphasis is placed on the performance of these technologies within the broader on-board energy system. Common key performance indicators are drawn from existing systems, experimental prototypes, and simulations, to quantitatively compare the different technologies. This review indicates that a wide range of technological options for embedding waste heat recovery in on-board energy systems are emerging. In particular, traditional turbocompounding is already fully implemented within the marine waste heat recovery (WHR) context. Conversely, ORC systems and absorption refrigeration systems have not yet been suitably adapted for marine applications due to a lack of research and prototypes, despite their deployment in conventional WHR contexts. Other technologies, such as thermal energy storage devices, hybrid refrigeration systems, isobaric expansion engines, Kalina Cycles, and adsorption desalination and cooling systems, are still at the research and development stage, while thermoelectric generation systems continue to incur high deployment costs. The development of research on these innovative technologies, the reduction of their cost and their synergistic integration could lead to significant improvements inengine fuel efficiency and emissions reduction, especially when coupled with existing waste heat recovery measures.",Not About Sufficiency
INSPIRE: A European training network to foster research and training in cardiovascular safety pharmacology,"Safety pharmacology is an essential part of drug development aiming to identify, evaluate and investigate undesirable pharmacodynamic properties of a drug primarily prior to clinical trials. In particular, cardiovascular adverse drug reactions (ADR) have halted many drug development programs. Safety pharmacology has successfully implemented a screening strategy to detect cardiovascular liabilities, but there is room for further refinement. In this setting, we present the INSPIRE project, a European Training Network in safety pharmacology for Early Stage Researchers (ESRs), funded by the European Commission's H2020-MSCA-ITN programme. INSPIRE has recruited 15 ESR fellows that will conduct an individual PhD-research project for a period of 36 months. INSPIRE aims to be complementary to ongoing research initiatives. With this as a goal, an inventory of collaborative research initiatives in safety pharmacology was created and the ESR projects have been designed to be complementary to this roadmap. Overall, INSPIRE aims to improve cardiovascular safety evaluation, either by investigating technological innovations or by adding mechanistic insight in emerging safety concerns, as observed in the field of cardio-oncology. Finally, in addition to its hands-on research pillar, INSPIRE will organize a number of summer schools and workshops that will be open to the wider community as well. In summary, INSPIRE aims to foster both research and training in safety pharmacology and hopes to inspire the future generation of safety scientists.",Not About Sufficiency
"Institutions, Labor Market Insecurity, and Well-Being in Europe","We examined the differences among seventeen European countries regarding the extent to which several key institutional and labor market characteristics affect the degrees of insecurity that people feel about their jobs and employment prospects, as well as their well-being (economic security and subjective well-being). We estimate how macrostructural factors affect well-being by fitting random-intercept multi-level models and decomposing the variance across national and individual levels, using data from the 2004 and 2010 European Social Surveys. We find that there is substantial country-level variation in labor market insecurity, economic security and subjective well-being. Active labor market policies, the generosity of unemployment benefits, and collective bargaining coverage explain a considerable portion of the identified differences among countries in labor market insecurity and well-being. The effects of employment protection legislation vary depending on whether the worker has a permanent or temporary contract. We did not find substantial differences between 2004 and 2010, suggesting that the effects of institutions and worker power on labor market insecurity and well-being reflect longer-term structural changes associated with the transformation of employment relations.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrated municipal solid waste management scheme of Hong Kong: A comprehensive analysis in terms of global warming potential and energy use,"The climate and energy nexus have drawn global attention towards sustainable solutions for synthetic processes, such as waste management. Innovative policies can amend waste management systems to be more sustainable, as in Hong Kong, where besides the conventional landfilling, alternatives like incineration and biological treatment methods are being considered to develop an integrated system. However, the outcomes appear uncertain and need to be analysed for best possible integration. This study proposes a customized methodology for impact assessment of these waste treatment technologies and evaluates five integrated scenarios in terms of net greenhouse gas emissions (GHEs) and energy use by applying classified modelling approaches. The baseline results revealed that compared to the landfilling alone, integration of landfilling with combined anaerobic digestion and composting (ADC) reduced up to 56% of net GHEs. Incineration with ADC saved up to 87% GHEs and ranked as the best-case scenario in both impact categories. Considering carbon sequestration as a credit suggested that landfill-linked scenarios were suitable for GHEs saving, while landfilling alone remained the worst case. The uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis revealed that some key parameters can alter the ranking order of scenarios, when variated by the reported uncertainty. The study provides useful modelling insights into the critical nature of these technologies and can be considered as a decision-making tool locally, as well as a generic calculation template.

Integrating coarse-resolution images and agricultural statistics to generate sub-pixel crop type maps and reconciled area estimates,"Reliable crop type maps are vital for agricultural monitoring, ensuring food security, and environmental sustainability assessments. Coarse-resolution imagery such as MODIS are widely used for crop type mapping due to their short revisit cycles, which is advantageous for detecting the seasonal dynamics of different crop types. However, the inherently low spatial resolution may restrict their utility for mapping crop types in regions with heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Agricultural statistics, which provide crop acreage information at different spatial and temporal scales, have the potential to improve crop type mapping from remote sensing. Yet, previous studies have often used agricultural statistics as reference data to evaluate the accuracy of satellitederived crop type maps but have rarely utilized them to improve crop type distribution mapping. The utility of integrating agricultural statistics with satellite images to produce high-accuracy crop type maps is rarely explored. This study presents a methodology for mapping sub-pixel crop type distributions via the integration of MODIS time series and agricultural statistics. We tested our approach in Heilongjiang Province, which has the highest agricultural production in China. First, we used an optimized random forest regression (RF-r) model with training samples derived from high spatial resolution images (i.e. SPOT and Landsat) to predict the sub-pixel crop type distributions from MODIS time series. To optimize the RF-r model, an 8-day MODIS time series of five vegetation indices in 2011 were used as the candidate independent variables, and a backward feature elimination strategy was implemented to select the best variables for model prediction. Second, we developed an Iterative Area Gap Spatial Allocation (IAGSA) method to spatially reconcile the discrepancies between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS-based maps and the agricultural statistics. We found that the MODIS-derived crop fractions agreed with those derived from the high-resolution images, with R2 > 0.75 for all crop types, yet there was a clear discrepancy between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS and agricultural statistics. The subpixel crop type maps adjusted by IAGSA were not only consistent with the agricultural statistics for crop acreage, but also retained the spatial distribution patterns of the original MODIS-derived crop fraction. Our results suggest the advantages of integrating coarse-resolution images and agricultural statistics to map sub-pixel crop type distributions, and to provide consistent estimation of crop acreage. The presented methodology has the potential to map large-scale crop type extent across regions in a cost-effective way.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating Energy Demand and Local Renewable Energy Sources in Smart Urban Development Zones: New Options for Climate-Friendly Resilient Urban Planning,"In recent years, most cities have experienced rapid population growth. Concurrently, international policies have called for substantial reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the resilience of energy-supply systems has become more important. Consequently, solutions to exhaust locally-available sources must be developed to minimize the fraction of fossil fuels for heating, cooling and electricity. This article shows an example of designing a low-temperature heating and cooling grid based on locally-available renewables and waste heat and introduces general hypotheses concerning smart energy planning in urban development zones. Taking an urban development area in Vienna, Austria, as example, it is shown that wastewater, geothermal and (office) waste heat, solar energy, and the heat content of ambient air can play an important role within a climate-friendly urban energy concept and that heating and cooling demand can be covered completely on-site. From an environmental point of view, the concept is promising, as greenhouse gas emissions and the non-renewable primary energy consumption can be reduced by over 70% compared to conventional gas heating, while, based on current (fossil) energy prices, it is economically not fully competitive. The gap could be closed e.g. by CO2 taxes on fossil energy sources or (temporal) subsidies for renewables. Additionally, reservations of stakeholders in the energy sector against this innovative approach must be dismantled.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating equity and social justice for indigenous peoples in undergraduate health professions education in Canada: a framework from a critical review of literature,"Understanding how to create structural change by actively counteracting racialized ways of interacting with Indigenous peoples at an individual and organizational level within health care systems and health professions education is essential for creating a more inclusive, equitable, and healthier society. In health professions education, the primary means of teaching about health inequities has been to frame them as stemming from culturally or ethnically based issues. While attention to culturally specific practices can be valuable to health and healing in some contexts, education that solely focuses on Indigenous cultures risks perpetuating cultural stereotypes and othering, rather than focusing on how Eurocentric systems continue to exert oppressive effects on Indigenous peoples. We present an organizational transformation framework grounded in equitable partnerships from a comprehensive critical review of the literature on the integration of equity and social justice in undergraduate health professions education with a focus on Indigenous health. We did a thematic analysis of the results and discussions presented in the 26 selected articles to identify promising practices and challenges associated with the integration of equity and social justice in undergraduate health professions education. The framework resulting from this analysis is composed of three interrelated components: 1) adopt critical pedagogical approaches that promote Indigenous epistemologies; 2) partner with Indigenous students, educators and communities; 3) engage educators in critical pedagogical approaches and health equity issues. This framework could guide the development of contextually tailored interventions that contribute to decolonizing health professions education.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating IPAT and CLUMondo Models to Assess the Impact of Carbon Peak on Land Use,"China's growth plans include a carbon emission peak policy, which is a restriction that indirectly impacts land use structure. In this study, we simulate different paths for achieving policy objectives, and explore the linkages between those paths and land use change. The IPAT model was used to simulate the carbon emissions generated from a natural development scenario, an ideal policy scenario, and a retributive carbon emission scenario in China from 2020 to 2030. The simulation results were incorporated into the CLUMondo model as a demand driver to simulate the land use change in 2030. The results show that carbon emission peak policy can somewhat reduce carbon emissions and increase building land in a regulated way. However, the policy may also lead to a short-term surge in carbon emissions, a reactive expansion of arable land and building land. This may reduce losses in economic development when carbon emissions are limited, but does not achieve the integration of social, economic, and ecological goals. This study links the carbon emission peak policy with land use change and provides a fresh perspective on the Chinese government's carbon reduction policy.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating machine and deep learning technologies in green buildings for enhanced energy efficiency and environmental sustainability,"A green building (GB) is a design idea that integrates environmentally conscious technology and sustainable procedures throughout the building's life cycle. However, because different green requirements and performances are integrated into the building design, the GB design procedure typically takes longer than conventional structures. Machine learning (ML) and other advanced artificial intelligence (AI), such as DL techniques, are frequently utilized to assist designers in completing their work more quickly and precisely. Therefore, this study aims to develop a GB design predictive model utilizing ML and DL techniques to optimize resource consumption, improve occupant comfort, and lessen the environmental effect of the built environment of the GB design process. A dataset ASHARE-884 is applied to the suggested models. An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is applied, which involves cleaning, sorting, and converting the category data into numerical values utilizing label encoding. In data preprocessing, the Z-Score normalization technique is applied to normalize the data. After data analysis and preprocessing, preprocessed data is used as input for Machine learning (ML) such as RF, DT, and Extreme GB, and Stacking and Deep Learning (DL) such as GNN, LSTM, and RNN techniques for green building design to enhance environmental sustainability by addressing different criteria of the GB design process. The performance of the proposed models is assessed using different evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.

Integration of environmental sustainability considerations within architectural programmes in higher education: A review of teaching and implementation approaches,"As education providers, universities play a pivotal role in developing and delivering quality education that contributes to the achievement of the ""2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development"" and the related ""Sustainable Development Goals"". Given the large impact of the built environment industry on global emissions and climate change, integrating environmental sustainability principles and architectural education is of paramount importance for the achievement of such targets.Through a systematic and comprehensive literature review, this article explores how and to what extent environmental sustainability considerations have been integrated within architecture curricula in tertiary edu-cation providers across North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, highlighting common approaches, future directions and areas that still need further development. Over 500 published refereed research outputs were analysed and 111 selected for inclusion and discussion in this article, with attention given to understanding course structures, pedagogy, relationship with design studios, types of assessment, teaching and learning technologies, and engagement of the wider architecture profession across undergraduate and graduate architecture programmes. 68% of the documents use case study methodologies to evaluate the impact of sus-tainability education, while theory only papers represent 15% of the total. Studies using a combination of theoretical discussions and applicative evidence are the 17% of the total. Among the case studies category, it is to be noted that the work done at course level (26%) almost equals that done at curriculum level (29%), signalling that attention has been paid to both the macro and micro scale. The research shows that more attention in the past was given to the 'what' (content and structure of courses and programmes), while more recent studies focus on the 'how' (pedagogies and implementation processes for teaching and curriculum development purposes).The latest works, on the other hand, start to be more focussed on assessing students' learning and increase active engagement, in an attempt to shape the profile of future graduates and make them ready to produce the substantial market transformation still needed to achieve environmental sustainability goals worldwide.",Not About Sufficiency
Interaction between sustainability practices and the mediating role of hotel performance,"The success of hotels and their contribution to the destination depends on the development of sustainability practices. The aim of this paper is to study possible interactions between environmental, economic and social sustainability practices with each other and with hotel performance. In these interactions, hotel performance is not considered as the final dependent variable. Hotel performance may play a mediating role as it may be considered as a consequence of environmental sustainability practices and as a means for economic and social sustainability practices. From a PLS analysis using data from 365 Spanish hotels, we find that environmental sustainability practices influence hotel performance and economic and social sustainability practices; hotel performance positively influences economic and social sustainability practices; and economic sustainability practices influence social sustainability practices. Moreover, hotel performance mediates the relationship between environmental sustainability practices and the other two dimensions of sustainability practices; and economic sustainability practices mediate the link between environmental and social sustainability practices. This study has theoretical and practical implications because it shows that environmental sustainability practices contribute to hotel performance, creating value for shareholders and owners; and environmental practices and the availability of financial resources contribute to the development of economic and social sustainability practices, also creating value for other stakeholders.",Not About Sufficiency
"Interactive influence of climate variability and land-use change on blue and green water resources: a case study from the Ganjiang River Basin, China","The response of blue and green water to climate and land-use change in the Ganjiang River Basin (GRB) is evaluated, via the SWAT model that combines three scenarios (the land-use/land-cover (LULC), climate change, and integrated climate and LULC change scenarios) in the 2040s (2031-2050) and 2060s (2051-2070). The results indicate that, for the GRB, cropland, woodland, and grassland show a decreasing trend, while build-up and water areas show an increasing trend in terms of future land-use change. The climatic conditions projected using NORESM1-M model data under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios suggest, respectively, increases in precipitation (31.17 and 27.24 mm), maximum temperature (2.25 and 2.69 degrees C), and minimum temperature (1.96 and 2.58 degrees C). Under climate change conditions, blue water is estimated to decrease by up to 16.89 and 21.4 mm under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, while green water is estimated to increase up to 19.14 and 20.22 mm, respectively. Under the LULC changes, blue water is projected to increase by up to 5.50 and 7.57 mm, while green water shows decreases of 4.05 and 7.80 mm for the LULC2035 and LULC2055 scenarios, respectively. Under the four combined LULC and climate change conditions (RCP4.5_2040s, RCP4.5_2060s, RCP8.5_2040s, and RCP8.5_2060s), blue water tends to decrease by 0.67, 7.47, 7.28, and 9.99 mm, while green water increases by 19.24, 20.8, 13.87, and 22.30 mm.

Intermediate-Scale Experimental Study to Improve Fundamental Understanding of Attenuation Capacity for Leaking CO2 in Heterogeneous Shallow Aquifers,"To assess the risks of Geologic Carbon Sequestration (GCS), it is crucial to understand the fundamental physicochemical processes that may occur if and when stored CO2 leaks upward from a deep storage reservoir into the shallow subsurface. Intermediate-scale experiments allow for improved understanding of the multiphase evolution processes that control CO2 migration behavior in the subsurface, because the boundary conditions, initial conditions, and porous media parameters can be better controlled and monitored in the laboratory than in field settings. For this study, a large experimental test bed was designed to mimic a cross section of a shallow aquifer with layered geologic heterogeneity. As water with aqueous CO2 was injected into the system to mimic a CO2-charged water leakage scenario, the spatiotemporal evolution of the multiphase CO2 plume was monitored. Similar experiments were performed with two different sand combinations to assess the relative effects of different types of geologic facies transitions on the CO2 evolution processes. Significant CO2 attenuation was observed in both scenarios, but by fundamentally different mechanisms. When the porous media layers had very different permeabilities, attenuation was caused by local accumulation (structural trapping) and slow redissolution of gas phase CO2. When the permeability difference between the layers was relatively small, on the other hand, gas phase continually evolved over widespread areas near the leading edge of the aqueous plume, which also attenuated CO2 migration. This improved process understanding will aid in the development of models that could be used for effective risk assessment and monitoring programs for GCS projects. Plain Language Summary Geologic carbon sequestration is a strategy that is currently being considered to help reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. This strategy involves injecting carbon dioxide deep underground in the hopes that it will safely stay there for long periods of time. However, the gas may eventually leak out of the storage location and travel back up toward the ground surface. If this happens, it could have negative effects on water resources, ecosystems, and human health. In order to better understand those potential risks, operators of carbon sequestration projects need to understand where the gas will go when it leaks. This study helped to improve that understanding and build predictive capability about carbon dioxide movement underground. Laboratory experiments were performed in a system that was designed to mimic an underground environment. Carbon dioxide was injected and sensors were used to measure where it went. Results showed that layers of different material slow down the movement of the gas.",Not About Sufficiency
Interpolating and Extrapolating Information from Periodic Forest Surveys for Annual Greenhouse Gas Reporting,"National forest inventories (NFIs) are an important source of data for reporting greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry sector as required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. A major limitation is that NFI resources are generally not sufficient for producing reliable information on year-to-year variation. Interpolation, extrapolation, smoothing, and/or aggregation of data from several years are therefore needed to comply with the reporting requirements for a specific year. Various methods for accomplishing this task are illustrated and evaluated based on data and experiences from the NFIs of six countries, concentrating on the estimation of the stem volume of living trees as a surrogate for tree biomass. Six main conclusions were drawn: (1) NFI data from the target years only were not sufficient for reliable estimation of annual stock change; (2) changes between whole inventory cycles (typically 5 years) could be estimated with reasonable precision; (3) simple moving average estimators of stock are problematic in the estimation of changes; (4) interpenetrating panel designs with permanent sample plots are desirable from the point of view of inter/extrapolating and change estimation; (5) data on annual growth variation and harvests are important and can be used directly in the default method, which is based on differences between increment and drain; and (6) time gaps between NFI surveys may lead to significant errors in the estimation of stock changes.

Inter-provincial trade driving energy consumption in China,"China's energy saving at the provincial level has important policy implications for the mitigation of the greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Therefore, this study uncovers the driving forces of the changes of the provincial energy consumption by distinguishing the domestic and interregional trade based on the MRIO-based SDA technique for the period of 1997-2011. We find that (1) final demand per capita was the top determinant of the increments in provincial energy consumption, while both energy intensity and production structure offset the provincial energy changes; (2) most of 30 provinces were outsourcers due to the close interprovincial linkages; (3) product flows from utility and raw materials of upstream resource-dependent provinces were supplied to the coastal provinces, which are the manufacturing hubs. This implies policy making for the reduction of provincial energy in China should simultaneously implement measures on production-side and consumption-side. This is even more important when considering the embodied energy due to the interprovincial linkages within China.",Not About Sufficiency

Introduction to emerging industrial applications of cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.),"The Italian Law of 22 November 2016 has legalized the cultivation of hemp, which drives the development of sustainable agriculture by generating new products with high added value in the new context of circular economy. Hemp cultivation is known for its low environmental impact, as hemp grows fast, suppresses weeds and does not need pesticides. It has no specialized parasites, favors pollination and improves the physical and chemical soil fertility. Recently, many countries have increased their interest in hemp (Cannabis Sativa L.), considering it as a climate-friendly crop that can mitigate climate change and desertification. For these reasons, hemp can be a new protagonist of Italian agriculture already oriented towards the objectives of EU 2030 which predicts 40% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990. The hemp cultivation can activate a new supply chain by allowing using different parts of the plant, benefiting farmers, environment, and human health. Indeed, although a very old plant, hemp will be one of the main protagonists of the green economy in the near future. Its seeds can be used by agri-food industry to produce flour, pasta, pastry and oil, while the stem through canapulo (woody part of stem) in green building sector.

The aim of this paper is to examine the patterns of inventive activity aimed at mitigating climate change in the maritime industry with respect to other transport modes. Appropriate research tools in the area of patent analysis were selected and utilised. A new class of patents related to climate change in maritime transport (CPC-Y02T70/00) was used as a data source. The original value of the study consists of offering a complete picture of the efforts made in patenting activity in climate change mitigation in the maritime transport, with a look at leading applicants and countries, knowledge flows, the most robustly developed and underdeveloped technical fields. A map of technical knowledge flows for climate change mitigation in transport was constructed. The research results show that inventions for the maritime industry are less hermetic than those for air and road transport; however, they are not as much linked with previously developed solutions. The most intensively developed technical fields include the design and construction of watercraft hulls (1) and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to the propulsion system (2). Among the technologies whose further development merits close attention are solutions related to electrical propulsion and wave energy. At the same time, inventive activity in the area of climate change adaptation dedicated to ports is insignificant and definitely needs more support from the community of scientists and inventors.

"Investigating spatio-temporal variations and contributing factors of land use-related carbon emissions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, China","The land use change is the primary factor in influencing the regional carbon emissions. Studying the effects of land use change on carbon emissions can provide supports for the development policies of carbon emission. Using land use and energy consumption data, this study measures carbon emissions from land use dynamics in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2000 to 2020. The standard deviation ellipse model is employed to investigate the distribution characteristics of the spatial patterns of carbon emissions, while the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model is used to examine the contributing factors of carbon emissions and their spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Results indicate a consistently increasing trend in carbon emissions from land use in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2000 to 2020. Construction land is characterized with both the primary source and an increasing intensity of carbon emissions. Besides, the spatial distribution of carbon emissions from land use in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region demonstrates an aggregation pattern from in the northeast-southwest direction towards the center, with a greater aggregation trend in the east-west direction compared to that in the south-north direction. During the study period, a positive correlation was documented between carbon emissions and factors including total population, economic development level, land use degree, and landscape patterns.

Investigation of the value-added potential of some selected freshwater cyanobacteria,"Ever growing population and environmental degradation lead to a rapid deterioration of global health, causing malnutrition and Ultra Violet radiation-induced skin damages to be more prevalent. It is critical to address these health issues quickly and sustainably. Compared to natural botanicals, cyanobacteria could be more promising due to their superior photosynthetic capabilities, rapid growth, low space and simple nutrients requirements, low capital investment, and zero environmental pollution. Therefore, this study explores the value-added potential of freshwater cyanobacteria in addressing the above health issues sustainably. Eight cyanobacteria strains, isolated from freshwater reservoirs in the dry zone of Sri Lanka were analyzed for total carbohydrate, protein, macro and micro minerals using Dubois' method, Lowry method, and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry. Mansur equation was applied to determine the Sun Protection Factor (SPF). Total carbohydrate and protein contents were in the range of 7.08 +/- 0.32% - 53.08 +/- 0.32% and 15.27 +/- 0.90% - 49.77 +/- 9.62%, respectively. Oscillatoriales had the highest total carbohydrate content (53.08 +/- 0.32%), higher than the carbohydrate content of other previously reported Oscillatoria species. Calcium and iron were the most abundant macro and micro minerals, respectively. Oscillatoriales recorded the highest SPF (1.57 +/- 0.002), whereas all the other strains had considerably greater or similar SPFs compared to other previously reported herbal extracts.

It was identified that the 100-year global warming potential for producing 1 m(3) of biogas under Egypt's conditions amounts to 2.72 kg CO(2)eq., while its total environmental footprint was 160.1 mPt. The main contributor was the operational phase (89.1%), while the construction phase had a much smaller contribution (10.9%). The main environmental hotspots were identified as the manure required to drive the process, closely followed by biogas leakages and intentional releases. By minimizing biogas losses, the system's environmental sustainability largely improves (similar to 60% reduction) and could be on the same level with the one of larger biogas units operating in developing countries. Furthermore, it was identified that the digester volume plays an overall small role in the system's environmental performance; however, oversized digesters grossly affect the environmental sustainability, due to the large amounts of biogas intentional releases. Finally, the use of digestate as a biofertilizer appears to be environmentally sustainable (similar to 38% reduction of total environmental footprint). Taken together, the results obtained in this study provide substantial information for policy- and decision-making on renewable energy development in rural Egypt and beyond. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Is biodiversity energy-limited or unbounded? A test in fossil and modern bivalves,"The quantity of biomass in an ecosystem is constrained by energy availability. It is less clear, however, how energy availability constrains taxonomic and functional diversity. Competing models suggest biodiversity is either resource-limited or far from any bound. We test the hypothesis that functional diversity in marine bivalve communities is constrained by energy availability, measured as particulate organic carbon (POC) flux, in the modern oceans. We find that POC flux predicts the relative prevalence of ecological modes in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Moreover, the associations of ecological modes with POC fluxes are similar between the Atlantic and Pacific despite being based on independent sets of species, indicating a direct causal relationship. We then use the relationship between POC flux and the prevalence of functional groups in the modern to test the hypothesis that the trend of increasing functional diversity in bivalves across the past 500 Myr has occurred in response to increased POC flux. We find no evidence that the earliest-appearing modes of life are preferentially associated with low-POC environments or that the mean POC flux experienced by marine bivalves has increased across geological time. To reconcile the close association between ecological mode and POC flux in the modern oceans with the lack of evidence for increasing POC fluxes across time, we propose that POC flux has not increased substantially over time but, rather, the increase in bivalve functional diversity enabled bivalves to become more abundant, to occupy a broader range of environments, and to capture a greater fraction of the total POC flux. The results here suggest at the geographic scale of oceans and through geologic time bivalve diversity was not bounded by food availability.",Not About Sufficiency
Is it Too Late for Growth?,"The planet is on a path to catastrophic warming which calls for structural changes in the operation of Global North economies, not merely a transformation of energy sources, the core of ""green growth"" approaches. Our research on inequality and working time shows that these are powerful drivers of carbon emissions that can be the center of a progressive agenda supplementing energy transition. Our work also shows that disproportionality in emissions sources presents a policy opportunity. We challenge Pollin's view that only growth-centric approaches are politically viable, and argue that progressive politics has moved from growth-centricity to needs- and people-centered policies. In our response, we argue that the recent rise of the Green New Deal is a strong piece of evidence for our position.",Not About Sufficiency
Is plant evolutionary history impacting recruitment of diazotrophs and nifH expression in the rhizosphere?,"Plant evolutionary history influences the taxonomic composition of the root-associated bacterial community, but whether it can also modulate its functioning is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that crop diversification is a significant factor determining the ecology of the functional group of nitrogen-fixing bacteria the rhizosphere of Poaceae. A greenhouse experiment was carried out using a range of Poaceae, i.e. four Zea mays varieties (from two genetic groups) and teosinte (representing maize's ancestor), sorghum (from the same Panicoideae subfamily), and wheat (from neighboring Pooideae subfamily), as well as the dicot tomato as external reference. Diazotroph rhizosphere community was characterized at 21 days in terms of size (quantitative PCR of nifH genes), composition (T-RFLP and partial sequencing of nifH alleles) and functioning (quantitative RT-PCR, T-RFLP and partial sequencing of nifH transcripts). Plant species and varieties had a significant effect on diazotroph community size and the number of nifH transcripts per root system. Contrarily to expectations, however, there was no relation between Poaceae evolutionary history and the size, diversity or expression of the rhizosphere diazotroph community. These results suggest a constant selection of this functional group through evolution for optimization of nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere.",Not About Sufficiency
IT impact on talent management and operational environmental sustainability,"We examine the impact of information technology (IT) on talent management and operational environmental sustainability and propose a model in which IT infrastructure capability enables the firm's operational environmental sustainability through talent management. We test the proposed model using the structural equation modeling technique with an innovative secondary data set collected for a sample of 63 large Spanish firms. We find that a firm's proficiency in leveraging IT infrastructure improves the management of talent, which in turn enables execution of a more environmentally sustainable operations strategy to increase firm performance. This paper has three key contributions. First, as the first study of talent management in the context of IT and environmental sustainability, it provides a better understanding of the concept of talent management. We explain theoretically and test empirically how IT infrastructure capability influences operational environmental sustainability through talent management. Second, since we find that IT infrastructure capability increases firm performance through talent management and operational environmental sustainability, our research also improves knowledge of how IT infrastructure capability influences firm performance. Finally, this study advances theoretical conceptualization of operational capabilities, and the relationships between IT infrastructure capability and dynamic and operational capabilities.",Not About Sufficiency
Causal analysis of Canada's environment-growth nexus for inclusive development metrics,"Little is known about the relevance of alternative measures of growth in environmental and developmental economic analyses. In Canada, for example, no literature exists on whether there is a causal link between the level of environmental performance and alternative measures of economic progress (which are argued to better capture the overall economic wellbeing than the gross domestic product-GDP). As environmental policies may relate to overall economic wellbeing, we opine that understanding overall economic progress is essential for achieving sustainable development and emissions reduction targets. This paper addresses a knowledge gap by assessing the causal links and directions between Canada's national-level greenhouse gas emissions (GHG-as an indicator of environmental performance) and three alternative measures of economic growth, namely, gross national disposable income (GNDI), human development index (HDI), and index of economic freedom (IEF); from 1995 to 2019. Our results indicate that causality exists between Canada's GHG and the alternative growth measures. This implies that Canada's GNDI, HDI, and IEF may be useful and complementary to GDP in forecasting the national-level total GHG emissions. The research provides insights to further consider the role of overall economic wellbeing in the quest for sustainable, lower-emissions, economic development in Canada and by extension in other nations.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the effectiveness of direct injection for ocean carbon sequestration under the influence of climate change,"This paper studies the effect of climate change on simulated efficiency of carbon injection at different locations and ocean depths using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, ISAM- 2.5D. Following the OCMIP carbon sequestration protocol, we carried out a series of carbon injection simulations. The ISAM results show that warming over the next 500 years under the IPCC S650 and WRE1000 stabilization scenarios could change the ocean circulation and thereby increases the residence time of CO2 disposed into the deep ocean, particularly for Atlantic injection. However, the warming does not have a significant effect on carbon injections into the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where circulation change is small. This new finding contrasts with previous OGCM results.",Not About Sufficiency
A comparative assessment of Composite Environmental Sustainability Index for emerging economies: a multidimensional approach,"PurposeThe present study aims to construct and compare Composite Environmental Sustainability Index (CESI) for 20 emerging countries for the period 1990-2020.Design/methodology/approachThe study constructs CESI using the principal component analysis (PCA). Furthermore, for the preparation of index weights, varimax rotation is used to get component loadings.FindingsThe study finds that the overall CESI values lies between 2 and 4.8 for the 20 emerging countries considered in the study. This study depicts a diverse picture of environmental sustainability among emerging countries. The study also shows the trend of CESI values from 1990 to 2020. The bottom three countries whose CESI is very low compared to others are Iran, South Africa and Saudi Arabia.

"Top managers' environmental values, leadership, and stakeholder engagement in promoting environmental sustainability in the restaurant industry","This study examines the role of top managers' values and leadership in advancing environmental sustainability. It also investigates the effects of stakeholder engagement on restaurants' environmental sustainability and assesses the impact of related practices on restaurant performance. A web-based survey was administered to collect data from top-level restaurant managers in the United States. The sample was selected from panels recruited by a research company specializing in panel surveys. Invitation emails were sent to 2500 managers and 240 responses were returned, 218 of which were retained for final analysis (response rate: 8.7%). Structural equation modeling was used for testing hypothetical relationships among key constructs in the proposed research model: environmental values, leadership, stakeholder engagement, environmental sustainability, and restaurant performance. Findings confirmed the significant role of top management values and leadership in advancing environmental commitment. The results also demonstrated the strong impact of stakeholder engagement on restaurants' commitment to environmental sustainability. Finally, they indicated the positive influence of restaurants' environmental sustainability performance on both financial and nonfinancial performance. The study presents a theoretical framework, integrating theories or models from extant literature, and contributes to an enhanced understanding of restaurants' environmental sustainability. The findings suggest several practical implications for managers in the restaurant industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Salicylic acid in plant salinity stress signalling and tolerance,"Soil salinity is one of the major environmental stresses affecting crop production worldwide, costing over $27Bln per year in lost opportunities to agricultural sector and making improved salinity tolerance of crops a critical step for sustainable food production. Salicylic acid (SA) is a signalling molecule known to participate in defence responses against variety of environmental stresses including salinity. However, the specific knowledge on how SA signalling propagates and promotes salt tolerance in plants remains largely unknown. This review focuses on the role of SA in regulation of ion transport processes during salt stress. In doing this, we briefly summarise a current knowledge on SA biosynthesis and metabolism, and then discuss molecular and physiological mechanisms mediating SA intracellular and long distance transport. We then discuss mechanisms of SA sensing and interaction with other plant hormones and signalling molecules such as ROS, and how this signalling affects activity of sodium and potassium transporters during salt stress. We argue that NPR1-mediated SA signalling is pivotal for (1) controlling Na+ entry into roots and the subsequent long-distance transport into shoots, (2) enhancing H+-ATPase activity in roots, (3) preventing stress-induced K+ leakage from roots via depolarisation-activated potassium outward-rectifying channel (KOR) and ROS-activated non-selective cation channels, and (4) increasing K+ concentration in shoots during salt stress. Future work should focus on how SA can regulate Na+ exclusion and sequestration mechanisms in plants.",Not About Sufficiency
The Roles of Mental Construal Level Theory in the Promotion of University Students' Pro-environmental Behaviors,"Although green technological innovation is designed to combat climate change, recent research suggests that increased attention to technological innovations might decrease climate change risk perception and reduce pro-environmental behaviors due to the feeling of being assured, which is referred to as risk compensation behavior. Although there has been a growing interest in reducing the risk compensation effect related to climate change, the academic literature in this area is very limited. In this study, we propose a psychological intervention to mitigate a sample of university students' (N = 1,500) irrational response to green technological innovation so as to promote their pro-environmental behaviors. Our experiments identify students' mental construal level as an important psychological factor that, when combined with a proper message framing strategy of introducing new green technologies, can remedy their irrational response to new green technologies. Our findings suggest that highlighting the new technology as playing a preventive/promotional role related to climate change can mitigate risk compensation behavior and eventually promote students' pro-environmental behaviors when they are at a high/low mental construal level.",Not About Sufficiency
Analog Circuit Design Knowledge Mining: Discovering Topological Similarities and Uncovering Design Reasoning Strategies,"Mining engineering metaknowledge from electronic documents is important in devising new design solutions for emerging applications as well as in identifying new business opportunities. Continuously and comprehensively reviewing and assessing the entire technical literature to find the most relevant ideas and solutions is cumbersome as engineering innovations are constantly being proposed. In particular, high performance analog circuit design has been at the forefront of technological innovations given their importance in applications, like telecommunications, mobile applications, and health care. This paper proposes a model and mining techniques for representing analog circuit design metaknowledge. The metaknowledge representation includes three components: an associative component presenting the conceptual hierarchy of the considered circuits, a component expressing the performance capabilities (e.g., trade-offs and bottlenecks) of the circuits, and a causal modeling part describing the more likely starting ideas and design plans used to create a circuit. Knowledge structures can be used to tackle new applications, identify opportunities to improve existing circuits, and validate design correctness.

Wrens on the edge: feeders predict Carolina wren Thryothorus ludovicianus abundance at the northern edge of their range,"The marked range shifts seen with global warming suggest that ranges are limited by temperature. Other findings, however, suggest winter survival is directly tied to food availability. We studied Carolina wrens Thryothorus ludovicianus at the northern edge of their range to understand the roles of temperature and food in limiting this species. We established 21 transects over 3 habitats (residential, city park, and rural) with varying degrees of human influence on temperature and food supply. The three habitat types showed variations in wren density, temperature, and feeder presence. While wren densities showed similar seasonal patterns in all habitats, significantly higher densities of birds were observed in the city park and residential habitats. Post-winter densities of Carolina wrens were predicted by the presence of bird feeders, and not by January mean minimum temperatures. Our findings suggest the winter range limits for endotherms is more directly related to food supply, and only indirectly related to temperature. Therefore supplemental feeding and other changes in food supply may modify the range shifts predicted from temperature changes alone.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the influence of lean manufacturing and total quality management practices on environmental sustainability: the moderating role of quality culture,"PurposeOrganizations have released the importance of lean manufacturing practices (LMPs) and total quality management (TQM) in enhancing competitiveness. However, the implementation of LMPs and TQM becomes more complex when discerning the environmental sustainability position. The complexity stems from the fact that LMPs and TQM are more intricate because of cultural differences. Thus, this study aims to tackle the aforementioned phenomenon by investigating the impact of LMPs and TQM on environmental sustainability moderated by quality culture. Design/methodology/approachA survey was distributed among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Jordan; thus, 315 valid responses were received. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used to analyze the data and test hypotheses. FindingsThe findings showed that environmental sustainability was significantly impacted by all the LMP practices except Kanban and all the TQM practices except statistical process control. Moreover, quality culture significantly and negatively moderated the relationship between TQM and environmental sustainability. However, the influence of LMPs on environmental sustainability was not significantly moderated by quality culture. Practical implicationsThis study has implications for policymakers in SMEs, supply chain managers and academics regarding the importance of LMPs and TQM systems for implementing environmental sustainability and the role of quality culture. Social implicationsThis study provides guidelines for decision-makers on the pathways that enable them to sustain the environment to safeguard the natural ecosystem and natural resources for upcoming generations.

Just Transition for China's Coal Regions Towards Carbon Neutrality Targets,"China has pledged to peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. A crucial aspect of this commitment involves transitioning from coal-dependent activities primarily concentrated in certain regions pivotal to local economies, employment, and livelihoods. High-quality development necessitates identifying just transition strategies for these coal-intensive regions, ensuring inclusive benefits from the energy transition. These regions exhibit disparities in economic and industrial growth, with many low-income mining communities and inadequate public services. This calls for comprehensive policy interventions in economic, energy, societal, and environmental domains. This study aims to delineate just transition strategies for China's coal regions, considering their unique challenges and circumstances. Initially, this article reviews the evolution of ""just transition"" as a concept and its policy implications. Subsequently, it explores China's approach to achieving carbon neutrality through the lens of just transition, delving into the local economy's reliance on coal-related industries and the impact on employment. Following a clear delineation of the vision for just transition in China, the analysis focuses on identifying principles and pathways for transition.

Does Land Use Age Influence Carbon Cycling in the Tibetan Plateau?,"Although substantial information had been generated on the effects of land use change on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) storage, studies are absent on multifactorial effects of land use types, land use age, and elevation on SOC and TN storage. SOC and TN were therefore investigated in 30 field sites comprising natural forests, planted forests, shrub, and grasslands. SOC and TN stocks differed and correlated significantly with land use age; the C stocks correlates significantly with land use change compared the TN stocks. However, there was no relation between the C and N stocks with elevation, implying that SOC and TN are solely dependent on land use age. SOC sequestration potentials of the sampled ecosystems were 345.86, 293.19, 266.45, and 251.23 t ha(-1) for the natural forests, planted forests, shrub, and grasslands with total mean value of 289.18 t.ha(-1) (1,060.42 t.ha(-1) CO(2-)eq). A significant SOC stock loss (17.96%, 29.80%, and 37.66%) occurred in converting natural forests to planted forests, shrub, and grasslands, whereas gains (27.36%, 14.31%, and 5.71%) would occur in reconverting grassland to natural forests, planted forests, and shrublands. Therefore, the C that was lost during deforestation and conversion of natural forests into other land use types could not match the carbon gains thereafter. Our results suggest that land use change and land use age have influenced soil C and N stocks. Moreover, natural forests are better in ecological conservation and restoration of degraded lands. This study provides baseline information for C and N management in ecologically restored and degraded lands.",Not About Sufficiency

"Effect of High-Occupancy Toll Lanes on Mass Vehicle Emissions Application to 1-85 in Atlanta, Georgia","High-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes were recently proposed for 1-85 in Atlanta, Georgia, as a way to relieve congestion and to provide a reliable commute time for single-occupant drivers who are willing to pay a toll. It is important to evaluate the air quality impacts of such a proposal in the context of environmental regulations, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and transportation conformity regulations. Several factors affect mass vehicle emissions, such as vehicle activity, speed, age distributions, and class distributions. These factors are incorporated into a base scenario that models the current conditions on 1-85 with high-occupancy vehicle lanes by using data collected in the corridor during the summer of 2007, and a future scenario that models the implementation of HOT lanes on this corridor by using information from cities that already have HOT lanes. The MOBILE-Matrix modeling tool, recently developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology, is used for the emissions analysis by means of the input factors described above. It calculates mass emissions for five pollutants: hydrocarbons (HQ, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m or smaller (PM2.5), and PM10 (with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 mu m or smaller) as a function of fleet composition and on-road operating conditions. The modeling work predicts extremely small increases in mass emissions for NOx, CO, PM2.5, and PM10, and an extremely small decrease in mass emissions for HC. In addition, the postimplementation emissions changes fall well within the motor vehicle emissions budgets for the facility that are used in air quality planning. Therefore, implementation of HOT lanes on 1-85 in Atlanta should not violate the emissions budget requirements of the federal Transportation Conformity Rule. For NEPA purposes, this analysis could be used to make the case that air quality impacts are not significant, and therefore further detailed analyses are not required.",Not About Sufficiency

Theories propounded by various authors were used to form the theoretical framework of the study while keeping those theories relevant to the Indian context. The study uses structural equation modelling to empirically test proposed hypothesis and research model of the relationships. Findings - The results indicated that MO has a positive influence on marketing capabilities, including product development, communication, channel linking and pricing. The study also found, albeit with exceptions, a positive association between marketing capabilities and sustainable innovation. These exceptions were communication capability on technical innovations and channel linking capability on nontechnical innovations. In addition, findings reveal that marketing capabilities fully mediate MO to performance link while sustainable consumption partially mediates the relation between sustainable innovation and competitive advantage. Competitive advantage also partially mediates marketing capabilities to performance relationship. Research limitations/implications - This study deals with four marketing capabilities only and uses cross-sectional data, instead of longitudinal data, that comprises data of 192 service firms in India. Originality/value - The study sets forth empirical evidence for the argument that specific marketing capabilities lead to sustainable innovation.

Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Acetylated Cellulose Nanofiber-Reinforced Polylactic Acid Based on Scale-Up from Lab-Scale Experiments,"This study deals with the possible range of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (LC-GHG) from acetylated cellulose nanofiber-reinforced polylactic acid (AcCNF/PLA) production processes, considering future scaling-up, process improvement, and variations in their process modeling and simulation. The chemical and mechanical processes required for breaking down aggregated natural cellulose into nanofibers and kneading as cellulose nanofiber-reinforced plastic are under development in lab or pilot scale; to assess future environmental performance, we estimated process inventories in future possible industrial processes for prospective life cycle assessment. It was found that both the pulp acetylation process and the mechanical kneading process makes up a large percentage of LC-GHG from AcCNF/PLA production and can be reduced by process improvement in industrialization. Acetic anhydride consumption is dominant in pulp acetylation LC-GHG and can be significantly reduced by installing and optimizing distillation columns for the recovery of excess acetic anhydride and byproduct acetic acid. Power consumption in the mechanical kneading process can also be reduced by increasing the production rate up to industrial scale.",Not About Sufficiency
"Utilization of biochar as a green additive in supersulfated cement: Properties, mechanisms, and environmental impacts","To promote the green development of building materials, this study develops a novel and sustainable method for incorporating coconut-derived biochar (BC) in supersulfated cement (SSC). Moreover, the solid waste desulfurized gypsum is used as a sulfate activator. The macroscopic experimental results show that the addition of 2 % biochar can reduce the fluidity of composites by 12.5 % but increase the 28-day compressive and flexural strength by 10.3 % and 19.1 %, respectively. Hydration heat analysis show that biochar can increase the maximum heat release of SSC. XRD patterns and TGA analysis indicate that 2 % biochar can improve the hydration degree of cement where the bound water content is increased by 8.9 %. SEM observations and 1H NMR spectrum suggest that although biochar can compact the microstructure, it increases the harmful and multiple harmful pores ratio. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis considering greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, cost, fluidity, and mechanical properties is performed to evaluate the BC-SSC composites. The results prove that BC-modified SSC has significantly lower environmental pollution and resource consumption than ordinary Portland cement, but the cost may be increased.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy consumption and economic growth revisited: Does the size of unrecorded economy matter?,"We analyze the long-run relationship between energy consumption and real gross domestic product (GDP) in Turkey taking into account the size of unrecorded economy. Since in developing countries, mainly due to the unrecorded economic activities, the official GDP is not measured correctly, the investigation of the linkage between energy consumption and official GDP may not give reliable results. In this study, empirical results for the case of Turkey over the period 1970-2005 suggest that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between the officially calculated GDP and energy consumption. Besides, using the error-correction modeling technique, we find out that unidirectional causality runs from official GDP to energy in both short and long runs. However, when we take into account unrecorded economy, we detect neither cointegration nor causality between energy consumption and true GDR These empirical findings imply that: first, energy conservation policies can be implemented in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without any adverse effect on the recorded economic activities: second the production function in the unrecorded economy is not stable. Furthermore, economic policies to combat unrecorded economy may not serve as a complement to energy conservation policies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency

Understanding the Role of Financial Literacy in Enhancing Economic Stability and Resilience in Montenegro: A Data-Driven Approach,"Financial literacy has emerged as a crucial factor in promoting economic stability and resilience, particularly in Montenegro. With the increasing complexity of financial products and the growing need for individuals to make sound financial decisions, the importance of financial literacy cannot be overstated. This study employs a quantitative, survey-based approach to explore the association between financial literacy levels and measures of economic stability, including savings rates, active debt management, and access to financial products. Data were collected through a representative, two-stage stratified sample of 1000 Montenegrin adults aged 18-79, ensuring comprehensive geographic coverage across all Montenegrin municipalities and balanced representation by gender and age. This stratification enables a detailed analysis of financial literacy trends across the population. Correlation analysis reveals that higher levels of financial literacy are associated with better financial practices, such as increased savings and responsible credit use, thereby enhancing economic resilience at the household level. Moreover, improved financial literacy contributes to sustainability by fostering long-term financial stability, reducing inequalities, and promoting inclusive economic growth. The findings suggest that financial literacy can mitigate the impact of economic shocks, emphasizing the need for policies that promote financial education as a tool for sustainable development. This study contributes to the literature on financial literacy in emerging economies and offers actionable insights for policymakers in Montenegro and similar contexts, highlighting financial education as a pathway to individual and national economic resilience.",Not About Sufficiency

Leveraging Buyers' Interest in ESG Investments through Sustainability Awareness,"Currently, organizations often take into consideration the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles by following a more inclusive approach together with potential other emerging practices that attract more consumers who have particular affiliations with the environment. This study investigates the influence of social and environmental sustainability awareness practices on impulse buying through a proposed set of hypotheses. The hypothetical model is based on (441) valid responses from Omani buyers via an online research survey. Data were processed using CFA and SEM techniques. Results indicate that social and environmental sustainability awareness has a productive relationship with green trust that strengthens impulse buying. Environmental sustainability awareness positively links with green altruism, which further enhances the impulse. By taking gender as a moderator, it has an encouraging impact on social and environmental sustainability awareness. Environmental sustainability awareness and green altruism have a constructive relationship within males rather than females. Based on the unique connection between sustainability practices and impulse buying, the current study's results indicate that if firms take appropriate steps to implement sustainability practices in their operations, sustainability commitment can promote the environmental and social well-being of consumers and the establishment of trust. Such practices enable companies to achieve their sustainability reporting goals and SDGs. Social and environmental sustainability practices protect from the harmful effects of social and environmental influences in mitigating the uncertainty of consumers' buying behavior. Such productive sustainability practices compel buyers to purchase products impulsively at premium prices. The study strongly recommends policymakers and marketers focusing on environmental and social sustainability awareness and green altruism.",Not About Sufficiency

Examining the health and wellness of solo self-employed workers through narratives of precarity: a qualitative study,"BackgroundIn recent decades, there has been a significant transformation in the world of work that is characterized by a shift from traditional manufacturing and managerial capitalism, which offered stable full-time employment, to new forms of entrepreneurial capitalism. This new paradigm involves various forms of insecure, contingent, and non-standard work arrangements. Within this context, there has been a noticeable rise in Self-Employed individuals, exhibiting a wide range of -working arrangements. Despite numerous investigations into the factors driving individuals towards Self-Employment and the associated uncertainties and insecurities impacting their lives and job prospects, studies have specifically delved into the connection between the precarious identity of Self-Employed workers and their overall health and well-being. This exploratory study drew on a 'precarity' lens to make contributions to knowledge about Self-Employed workers, aiming to explore how their vulnerable social position might have detrimental effects on their health and well-being.MethodsDrawing on in-depth interviews with 24 solo Self-Employed people in Ontario (January - July 2021), narrative thematic analysis was conducted based on participants' narratives of their work experiences. The dataset was analyzed with the support of NVIVO qualitative data analysis software to elicit narratives and themes.FindingsThe findings showed that people opt into Self-Employment because they prefer flexibility and autonomy in their working life. However, moving forward, in the guise of flexibility, they encounter a life of precarity, in terms of job unsustainability, uncertainties, insecurities, unstable working hours and income, and exclusion from social benefits. As a result, the health and well-being of Self-Employed workers are adversely affected by anger, anomie, and anxiety, bringing forward potential risks for a growing population.Conclusion and implicationsNeoliberalism fabricates a 'precariat' Self-Employed class. This is a social position that is vague, volatile, and contingent, that foreshadows potential threats of the health and wellbeing of a growing population in the changing workforce. The findings in this research facilitate some policy implications and practices at the federal or provincial government level to better support the health and wellbeing of SE'd workers.",Not About Sufficiency
The use of nitrous oxide 'cracking' technology in the labour ward: a case report and patient account,"Nitrous oxide is a common choice of labour analgesia in many countries. However, its use is associated with significant cost to the environment as well as potential risks of long-term occupational exposure. Our hospital is one of a small number of healthcare providers in the United Kingdom trialling technology which catalytically destroys ('cracks') nitrous oxide to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and occupational exposure. When used in the setting of inhaled analgesia, cracking technology relies on capturing the patient's exhaled breath via a facemask or mouthpiece, a technique which requires some user skill and may be challenging for patients. In this report, we present the case of a primiparous 35-year-old consultant anaesthetist, who used nitrous oxide cracking technology with inhaled nitrous oxide analgesia (via a facemask) during labour. We present the patient's experiences and discuss the implications of using such technology on ambient nitrous oxide levels in the delivery room. Notably, despite this patient's professional expertise and familiarity with facemask use, nitrous oxide remained detectable throughout her labour, although generally at low levels. This illustrates that whilst this technology has the potential to reduce ambient nitrous oxide levels, its efficacy may vary depending on how it is used, with implications for patient education and support.",Not About Sufficiency
Public Value of Marine Biodiesel Technology Development in South Korea,"Biodiesel (BD) is often regarded as a carbon-neutral fuel. Many countries are investing resources in biodiesel technology development to respond to the need to improve energy sustainability and the threat of climate change. Since 2009, the South Korean Government has invested a considerable amount of money in developing marine BD (MBD) technology that converts carbon dioxide into diesel using marine microalgae cultivated in large quantities with the help of waste heat from nuclear power plants and/or coal-fired power plants. If the development is successful, 4800 tons of MBD a year, approximately 1820 cars fully fueled annually, will be produced from 2019. Furthermore, the South Korean Government is expected to continue to invest in MBD to improve the market share after 2019. Quantitative information about the public value of MBD technology development is widely demanded by the Government. This study aims to investigate the public value of MBD technology, the attributes of which it considers to be the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the mitigation of air pollutant emissions, new job creation, and the improvement of energy security. A choice experiment (CE) survey of 600 people was conducted during July 2016. The trade-offs among the attributes and the price were evaluated in the survey. The CE data were examined through a multinomial logit model. The marginal values for a 1%p reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, 1%p mitigation of air pollutant emissions, the creation of 100 new jobs, and an improvement of energy security caused by MBD technology development are computed to be KRW 1082.7 (USD 0.9), 918.1 (0.8), and 258.3 (0.2) per household per month, respectively.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysis of Major Bacteria and Diversity of Surface Soil to Discover Biomarkers Related to Soil Health,"The discovery of biomarkers for assessing soil health requires the exploration of organisms that can explain the core functions of soil and identification of species with major roles in these functions. However, identifying specific keystone markers within the soil microbiota is challenging. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based molecular-biological methods have revealed information on soil biodiversity; however, whether this biodiversity is related to soil health remains unclear. In this study, we performed NGS on grassland surface soil to compare the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genetic diversity to determine the chemical soil quality and examined markers associated with soil health. Microorganisms associated with the nitrogen cycle, bioremediation, plant pathogenicity, antibiotic production, and material degradation showed potential for use as markers. To propose a framework for soil health assessment, we not only used traditional indicators, such as chemical and physical measures, but also assessed metagenomics data of soil by land use to identify the major factors influencing the microbial structure in soil. Moreover, major keystone species were identified. Furthermore, the microbial genetic diversity of generally healthy surface soil, such as forests, farmland, and parks, was determined. These findings provide basic data for exploring soil health-related biomarkers.",Not About Sufficiency
Changes in the health of metal-contaminated soil before and after stabilization and solidification,"Stabilization is popularly employed to remediate metal-contaminated soils. It involves the absorption and precipitation of heavy metals to reduce their solubility, movement characteristics, or risk and toxicity. This study aimed to conduct a soil health assessment to determine changes in the health of metal-contaminated soil before and after the application of five stabilizers (acid mine drainage sludge (AMDS), coal mine drainage sludge (CMDS), steel slag, lime, and cement). Soil health assessment, including three soil functions, namely soil productivity, soil stability, and soil biodiversity, evaluated the physical, chemical, and biological indicators (total 16 indicators). Soil health index (SHI) of soil function was calculated by multiplying each indicator score by the weighting factor of each indicator. Total SHI was obtained by summing the three soil-function SHI. Total SHI of the stabilized and test soils followed the order as control soil (1.90) > heavy metal-contaminated soil (1.55) > CMDS-stabilized soil (1.29) > steel slag-stabilized soil (1.29) > AMDS-stabilized soil (1.26) > cement-stabilized soil (0.74) > lime-stabilized soil (0.67). Total SHI of the initial heavy metal-contaminated soil was evaluated as 'normal', before the stabilizer was applied; however, most of the stabilized soils became 'bad' after application of the stabilizers. Furthermore, soils stabilized by cement and lime showed very poor soil health. The results implied that changes in physical and chemical soil properties occurred due to the disturbance caused by the mixing of stabilizers, and ions eluted from the stabilizers could deteriorate soil health further. The findings indicated that soil treated with stabilizers is not suitable for agricultural purposes. Overall, the study suggested that stabilized soil from metal-contaminated sites should be covered with clean soil or monitored for some time before deciding its future agricultural use.",Not About Sufficiency
Querying heteronormativity among transnational Pasifika teenagers in New Zealand: An Oceanic approach to language and masculinity,"This study aims to contribute to emerging dialogues on language, sexuality and gender, focusing on the performance and subversion of gender and sexual normativities in a New Zealand sexuality education classroom. In terms of theory, the aim is to focus on New Zealand's outlying, unsettled 'global Southern' status. It also aims to heuristically separate New Zealand from the global North to explore local relationships between sexuality and gender that might otherwise be imperceptible in the glare of globalisation. In two critical incidents, transnational Pasifika boys use language to perform what appears to be sexual fluidity and sexual objectification of the self. A transformation occurs in which a local version of hegemonic masculinity is countered, and the analytical purchase of the concept of heteronormativity becomes questionable in this context. Existing Southern theories from Oceania provide a possible pathway to better understanding the sociolinguistics of gender and sexuality in New Zealand and in the world at large.",Not About Sufficiency

Intergenerational education mobility in India: nonlinearity and the Great Gatsby Curve,"Introduction Intergenerational education mobility, which reflects the degree to which an individual's educational attainment is independent of their parents' education, is essential for promoting equal opportunities in society. In the context of India, where socio-economic disparities are deeply entrenched, understanding the dynamics of intergenerational mobility is particularly crucial.Methods This paper examines various aspects of intergenerational education mobility in India using data from the Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS), a nationally representative multi-topic survey. We analyze intergenerational mobility across different age cohorts and investigate the nonlinearities in the transmission of education. Additionally, we explore the impact of educational inequality, economic growth, and public expenditure on education on mobility outcomes.Results Our analysis reveals a high degree of intergenerational persistence in education, although this persistence has decreased over time. Employing quantile regressions, we observe significant nonlinearities in the relationship between fathers' and sons' educational outcomes across the educational distribution. In particular, we find a widening mobility gap between historically advantaged subgroups (urban populations, upper castes, Hindus) and disadvantaged groups (rural populations, lower castes, Muslims) at the middle and upper quantiles. Moreover, we confirm the ""Higher Inequality leading to Lesser Mobility"" nexus, supporting the 'Great Gatsby Curve' within the Indian context. Macroeconomic factors, such as economic growth and public expenditure on education, are positively correlated with educational mobility, suggesting that these factors play a critical role in enhancing mobility.Discussion These findings highlight the importance of targeted policy interventions to reduce educational disparities and promote greater intergenerational mobility. The widening mobility gaps between socio-economic and demographic groups emphasize the need for more equitable resource distribution and educational reforms. Future research should explore the multifaceted aspects of intergenerational mobility, incorporating longitudinal studies and regional analyses to deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.",Not About Sufficiency
Modeling Regional Transportation Demand in China and the Impacts of a National Carbon Policy,"China's climate and energy policy commitment are stated at the national level, but they may have uneven impacts on the country's regionally heterogeneous transport system. This work quantifies the expected provincial-level response of freight transport to an economywide policy targeting reductions in carbon emissions intensity. The analysis applies the China Regional Energy Model, a multisector, static, global, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model representing 30 individual provinces with physical accounts of energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The structure of road and nonroad freight (and passenger) sectors, the preparation of transport activity data, and a policy similar to announced goals that specify a 17% reduction in the carbon dioxide emissions intensity of gross domestic product are described. In the national aggregate and in most provinces, the road freight sector is most affected by the emissions intensity cap. The road freight sector contributes 24% versus 18% from nonroad freight and 51% from nontransport sectors of a 5.1% reduction in national refined oil demand. Significant regional differences are found in the impacts of a national-level, economywide policy. Steep reductions in freight activity occur in some of the poorest provinces, partly because they offer low-cost abatement opportunities, and the resulting adjustments across the economy affect transport demand. This research contributes a new tool capable of capturing the transport impact of sector- and province-specific policies in detail and providing a rigorous foundation for future dynamic CGE analyses. Potential impacts of energy and climate policy on regional transport systems are important inputs to policy and infrastructure investment decisions at the central and local levels.",Not About Sufficiency
Knowledge sharing: an innovative organizational approach to engage volunteers,"Purpose A profound managerial transformation approach is increasingly designed to unleash the energy and creativity of employees. The purpose of this paper is to observe as the organizations in this sector can use the knowledge sharing to derive maximum efficiency from such crucial volunteers, creating an environment suitable for stimulating the psychological well-being that is the basis of engagement. Design/methodology/approach This exploratory study proposes a model to account the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to exchange knowledge related to factors that stimulate volunteer's engagement. Findings The results of a survey of 301 volunteers operating in European organizations indicate that influencers of volunteers in a specific domain activated by knowledge sharing can act as sources of creation and can reinforce their identity, sense of belonging and trust in the organization. Research limitations/implications Despite results cannot be generalized because of the samples of convenience, exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the elements for which nonprofit organizations should activate a knowledge-sharing strategy so that engaged volunteers feel like cocreators of values and therefore act as true competitive assets.

"Occurrence of forever chemicals in Chennai waters, India","Background Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are considered 'contaminants of emerging concern' due to their environmental persistence, bio-accumulative potential, and adverse effects on human health. They are widely employed in producing various goods used in daily life, such as non-stick cookware, cleaning agents, and many industrial applications in aerospace, automotive, construction, electronics, and military, all of which ultimately end up in different environmental matrices. India's rapid economic growth necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its PFAS contamination levels and potential human and ecological exposure. Results The present study reports the quantification of one long-chain and two short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids and three long-chain and two short-chain perfluorosulfonic acids and qualitative analysis using suspect screening in the waters of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Samples were collected from surface and groundwater sources, including the Adyar river, Buckingham canal, Chembarambakkam lake, and the water treatment plant. The concentrations analyzed in all the samples ranged from 0.10 ng/L to 136.27 ng/L. Groundwater had some of the highest concentrations of PFAS. L-PFBS (up to 136.27 ng/L) and PFOA (up to 77.61 ng/L) are present in all the samples. The concentrations of all the target PFAS increased in the 5 to 103% range in the final treated water compared to the raw water of the water treatment plant. This treated water is distributed as a source of drinking water for the residents of Chennai. Additionally, the dominance of short-chain compounds (4-7 carbons) over long-chain compounds (> 7 carbons) was observed. Suspect screening revealed numerous precursors and other fluorinated compounds abundantly present in the samples. Conclusions Our study revealed PFAS levels up to 136.27 ng/L in both surface and groundwater samples from Chennai. These findings raise concerns about potential risks to ecosystems and human well-being. The dominance of short-chain PFAS coupled with abundant precursors and unidentified fluorinated compounds indicates an ongoing shift toward alternatives. Conventional water treatment is ineffective in eliminating these chemicals from the water system; rather, increasing the PFAS concentrations from raw water to treated water necessitates advanced polishing steps. Industrial emissions, untreated domestic wastewater discharge, and open dump sites have been suspected as the significant sources of contamination, highlighting the need for further investigation to fully assess the extent of PFAS contamination in Chennai.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating Experts' Perceptions on Regional Competitiveness Based on the Ten Key Factors of Assessment,"In the contemporary landscape, the foundation of competitive advantage lies in sustainability, particularly within the context of regional competitiveness. This topic explores the impact of sustainability on regional competitiveness. In this study, we assessed experts' opinions on the impact of the main ten key factors of evaluation on regional competitiveness, namely the economy, labor market, poverty and social inclusion, health, education, environmental and energy considerations, transport infrastructure, science and technology, high-tech industries, and innovation. The study aims to understand how these factors influence regional competitiveness. A sample of 93 experts participated in a questionnaire survey through the Google platform from October to December 2023. This methodology was chosen to gather diverse expert opinions efficiently. The collected data were analyzed with statistical tools, combining cross and chi-square tests. Statistical analysis methods such as cross and chi-square tests were employed to analyze the collected data. Our findings indicate that experts recognize the economy (up to a positive level of 69.1%), the labor market (up to 64.7%), and the health infrastructure (up to 52.9%) as the main impact factors on regional competitiveness. Collective efforts and improvements in these factors are essential to alleviate poverty and social exclusion (up to 50.8%). Investments in education (up to 41.9%) and technological science and the digital society (up to 39.2%) are considered key after the main factors to promoting prosperity and competitiveness. Following them, there is a growing call for creating a greener, healthier, and more sustainable future, reflected in the focus on environmental and energy issues (up to 36.7%) and toward transport developments (up to 35.7%). At the bottom of the list are high-tech industry (up to 32.5%) and the innovation factor (up to 28.2%). These factor groups are highlighted as critical aspects for promoting prosperity and addressing social challenges in the region. The findings underscore the multifactorial nature of regional competitiveness, emphasizing both the important and less critical factors. It becomes apparent that the interpretation of regional competitiveness requires a comprehensive analysis of multiple factors, each contributing differently to overall competitiveness.

"Analysis of kinetics, mechanism, thermodynamic properties and product distribution for pyrolysis of Ni-Fe impregnated coconut husk","This study explored on pyrolytic thermal degradation of coconut husk (CH), treated with Ni-Fe electroplating wastewater and Ni-Fe synthetic water, for bioenergy generation. Initially, green coconut husk absorbed solutions resembling electroplating effluent and synthetic Ni-Fe at 105 degrees C. Physiochemical properties of the husk and ICP-MS analysis of water were thoroughly examined before TG/DTG analysis. The impact of catalysts on pyrolysis was assessed through TG/DTG measurement, the obtained results were utilized to study the kinetics and thermodynamic parameters using the iso-conversional approaches (FWO, KAS, Starink) and Criado plots were used to discuss the reaction mechanism. Metal impregnated biomass with wastewater (MICHw) found to have high activation energy compared to that of metal impregnated with synthetic water (MICHs). For MICHw, average activation energies were calculated as 132.22, 151.37, and 149.78 kJ/molefegurefff for FWO, KAS, Starink, respectively, however, for MICHs the values were 114.79, 114.03.71, and 114.75 kJ/mol. The potential energy barrier (6-10 kJ/mol) between activation energy and reaction enthalpy showed a favourable environment for product development. Various experiments on native green coconut husk (NGCH) and impregnated coconut husk under different conditions showed a higher liquid oil yield for MICHw, attributed to the Ni-Fe catalyst at 650 degrees C and smaller particle sizes.

Fertility in Russia: A Re-Examination Using Microdata,"This paper employs the microdata of the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS-HSE) to discuss the impact of economic factors, such as household income and female wages, and subjective well-being, such as life satisfaction and health condition, on childbirth probability in Russia, which, following a continuous decline in birth rate throughout the 1990s, began to increase in the 2000s, and rose thereafter almost continuously. The following results were obtained: higher household incomes serve to encourage childbirth, while female wages are seen to act by curtailing childbirth, and when indicators such as life satisfaction and health condition are high, the likelihood of childbirth is increased significantly. Most previous research concerning the determinants of the birth rate in Russia has shown that household income has no effect at all, but the findings in this paper suggest that this may have been due to the special circumstances that existed at the beginning of the economic transformation period in the 1990s.",Not About Sufficiency
A study on development of recycled cement made from waste cementitious powder,"With the goal of achieving sustainable development, many studies have been performed on approaches to reducing environmental load and cutting construction-related waste and greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, this study aims to reduce carbon emissions and preserve the fixed materials such as limestone by utilizing the presumably high value-added cementitious powder of waste concrete, which is not currently being recycled. First, the chemical properties of cementitious powder were analyzed to manufacture recycled carbonic cement by deriving the optimal mix proportion of the materials using the industrial byproduct (former slag) and limestone as a property adjustment. To make a clinkering evaluation, Free CaO measurement, an XRD analysis, a thermal analysis, a compressive strength test and a flowability analysis were performed. Through this series of analyses, overall properties were found to be at 80% those of OPC or better. In addition, when using the cementitious powder as a substitute for limestone, it was discovered that the carbon emissions were reduced by up to 46%. However, as the amount of fine aggregate that was not separated from the cementitious powder due to its similar grain size and shape increased, the plasticity and the reduction in carbon emissions were radically decreased. Moreover, when the fine aggregate was mixed in the proportion of more than 30%, it is believed to be hardly materialized. Therefore, an effective separation technology of cementitious powder from fine aggregate should be researched and developed in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Effect of feedstock particle size distribution and feedstock moisture content on pellet production efficiency, pellet quality, transport and combustion emissions","This study evaluates the possibility of reducing drying costs by screening large particles prior to drying and pelletizing them with the dried medium size and fine particles. Four feedstocks with different shares of fibers (> 3.15 mm) and fines (< 1 mm) were conditioned at 12 and 24% water content (wc). Bulk density, durability, length and water sorption behavior of the pellets were evaluated. Transport costs, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission equivalents were calculated. The combustion behavior was correlated to the particle size distribution of the feedstock. The 24%(wc) feedstock pellets (P-24) showed a low durability (<(x)over bar> = 79%). The P24 with the highest share of large particles showed the highest durability ((x) over bar = 89%). Large particles caused pellets with high durability and fines caused pellets with low durability. All P-12 had lower transport costs, lower energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to the P-24, because their bulk density was higher (619 kg x m(-3) and 362 kg x m(-3), respectively). The combustion parameters of the P-12 were affected by the feedstock particle size distribution. The Fpsd with the highest share of particles in the range of 3.15-6.30 mm showed the highest durability ((x) over bar = 98.5%) and the lowest CO emissions ((x) over bar = 280 mg/m(3)). The calculated costs for a combined screening/drying process were lower than the costs for conventional drying. A new production concept is proposed: Large particles can be screened before drying and can be mixed with the dried medium/small size particles for pelletization.",Not About Sufficiency
MODELING DISTORTIONARY ASPECTS OF THE UNITED-STATES WHEAT PROGRAM AND POLICY REFORM,"Evaluation of U.S. agricultural policy reform is complicated by the interaction of price support programs and production constraints. Researchers have typically presumed that price support policies within the U.S. wheat program increase the producer incentive at the margin, however, little work has been done to determine whether such a presumption is warranted by the data. The results of this research indicate that price support, conditioned on production constraint, has not increased U.S. production. Furthermore. the combined effect of price support and production control within a voluntary system is shown to increase U.S. supply response with respect to market price.

"Land Use Conflicts Identification and Multi-Scenario Simulation in Mountain Cities, Southwest China: A Coupled Structural and Functional Perspective","Land use conflicts (LUCs) arise during land use change, causing an uncoordinated spatial structure of the land and negatively affecting the synergistic development of multifunctionality, especially in mountain cities. Previous studies have focused on identifying and measuring land use structural conflicts (LUSC), with less attention paid to land use functional conflicts (LUFC), and a lack of simulation for future multi-scenarios. Thus, taking Chongqing as an example, based on the perspective of LUSC-LUFC coupling, this study constructed a comprehensive conflict index to identify and assess LUCs, then applied the PLUS model to predict LUCs under three development scenarios in 2030. This study found that (1) there was a significant positive spatial association between LUSC and LUFC, with high-high agglomeration types in areas of severe LUCs and low-low agglomeration types in areas of light LUCs. (2) During 2000-2020, the LUCs in Chongqing displayed a trend of upward and then downward from 2000 to 2020, with significant agglomeration in their spatial pattern. (3) Two typical areas of LUCs intensification were identified, namely the topographic transition zone located in the Daba and Wuling mountains and the urban-rural interface in the Chongqing metropolitan area. (4) In 2030, the LUCs in Chongqing manifest an overall mitigation in the ecological protection (EP) scenario, while displaying an intensification in the natural development (ND) and economic development (ED) scenarios. Based on the types of spatial interaction between LUSC and LUFC, land use optimization strategies were formulated.

Land use projections in China under global socioeconomic and emission scenarios: Utilizing a scenario-based land-use change assessment framework,"Land-use changes under the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) have been analyzed globally, but how regional and national land use respond to the global mitigation policies is seldom explored, which poses difficulties in regional environmental adaptation and decision-making. China, as a major food consuming and biofuel production country, would suffer great uncertainties in future land-use dynamics under the global scenarios. Here, we present a scenario-based land-use change assessment framework, integrating Global Change Assessment Model and Future Land Use Simulation Model, to evaluate the potential land use projections of China from 2010 to 2100. Eight scenarios with different combinations of SSPs and radiative forcing targets of RCPs are designed, to analyze the impacts of the global socioeconomic and emission assumptions on regional mitigations and land-use changes. We recalibrated the historical land use data and urban dynamics of China to improve the consistency of modeling results with the actual regional changes. Meanwhile, differences in land use dynamics are demonstrated by spatial downscaling, which are jointly affected by the global assumptions and local driving factors, showing a fierce competition between the crop and forest. We find that the regional crop changes are sensitive to the socioeconomic dynamics as well as the bioenergy production, while different carbon regimes drive the forest changes in unexpected ways. Besides, overall heterogeneous landscape patterns and similar spatial suitability maps are found in distributions of land-use change between the emission and socioeconomic scenarios. The results indicate that this framework embedded with the consideration of anthropogenic managements as well as the detailed interactions of local environments provides an effective way to investigate regional land use response to a range of alternative future pathways.",Not About Sufficiency
Landscape factors affecting territory occupancy and breeding success of Egyptian Vultures on the Balkan Peninsula,"Avian scavengers are declining throughout the world, and are affected by a large number of threats such as poisoning, electrocution, collision with man-made structures, direct persecution, changes in agricultural practices, landscape composition, and sanitary regulations that can reduce food availability. To formulate effective conservation strategies, it is important to quantify which of these factors has the greatest influence on demographic parameters such as territory occupancy and breeding success, and whether quantitative models can be transferred across geographic regions and political boundaries. We collated territory and nest monitoring data of the endangered Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus in the Balkans to understand the relative influence of various factors on population declines. We monitored occupancy in 87 different territories and breeding performance of 405 territory-monitoring years between 2003 and 2015, with an overall territory occupancy rate of 69% and a mean productivity of 0.80 fledglings per occupied territory. We examined which of 48 different environmental variables were most influential in explaining variation in territory occupancy and breeding success in Bulgaria and Greece, and tested whether these models were transferrable to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Territory occupancy and breeding success were affected by a wide range of environmental variables, each of which had a small effect that may not be the same across political boundaries. Both models had reasonably good discriminative ability [area under the receiver-operated characteristic curve (AUC) for territory occupancy = 0.871, AUC for breeding success = 0.744], but were unsuccessful in predicting occupancy or breeding success in the external validation data set from a different country, possibly because the most influential factors vary geographically. Management focussing on a small number of environmental variables is unlikely to be effective in slowing the decline of Egyptian Vultures on the Balkan Peninsula. We recommend that in the short term the reduction of adult mortality through the enforcement of anti-poison laws, and in the long term the adoption of large-scale landscape conservation programs that retain or restore historical small-scale farming practices may benefit vultures and other biodiversity.",Not About Sufficiency

Design and analysis of a low-carbon lignite/biomass-to-jet fuel demonstration project,"Biomass-derived synthetic jet fuel with low net greenhouse gas emissions can help decarbonize aviation. Demonstration projects are required to show technical feasibility and give confidence to investors in large commercial-scale deployments. Most previous literature focuses on assessing future commercial-scale systems, for which performance and costs will differ considerably from demonstration projects. Here, a detailed analysis is presented for a first-of-a-kind demonstration plant that would be built in the Southeastern US. The plant, which cogasifies biomass and lignite and captures CO2 prior to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, was designed and simulated using Aspen Plus. The process heat recovery system was designed using a systematic optimization method. Lifecycle analysis was used to assess net greenhouse gas emissions. Capital and operating cost estimates were developed in collaboration with a major engineering firm. The plant produces 1252 barrels per day (80% jet fuel), exports 15 MWe (net), and has a net energy efficiency of 35.8% (lower heating value). Captured CO2 (1326 t/d) is sold for use in enhanced oil recovery. With biomass coming from sustainably-managed pine plantations, net lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are well below those for petroleum jet fuel. The estimated range of capital required to build the plant is 3875-5762 $/kW(th) of feedstock input (2015$). As expected for a small demonstration designed to minimize technological risks, subsidies are required for the jet fuel product to compete with petroleum jet fuel. Technology innovations, learning via construction and operating experience, and larger plant scales will improve the economics of future commercial plants.",Not About Sufficiency
Latin@s and Social Movements in the Obama Years,"Although the social movement that crossed race, class, sexuality and gender lines before 2008 was exemplary, there is now another type of social movement that has emerged. This movement, led by conservative right wing groups, has been stirring racial divisions by using the economic crisis to scapegoat immigrants. At the same time, the promises of the Obama Administration have not been kept. Instead, under this administration's immigration policies close to one million deportations have occurred nationally, the implementation of a Secure Communities program has led to arbitrary arrests for minor offenses and violated the due process rights of both citizens and noncitizens, and an existing program of employee immigration-status verification has led to as many as 19,000 people that have been mistakenly identified as being deportable. The ingredients of a social movement are still visible but the strategies have shifted to local organizing efforts that, in California, have resulted in legislation supporting: cities opting out of E-Verify, the right of AB540 students to attend college with financial aid, the right of people without a driver's license to stop the impounding of their cars, and the establishment of a pilot program designed to protect undocumented workers who pay state income taxes. This paper focuses on these various trends and the prospects for future systemic change.",Not About Sufficiency
Psychological predictors of eco-driving: A longitudinal study,"Eco-driving has well-known positive effects on fuel economy and greenhouse-gas emissions. Moreover, eco-driving reduces road-traffic noise, which is a serious threat to the health and well-being of many people. We investigated the psychological predictors of the adoption of eco-driving from the perspective of road-traffic noise abatement. The data came from 890 car drivers who participated in a longitudinal survey over four months. Specifically, we tested the effects of the intention to prevent road-traffic noise, variables derived from the theory of planned behavior (social norm, perceived behavioral control, and attitude), and variables derived from the health action process approach (implementation intention, maintenance self-efficacy, and action control) on the intention to practice eco-driving and on eco-driving behavior. The intention to prevent road-traffic noise was not linked to the intention to practice eco-driving. The strongest predictors of the intention to practice eco-driving were attitude and perceived behavioral control. The strongest predictor of eco-driving behavior was action control. The link between behavioral intention and behavior was weak, indicating that drivers have difficulties putting their intention to practice eco-driving into action. Therefore, intervention efforts should directly address and support the transition from intention to behavior. This could be accomplished by providing reminders, which help to maintain behavioral intention, and by providing behavior feedback, which helps car drivers to monitor their behavior.

Rhodolith mobility potential from seasonal and extreme waves,"Rhodolith beds can contribute large amounts of CaCO3 to coastal environments, playing an important role in Carbon sequestration. The spatial distribution of rhodoliths is a consequence of their sensitivity to light intensity, currents, wave action, sedimentation rates, and salinity, whereas mesophotic, low sedimentation quiescent conditions are optimal. Although there is evidence of a clear relationship between hydrodynamics and rhodolith morphology and mobility, there are few studies relating wave action and rhodolith mobility. We aim to assess the mobility potential by waves, of the rhodoliths of the Abrolhos Shelf (Brazil), that contains the largest rhodolith field in the world. Based on the local wave climate and its propagation through the shelf, the rhodolith mobility potential was evaluated. Rhodolith mobility potential distribution is directly related to shelf morphology and incoming waves characteristics. Despite being restricted to deeper areas of the shelf (>20 m), rhodoliths in the area are mobilized by wave action, especially from the more energetic waves associated with storms. Waves can mobilize rhodoliths in the area, with mobility potential distribution being controlled by shelf morphology and seasonal wave climate. Largest areas of mobilization are observed during energetic waves conditions associated to the passage of cold fronts.",Not About Sufficiency
"Open area and road density as land use indicators of young offender residential locations at the small-area level: A case study in Ontario, Canada","This research explores associations between land use types and young offender residential location in the Regional Municipality of York, Ontario, Canada, at a small-area level. Employing a Bayesian spatial modelling approach, we found that after controlling for socio-economic risk factors, proportion of open area land use was positively associated, and road density negatively associated, with residential location of young offenders. Map decomposition, which visualises the contribution of each risk factor to total young offender risk, demonstrated that open area land use contributed more risk in rural areas than urban, and that road density contributed less risk in urban areas than rural. We propose explanations for these results focused on social disorganisation theory and accessibility to structured leisure activities and apply findings to inform law enforcement and land use planning. Results provide a criminological perspective not often considered in planning and urban studies research and contrast land use policies generally motivated by public health and the environment.",Not About Sufficiency
Is neighborhood satisfaction related to density perception? Promoting liveable and sustainable land use planning,"While sustainable land use planning ensures land preservation through urban compactness, liveable residential environments are commonly associated with low density levels. Analyzing the relationships between density and neighborhood satisfaction (as a measure for liveability) may therefore help urban planners to offer sustainable infill projects that also guarantee liveability for the residents. Objective or subjective measures of density can be proposed. While the literature considering objective density is plentiful, the empirical work analyzing the relationships between density perception and neighborhood satisfaction is surprisingly scarce. In this study, we use a 2015 online survey in the Loire-Atlantique Departement in France that provided 1,134 questionnaires, which we analyzed using a discrete choice experiment. We find that neighborhood satisfaction has no relationship to the perceived density of the built environment by individuals. What matters is peacefulness as another type of neighborhood perception.

"Coastal Cities and Regions in a Changing Climate: Economic Impacts, Risks and Vulnerabilities","This review examines recent literature on economic impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation to climate change in coastal cities and regions of the developed world. Major areas of focus within this body of literature include study of the economic impacts of extreme events, examination of the economic consequences of sea level rise, and investigation of the multiple factors that influence economic vulnerability and resilience. Despite blossoming interest in the local and regional economic dimensions of climate change, the majority of work on this topic is focused on coastal cities and regions in the Global North. This work is also largely conducted outside the field of economic geography in disciplines that include natural hazards, economics, planning, and human dimensions of global environmental change, among others. While these studies have made important contributions to knowledge about how climate change may affect developed coastal cities and regions, there is substantial room for new engagement by economic geographers. In addition to a clear need for more work on the Global South, areas where economic geographers seem especially well-positioned to contribute include comprehensive assessments of coastal economic impacts which incorporate both market and non-market measures, investigation of the effects of climate change on patterns of growth and spatial inequality across coastal and related inland areas, and development of new theoretical understandings of how changing environmental baselines may influence regional economic growth and decline.",Not About Sufficiency
Regime destabilization in energy transitions: The German debate on the future of coal,"Greenhouse gas emissions are stagnating in Germany despite increasing deployment of renewable energy. This makes the government's Energiewende appear inconsistent and has triggered a discussion on phasing-out coal. The focus has thus turned from niche technology development to the destabilization of the existing high-carbon regime. In this paper we investigate stakeholders' framings and their perceptions of different policy options to advance the understanding of regime destabilization processes and theory-building in the context of the multilevel perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions. We find that actors still form coalitions with traditional allies and cling to established lines of reasoning, although there are indications for a beginning disintegration of the status quo-defending coalition. In their framings, core actors emphasize risks and threats. This confirms that regime destabilization is particularly conflictual and shows that for actors pushing regime change it is more difficult to offer a positive story. Linking policies for phasing-out incumbent technologies to accompanying measures for managing structural change in affected regions may facilitate compromise. The results moreover point to a tension between national and supranational action as a core issue in destabilization debates. Our insights are relevant for countries in similar transition phases and may inform future comparative research.",Not About Sufficiency
Lessons learnt from a sectoral analysis of greenhouse gas mitigation potential in the Balkans,"Balkan countries in the process of joining the European Union shall adopt greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and implement appropriate mitigation policies and measures. This paper presents a simplified methodological framework based on marginal abatement cost curves for estimating the technical and economic mitigation potential at sectoral level (buildings and road transport) in selected Balkan countries. The results of the analysis provide to decision makers useful information regarding the availability of background data, the potential for setting ambitious mitigation targets, and detailed tools for assisting the selection of policies and measures to meet these targets. The analysis performed shows that a significant part of the greenhouse gas emissions abatement potential can be achieved through win-win measures. The incorporation of environmental externalities associated with these interventions, estimated through benefits transfer, further improves the economic performance of these measures, especially in the buildings sector. Moreover, the implementation of these measures is shown to result in positive macroeconomic effects through increases in GDP (gross domestic product) and creation of new jobs. Finally, the rebound effect may restrict the estimated greenhouse gas emission reductions in the buildings of the countries examined due to the low energy performance of the existing building stock.

Animal-fat investigation and combustion test,"The department was commissioned to investigate the possibilities for animal-fat combustion in industrial steam generators operating originally on fuel-oil or natural gas. There are two main reasons for operating generators on animal fat as a fuel: On one hand, this material is considered as hazardous waste, thus an important goal is its environmentally benign elimination or disposal. On the other hand, fat is an excellent energy source and can be used as combustion fuel. This way fossil fuel usage can be saved while environmental regulations can also be met. The usage of animal fat as a fuel for furnaces required classification according to fuel classification rules, and comparison with the properties of fuel oil. In addition, its pollutant content was determined and the effects on the combustion process and emission were investigated. Finally the savings in fossil fuel energy consumption and related CO(2) emission achieved were determined. The first stage involved the determination of the composition of animal fat. Subsequently other properties such as viscosity and flash point variation were investigated. These data were compared to the properties of fuel oil. The theoretical investigations of animal-fat classification were promising. Initially one steam generator, originally designed for fuel oil combustion, was modified and fitted with a parallel animal fat fuel supply system. The results of the test were encouraging, although there were some problems with power regulation and later with fuel supply. A rotary cup type burner was then fitted to the boiler. Using this system, all the requirements including environmental regulations were met.",Not About Sufficiency
From molecule to cell: the expanding frontiers of plant immunity,"In recent years, the field of plant immunity has witnessed remarkable breakthroughs. During the coevolution between plants and pathogens, plants have developed a wealth of intricate defense mechanisms to safeguard their survival. Newly identified immune receptors have added unexpected complexity to the surface and intracellular sensor networks, enriching our understanding of the ongoing plant-pathogen interplay. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms of resistosome shapes our understanding of these mysterious molecules in plant immunity. Moreover, technological innovations are expanding the horizon of the plant-pathogen battlefield into spatial and temporal scales. While the development provides new opportunities for untangling the complex realm of plant immunity, challenges remain in uncovering plant immunity across spatiotemporal dimensions from both molecular and cellular levels.

From acceptance to continuance: Understanding the influence of initial participation experience on residents' intentions to continue participation in neighborhood rehabilitation,"In the context of increasing focus on social sustainability, neighborhood rehabilitation has emerged as a crucial component of global urban renewal initiatives. Distinct from most renewal paradigms that are usually one-offs, neighborhood rehabilitation is a long-term endeavor that requires ongoing resident participation to effectively address diverse needs, investment shortages, and governance challenges. Extant research predominantly focuses on residents' initial engagement, leaving the dynamics of continued participation and its influencing factors largely unexamined. Employing the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM), this study explores how residents' initial participation experiences influence their intentions to continue participation. Analyzing questionnaire responses from 367 experienced residents in Wuhan, China, the study finds that a mere 38.2 % of residents exhibit re-engage intention. Path analysis shows that initial participation experience influences residents' reengage intention indirectly through participation satisfaction and perceived usefulness. Residents' re-engage intention is most influenced by level of influence residents hold in decision-making, followed by type of activities they engage in, and stage of their initial involvement. As an exploratory study into the realm of continued participation, this research uncovers several potential pathways and policy recommendations, aiming to ease residents' transition from initial acceptance to sustained engagement in future neighborhood development efforts.",Not About Sufficiency
Does environmental disturbance also influence within-stream beta diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages in tropical streams?,"Riparian deforestation is a major threat to the ecological integrity of streams and aquatic biodiversity, influencing microhabitat availability and susceptibility to disturbances. Here we tested if riparian deforestation of tropical streams influenced beta diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages, by comparing indices that weighted differentially rare and dominant taxa, and testing if nestedness in community composition increased in deforested streams. Within-stream beta diversity was higher in deforested than forested streams, mainly due to taxon loss and higher dominance. In disturbed streams, higher sedimentation in pool mesohabitats resulted in larger differences in community composition, whereas mesohabitats in forested streams were more stable.",Not About Sufficiency
Life Cycle Analysis of an Alternative to the Haber-Bosch Process: Non-Renewable Energy Usage and Global Warming Potential of Liquid Ammonia from Cyanobacteria,"The production of ammonia via the Haber-Bosch process consumes large amounts of fossil fuels and releases large amounts of greenhouse gases. Ammonia has many important applications including fertilizer for crops and for microalgae-derived biofuel systems. Aquatic cyanobacteria fix nitrogen from the air and have been mass-cultured for many uses. This study analyzes, on a life cycle basis, a process to culture the cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. ATCC 33047, in open ponds; harvest the biomass and exopolysaccharides and convert these to biogas; strip and convert the ammonia from the biogas residue to ammonium sulfate; dry the ammonium sulfate solution to ammonium sulfate crystals; transport the ammonium sulfate and convert it to liquid ammonia and concentrated sulfuric acid. When compared to the ammonia produced via the Haber-Bosch process, savings of about 1.0 x 10(5) MJ of non-renewable energy and 3100 kg CO2 equivalent of global warming potential per 1000 kg of liquid ammonia might be possible. The results are robust and are not sensitive to the model parameters. The proposed system, if implemented, might have a significant impact on many important global issues such as global warming, fossil fuel depletion, and food security.

Life cycle assessment of electricity generation from bagasse in Mauritius,"This paper presents the findings of a life cycle assessment (LCA) of electricity generated from the combustion of sugar cane bagasse in Mauritian sugar mills. The study arose from the identification of the need for to provide data for the development of an LCA profile for the electricity mix in Mauritius. The system is limited geographically to the island of Mauritius and is intended to be the representative of current agricultural techniques practiced and current manufacturing processes used by Mauritian sugar mills. The unit operations that make up the system are the growing and harvesting of sugar cane, the transport of the harvested cane to sugar mills, the production of bagasse as a by-product from the sugar milling process, and the combustion of bagasse to generate heat and electricity. The functional unit of the study is the generation of I GWh of electricity exported to the national electricity grid. The characterised data for I GWh of bagasse-derived electricity were compared with data for I GWh of coal-derived electricity, using the same set of characterisation factors. The results of this comparison indicate that bagasse-derived electricity performs well in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions, acidification, and non-renewable energy inputs, but performs poorly in relation to water consumption and eutrophication.

"Life cycle assessment for municipal solid waste management: a case study from Ahvaz, Iran","This study assessed the available status of waste management system in Ahvaz and its impact on the environment, as well as seven other scenarios in order to quantitatively calculate potential environmental impacts by utilizing the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. These scenarios were as follows: scenario 1: landfilling without biogas collection; scenario 2: landfilling with biogas collection; scenario 3: composting and landfilling without biogas collection; scenario 4: recycling and composting; scenario 5: composting and incineration; scenario 6: anaerobic digestion, recycling, and landfilling; scenario 7: anaerobic digestion and incineration. Emissions were calculated by the integrated waste management (IWM) model and classified into five impact categories: resource consumption, global warming, acidification potential, photochemical oxidation, and eco-toxicity. In terms of resource consumption and the depletion of non-renewable resources, the third scenario showed the worst performance due to its lack of any recycling, energy recovery, and conversion to energy. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions and the effect on global warming, scenario 1 and scenario 2 showed that disposing the whole amount of waste resulted in the most amount of greenhouse gases produced. Moreover, 50% gas and energy recovery from landfills, in comparison with the non-recovery method, reduced the index of global warming by 12%. Finally, scenarios which were based on producing energy from waste showed a reasonably positive performance in terms of greenhouse gases emissions and the influence on global warming.",Not About Sufficiency
Life cycle assessment of stone buildings in the Taihang mountains of Hebei province: Evolution towards cleaner production and operation,"The building sector has gained significant attention due to its remarkably high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In China's rural areas, stone is a popular building material, but there are unprece-dented demands to improve the life-cycle performance of stone buildings. It is essential to preserve the original architectural features while evolving towards a cleaner production and operation. This study implements a field survey in the Taihang Mountains of Hebei province. The improvement of stone extraction methods and the evolution of three stone wall styles are collected and developed. Thermal transmittances of three stone walls are measured and modeled. A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment is conducted, and the results are compared to show their environmental performance in the embodiment and operation phases. Their life cycle inventories, including stone extraction, are developed. One representative building style sample is developed for the cooling and heating energy requirement simulation in the DesignBuilder. Based on the inventories, conducting life cycle impact assessment shows various environmental profiles in their whole life cycles. From the outcomes, the stone cladding wall (SCW) outperforms the other stone walls in both the embodiment and operation phases. However, its relatively high cost is a challenge for an individual house owner. This study proves the SCW is more sus-tainable, providing a basis for the choice of stone wall style in the future construction.",Not About Sufficiency
Life Cycle Assessment of a Gas Turbine Installation,"Gas turbine installations (GTIs) are widely used to generate electrical and thermal energy, mainly by burning gaseous fuels. With the development of hydrogen energy technology, a current area of particular interest is the use of GTIs to burn hydrogen. In order to assess the prospects of using GTIs in this way, it is necessary to understand the carbon emissions of gas turbines within the larger context of the entire hydrogen life cycle and its carbon footprint. The article provides an overview of results from previously published studies on life cycle assessment (LCA) of complex technical devices associated with the production and consumption of fuel and energy, which are most similar to GTIs when it comes to the complexity of LCA. The subject of analysis was a set of GTIs located in Russia with a capacity of 16 MW. An assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per MWh of electricity produced showed that at different stages of the GTI life cycle, the total carbon footprint was 198.1-604.3 kg CO2-eq., of which more than 99% came from GTI operation. Greenhouse gas emissions from the production and end-of-life management stages are significantly lower for GTIs compared to those for other complex technical devices used to generate electricity.

Life cycle comparison of industrial-scale lithium-ion battery recycling and mining supply chains,"Recycling lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) can supplement critical materials and improve the environmental sustainability of LIB supply chains. In this work, environmental impacts (greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, energy consumption) of industrial-scale production of battery-grade cathode materials from end-of-life LIBs are compared to those of conventional mining supply chains. Converting mixed-stream LIBs into battery-grade materials reduces environmental impacts by at least 58%. Recycling batteries to mixed metal products instead of discrete salts further reduces environmental impacts. Electricity consumption is identified as the principal contributor to all LIB recycling environmental impacts, and different electricity sources can change greenhouse gas emissions up to five times. Supply chain steps that precede refinement (material extraction and transport) contribute marginally to the environmental impacts of circular LIB supply chains (<4%), but are more significant in conventional supply chains (30%). This analysis provides insights for advancing sustainable LIB supply chains, and informs optimization of industrial-scale environmental impacts for emerging battery recycling efforts.",Not About Sufficiency
"Life cycle greenhouse gases, energy and cost assessment of automobiles using magnesium from Chinese Pidgeon process","Magnesium (Mg) has a great potential to reduce vehicle weight, fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. The Chinese Mg industry has developed rapidly since the 1990s. The output of Mg reached 700,000 tons in 2006, accounting for more than 70% of global Mg production. Most of Mg is produced in China through the Pidgeon process that has an intensive energy usage and generates a large amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which may offset the potential advantage of using Mg parts in automobiles. It is critical to quantify the energy usage and GHG emissions through entire life cycle when the Mg are applied to automobiles. It is also essential to evaluate cost implications of the Mg parts application in automobiles and ensure it to be cost competitive. The objectives of this study are (1) Build a life cycle inventory (LCI) of Mg produced by Pidgeon process; (2) Establish an LCA model that can evaluate GHG emissions and energy usage for the Mg automotive application; (3) Estimate the cost implications of the Mg parts application in automobiles. An Mg LCI was built based on interviews and surveys and the GREET model was adapt for this study. The results indicated that, for each kilogram of Mg produced by Pidgeon process, GHG emissions and energy usage would be 27 kg CO(2)eq and 280 MJ, which are five times higher than steel production. Replacing steel with 82 kg Mg on a base automobile would lower curb weight by 5.7%, but only reduce life cycle GHG emissions and energy usage by 0.8% and 1.3%. Scenario analyses indicated that potential reduction of life cycle GHG emissions and energy usage could reach to 15%, if secondary weight saving and a smaller engine were included. Cost analyses also show 18% reduction when the additional weight saving and a smaller displacement engine were included, under a 100,000 km driving distance and gasoline price at $1.0/l.

"Life cycle inventory-based analysis of greenhouse gas emissions from arable land farming systems in Hokkaido, northern Japan","To assess their impacts on net global warming, total greenhouse gas emissions (mainly CO2, N2O and CH4) from agricultural production in arable land cropping systems in the Tokachi region of Hokkaido, Japan, were estimated using life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis. The LCI data included CO2 emissions from on-farm and off-farm fossil fuel consumption, soil CO2 emissions induced by the decomposition of soil organic matter, direct and indirect N2O emissions from arable lands and CH4 uptake by soils, which were then aggregated in CO2-equivalents. Under plow-based conventional tillage (CT) cropping systems for winter wheat, sugar beet, adzuki bean, potato and cabbage, on-farm CO2 emissions from fuel-consuming operations such as tractor-based field operations, truck transportation and mechanical grain drying ranged from 0.424 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for adzuki bean to 0.826 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for winter wheat. Off-farm CO2 emissions resulting from the use of agricultural materials such as chemical fertilizers, biocides (pesticides and herbicides) and agricultural machines were estimated by input-output tables to range from 0.800 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for winter wheat to 1.724 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for sugar beet. Direct N2O emissions previously measured in an Andosol field of this region showed a positive correlation with N fertilizer application rates. These emissions, expressed in CO2-equivalents, ranged from 0.041 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for potato to 0.382 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for cabbage. Indirect N2O emissions resulting from N leaching and surface runoff were estimated to range from 0.069 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for adzuki bean to 0.381 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for cabbage. The rates of CH4 removal from the atmosphere by soil uptake were equivalent to only 0.020-0.042 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1). From the difference in the total soil C pools (0-20 cm depth) between 1981 and 2001, annual CO2 emissions from the CT and reduced tillage (RT) soils were estimated to be 4.91 and 3.81 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. In total, CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions under CT cropping systems in the Tokachi region of Hokkaido amounted to 6.97, 7.62, 6.44, 6.64 and 7.49 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for winter wheat, sugar beet, adzuki bean, potato and cabbage production, respectively. Overall, soil-derived CO2 emissions accounted for a large proportion (64-76%) of the total greenhouse gas emissions. This illustrates that soil management practices that enhance C sequestration in soil may be an effective means to mitigate large greenhouse gas emissions from arable land cropping systems such as those in the Tokachi region of northern Japan. Under RT cropping systems, plowing after harvesting was omitted, and total greenhouse gas emissions from winter wheat, sugar beet and adzuki bean could be reduced by 18%, 4% and 18%, respectively, mainly as a result of a lower soil organic matter decomposition rate in the RT soil and a saving on the fuels used for plowing.",Not About Sufficiency
"LIFECYCLE CARBON FOOTPRINT: THE CASE STUDY OF THE ELECTRICITY USE IN PUEBLA, MEXICO","Greenhouse gas emissions inventories and carbon footprints assessed at the local level are critical for any country, mainly for those countries which are part of the Paris Agreement such as Mexico, where federal and local governments join forces to design climate-change mitigation policies. However, determining carbon footprints is time and resource-intensive and not always possible for local governments. To meet this need, we propose an alternative method using lifecycle input-output analysis and location quotients to quantify direct and total emissions of the Mexican state of Puebla caused by its use of electricity during 2013. We quantify the emissions from the production and consumption-based perspective, finding that Puebla's economy emitted a total of 15 million metric tons of CO(2)e caused by industrial sectors' electricity use, which represented 3 % of the total national emissions caused by Mexico's industrial electricity use. The most significant contributors to Puebla's total greenhouse gas emissions were the ""food and beverage preparation services"" and the ""business support services"" sectors accounting for 38 % and 9 % of Puebla's total emissions and 50 % and 23 % of direct emissions, respectively. We conclude that, in addition to the decarbonization of the energy matrix, potential climate change mitigation policies should reduce the intensity factors of the sectors with the highest emissions identified with the proposed method.",Not About Sufficiency
Valued forest carbon sinks: How much emissions abatement costs could be reduced in China,"Carbon sink is an effective measure to balance the contradiction between economic development and mitigating climate change in China. This paper reveals that environmental performance of forest carbon sinks reflects in economic value by reducing the emissions abatement cost. The carbon trading system is used to demonstrate the environmental and economic value of forests. The forest carbon sequestrations are estimated and predicted in different regions of China. Furthermore, a market model has been established to assess how the emission reduction costs can be reduced among all regions by the year 2030 to achieve the goal of carbon emissions intensity in China. The results show that carbon sequestration trades can reduce the emissions reduction costs and it can represent the value of forest carbon sinks. In particular, when economic growth is maintained in moderate and low level in China, the national carbon trading market with carbon sequestration will decrease the carbon emissions reduction costs more effectively. Besides, carbon sink can bring economic benefits to under-developed regions where there are rich forest resources. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Planning of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations With PV and Energy Storage Using a Fuzzy Inference System,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas. The construction of EV charging stations (EVCSs) is critical to the development of the EV industry. This article proposes a novel integrated fuzzy inference system (FIS)-based planning framework for determining the optimal locations and capacities of EVCSs with photovoltaic (PV) systems and energy storage units. Several off-site factors that will affect the planning results of EVCSs are analyzed and incorporated into a multiobjective optimization problem, aiming at minimizing the cost of electricity (COE) and emission pollutants simultaneously. The proposed FIS-based planning approach introduces novel fuzzy criteria that account for the nonlinear and difficult-to-model joint effect of social and environmental factors. By incorporating these off-site factors, a more realistic framework for EVCS planning is presented. Numerical studies are conducted on a coupled 33-bus distribution system and 25-bus transportation system to illustrate the proposed planning method. According to the simulation results, employing the proposed FIS-based planning framework not only reduces the search space and simplifies the optimization problem but also makes the results more realistic according to practical system conditions.",Not About Sufficiency

Thus, the objective of the present paper was to analyse the relationship between income inequality level and consumption-based GHG emissions from 1990 to 2014 under different stages of economic development. The results revealed a large gap between consumption-based GHG emissions at different economic development stages. Economic growth contributed to the growth of consumption-based GHG emissions in all income groups, and the largest effect was observed in middle-low- and low-income countries. Higher income inequality level was associated with lower negatively influenced consumption-based emissions in high- and middle-high-income countries, confirming the marginal propensity to emit and 'Veblen effect' theories. Meanwhile, regarding the middle-low- and low-income groups, the relationships between inequality level and GHG emissions were insignificant. Urbanisation level contributed to the growth of consumption-based GHG emissions in middle- and low-income countries. Education level contributed to the reduction of consumption-based GHG emissions in high-, middle-high-, and middle-low-income countries, and growth of emissions in low-income countries. Therefore, our analysis revealed that income inequality and climate change are still incompatible in all income groups, and we suggested how to achieve the reduction of income inequality and climate change simultaneously.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating the spatial proximity effect into the assessment of changes in ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation,"The assessment of the value of ecosystem services is a valuable tool for biodiversity conservation that can facilitate better environmental policy decision-making and land management, and can help land managers develop interventions to compensate for biodiversity loss at the patch level. Previous studies have suggested that it is appropriate to assess the value of biodiversity for conservation planning by considering both the condition of the landscape and the spatial configuration of adjacent land uses that can be reflected as a proximity effect. This research examines the influence of spatial proximity on biodiversity conservation from the ecosystem service perspective based on the assumption that the variation in the proximity effect caused by land cover change has positive or negative impacts on ecological services. Three factors related to the spatial characteristics of the landscape were considered in this approach: the relative artificiality of the land cover types, the distance decay effect of patches and the impact of one land cover type on others. The proximity effect change (PEC) parameter reflected the relationship between the spatial proximity effect and biodiversity conservation. The results of a quantitative and spatial comparative analysis of the proposed method and the conventional method in Yingkou for the periods of 2000-2005 and 2005-2010 showed that the former can account for the temporal and spatial changes in ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation that were caused by patch-level changes as well as the interaction between the altered and adjacent patches from a spatial perspective. The metric can also identify the most critical areas for biodiversity protection and inform the efficient allocation of limited land resources for nature conservation to maximize the benefit to biodiversity by guiding the process of land-use change, particularly urbanization and agriculture. Future studies should focus on the other important factors that are applicable to the assessment of the value of biodiversity conservation in socio-ecological systems, where society and nature are mutually capable of fulfilling their roles.

An Internal Control System that Includes Corporate Social Responsibility for Social Sustainability in the New Era,"Although the importance of corporate social responsibility has received more attention over the years, the goal of social sustainability has still not been achieved. The main reason is that companies seeking to implement social sustainability, have failed to incorporate the concept of corporate social responsibility into their corporate internal control objectives. Furthermore, studying the interactive relationship between corporate social responsibility and internal control and ensuring the consistency of corporate strategy and internal control objectives are done to help promote the sustainable development of enterprises. In order to promote social sustainability and improve management decision-making gaps, therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a new hybrid multi-attribute decision model to assess the impact of corporate social responsibility for the implementation of internal control that includes corporate social responsibility. The empirical results show that a social responsibility-oriented internal control system may be a better strategy than maintaining the original internal control objectives. In addition, by adjusting the internal control system to jointly promote the sustainable development goals of the company and ensure the consistency of corporate strategy and internal control objectives, the company can be truly guided to implement the social responsibility management objectives. Finally, the social sustainable development goals can be truly realized, and the interests of all stakeholders in the enterprise can be truly satisfied.",Not About Sufficiency
Limitations of Natural Gas Lean Burn Spark Ignition Engines Derived From Compression Ignition Engines,"Converting existing diesel engines to the spark ignition (SI) operation can increase the utilization of natural gas (NG) in heavy-duty applications, which can reduce oil imports in the US and curtail greenhouse-gas emissions. The NG operation at lean-burn conditions was evaluated inside a retrofitted heavy-duty direct-injection compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the diesel injector was replaced with a high-energy spark plug and NG was mixed with air in the intake manifold. Steady-state engine experiments that changed combustion phasing were performed at 13.3 compression ratio, lean equivalence ratio, medium load, and low-speed conditions, fueled with pure methane as NG surrogate. Results suggested that NG combustion inside such retrofitted engines is different from that in conventional SI engines due to the geometric characteristics of the diesel combustion chamber. In detail, the different conditions inside the bowl and the squish partitioned the combustion process into two distinct events in terms of timing and location. Moreover, the squish region helped stabilize the extreme lean operation by creating a highly turbulent flow into the bowl during the compression stroke. However, combustion efficiency and unburned hydrocarbon emissions were significantly affected by the fuel fraction that burned inside the squish region under less than optimal conditions during the expansion stroke. As a result, despite the combustion phasing being the primary control of engine's indicated thermal efficiency, the combustion strategy for CI engines converted to NG SI should optimize the slower burning inside the squish region.",Not About Sufficiency
Distinct Miscanthus lignocellulose improves fungus secreting cellulases and xylanases for consistently enhanced biomass saccharification of diverse bioenergy crops,"Bioenergy crops provide enormous renewable biomass resources convertible for biofuel production, but lignocellulose recalcitrance fundamentally determines its enzymatic saccharification at high cost and low efficiency. In this study, total 30 diverse Miscanthus lignocellulose substrates were incubated with T. reesei strain to secret lignocellulose-degradation enzymes, and their major wall polymers features (cellulose crystallinity, hemicellulose arabinose and lignin H-monomer) were meanwhile examined with distinct impacts on the enzyme activities. Using characteristic Miscanthus (Msi62) de-lignin residue as inducing substrate with the reesei strain, this study detected that the Msi62-induced enzymes were of consistently higher enhancements on enzymatic saccharification of various lignocellulose residues examined in 17 grassy and woody bioenergy crops, particularly for the hemicellulose hydrolyses, compared to other two reesei-secreted cellulases and three commercial enzymes. Notably, based on SDSgel protein separation profiling and LC-MS/MS analysis, the Msi62-induced enzymes consist of distinct cellulases (CBHI, BG, EGII) compositions and high-activity xylanases. Therefore, this study has demonstrated an applicable approach to achieve the optimal cellulases and xylanases cocktails that enable for low-costly and high-efficient enzymatic saccharification of diverse lignocellulose sources, providing a potential strategy for large-scale biofuel production in all major bioenergy crops.

Energy Costs of Reducing Industrial Sulfur Dioxide Emissions in China,"With increasing environmental pollution, China has instituted corresponding environmental regulations to address environmental challenges. Estimating the costs of such environmental regulations can help governments to formulate rational environmental policies. This review estimates the costs of environmental regulations based on a novel perspective of energy consumption. Using panel data for Chinese provincial regions in 2006-2015, we developed a non-parametric directional distance function and estimated different optimal energy inputs based on data envelopment analysis under two scenarios, namely, those with and without emission reduction constraints. The gap between the two groups of optimal energy inputs facilitated the estimation of the energy costs associated with reducing SO2 (sulfur dioxide) emissions in China's industrial sectors. The results suggest that approximately 13.40 tons of standard coal were required to reduce SO2 emissions by 1 ton, highlighting the discrepancy between energy savings and emission reduction. The energy costs of SO2 emission reduction were the highest in West China (18.63), followed by those in Central and Northeast China; meanwhile, those in East China were the lowest (9.91). The large differences between the energy costs of emission reduction in different regions indicated that economically underdeveloped areas have scope for improvement with respect to energy structures and innovation in the green technology field.",Not About Sufficiency

Spatial identification of restored priority areas based on ecosystem service bundles and urbanization effects in a megalopolis area,"Rapid urbanization has altered the structure and function of urban ecosystems with respect to the demand for planning ecological restoration to inhibit ecological degradation. However, there is still a challenge to quickly and effectively identify the restored priority areas to maximize ecological service (ES) supply and enhance human well-being. Taking the Shenzhen metropolitan region as a case study area, this study identified the restored priority sites based on the ES bundles evolution and urbanization effects. The ES bundles were identified by analyzing the spatial dynamics under the hybrid urban landscape, then the impact of urbanization on the ES bundles was explored using linear regression analysis characterized by different levels of urbanization in different stages. Furthermore, the spatial statistics were used to identify the priority sites. The results showed that 68.78% of the grids had changed their ES bundles in terms of their quantities, types, and sites in Shenzhen during 1978-2018. The urbanization driver spatially shifts from provision of service to regulation and cultural ecosystem services and significantly negatively influences the composition and structure of the ES bundles in different urbanization stages. 1196 of the 1 square kilometer grids, which accounted for 54.17%, were identified to prioritize for ecological restoration in Shenzhen. However, only 4.08% of them need to set as the key ecological restoration site. This study explored an effectively spatial way to implement ecological restoration planning in a rapidly urbanized area.",Not About Sufficiency
Local responses to global sustainability agendas: learning from experimenting with the urban sustainable development goal in Cape Town,"The success of the Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) depends on the availability and accessibility of robust data, as well as the reconfiguration of governance systems that can catalyse urban transformation. Given the uneven success of the Millennium Development Goals, and the unprecedented inclusion of the urban in the SDG process, the feasibility of SDG 11 was assessed in advance of its ratification through a series of urban experiments. This paper focusses on Cape Town's participation in piloting SDG 11, in order to explore the role of urban experimentation in highlighting the partnership arrangements necessary to allow cities to meet the data and governance challenges presented by the SDG 11. Specifically, we focus on the relationship between data and governance that lie at the heart of the SDG 11. The urban experiment demonstrates the highly complex and multi-level governance dynamics that shape the way urban experiments are initiated, executed and concluded. The implications of these dependencies illustrate that more attention needs to be paid at the global level to what data are important and how and where the data are generated if SDG 11 is to be met. Overall, this paper makes the case that the success of SDG 11 rests on effecting local level change and enabling real opportunities in cities.",Not About Sufficiency
"Long-term spatial and temporal trend analysis of stream flow and suspended sediment transport of Godavari River Basin, India","Long-term spatial and temporal variations of stream flow and suspended sediment discharge of rivers are important for effective planning of available water resources and soil conservation measures.

The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test and the Pettitt test are used to detect gradual and abrupt changes, respectively. The results of MK test indicates that 76% stations show decreasing trend in stream flow, whereas 90% stations show decreasing trend in suspended sediment discharge. The abrupt change is reported in the early and middle period of 1990 to 2000. The significant decreasing trend in stream flow and sediment discharge is due to the construction of extensive dams, land use change and rainfall pattern.",Not About Sufficiency
Long-term wind speed prediction using artificial neural network-based approaches,"In the current scenario, worldwide renewable energy systems receive renewed interest because of the global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Through structural equation modelling and using data from Spanish hotels, this study adds value to the dynamic capabilities theory by empirically demonstrating that quality management and absorptive capacity, used together, positively influence (directly or indirectly) the environmental, economic and social sustainability of hotels in order to reduce their environmental impact, and improve the social well-being of stakeholders and the economic development of the region.",Not About Sufficiency
Loss and Damage from Climate Change: Knowledge Gaps and Interdisciplinary Approaches,"Loss and damage from climate change have risen to a prominent position on the international agenda. At COP27 in 2022, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ratified a decision to establish a loss and damage fund to compensate low- and middle-income countries that are suffering negative impacts from climate change. The fund is meant to address the Global Adaptation Gap, which describes the rising cost of adaptation needed to cope with climate change impacts due to delayed action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. This essay highlights issues around loss and damage from climate change from a variety of natural and social science perspectives. From three months of discussions, an interdisciplinary perspective and research agenda on this topic have crystallised, which is outlined here. Given that the implementation of the loss and damage fund still needs negotiation and commitment from signatories to the UNFCCC, it is timely now to address some important knowledge gaps on how loss and damage can be measured, quantified, valued, understood, communicated, and adapted to. Hence, it is necessary to understand the complex interactions between people, politics, nature, and climate in this interdisciplinary context.",Not About Sufficiency
"Low Impact Development practices in the context of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: A new concept, lessons learned and challenges","The increase in urbanization and climate change brings new challenges to the cities' sustainability and resilience, mainly related to flood and drought events. Among these challenges, it can be highlighted the physical and health damage to the population, interruption of water, energy and food supply services, damage to basic infrastructure, economic losses and contamination of urban rivers. To contribute to the increase of resilience in urban centers, LID practices have been used as a new approach of mitigation and adaptation within urban drainage systems, aiming at runoff retention, peak flow attenuation, pollutant removal and ecosystem services restoration (e.g., resources recycling, carbon sequestration, thermal comfort and landscape integration). These different mitigation purposes and complementary benefits provided by LID practices can be related to the different Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) presented by the United Nations (UN), to achieve countries' systemic sustainability. The identification of local techniques that contribute to the different SDG helps to achieve their territorialization and application as public policy. Therefore, this paper presents a literature review, categorizing the studies into different generations based on their main application purpose and presents a linkage of the LID benefits to different SDG. Some challenges were identified requiring further investigation, such as the need to identify and quantify the energy demands for LID practices maintenance and their incorporation in the system final energy balance, identification of processes that contribute to carbon sequestration and emission, and risks of emerging pollutants for human health from water reuse and nutrient cycling for sustainable agriculture.",Not About Sufficiency
A novel methodology to select sustainable municipal solid waste management scenarios from three-way decisions perspective,"Selecting a sustainable municipal solid waste management (MSWM) scenario can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and deal with the energy crisis, effectively. However, traditional decision approaches only rank alternative scenarios but fail to manage them. Implementing effective management for alternative MSWM scenarios can save decision costs and improve efficiency. Thus, this paper aims to construct a novel multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) methodology to manage and rank sustainable scenarios. To evaluate sustainable MSWM scenarios, a comprehensive evaluation index system is constructed from five dimensions including economy, environment, society, technology, and energy. The hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is employed to articulate evaluation information. Given the importance of experts and the incomplete criteria weight information, an inclusion measure-based approach is proposed to obtain expert weights, and the grey relational analysis linear programming model with incomplete criteria weight information is constructed to determine criteria weights. An inclusion measure-based hesitant fuzzy linguistic multigranulation three-way decisions over two universes approach is developed to manage and rank alternative MSWM scenarios. The feasibility of the proposed methodology is illustrated by a numerical case. Triple sensitivity analysis is performed from the perspectives of decision-makers' risk appetite, expert weight fluctuations, and criteria weight fluctuations. A comparative analysis is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology. This study provides a novel insight to solve MSWM scenario selection and can extensively be applied to handle other MCGDM problems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Dynamics of spatial relationships among ecosystem services and their determinants: Implications for land use system reform in Northwestern China,"Understanding the dynamics and relationships among ecosystem services (ESs) and their underlying socioecological driving mechanisms has great importance for policy-makers to achieve sustainable development. In this study, using the City Belt along the Yellow River in Ningxia, China as the study area, we quantified and mapped five ESs for the period 1989-2017, analyzed the spatial relationships among ESs through hotspots analysis, correlation analysis and cluster delineation, and explored the dynamic impacts of socio-ecological factors on ESs through random forest analysis. The results showed that spatial distributions and relationships among ESs had significant change over the past three decades, driven by the varied impacts of socio-ecological factors. Cropland in the central plain could supply higher values of food production, carbon sequestration and nutrient retention, which were mainly impacted by land use pattern and vegetation coverage and existed significant synergies among them at regional scale. Specially, the hotspots of food production and carbon sequestration both decreased in the northern part over time, while the former one was caused by the increasing impacts of socioeconomic indicators and the latter one by climate factors. Northwestern and southern mountains could provide higher values of sand fixation, which was mainly impacted by the increasing impact of topography and decreasing impact of climate factors. Thus hotspots of sand fixation increased in the mountainous areas and decreased in other regions. Socio-economic factors had an increasing impact on recreational opportunity, resulting the transformation of its hotspots from mountains to the central Yinchuan city and transition region between mountains and central plain. Dynamic impacts of socio-ecological factors could alter the spatial relationships among ESs and impact their co-occurrence across space. Specific management strategies have been proposed for different sub-regions to improve ESs under the land-use system reform, ecological civilization and rural revitalization in China.",Not About Sufficiency

How does climate change impact people who use alcohol and other drugs? A scoping review of peer reviewed literature,"Background: The world has experienced devastating extreme weather events, alongside slow-onset processes including increasing temperature means, that scientists agree are manifestations of human-induced climate change. Even with radical action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, effects of climate change will become increasingly severe. Objectives: The aim of this review was to classify impacts of climate change for people who use alcohol and other drugs (AoD), as reflected in peer reviewed literature. Method: A scoping review was conducted to achieve this. Included studies involved a human population, a climate change related exposure, and an AoD outcome. Studies were published in English between 1998 and November 2023. Exposure events of interest included extreme heat, fires, storms, floods, droughts, and longerterm environmental changes. 8,204 studies were screened, with 82 included for data extraction and narrative analysis. Results: Most papers describe increased AoD use, with smaller numbers showing decreased or unchanged substance use. Some studies identify unplanned withdrawal, changed drug markets, disrupted service access, specific physiological vulnerabilities of AoD users to extreme heat, and compounding effects on mental health. We note the relative absence of peer reviewed studies investigating impacts of climate change on AoD use in low-and middle-income countries. Further, few studies consider impacts that occur because of long-term or gradual climatic shifts such as environmental changes that are detrimental to livelihoods. Conclusion: It is crucial to document effects of a changing climate on people who use AoD so that policy and services can meet future needs.

Closing global knowledge gaps: Producing generalized knowledge from case studies of social-ecological systems,"Concerns over rapid widespread changes in social-ecological systems and their consequences for biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, food security, and human livelihoods are driving demands for globally comprehensive knowledge to support decision-making and policy development. Claims of regional or global knowledge about the patterns, causes, and significance of changes in social-ecological systems, or 'generalized knowledge claims' (GKCs), are generally produced by synthesis of evidence compiled from local and regional case study observations. GKCs now constitute a wide and varied body of research, yet they are also increasingly contested based on disagreements about their geographic, temporal, and/or thematic validity. There are no accepted guidelines for detecting biases or logical gaps between GKC's and the evidence used to produce them. Here, we propose a typology of GKCs based on their evidence base and the process by which they are produced. The typology is structured by three dimensions: i) the prior state of knowledge about the phenomenon of interest; ii) the logic of generalization underlying the claim; and iii) the methodology for generalization. From this typology, we propose a standardized approach to assess the quality and commensurability of these dimensions for any given GKC, and their ability to produce robust and transparent knowledge based on constituent evidence, We then apply this approach to evaluate two contested GKCs - addressing global biodiversity and large-scale land acquisitions - and in doing so demonstrate a coherent approach to assessing and evaluating the scope and validity of GKCs. With this approach, GKCs can be produced and applied with greater transparency and accuracy, advancing the goal of actionable science on social-ecological systems.",Not About Sufficiency
Magnetic biochar accelerates microbial succession and enhances assimilatory nitrate reduction during pig manure composting,"Biochar promotes microbial metabolic activities and reduces N2O on aerobic composting. However, the effects of magnetic biochar (MBC) on the microbial succession and N2O emissions during pig manure composting remain unclear. Herein, a 42-day composting experiment was conducted with five treatment regimes: pig manure without biochar (CK), 5 % pig manure-based biochar (5 % PBC), 2 % MBC (2 % MBC), 5 % MBC (5 % MBC) and 7.5 % MBC (7.5 % MBC)), to clarify the variation in functional microorganisms and genes associated with nitrogen and direct interspecies electron transfer via metagenomics. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that MBC possessed more stable aromatic structures than pig manure-based biochar (PBC), indicating its greater potential for nitrous oxide reduction. MBC treatments were more effective in composting organic matter and improving the carbon/nitrogen ratio than PBC. The microbial composition during composting varied significantly, with the dominant phyla shifting from Firmicutes to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidota. Network and hierarchical clustering analyses showed that the MBC treatment enhanced the interactions of dominant microbes (Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota) and accelerated the composting process. The biochar addition accelerated assimilatory nitrate reduction and slowed dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification. The Mantel test demonstrated that magnetic biochar potentially helped regulate composting nutrients and affected functional nitrogen genes. These findings shed light on the role of MBC in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions during aerobic composting.",Not About Sufficiency
Main factors influencing greenhouse gas emissions of wood-based furniture industry in Finland,"The significance of green values is growing in the furniture sector; customers are demanding more specific environmental information of the products, new regulations are tackling to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Impact of Selected High-Performance Fuel Blends on Three-Way Catalyst Light Off under Synthetic Spark-Ignition Engine-Exhaust Conditions,"The U.S. Department of Energy funded Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines initiative aims to simultaneously develop advanced engines along with high-performance fuels to reduce petroleum consumption. The engine exhaust of spark-ignited light-duty vehicles contains pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide (CO), and non-methane organic gases. When operated above their ""light-off"" temperature, three-way catalysts (TWCs) efficiently control the emissions of these pollutants from the vehicle exhaust. However, below the catalyst light-off temperature, during cold start, the TWCs are not effective. Thus, the stringent environmental regulations necessitate cold-start compliance of advanced engines operating on novel fuels for commercialization. Exhaust composition strongly impacts the effectiveness of TWCs. Hence, ensuring that the high-performance fuels under consideration do not have detrimental effects on current emissions control technology is necessary. To mitigate cold-start emissions, a low light-off temperature of the fuel on the TWC is desirable. As real-world fuels are multicomponent blends, we conducted investigations into the light-off behavior of representative fuel mixtures on a three-mode redox-aged commercial TWC under synthetic engine-exhaust conditions. The high-performance fuels in this study included 10-30% volumetric levels of ethanol, isobutanol, diisobutylene, and an aromatic mixture. Each of these high-performance fuel components was mixed into a gasoline surrogate blendstock for oxygenate blending (BOB). Our results showed that aromatics and alkenes in the surrogate BOB inhibit low-temperature reactivity of alkanes, alcohols, and CO on the TWC and dominate the blend light-off behavior. All the high-performance fuel blends had a very similar light-off behavior to the surrogate gasoline BOB, indicating that blending up to 30% (by vol.) of high-performance blendstocks in a gasoline base fuel can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions through improved engine efficiency and petroleum displacement without jeopardizing the ability to meet emissions regulations. While some high-performance blendstocks demonstrated lower light-off temperatures than a surrogate gasoline blend, taking advantage of the higher catalytic reactivity of these blendstocks to reduce cold-start emissions would require reducing the aromatic content in petroleum-based market fuels.",Not About Sufficiency
Making light work of heavy metal contamination: the potential for coupling bioremediation with bioenergy production,"Intense anthropogenic activity continues to expose the natural environment to heavy metal contamination. Whilst a number of physical and chemical solutions for remediation exist, the use of higher plants and algae for clean-up of contaminated landscapes, termed 'phytoremediation' and 'phycoremediation', respectively, offer an attractive and sustainable alternative. However, these remediation processes will always lead to a high-moisture, heavy metal-contaminated biomass, which must be further processed to partition, or render inert, the metal contaminants. Conversion of this metal-rich biomass into second-generation biofuels offers a useful route to subsidise the economics of remediation activities. Here we briefly review the various methods for bioremediation of heavy metals, and discuss the potential to produce bioenergy from these biomass sources. Coupling the bioremediation activity to bioenergy production gives far-reaching social and economic benefits; however, established processes such as direct combustion and anaerobic digestion risk releasing heavy metals back into the environment. Alternatively, thermochemical conversions such as pyrolysis or hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) offer significant advantages in terms of the segregation of metals into a relatively inert and compact solid phase while producing a biocrude oil for bioenergy production. In addition, preliminary work suggests that the HTL process can also be used to partition essential macronutrients, such as N, P and K, into an aqueous medium, allowing additional nutrient recycling.

Making or breaking environmental innovation? Technological change and innovation markets in the pulp and paper industry,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of internationally changing market conditions versus national innovation systems (NIS) for environmental innovation in a transforming industry sector, the Nordic pulp and paper industry. Design/methodology/approach - Based on several case studies of technological innovations in the sector, using data triangulation, crucial factors for environmental innovation are analyzed. The cases focus on bioenergy technologies in pulp mills and on new products from fiber. Findings - While NIS still supports the networks through which innovations are created, the formation of innovation markets is increasingly dependent on international developments. Environmental innovation is most likely to occur when momentum is created by simultaneous changes in private and policy- created markets. Environmental policies, increasingly originating at the EU level, have added the final impetus for bioenergy technologies, while for new products the policy effect has been smaller. Practical implications - National innovation policies must be designed to take into account the internationalizing influences on environmental innovation. Originality/value - The paper shows the continued importance of NIS in a low-and-medium technology sector despite internationalizing markets.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of the pyrolysis products from halophyte Salicornia bigelovii cultivated in a desert environment,"The development of bioenergy in marginal environments has been hampered by the lack of sustainable sources of biomass.

In this study, the S. bigelovii seed and the seedless-plant have been assessed, for the first time, for biofuel and biochar production through thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis) in an auger reactor operated at 550 degrees C. Both feed-stocks showed significant differences in chemical composition, with the seed being closer to the characteristics of seeds from common oilseed crops. The S. bigelovii seed produced high bio-oil yield (79.9% of total liquid) of high pH predominated with fatty acids commonly found in vegetable oils. The S. bigelovii seedless-plant produced a liquid of significantly low bio-oil (10% of total liquid) with an aqueous phase of pH and salinity close that of brackish water. The biochars were of moderate heating value and limited potentials for soil amendment due to the high ash content in the biomass, but are reasonably stable for long term carbon sequestration due to their low O/C and H/C ratios (<0.1 and <1.0, respectively). Comparative assessment in terms of the conversion efficiency and renewability indicated that pyrolysis of the S. bigelovii seed offers a good opportunity for biofuel production in arid/semi-arid saline regions against the alternative option of transesterification conversion.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of temperature and nutrient enrichment on the Arctic moss Hygrohypnella ochracea growth and productivity,"Arctic streams are highly sensitive to climate warming due to changes in water temperature and nutrient availability. Mosses are the dominant benthic primary producers in low-order streams in Greenland, and climate induced ecosystem alterations are expected to cause significant changes to their growth and productivity rates. However, the combined effects of climate change to stream mosses are relatively unknown. In this study, we conducted a full factorial experiment with three levels of nutrients and temperatures, and we measured primary productivity by applying the C-14-CO2 tracer method, relative growth rate (RGR), shoot elongation (SE) and lateral growth (length of branches, LB; Shoot density, SD). We aimed to investigate the single and interactive effect of temperature and nutrient enrichment on growth (biomass and elongation), primary productivity and shoot morphology of the Arctic aquatic moss Hygrohypnella ochracea. We found that low temperature determines H. ochracea growth however, the effect of nutrient enrichment became increasingly significant with increasing temperature. We also found important morphological changes in moss lateral growth which is expected to cause fundamental changes in moss community structure.

To find research clusters, trends, and themes linked to SDGs and their connection to environmental sustainability, we thoroughly analyzed 29,897 publications from 2012 to 2022. The analysis showed that SDG 15, SDG 7, SDG 12, SDG 13, and SDG 11 were the top five SDGs, with an environmental focus among the 17 SDGs. These top SDGs had many clusters connected to them, illustrating various sustainability-related problems. The study also looked at connections between SDGs, the nations with the highest rates of productivity, the top contributors, and the journals with the highest citation counts. We discovered three separate SDG clusters using co-occurrence network analysis, each representing a different SDG. We discovered relevant SDGs using Matrice d'impacts croise & PRIME;s multiplication applique & PRIME;e a & PRIME; un classment (MICMAC) analysis and centrality indicators like eigenvector and betweenness. This novel method for publishing analysis combines an AHP focus that aligns with the SDGs with social network analysis and centrality metrics. Our research advances knowledge of how the AHP technique can assess initiatives supporting the SDGs. We offer essential insights into prioritizing sustainable development measures by identifying research clusters, trends, and issues related to environmental sustainability. This study highlights the subject's most important SDGs, productive nations, helpful organizations, and significant journals.",Not About Sufficiency
Mapping construction sector greenhouse gas emissions: a crucial step in sustainably meeting increasing housing demands,"This paper examines the tension between needing to build more infrastructure and housing and simultaneously reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. This study uses an Environmentally Extended Input-Output approach to conduct a high-resolution top-down analysis of Canada's national construction GHG emissions. Our findings highlight that Canada's current construction practices cannot accommodate the construction required to restore housing affordability by 2030 without substantial environmental consequences. On a consumption life cycle basis, the construction sector was responsible for approximately 90 Mt CO2e in 2018, equivalent to over 8% of Canada's total GHG emissions, while delivering less than a third of Canada's annual housing needs. Residential construction was responsible for the largest share (42%) of total construction emissions. Overall, 84% of emissions are from material manufacturing and 35% of construction emissions are imported, underscoring the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework addressing both domestic and imported emissions. Under current construction practices (i.e. current material use patterns and emissions intensities), meeting Canada's 2030 housing affordability and climate commitments requires an 83% reduction in GHG emissions per construction product (i.e. per home) compared to the 40% economy-wide reduction promised in Canada's international reduction commitments. Mitigating the GHG gap between emission caps and housing demand calls for changes in the ratio of housing to other infrastructure (e.g. fewer roads, less fossil fuel infrastructure), new construction approaches (e.g. increasing material efficiency) and/or disproportionally allocating climate budget to construction. The implications of our study extend beyond Canada, offering valuable insights for other growing countries with climate goals. The results emphasize the urgency in considering and establishing sectoral GHG budgets for construction and for transformative changes in the construction sector to meet national GHG emission reduction commitments.",Not About Sufficiency
"Mapping seasonal trends in vegetation using AVHRR-NDVI time series in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico","This research examines the spatio-temporal trends in Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series to ascribe land use change and precipitation to observed changes in land cover from 1982 to 2007 in the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula, using seasonal trend analysis (STA). In addition to discrete land cover transitions across the study region, patterns of agricultural intensification, urban expansion and afforestation in protected areas have enacted changes to the seasonal patterns of apparent greenness observed through STA greenness parameters. The results indicate that the seasonal variation in NDVI can be used to distinguish among different land cover transitions, and the primary differences among these transitions were in changes in overall greenness, peak annual greenness and the timing of the growing season. Associations between greenness trends and precipitation were weak, indicating a human-dominated system for the 26 years examined. Changes in the states of Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatan appear to be associated with pasture cultivation, urban expansion-extensive cultivation and urban expansion-intensive cultivation, respectively.",Not About Sufficiency
Mapping the Sustainable Development in Health Tourism: A Systematic Literature Review,"Health tourism is recognised as a growing industry. Therefore, sustainable development in health tourism is crucial not only for the well-being of patients but also for destinations and communities. In this sense, sustainable development in health tourism aims to develop solutions related to the environmental, social, and economic challenges faced by the country and the tourism sector. After the COVID-19 pandemic, health tourism has become popular, and despite the increase in research related to the theme, the existing literature is still relatively fragmented and lacks a comprehensive view. This study addresses this gap by investigating sustainable development in health tourism through a systematic literature review. Ninety-three articles were collected from the Web of Science database. After subjecting them to bibliometric analysis, it is possible to examine the topic's current state of the art. This research permits the systematisation of the existing literature into five areas: (1) stakeholders of sustainable tourism, (2) impact of COVID-19, (3) health tourism, (4) challenges and opportunities, and (5) sustainability values. This research provides significant contributions to the field of sustainable development in health tourism. Firstly, it sheds light on aspects that previous literature has examined, offering valuable insights into the drivers of sustainable development in health tourism, thus enriching our comprehension of the subject. Additionally, the article delineates a prospective research agenda, suggesting various directions that can lay the foundation for upcoming inquiries and the development of pertinent theories for assessing the impact of sustainable development in health tourism.",Not About Sufficiency
Malignant pleural mesothelioma:: interrogations and hopes concerning the expected epidemic,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare incurable tumor. Interest in MPM has increased in recent years due to a steadily increasing incidence subsequent to the intensive use of asbestosis, the main causal agent, but also due to better awareness in the political and scientific communities faced with a serious public health issue. Our knowledge of MPM has improved regularly in terms of pathologic diagnosis and the mechanisms underlying the mesothelial carcinogenesis. MPM is also the subject of many technological innovations as illustrated by the recent identification of new biological markers, access to metabolic imaging, and clinical research on targeted treatments. Proper management implies the participation of the general population since the implementation of administrative procedures for social indemnities. In 2007, a more aggressive therapeutic approach is becoming common practice with the use of radiotherapy and the emergence of the concept of multimodal care centered on wide pleuropneumonectomy. These advances create real hope for improvement, but also many interrogations since no standard treatment protocol has been clearly identified.",Not About Sufficiency

Assessing California's progress toward its 2020 greenhouse gas emissions limit,"California law requires statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to return to 1990 levels by 2020-a goal achieved in 2016, four years early. We conduct the first independent retrospective analysis of California's greenhouse gas emissions to assess how the state has achieved faster-than-expected emissions reductions. We analyze the extent to which economic activity, climate policies, and market forces drove California's greenhouse gas emissions trends overall and in two key categories: electricity and light-duty vehicles. We also compare historical trends with business-as-usual and policy expectations from the 2008 Climate Change Scoping Plan, California's official strategy for achieving the 2020 emissions limit. Our analysis, based on data through 2017, indicates that reduced economic activity during the 2008-2009 recession and its aftermath has been a major contributor to early achievement of the 2020 emissions limit. Policies and market forces, however, have played a larger role in reducing emissions in recent years-particularly in the electricity sector, which has decarbonized more rapidly than expected. Meanwhile, GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles in recent years were rising, not falling, in contrast to expectations. Our analysis demonstrates how decomposition methods can be used to track climate policy implementation and inform future policy development.",Not About Sufficiency
"Matches and mismatches between the supply of and demand for cultural ecosystem services in rapidly urbanizing watersheds: A case study in the Guanting Reservoir basin, China","Evaluating the spatial relationship between the supply of and demand for cultural ecosystem services (CESs) in rapidly urbanizing watersheds is critical for landscape planning and the improvement of human well-being. However, few approaches can investigate relationships of multiple CESs in a spatially explicit way and involve different groups of stakeholders. In our study, we developed an integrated approach that combined a survey-driven model (SOlVES) and a text analysis of the social media reviews, using the Guanting Reservoir basin as an example. Three CESs, including aesthetic service, historical and cultural service, and recreational and therapeutic service, were examined. The results showed that 80% of the total area of the basin exhibited a spatial mismatch between CES supply and demand. Among the three CESs, historical and cultural service had the largest mismatched area, which was dominated by a low supply and high demand. For the venue of the 2022 Winter Olympics, Chongli District, all three CESs exhibited spatial mismatches, while the main type of mismatch was low supply and high demand. Urbanization can either promote a match or worsen a mismatch. Therefore, place-based solutions, such as environmental monitoring and promoting tourism, are encouraged to mitigate the mismatch of CES supply and demand in rapidly urbanizing watersheds.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects on perceptions of greenspace benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Calls for investment in green infrastructures, which can provide a range of ecosystem services in support of sustainability and resilience, are increasing amidst the climate crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed for many the important benefits of greenspace to cultural ecosystem services, particularly to individuals' own assessments of their mental and emotional health, or subjective well-being (SWB). This pandemic has also revealed the unevenness of these benefits. In order to better understand the contributions of greenspace to SWB, as well as the distribution of the benefits, during times of shared social-ecological disruption, we investigate perceptions of greenspace and their effect on SWB during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use a mixed methods approach combining data from surveys and interviews conducted with US post-secondary students. Our results indicate that perceiving the outdoors as good for you is related to higher levels of SWB. We also find that both prior experience with nature and current social-environmental circumstances play an important role in shaping this perception. When considered alongside research regarding environmental justice and children's access to nature, these findings suggest a need for both distributional and intergenerational justice in greenspace planning, design, and management, as well as explicit attention to the role of greenspace in coping with future social-ecological disturbance.",Not About Sufficiency
"Modelling the Impact of National vs. Local Emission Reduction on PM2.5 in the West Midlands, UK Using WRF-CMAQ","Ambient air pollution from PM2.5 is a major risk to human and environmental health, with significant impacts on mortality and morbidity. Mitigation policies-which may be regional or national in extent-need to consider both primary and secondary particles to be effective, balancing within-region emissions and longer-range transport phenomena. The modelling system WRF-CMAQ was used to simulate the impact of emissions reductions in the West Midlands region of the UK, evaluating the change in total PM2.5 and in its primary and secondary components. Domestic combustion, road transport and agriculture emissions were reduced individually or in combination, at a national or at local level. Combined reduction of road transport and agriculture emissions showed the strongest reduction (29%) in average PM2.5 if applied at national level. At the local level, reductions from domestic combustion were shown to be the most effective policy (13.4% on average). Secondary inorganic fractions of PM2.5 are the most abundant, with 25% NO3- 21% SO42- and 13% NH4+ on average. Scenario analysis shows that the contribution of secondary components to the fractional change of PM2.5 dominates for national policies (up to 0.86 for NO3-) when road transport and agriculture activities are reduced, while at the regional level the elemental and organic carbon fractional changes are dominant (up to 0.64 for organic carbon).",Not About Sufficiency
Improving ecological function of polluted coasts under a tide of plastic waste,"Unprecedented levels of plastics are entering coastal seas, which are already subject to another insidious pollutant: excess nitrogen. Both pollutants were created to enhance human well-being on land but once in the sea they impair the function of filter-feeding organisms that help maintain coastal water quality. We conceptualized evidence to show that oysters (Ostrea spp), the reefs of which can provide a biological solution for managing water quality, can effectively reduce the threat of algal blooms caused by excess nitrogen pollution, even when exposed to moderate microplastic pollution. Yet the functional collapse of this ecosystem service (filter-feeding by oysters) is at risk if current trends in plastic pollution continue, and pollution thresholds that predict functional collapse have already been exceeded in the world's most polluted rivers. Nevertheless, although the plastic problem is daunting, growing social and political awareness of the need to reduce plastic waste provides hope that a sustainable material society can be attained.",Not About Sufficiency
Advanced Lead-Acid Batteries and the Development of Grid-Scale Energy Storage Systems,"This paper discusses new developments in leadacid battery chemistry and the importance of the system approach for implementation of battery energy storage for renewable energy and grid applications. The described solution includes thermal management of an UltraBattery bank, an inverter/ charger, and smart grid management, which can monitor the state of charge (SoC) and the state of health (SoH) of the battery during system operation. With such features, it can allow the battery to operate within an optimum SoC window and thus can further maximize the longevity of the UltraBattery. Importantly, the smart battery management can trend the SoH of the battery and allow cell replacement at a convenient time without affecting the system operation. Furthermore, the advanced system package allows remote monitoring and control of operation, thus reducing the running cost of the system. It is clear that the widespread use of renewable-energy systems, in turn, would lead to a reduction in global consumption of the limited supplies of the fossil fuels and in the associated production of greenhouse-gas emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
The changing nature of life cycle assessment,"LCA has evolved fromits origins in energy analysis in the 1960s and 70s into a wide ranging tool used to determine impacts of products or systems over several environmental and resource issues. The approach has become more prevalent in research, industry and policy. Its use continues to expand as it seeks to encompass impacts as diverse as resource accounting and social well being. Carbon policy for bioenergy has driven many of these changes. Enabling assessment of complex issues over a life cycle basis is beneficial, but the process is sometimes difficult. LCA's use in framing is increasingly complex and more uncertain, and in some cases, irreconcilable. The charged environment surrounding biofuels and bioenergy exacerbates all of these. Reaching its full potential to help guide difficult policy discussions and emerging research involves successfully managing LCA's transition from attributional to consequential and from retrospective to prospective. This paper examines LCA's on-going evolution and its use within bioenergy deployment. The management of methodological growth in the context of the unique challenges associated with bioenergy and biofuels is explored. Changes seen in bioenergy LCA will bleed into other LCA arenas, especially where it is important that a sustainable solution is chosen. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Measuring social and environmental impact: a case study,"Social Enterprises (SEs) are part of new business models that seek to achieve two concurrent missions: economic and social/environmental. These businesses aim to minimize socio-environmental problems by offering products and services focused on socioenvironmental sustainability. The objective of this research was to analyze the impact measurement process by identifying the main impact indicators established by the investigated SE. The applied methodology is qualitative and descriptive, using a single case study. The chosen case was a SE operating in the organic and agroecological food sector in Fortaleza-CE. The results indicate that impact measurement brings advantages throughout the entire supply chain: for the farmers, the main impact is the guarantee of production and, thus, recurring income. For the SE, the indicators allow for better management organization and provide proof of the positive impact generated. For retail customers, the collected information is used to publicize ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) practices. Regarding the indicators used to measure the SE activities' impact, it was found that they are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the UN (United Nations) for 2030, which are: Poverty Eradication (SDG 1), Zero Hunger (SDG 2), Gender Equality (SDG 5), Reduction of Inequalities (SDG 10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12), and Climate Action (SDG 13).",Not About Sufficiency
Measuring the Importance of Decision-Making Criteria in Biofuel Production Technology Selection,"Environmental problems, combined with a finite supply of fossil fuels, have made the use of renewable energy sources necessary. Biomass is a renewable source of energy that has played a very important role in energy production in recent years. Because there are a number of technologies that can be used to convert biomass into energy, it is important to select the best option. The fact that multiple options are available that need to be evaluated based on a set of decision-making criteria makes this a multicriteria decision-making problem. This paper takes the first step in proposing an evaluation framework and identifying the importance of the relevant decision-making criteria in biofuel production technology selection. To determine the importance of the selection criteria, experts were asked to respond to an online questionnaire based on the best-worst method. The results indicate that air pollution, land use change, and human expertise are the three most important criteria for selecting the best biofuel production technology in our case country, Iran.",Not About Sufficiency
Alternative stabilised rammed earth materials incorporating recycled waste and industrial by-products: Life cycle assessment,"As the Paris Agreement target year of 2030 draws nearer, it is becoming increasingly evident that neither Australia nor many other nations are progressing at a rate sufficient to meet greenhouse gas emissions targets. One area in which to improve performance is in the use of low embodied energy construction materials. Rammed earth (RE) is often considered to be one such material. However, many modern RE variations incorporate cement: a significant contributor to global CO2 emissions. RE materials with low greenhouse gas emissions have been developed as replacements for conventional construction materials. In this series, we examine the strength development, durability and sustainability, via life cycle assessment, of these new materials. This paper explores the cradle-to-gate greenhouse gas emissions of RE materials incorporating recycled waste (crushed brick and concrete), industrial by-products (ground granulated blast furnace slag, fly ash and silica fume) and either NaOH or hydrated lime. These are then compared to construction techniques conventionally used in Australia (cavity brick and brick veneer). Attributional life cycle assessments were carried out for hypothetical building envelopes suitable for climate zones 1-7, assuming construction in metropolitan Perth and 600 km inland (Kalgoorlie, WA). Results showed that greenhouse gas emissions per vertical square metre of wall could be reduced by 73% or 57% respectively when compared to traditional cavity brickwork or brick veneer. This is in contrast to RE incorporating cement, which produced a saving of just 15% compared to brick veneer. If this construction technique were adopted across Australia for new, detached dwellings constructed during 2021-2030, this could represent a greenhouse gas reduction of 11.3 million tonnes CO2eq, or 1.2-1.3% of the cumulative emissions reductions required in 2021-2030 to meet Australia's Paris Agreement targets.

Metal-organic framework-based catalysts toward the electrosynthesis of urea,"Nitrogen-based fertilizer, primarily urea, production generates 2.1% of global CO2 emissions through the energy-intensive Bosch-Meiser process.

While numerous review articles have focused on the electrocatalytic synthesis of urea using nanostructures or heterostructures composed of transition metal alloys that leverage the synergistic effects of distinct metal catalytic sites, no comprehensive reviews have explored the application of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in this context. Following the publication of the Nature Synthesis paper in 2024, which reported a nearly fivefold increase in yield rate compared to existing catalysts, we revisited the electrosynthesis of urea using MOF materials. Over the past two years, a few high-impact papers have been published on MOF-based materials, which have emerged as promising catalysts for electrochemical urea synthesis, demonstrating notable efficiency and stability. This review aims to highlight these MOF-based materials, their catalytic performance, and underlying mechanism in electrocatalytic urea synthesis.",Not About Sufficiency
Metamorphization of society: The factor of 'side effects' and globaliza-tion of nothing,"Today physical, biological and social worlds develop increasingly quicker and in a more complex way that includes the phenomena of metamorphoses. Traditionally, they were considered as determined mainly by external factors, i.e. the forces of nature. Contemporary metamorphoses seem to become of a complex man-made nature. Compared to traditional metamorphoses with 'rigid' and predictable results, contemporary metamorphoses of societies can produce both negative and positive consequences, which proves the non-linear dynamic picture of the world. There is also a traumatic tendency - when something is metamorphosed into 'nothing'. Due to digitalization, 'nothing' becomes more complex and 'pure' from cultural and humane characteristics, thus, revealing new expressions of the 'death' of the social: humans are metamorphosed into 'digital beings'. Metamorphization of society can produce common goods as a side effect of the bad. The author argues that the formal-rational, pragmatic transformations of society and nature, like the scientific and technological innovations of mercantile type, deform and dehumanize life-worlds. The global traumatization in the form of 'liquid' catastrophes permanently changes the living and non-living nature, structure of soil, water and air, desocializes human relations, facilitates transformations of something into nothing, people into 'non-people', places into 'non-places', things into 'non-things'. However, people as reflexive actors can turn metamorphoses into 'things-for-man'. To start this process, it is necessary to change the pragmatic monodisciplinary principles of science by the interdisciplinarity ones to ensure a humanistic turn in science and technologies.",Not About Sufficiency
"Methane and nitrous oxide fluxes from reference, restored, and disturbed estuarine wetlands in Pacific Northwest, USA","There is substantial interest in restoring tidal wetlands because of their high rates of long-term soil carbon sequestration and other valued ecosystem services. However, these wetlands are sometimes net sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) that may offset their climate cooling potential. GHG fluxes vary widely within and across tidal wetlands, so it is essential to better understand how key environmental drivers, and importantly, land management, affect GHG dynamics. We measured methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes at 26 reference and restored tidal wetland sites and eight nontidal pastures (mostly diked former tidal wetlands) in five estuaries in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), USA. We measured fluxes 7-8 times over one year to assess the effects of environmental drivers, wetland type, and land management on CH4 and N2O fluxes. Linear relationships between CH4 fluxes and environmental drivers were poor, but a machine-learning approach with boosted regression trees provided strong predictability for fluxes based upon wetland surface elevation, water-table level, and salinity. Less important variables were groundwater pH, wetland type, and temperature. Under oligohaline conditions, CH4 fluxes were variable and sometimes very high, but fluxes at salinities above 2 ppt were relatively low on an annual basis. Fluxes of CH4 were higher in restored tidal marshes and wet pastures than in reference tidal marshes, tidal swamps, and dry pastures. The N2O model had lower predictive power than the CH4 model, with wetland type as the most important factor, although N2O fluxes across all wetland types were low (median of zero). Our results indicate that estuarine hydrologic gradients are a key driver of CH4 fluxes and that wetland land use impacts on CH4 fluxes are largely mediated by their varying environmental conditions. In the PNW, estuarine wetlands that have low salinity, lower elevation, and have high water tables are more likely to have increased CH4 emissions that may offset their carbon sequestration benefits until they gain enough elevation through accretion. This study also provides a transferrable modeling approach to predict the consequences of coastal wetland management on GHG fluxes using monitoring data from a limited set of key environmental drivers.",Not About Sufficiency
Methanol production from biomass and natural gas as transportation fuel,"Two processes are examined for production of methanol. They are assessed against the essential requirements of a future alternative fuel for road transport: that it (i) is producible in amounts comparable to the 19 EJ of motor fuel annually consumed in the U.S., (ii) minimizes emissions of criteria pollutants, (iii) reduces greenhouse gas emissions from production and use, (iv) is cost-competitive with petroleum fuel, and (v) is compatible with the emerging vehicle technologies, especially those powered by fuel cells. The methanol yield, production cost, and potential for reduction of overall fuel-cycle CO2 emissions were evaluated and compared to those of reformulated gasoline. The results show that a process utilizing natural gas and biomass as cofeedstocks can meet the five requirements more effectivly than individual processes utilizing those feedstocks separately. When end-use efficiencies are accounted for, the cost per vehicle mile traveled would be less than that of gasoline used in current vehicles. CO2 emissions from the vehicle fleet would be reduced 66% by methanol used in fuel cell vehicles and 8-36% in flexible-fuel or dedicated-methanol vehicles during the transition period. Methanol produced from natural gas and biomass, together in one process, and used in fuel cell vehicles would leverage petroleum displacement by a factor of about 5 and achieve twice the overall CO2 emission reduction obtainable from the use of biomass alone.",Not About Sufficiency
Mexico at the crossroads of natural resource dependence and COP26 pledge: Does technological innovation help?,"The nexus between natural resource depletion and environmental quality has been a heated topic of debate among policy experts in recent years. This nexus is crucial to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 which deals with climate change mitigation. However, the extant literature has not paid due attention to this nexus, particularly in the case of Mexico. Against this backdrop, the present study examines the relationship between ecological footprint and natural resource depletion, economic growth, energy consumption, technological innovation, and foreign direct investment in the Mexican economy. The present research leverages the novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) simulations approach and uses annual frequency data from 1980 to 2018. Empirical findings from the ARDL bounds test substantiate the presence of long-run association among studied variables. Furthermore, the result of the novel dynamic ARDL simulation does not validate the Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. Thus, implying that Mexico's economy remains at the scale stage, with a scope of economic expansion relative to environmental quality. However, the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH) is validated. Interestingly, natural resource rent accompanied with energy use and foreign direct investment deteriorate the environmental quality in the short-and long-run. However, technological innovation seems to emanate as a panacea for environmental degradation in the long-run. Result analysis also demonstrates that 10% positive and negative simulation graphs for the studied variables. The Frequency Domain Causality analysis also corroborates the above findings.

"Microalgal-Based Bioenergy: Strategies, Prospects, and Sustainability","The fuel crisis with the slumping reserves of fossil fuels and the exponential increase in the demand of energy necessitate a paradigm shift to a more sustainable and eco-friendly energy system. Microalgal biofuel has been recognized as one of the most prominent and versatile alternative renewable energy sources because it can be converted into a wide array of biofuels, such as biodiesel, bioethanol, bioelectricity and biogases such as syngas, methane, hydrogen, and hythane etc., with a lower carbon emission profile. To attain the economic viability of algal fuels, a collective biorefinery approach addressing both the operational and technical limitations is quintessential. The current review critically analyzes and categorizes energy aspects of microalgae through various direct and indirect approaches with the perspective of a circular economy. These approaches include complicated thermochemical and biochemical processes integrating the recovery of a wide range of value-added products apart from biofuels, thus defining a cascading approach for a multiproduct-based biorefinery model. A glimpse of recent technological advancements comprising hybrid cultivation systems, prospects of co-culturing, and the role of automated/modeling approaches in the industrial-scale production of ""algal-based bioenergy"" is also discussed in detail. Further, the review has also scrutinized and highlighted the developments and bottlenecks in genetic and molecular aspects of strain improvement for bioenergy production.

Microplastics in aquatic bodies: Assessing the role of governance mechanisms in industrial wastewater management,"The purpose of this research is to examine the association between corporate governance mechanisms (board independence, board gender diversity, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) duality, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) linked compensation) and wastewater recycling as a strategy for managing the flow of microplastics into the aquatic environment. The study analysed an international sample of top companies on the Forbes 500 list over a 15-year period during the millennium development goals (MDGs) and sustainable development goals (SDGs) eras. Multiple regression analysis with fixed effect OLS, two-stage least squares regression, propensity score matching, and logistic regression were applied in the data analysis. The results show that, at the aggregate level, board gender diversity is positively associated with wastewater recycling, whilst CEO duality has a significant negative impact. When disaggregated into industries, board gender diversity is positively associated with wastewater recycling in high-polluting and low-polluting industries. In relation to the MDGs/ SDGs eras, the impact of board gender diversity is more significant in the MDGs era than in the SDGs era. At the geographical region level, CEO duality has a significant negative impact on wastewater management in the America and Asia Pacific regions, whilst the effect of CEO duality is significantly positive in the Western Europe region. We also find that a minimum of two female directors is required to improve wastewater management practice. The study concludes that whilst board gender diversity is a notable driver of wastewater management, CEO duality diminishes the commitment of multinational entities (MNEs) to addressing wastewater management issues. Our result is robust to (i) alternative measures of wastewater management, (ii) alternate sample composition, (iii) alternate method of data analysis, and (iv) endogeneity checks.

The model optimizes CO2 management infrastructure at a variety of carbon prices for the oil sands industry. Our study reveals several key findings. We find that the oil sands industry lends itself well to development of CO2 trunk lines due to geographic coincidence of sources and sinks. This reduces the relative importance of transport costs compared to nonintegrated transport systems. Also, the amount of managed oil sands CO2 emissions, and therefore the CCS infrastructure, is very sensitive to the carbon price; significant capture and storage occurs only above 110$/tonne CO2 in our simulations. Deployment of infrastructure is also sensitive to CO2 capture decisions and technology, particularly the fraction of capturable CO2 from oil sands upgrading and steam generation facilities. The framework will help stakeholders and policy makers understand how CCS infrastructure, including an extensive pipeline system, can be safely and cost-effectively deployed.",Not About Sufficiency
"Miscanthus, a host for larvae of a European population of Diabrotica v. virgifera","The EU policies for decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions present challenging targets for bioenergy production. Field trials in Europe of Miscanthus x giganteus (Poales: Poaceae) over the past 20 years have shown that this plant is suitable for the production of biomass but the economic models promoting its use for this purpose often assume that controlling its pests will cost little or nothing. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine whether this plant is suitable for the development of larvae of the western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), which is an important pest of maize. Larvae of WCR, originating from a Central and South Eastern European population, can develop on Miscanthus.",Not About Sufficiency
Mitigation strategies to enhance carbon sink potential in climate vulnerable districts of Eastern India,"As per the commitment of COP-21, reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under various production systems without affecting productivity is one of the important challenges in addressing global warming. To address this, environmentally and economically efficient climate resilient management practices were identified under the National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) project and were implemented in the sixteen study villages of four districts of Eastern India. In this study, the GHG emissions in terms of C balance in tCO(2)eq due to the adoption of climate resilient practices in agriculture, livestock and forestry were estimated using the EX-ACT model that was developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN). EX-ACT tool was found to be an user-friendly and easy tool to assess the C balance in small areas with diverse climate and soil types. The findings of this study reveal that there is a sink due to the adoption of mitigation strategies (climate resilient management practices) in annuals, perennials and afforestration, while a source (emissions) was observed in irrigated rice, land use change and fertilizer use (inputs). When all the components were considered instead of a single component, the overall C balance in the study villages was found negative, suggesting a sink.",Not About Sufficiency
Reasoned decisions in construction contracts evaluation,"Preparation of an agreement has a great influence on economic success of both parties and on their behaviour in order to increase their profits and to protect themselves against a possible loss. It is important to use technological innovations in construction contracting. Even when the contractor is selected and the price and work terms are negotiated, it is possible to choose several variants of agreements. The aim of this article is to develop a hierarchical model of criteria of a construction contract agreement based on their functions. Construction contract agreements can he concluded, evaluated and compared on the basis of this model. The model forms the basis of decision support system for analysis of construction contracts. Decision support system created on the basis of the presented model can be very useful and helpful in construction contract agreement and can be widely implemented in different construction sectors.",Not About Sufficiency
MNCs and sustainable business practice: The case of the Colombian and Peruvian petroleum industries,"Multinational corporations (MNCs) play an increasingly important role in the economic development strategies of many less developed countries (LDCs). At the same time the sustainable development of LDCs requires economic growth to be accompanied by environmental protection and greater social equity. This paper contributes to the literature concerned with MNCs' contribution to the sustainable development of LDCs. The concept of sustainable business practice (SBP) is proposed as relevant to understanding MNCs' contribution, and an analytical framework incorporating the content, context, and process of SEP is used to examine what SEP might consist of, as well as those conditions important for its widespread adoption. Results from a study examining the Colombian and Peruvian petroleum industries show that despite important contributions by MNCs to sustainable development, SEP is not yet widespread. The study also shows the importance of external institutional pressures-principally in the form of local legislation-for MNCs' contribution to the sustainable development of LDCs. Finally the paper shows how the process of change toward more SBP is closely linked to the external context in which MNCs operate, the characteristics of their internal context, and the internal and external processes linking these contexts.

Mobilization of aged and biolabile soil carbon by tropical deforestation,"In the mostly pristine Congo Basin, agricultural land-use change has intensified in recent years. One potential and understudied consequence of this deforestation and conversion to agriculture is the mobilization and loss of organic matter from soils to rivers as dissolved organic matter. Here, we quantify and characterize dissolved organic matter sampled from 19 catchments of varying deforestation extent near Lake Kivu over a two-week period during the wet season. Dissolved organic carbon from deforested, agriculturally dominated catchments was older (C-14 age: similar to 1.5 kyr) and more biolabile than from pristine forest catchments. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that this aged organic matter from deforested catchments was energy rich and chemodiverse, with higher proportions of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing formulae. Given the molecular composition and biolability, we suggest that organic matter from deforested landscapes is preferentially respired upon disturbance, resulting in elevated in-stream concentrations of carbon dioxide. We estimate that while deforestation reduces the overall flux of dissolved organic carbon by approximately 56%, it does not significantly change the yield of biolabile dissolved organic carbon. Ultimately, the exposure of deeper soil horizons through deforestation and agricultural expansion releases old, previously stable, and biolabile soil organic carbon into the modern carbon cycle via the aquatic pathway.",Not About Sufficiency
Modeled regional climate change and California endemic oak ranges,"In the coming century, anthropogenic climate change will threaten the persistence of restricted endemic species, complicating conservation planning. Although most efforts to quantify potential shifts in species' ranges use global climate model (GCM) output, regional climate model (RCM) output may be better suited to predicting shifts by restricted species, particularly in regions with complex topography or other regionally important climate-forcing factors. Using a RCM-based future climate scenario, we found that potential ranges of two California endemic oaks, Quercus douglasii and Quercus lobata, shrink considerably (to 59% and 54% of modern potential range sizes, respectively) and shift northward. This result is markedly different from that obtained by using a comparable GCM-based scenario, under which these species retain 81% and 73% of their modern potential range sizes, respectively. The difference between RCM- and GCM-based scenarios is due to greater warming and larger precipitation decreases during the growing season predicted by the RCM in these species' potential ranges. Based on the modeled regional climate change, < 50% of protected land area currently containing these species is expected to contain them under a future midrange ""business-as-usual"" path of greenhouse gas emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
Modeling approaches to detect land-use changes: Urbanization analyzed on a set of 43 US catchments,"Paired catchment approach probably provides the most robust method to detect the effects of land-use change on catchments' flow characteristics. This approach is limited by the availability of two neighbor catchments with and without land-use change under similar climate conditions. This paper uses a hydrological model to detect the hydrological change caused by urbanization. This study describes (1) use a statistical method to evaluate change detection relative to variation of land use change, (2) simulation of non-urban condition for the urban catchment with an alternative approach, to this aim stream flow series of urban catchments have been reconstructed from the period that urbanization had not taken place yet, and (3) the model validation with observed data. This paper intends to compare the flow changes detected by two different approaches: a regional statistical approach (the paired-catchment approach) and a conceptual modeling approach (the residual approach) on the particular case of urbanized catchments. To investigate the sensitivity of the results to the settings of both approaches, the comparison is made on a relatively large number of 43 catchments located in the United States, with relatively large gradients in terms of geomorphology and hydroclimatic characteristics. Results show that the two approaches are generally in relative good agreement in terms of detection and quantification of changes for the three flow characteristics analyzed (mean annual flow, high and low flow characteristics). Besides, it is found that the impact of urbanization on the catchment's hydrologic response is difficult to generalize: the proportion of nonsignificant trends, significantly increasing decreasing trends are on the same order of magnitude, even if an increase in urban areas generally has a greater impact on mean flows and high flows than on low flows.

Modeling residential water demand: An approach based on household demand systems,"Most estimations of residential water demand are based on single-equation models that rely on assumptions that are most often not compatible with the fundamental principles of consumer theory. In this paper, we relax these assumptions by using a more flexible system of demand estimation, the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) (Banks et al., 1997) and reveal the existence in our sample of substitution and complementary patterns as well as non-linearities in Engel curves for water consumption. Water demand would not be, therefore, linear in income and separable from other goods consumed within the household. In this context the QUAIDS functional specification is expected to be more consistent with observed consumer behavior. Our results seem to confirm this expectation; when compared to the linear, log-linear and double-log models commonly used in water demand estimation, QUAIDS seems to produce a better overall fit and a better fit to the asymmetric shape of the real distribution of water consumption. This has important implications in terms of public policy, as it allows to explore how water policies interact with other goods consumed within the household (e.g. water-energy nexus or efficient household appliances). Furthermore, differential responses to pricing policies and taxes across the income distribution can be considered, thus contributing to avoid undesired redistributive effects and water poverty.",Not About Sufficiency

A detailed error components model is estimated to identify persistent and transitory components of (the trends of) log-earnings variance and to disentangle the contributions to it of native, immigrant and cross-border workers. The model is flexible and allows for a high degree of individual, age, time and cohort heterogeneity. We observe a surprising stability in overall earnings inequality as a result of more complex underlying changes, with marked increases in persistent inequality (except among natives), a growing contribution of foreigners and a decrease in earnings instability (primarily for natives).",Not About Sufficiency
Monitoring gas flaring in Texas using time-series sentinel-2 MSI and landsat-8 OLI images,"Since the shale Oil/Gas revolution, gas flaring and venting in the United States has garnered increasing attention. There is a pressing need to understand the spatial-temporal characteristics of gas flaring and track the associated greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, we use a thermal anomaly index (TAI) incorporating the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computation and local batch processing for monitoring gas flaring and characterizing its spatial-temporal dynamics. We then apply a quantitative analysis of satellite-based carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the gas flaring region. Here, we generate a gas flaring sites inventory in Texas from 2013 to 2022 based on > 83,500 multi-source moderate-resolution images (including 74,627 Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument [MSI] images and 8,969 Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager [OLI] images). Validations and comparisons demonstrate that our method is reliable for MSI and OLI images, with an overall accuracy of > 95 % and a low commission rate and omission rate. We detected 217,034 gas flares from 9,296 flaring sites in Texas, and the majority (>92 %) were found in the central and western regions of the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale. The number of detected gas flaring sites vastly outnumbered the existing Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) fire products, with an upward trend from 2013 to 2019 and a downward trend from 2020 to 2022. Notably, the gas flaring sites dropped significantly at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (from December 2019 to May 2020), with the lowest average monthly growth rate of 14.38 %, and fell to the level of mid-2017. Application of gas flaring data identifies the localized greenhouse gas (GHG) emission hotspots in Texas and demonstrates that the increased effect of CH4 released from gas flaring regions was significantly stronger than that of CO2. These findings can provide references for monitoring similar small industrial sources in the future, can be used as an essential supplement to low-resolution fire products, and improve our understanding of CO2 and CH4 emissions from gas flaring at fine spatial scales.",Not About Sufficiency
Multidimensional Urban Exposure Analysis of Industrial Chemical Risk Scenarios in Mexican Metropolitan Areas,"Risk scenarios are caused by the convergence of a hazard with a potentially affected system in a specific place and time. One urban planning goal is to prevent environmental hazards, such as those generated by chemical accidents, from reaching human settlements, as they can cause public health issues. However, in many developing countries, due to their strategic positioning in global value chains, the quick and easy access to labor pools, and competitive production costs, urban sprawls have engulfed industrial areas, exposing residential conurbations to environmental hazards. This case study analyzes the spatial configuration of accidental chemical risk scenarios in three major Mexican metropolitan areas: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. Spatial analyses use an areal locations of hazardous atmosphere (ALOHA) dispersion model to represent the spatial effects of high-risk industrial activities in conurbations and the potentially affected populations vulnerable to chemical hazards. Complementary geostatistical correlation analyses use population data, marginalization indexes, and industrial clustering sectors to identify trends that can lead to comprehensive environmental justice approaches. In addition, the marginalization degree of inhabitants evaluates social inequalities concerning chemical risk scenarios.",Not About Sufficiency
Greenhouse Gas Mass-Balance in Conventional Activated Sludge Wastewater Treatment: A Case Study in Mexico for Developing Countries,"While numerous studies report methane emissions from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in developed countries, few address emissions from plants in developing countries, where outdated technologies, such as the lack of enhanced primary and sludge treatment, are common. Moreover, these studies often rely on indirect calculations rather than direct measurements. Our study fills this gap by providing unit-process-level direct measurements of methane emissions in a conventional WWTP in Mexico, serving as a case study for developing countries. A standard plant was selected and visited on five occasions. It includes a primary settler, an aerated reactor, and a secondary settler, with no sludge treatment in place. Our findings revealed a CH4 emission factor of 0.396 +/- 0.218 g CH4 m-3 of treated water, with the primary settler accounting for 72.3 +/- 15.9% of emissions, and the aerated reactor contributing 27.7 +/- 15.9%. Notably, the emission factors are comparable to those reported for plants with more advanced treatment technologies, suggesting that technological obsolescence may not significantly enhance CH4 emissions. Methanotrophy in the aerated reactor was a key process, oxidizing 91-98% of the CH4 transported from the primary settler. Additionally, a carbon dioxide (CO2) emission factor of 97.4 +/- 34.4 g CO2 m-3 was measured, primarily from the aerated reactor, consistent with the plant's overall treatment efficiency. These findings provide crucial data for understanding greenhouse gas emissions from WWTPs in developing regions and highlight the need for targeted mitigation strategies.",Not About Sufficiency
"Multi-criteria decision making for sustainability assessment of boxboard production: A life cycle perspective considering water consumption, energy consumption, GHG emissions, and internal costs","Papermaking is a capital-intensive industry that requires a high consumption of plant fibers, energy, and water. Previous sustainability assessments of papermaking industry primarily focused on separate evaluations for multiple criteria without the integration for criteria and could not compare the overall priority of the production alternatives. The life cycle sustainability for the most representative boxboard production is analyzed as a case study in this work. Life cycle water consumption, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and internal costs are selected as the assessment criteria. The two multi-criteria decision-making methods are applied to integrate the above criteria to obtain the sustainability sequence under different production pathways. When the papermaking enterprises are regarded as decision-makers, the alternative using waste paper as raw material to manufacture boxboard is the most sustainable, following by mixed fiber. The sustainability sequence of the alternatives using wood and straw as raw materials is controversial due to the different calculation models. Changing the proportion of raw materials and the criteria weights might adjust sustainability sequence of the alternatives.",Not About Sufficiency
"Multidimensional Social Exclusion and the ""Rural-Urban Divide' in Eastern Europe and Central Asia","Rural areas in the transition countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia are often excluded from the fruits of economic growth.

Social exclusion, measured by three dimensions, exclusion from economic life, exclusion from social services, and exclusion from civic life and social networks, is captured by an innovative multidimensional exclusion index (MEI), developed in the Regional Human Development Report. The empirical base for the MEI is a set of large household surveys in six transition countries, Kazakhstan, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, Serbia, Tajikistan, and Ukraine, held in the period September-November 2009, during the height of the economic crisis.

Multi-model projections of twenty-first century North Pacific winter wave climate under the IPCC A2 scenario,"A dynamical wave model implemented over the North Pacific Ocean was forced with winds from three coupled global climate models (CGCMs) run under a medium-to-high scenario for greenhouse gas emissions through the twenty-first century. The results are analyzed with respect to changes in upper quantiles of significant wave height (90th and 99th percentile H-S) during boreal winter. The three CGCMs produce surprisingly similar patterns of change in winter wave climate during the century, with waves becoming 10-15 % smaller over the lower mid-latitudes of the North Pacific, particularly in the central and western ocean. These decreases are closely associated with decreasing windspeeds along the southern flank of the main core of the westerlies. At higher latitudes, 99th percentile wave heights generally increase, though the patterns of change are less uniform than at lower latitudes. The increased wave heights at high latitudes appear to be due a variety of wind-related factors including both increased windspeeds and changes in the structure of the wind field, these varying from model to model. For one of the CGCMs, a commonly used statistical approach for estimating seasonal quantiles of H-S on the basis of seasonal mean sea level pressure (SLP) is used to develop a regression model from 60 years of twentieth century data as a training set, and then applied using twenty-first century SLP data. The statistical model reproduces the general pattern of decreasing twenty-first century wave heights south of similar to 40 N, but underestimates the magnitude of the changes by similar to 50-70 %, reflecting relatively weak coupling between sea level pressure and wave heights in the CGCM data and loss of variability in the statistically projected wave heights.",Not About Sufficiency
Multiobjective Integrated Planning and Scheduling of the Energy Infrastructure of the Oil Sands Industry Incorporating Intermittent Renewable Energy,"The energy infrastructure for oil sands operations can be classified as a decentralized energy system, in which energy requirements (i.e., power, heat and hydrogen) are generated near the end-users, and can operate with interactions with the local Alberta grid, in which it feeds surplus power generated to it. In this study, a mathematical optimization model is developed for the integrated planning and scheduling of the energy infrastructure of the oil sands industry. The contributions of various energy sources including conventional, renewables, and nuclear are investigated. Power-to-gas for energy storage is incorporated to manage surplus power generated from intermittent renewable energy sources, particularly wind. The wind-electrolysis system included incorporates two hydrogen recovery pathways, which are power-to-gas and power-to-gas-to-power using natural gas generators. The problem is modeled as a multiobjective and multiperiod mixed integer linear programming model that minimizes the system cost (energy production and storage), grid cost, and total greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to including the grid cost and emissions in the objective function, grid-interaction is incorporated in the optimization model through the unit commitment operations of the existing power generation units of the grid. The proposed model is designed to evaluate the optimal operation and sizing of the energy producers and the energy storage system as well as the interactions between them. The epsilon constraint method is used to solve the multiobjective aspect of the proposed model. To illustrate its applicability, the model is applied to a case study based on the oil sands industry in Alberta for the integrated planning and scheduling of its energy infrastructure for the year 2017.",Not About Sufficiency
Multi-Objective Optimal Design of a Hydrogen Supply Chain Powered with Agro-Industrial Wastes from the Sugarcane Industry: A Mexican Case Study,"This paper presents an optimization modeling approach to support strategic planning for designing hydrogen supply chain (HSC) networks. The energy source for hydrogen production is proposed to be electricity generated at Mexican sugar factories. This study considers the utilization of existing infrastructure in strategic areas of the country, which brings several advantages in terms of possible solutions. This study aims to evaluate the economic and environmental implications of using biomass wastes for energy generation, and its integration to the national energy grid, where the problem is addressed as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), adopting maximization of annual profit, and minimization of greenhouse gas emissions as optimization criteria. Input data is provided by sugar companies and the national transport and energy information platform, and were represented by probability distributions to consider variability in key parameters. Independent solutions show similarities in terms of resource utilization, while also significant differences regarding economic and environmental indicators. Multi-objective optimization was performed by a genetic algorithm (GA). The optimal HSC network configuration is selected using a multi-criteria decision technique, i.e., TOPSIS. An uncertainty analysis is performed, and main economic indicators are estimated by investment assessment. Main results show the trade-off interactions between the HSC elements and optimization criteria.

"Blockchain Adoption for Sustainable Supply Chain Management: Economic, Environmental, and Social Perspectives","Due to the rapid increase in environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources, the focus of researchers is shifted from economic to socio-environmental problems. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has the potential to restructure the entire supply chain for sustainable practices. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides a digital database for recording all the transactions of the supply chain. The main purpose of this research is to explore the literature relevant to blockchain for sustainable supply chain management. The focus of this review is on the sustainability of the blockchain-based supply chain concerning environmental conservation, social equality, and governance effectiveness. Using a systematic literature review, a total of 136 articles were evaluated and categorized according to the triple bottom-line aspects of sustainability. Challenges and barriers during blockchain adoption in different industrial sectors such as aviation, shipping, agriculture and food, manufacturing, automotive, pharmaceutical, and textile industries were critically examined. This study has not only explored the economic, environmental, and social impacts of blockchain but also highlighted the emerging trends in a circular supply chain with current developments of advanced technologies along with their critical success factors. Furthermore, research areas and gaps in the existing research are discussed, and future research directions are suggested. The findings of this study show that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the entire supply chain from a sustainability perspective. Blockchain will not only improve the economic sustainability of the supply chain through effective traceability, enhanced visibility through information sharing, transparency in processes, and decentralization of the entire structure but also will help in achieving environmental and social sustainability through resource efficiency, accountability, smart contracts, trust development, and fraud prevention. The study will be helpful for managers and practitioners to understand the procedure of blockchain adoption and to increase the probability of its successful implementation to develop a sustainable supply chain network.",Not About Sufficiency
EMF-33 insights on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS),"This paper explores the potential role of bioenergy coupled to carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (BECCS) in long-term global scenarios. We first validate past insights regarding the potential use of BECCS in achieving climate goals based on results from 11 integrated assessment models (IAMs) that participated in the 33rd study of the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum (EMF-33). As found in previous studies, our results consistently project large-scale cost-effective BECCS deployment. However, we also find a strong synergistic nexus between CCS and biomass, with bioenergy the preferred fuel for CCS as the climate constraint increases. Specifically, the share of bioenergy that is coupled to CCS technologies increases since CCS effectively enhances the emissions mitigation capacity of bioenergy. For the models that include BECCS technologies across multiple sectors, there is significant deployment in conjunction with liquid fuel or hydrogen production to decarbonize the transportation sector. Using a wide set of scenarios, we find carbon removal to be crucial to achieving goals consistent with 1.5 degrees C warming. However, we find earlier BECCS deployment but not necessarily greater use in the long-term since ultimately deployment is limited by economic competition with other carbon-free technologies, especially in the electricity sector, by land-use competition (especially with food) affecting biomass feedstock availability and price, and by carbon storage limitations. The extent of BECCS deployment varies based on model assumptions, with BECCS deployment competitive in some models below carbon prices of 100 US$/tCO(2). Without carbon removal, 2 degrees C is infeasible in some models, while those that solve find similar levels of bioenergy use but substantially greater mitigation costs. Overall, the paper provides needed transparency regarding BECCS' role, and results highlight a strong nexus between bioenergy and CCS, and a large reliance on not-yet-commercial BECCS technologies for achieving climate goals.",Not About Sufficiency

N2O emission and bacterial community dynamics during realization of the partial nitrification process,"In this study, greenhouse gas emissions and microbial community succession during the realization of the partial nitrification (PN) process were studied. The results show that N2O emission mainly occurred in the aerobic stage and the PN reactor released about 20 mg of N2O gas each cycle. There is a positive correlation between the dissolved N2O concentration and the temperature of a typical cycle. High-throughput sequencing was used to illustrate succession in the microbial community structure. The most significant microfloral change during the PN startup process was that some aerobic bacteria were relatively enriched and some anaerobic bacteria were weeded out. The ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) like Nitrosomonadaceae were enriched on account of the suitable external environment. Pseudomonas whose main function is denitrification declined and Planctomyces (anammox) showed the same tendency.

National blue carbon assessment in Spain using InVEST: Current state and future perspectives,"Coastal and marine ecosystems supply multiple services in which human well-being is highly dependent. However, high-resolution spatial distribution studies of marine ecosystem services are scarce, even if it is known that this information is needed to better manage and conserve these ecosystems. With the aim of filling this gap, in this study we have: (1) mapped and assessed the current capacity of marine phanerogams (Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa, Zostera noltii, Zostera marina, and Halophila decipiens) to store and sequester blue carbon in Spain; (2) mapped and assessed the future capacity of marine phanerogams to store and sequester blue carbon under three plausible futures; and (3) assess the economic implications of these scenarios. Our results are based on the InVEST Blue Carbon model and exhibit high spatial resolution (100 m/pixel) of carbon stored in marine phanerogams. We found that 82% of carbon storage and sequestration by marine phanerogams is currently managed within Natura 2000 areas. However, results from the modeled future scenarios indicate a constant decrease in the amount of carbon stored in these ecosystems by 2050 (24% lost in the business-as-usual scenario). The economic impact of these losses is equivalent to 17,974 million euro (around 1.6% of the Spanish GDP). Finally, we consider that a transformative management change is needed to conserve marine phanerogams in Spain, and we discuss the importance of the Natura 2000 Network in managing marine ecosystems and their services in the near future.",Not About Sufficiency
The Expression of the Country's Modernisation in the Context of Economic Environmental Sustainability: The Case of Lithuania,"In order to develop broader scientific discussions, the authors analyze a contemporary social phenomenon in the field of sustainability-the modernisation of the country in order to preserve the ecosystem, emphasizing one of the most important aspects of modernisation-the context of economic environmental sustainability. Underscoring the importance of this study, the research problem was identified by answering the questions of how the modernisation of the country manifests itself in the context of economic environmental sustainability and what are the consequences for the society. This article examines the factors behind the country's modernisation through the lens of its citizens. The purpose is to analyze the development of modernisation in Lithuania from the perspective of a sustainable economic environment and to form a complex system of indicators for the formation of an effective governance of a modern country.

Negative emissions and the long history of carbon removal,"Recent IPCC assessments highlight a key role for large-scale carbon removal in meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement. This focus on removal, also referred to as negative emissions, is suggestive of novel opportunities, risks, and challenges in addressing climate change, but tends to build on the narrow techno-economic framings that characterize integrated assessment modeling. While the discussion on negative emissions bears important parallels to a wider and older literature on carbon sequestration and carbon sinks, this earlier scholarship-particularly from the critical social sciences-is seldom engaged with by the negative emissions research community. In this article, we survey this ""long history"" of carbon removal and seek to draw out lessons for ongoing research and the emerging public debate on negative emissions. We argue that research and policy on negative emissions should proceed not just from projections of the future, but also from an acknowledgement of past controversies, successes and failures. In particular, our review calls attention to the irreducibly political character of carbon removal imaginaries and accounting practices and urges acknowledgement of past experiences with the implementation of (small-scale) carbon sequestration projects. Our review in this way highlights the importance of seeing continuity in the carbon removal discussion and calls for more engagement with existing social science scholarship on the subject. Acknowledging continuity and embracing an interdisciplinary research agenda on carbon removal are important aspects in making climate change mitigation research more responsible, and a precondition to avoid repeating past mistakes and failures.

"Neo-liberal Macroeconomic Policy and Structural Transformation of Indian Economy: Impact on Income, Employment and Distribution","Predominant objective of macroeconomic policies in developing countries has been to achieve higher level of potential economic growth and sustain it once it is achieved. Macroeconomic policy in India, on the backdrop of severe balance of payment crisis, has witnessed major shift in the early 1990s when neo-liberal economic policy on the pressure of IMF and World Bank has been adopted abandoning the socialist pattern of economic policy pursued in the post-independence period. Since implementation its scope has been consistently widening in terms of economic reform in different sectors of the economy, now its impact both positive and adverse is clearly visible. Since the last two and half decades, the serious adverse implication of the new economic policy is visible, particularly on the widening income inequality, although there has been positive effect on achieved higher aggregate economic growth. The major channel through which it is manifested is less than desired performance on labour market as employment generation has slowed down drastically when compared to the long-term trend in employment generation. In post-1991 period during 1993-1994 and 2011-2012, the growth in employment has been around 1.3% per annum against long-term growth rate of 2.11% per annum between 1977-1978 and 2011-2012. Even those employments generated are mostly in construction and low-productive services sector and are precarious and casual in nature. The paper has contributed in understanding the phenomena of rising inequality in the nature of production, through examination of structure and composition of output, employment and emerging wide disparity across sectors. We have shown by examining output per worker and concentration of workforce across sectors the problem of existing and rising income inequality.",Not About Sufficiency
Network Design Mode of In-Seam Gas Extraction Parameters Using Mathematical Modelling-Take Tangan Colliery as an Example,"Gas extraction is a practical and effective way to guarantee mining-process safety and deliver greater environmental benefits through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increase the supply of a valuable clean gas resource. It has been effective in recent years, however it still has a series of problems that need to be solved. Gas extraction design mainly relies on engineering experience rather than quantitative design, resulting in low input-output ratio of gas extraction because of unreasonable design. How to build a bridge of communication between engineers and scientists is the key to realize scientific gas extraction. In this work, taking our previous gas-coal and gas-coal-heat coupling models of gas extraction as the theoretical basis, a new communication and design concept-an engineering design platform for gas extraction-is proposed using the network mode. Through the platform, on- and off-line interactions between service centre (scientific workers) and design objects (enterprises or individuals), such as data transmission, material review, scheme design and reviews, and so on. It greatly improves the efficiency and standardization of gas extraction design. Appling the networked platform, the gas extraction engineering parameters were quantitatively designed in the working face of 3307, Tangan colliery. According to the extraction time, the working face was divided into 6 extraction units. The number of boreholes were 763, the drilling capacity of coal was 0.03 m/t, and the extraction rate of each unit was more than 25%. The networked mode of in-seam gas extraction design would transform the traditional experience to the quantitative mode.",Not About Sufficiency
New insights into protein-protein interaction modulators in drug discovery and therapeutic advance,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental to cellular signaling and transduction which marks them as attractive therapeutic drug development targets. What were once considered to be undruggable targets have become increasingly feasible due to the progress that has been made over the last two decades and the rapid technological advances. This work explores the influence of technological innovations on PPI research and development. Additionally, the diverse strategies for discovering, modulating, and characterizing PPIs and their corresponding modulators are examined with the aim of presenting a streamlined pipeline for advancing PPI-targeted therapeutics. By showcasing carefully selected case studies in PPI modulator discovery and development, we aim to illustrate the efficacy of various strategies for identifying, optimizing, and overcoming challenges associated with PPI modulator design. The valuable lessons and insights gained from the identification, optimization, and approval of PPI modulators are discussed with the aim of demonstrating that PPI modulators have transitioned beyond early-stage drug discovery and now represent a prime opportunity with significant potential. The selected examples of PPI modulators encompass those developed for cancer, inflammation and immunomodulation, as well as antiviral applications. This perspective aims to establish a foundation for the effective targeting and modulation of PPIs using PPI modulators and pave the way for future drug development.",Not About Sufficiency
New land-usechange scenarios for Brazil: Refining global SSPs with a regional spatially-explicit allocation model,"The future of land use and cover change in Brazil, particularly due to deforestation and forest restoration processes, is critical for the future of global climate and biodiversity, given the richness of its five biomes. These changes in Brazil depend on the interlink between global factors due to its role as one of the main exporters of commodities globally and the national to local institutional, socioeconomic, and biophysical contexts. Aiming to develop scenarios that consider the balance between global (e.g., GDP growth, population growth, per capita consumption of agricultural products, international trade policies, and climatic conditions) and local factors (e.g., land use, agrarian structure, agricultural suitability, protected areas, distance to roads, and other infrastructure projects), a new set of land-use change scenarios for Brazil were developed that aligned with the global structure Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCPs) developed by the global change research community. The narratives of the new scenarios align with SSP1/RCP 1.9 (Sustainable development scenario), SSP2/RCP 4.5 (Middle of the road scenario), and SSP3/RCP 7.0 (Strong inequality scenario). The scenarios were developed by combining the LuccME spatially explicit land change allocation modeling framework and the INLAND surface model to incorporate the climatic variables in water deficit. Based on detailed biophysical, socioeconomic, and institutional factors for each biome in Brazil, we have created spatially explicit scenarios until 2050, considering the following classes: forest vegetation, grassland vegetation, planted pasture, agriculture, a mosaic of small land uses, and forestry. The results aim to detail global models regionally. They could be used regionally to support decision-making and enrich the global analysis.",Not About Sufficiency

Nexus between indigenous ecological knowledge and ecosystem services: a socio-ecological analysis for sustainable ecosystem management,"The well-being of the human society cannot be ensured and sustainable unless the flow of Ecosystem Services (ESs) would be matching with their consistent demand. The consistent flow of ESs required sustainable management of ecological resources of the ecosystem. The management of ecosystem can be ensured with variety of approaches. Integration of indigenous ecological knowledge (IEK) in management prescription with the view that IEK-based extraction of ESs ensures removal of resources from the ecosystem within the limit thereby ensuring the sustainability of ecosystem. The present study is an evaluation to understand the nexus between ESs and IEK for sustainable environmental management. The focus of the study was a tribal dominated socio-ecological patch of Barind Region of Malda district, Eastern India. The assessment of ESs and IEK was based on the data collected from the randomly selected tribal households following the pre-tested questionnaire containing questions on ESs as per millennium ecosystem assessment. The data were analyzed following social preference approach, and statistical tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney). General linear model (GLM) has also been used to examine the impact of socio-demographic attributes on the perceived valuation of ESs. The results revealed that the provisioning ESs (such as water, fuel wood, medical plants) were most preferred followed by cultural and regulating ESs by tribal. Differential importance of ESs was observed among tribal and accounted by gender, education as well as age of the tribe. A gap between the actual accessibility and evaluation of ESs by the tribal communities was also apparent. The socio-demographic attributes have an immense impact on the valuation of ESs and also governed based on the IEK. Various types of indigenous ecological belief systems were closely linked with conservation of ecosystem and sustainable supply of ESs. The present study can contribute to understand socio-ecological nexus with the lens of IEK in tribal dominated ecological landscapes for improved ecosystem and environmental management besides ensuring sustainability of flow of ESs.",Not About Sufficiency
Measuring Development of Self-Help Organizations for Patients with Chronic Health Conditions in Hong Kong: Development and Validation of the Self-Help Organization Development Scale (SHODS),"Self-help organizations (SHOs) enable patients with chronic health conditions (PCHCs) to overcome common difficulties through the exchange of knowledge and mutual assistance, which serves as the basis for promoting the self-reliance and well-being of PCHCs. Nevertheless, practical challenges persist because little is known about what and how to evaluate for the developmental outcomes of SHOs. To address this knowledge gap, the present study seeks to develop and validate the Self-Help Organization Development Scale (SHODS). A total of 232 core members from 54 SHOs in Hong Kong participated in our study. The SHODS structure was validated by confirmatory factor analysis. This analysis derived five factors: citizen support, business support, member recovery and mutual aid, organizational health, and functional sustainability. The five-factor structure demonstrated stability across various types of SHOs, as validated by the subgroup analysis based on two criteria: duration of SHO establishment and organization affiliation. Good concurrent validity was supported by significant correlations between the SHODS factors and organizational variables, including staff supervision, staff understanding, networking, advocating, and educating the public and patients. The SHODS also showed excellent internal consistency. In conclusion, the SHODS is a psychometrically sound instrument for measuring the developmental outcomes of SHOs.",Not About Sufficiency
THE NEW RURAL AREA PROGRAM IN VIETNAM FROM THE SENSE OF PLACE THEORY PERSPECTIVE: CASE OF QUANG NAM PROVINCE,"New Rural Area Program (Nong thon moi) has been being promoted in Vietnam successful certified ""standard new rural areas"", following the sustainability direction in rural areas in the world. The overall goal of the central government in Vietnam pictures a new rural area development scheme with environmental sustainability and socio-cultural identity. However, it might not be easy for policy implementation to totally match the initial goal. This paper studies the case of Quang Nam's reports on new rural area development and finds out that while the middle-term goals of developing rural areas' infrastructure and reducing poverty are well reached, a long-term goal of building up rural areas' environment and community for sustainable purposes might not yet be fulfilled. The criteria of new rural area in Vietnam is a top-down ambitious list of every aspect becoming better but the community participation into the program has been limited.

Nitrous oxide production during nitrification from organic solid waste under temperature and oxygen conditions,"Landfill aeration can accelerate the biological degradation of organic waste and reduce methane production; however, it induces nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. Nitrification is one of the pathways of N2O generation as a by-product during aerobic condition. This study was initiated to demonstrate the features of N2O production rate from organic solid waste during nitrification under three different temperatures (20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 40 degrees C) and three oxygen concentrations (5%, 10%, and 20%) with high moisture content and high substrates' concentration. The experiment was carried out by batch experiment using Erlenmeyer flasks incubated in a shaking water bath for 72h. A duplicate experiment was carried out in parallel, with addition of 100Pa of acetylene as a nitrification inhibitor, to investigate nitrifiers' contribution to N2O production. The production rate of N2O ranged between 0.40x10(-3) and 1.14x10(-3) mg N/g-DM/h under the experimental conditions of this study. The rate of N2O production at 40 degrees C was higher than at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Nitrification was found to be the dominant pathway of N2O production. It was evaluated that optimization of O-2 content is one of the crucial parameters in N2O production that may help to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and N turnover during aeration.",Not About Sufficiency
"Sustainability, collapse and oscillations in a simple World-Earth model","The Anthropocene is characterized by close interdependencies between the natural Earth system and the global human society, posing novel challenges to model development. Here we present a conceptual model describing the long-term co-evolution of natural and socio-economic subsystems of Earth. While the climate is represented via a global carbon cycle, we use economic concepts to model socio-metabolic flows of biomass and fossil fuels between nature and society. A well-being-dependent parametrization of fertility and mortality governs human population dynamics. Our analysis focuses on assessing possible asymptotic states of the Earth system for a qualitative understanding of its complex dynamics rather than quantitative predictions. Low dimension and simple equations enable a parameter-space analysis allowing us to identify preconditions of several asymptotic states and hence fates of humanity and planet. These include a sustainable co-evolution of nature and society, a global collapse and everlasting oscillations. We consider different scenarios corresponding to different socio-cultural stages of human history. The necessity of accounting for the 'human factor' in Earth system models is highlighted by the finding that carbon stocks during the past centuries evolved opposing to what would 'naturally' be expected on a planet without humans. The intensity of biomass use and the contribution of ecosystem services to human well-being are found to be crucial determinants of the asymptotic state in a (pre-industrial) biomass-only scenario without capital accumulation. The capitalistic, fossil-based scenario reveals that trajectories with fundamentally different asymptotic states might still be almost indistinguishable during even a centuries-long transient phase. Given current human population levels, our study also supports the claim that besides reducing the global demand for energy, only the extensive use of renewable energies may pave the way into a sustainable future.",Not About Sufficiency
"An Interannual Comparative Study on Ecosystem Carbon Exchange Characteristics in the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, a Dominant Subtropical Evergreen Forest Ecosystem","Compared with other forest systems, research interest in the potential for a stronger ecosystem carbon sequestration of evergreen forests throughout subtropical China has greatly increased. The eddy covariance technique is widely employed to determine accurate forest-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) flux, which is subsequently used to determine forest ecosystem carbon exchange characteristics. The Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, a subtropical monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest, is a suitable study area due to its warm and humid climate (compared with other regions within the same latitude), consequently playing a role in the carbon cycle in the region. For this study, we hypothesized that the forest land in this region generally acts as a carbon sink, and that its carbon sequestration capacity increases over time despite the influence of climatic factors. Here, we compared net CO2 flux data derived from the eddy covariance technique over an 8-year study window. Additionally, we ascertained the effects of various environmental factors on net CO2 flux, while also using the Michaelis-Menten model and a physiologically based process model to track and report on ecosystem carbon exchange characteristics. We observed seasonal trends in daily ecosystem flux, indicative of sensitivity to climatic factors, such as air temperature, precipitation, and sunlight. The carbon sequestration capacity of the region exhibited seasonal variability, increasing from October to March (-264 g C m(-2) year(-1), i.e., 48.4%) while weakening from April to September (-150 g C m(-2) year(-1), i.e., 40.4%) on average. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) rate varied from -518 to -211 g C m(-2) year(-1); ecosystem respiration (Re) varied from 1,142 to 899 g C m(-2) year(-1); and gross primary production (GPP) varied from 1,552 to 1,254 g C m(-2) year(-1). This study found that even though the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve generally acts as a carbon sink, its carbon sequestration capacity did not increase significantly throughout the study period. The techniques (models) used in this study are suitable for application in other ecosystems globally, which can aid in their management and conservation. Finally, the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve is both an exemplary and a model forest system useful in exploring CO2 absorption and sequestration from the atmosphere.</p>",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Customer-Centric Sustainability on Brand Relationships,"This paper contributes to the existing but scarce literature on customer-centric sustainability and measures consumers' perceptions of fast-fashion brands regarding economic, environmental, and social sustainability. Furthermore, it aims to test the impact of each dimension of customer-brand relationships, specifically brand trust, affective brand commitment, and continuance brand commitment. A research model and nine hypotheses were tested through multiple linear regressions using a convenience sample of 228 Portuguese fast-fashion consumers. It also provides additional insights into how consumers' perceptions of the three dimensions of sustainability might affect customer-brand relationships, namely brand trust and brand commitment. The results reveal a significant relationship between all dimensions of customer-centric sustainability and brand trust. Furthermore, economic sustainability and social sustainability were found to significantly predict effective brand commitment. Additionally, this study demonstrates that brand trust positively influences consumers' intentions to maintain long-term relationships with fast-fashion brands. The implications of the results are discussed in detail, shedding light on the importance of incorporating customer-centric sustainability practices into brand management strategies within the fast-fashion industry.

Non-parametric Analysis of Technical Efficiency of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) in India,"The aim of the article is to analyze and evaluate technical efficiency scores of public sector banks (PSBs) in India. The study also determines the nature of return to scale (RTS) of individual banks and thereby identifies the leaders and laggards in the PSBs. To measure the extent of overall technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency (SE), the non-parametric approach, that is, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to determine the causes of inefficiency. The sample of the study includes 26 PSBs operating in India during the time period from 2007-2008 to 2011-2012. The results show that although the PSBs have more or less similar efficiency scores, that is, higher than 0.900, still out of 22 banks falling in the category of efficient banks in 2007-2008, only 7 of them were left by the year 2011-2012. Overall analysis of PSBs during the time period of the study explains that a greater part of inefficiency among PSBs is attributed to scale inefficiency. In addition, the number of banks operating at constant return to scale (CRS) came down to 9 in 2011-2012 from 23 in 2007-2008. Simultaneously, there was a reduction in leaders and increase in laggards.

The greenhouse gas impact of IPCC and ore-sorting technologies,"In-pit crushing and conveying (IPCC) and ore sorting are two developing technologies that, in addition to providing likely economic benefits, also have the potential to reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of mining and mineral processing operations. A life cycle assessment study was carried out to provide estimates of the likely greenhouse gas reductions from the implementation of IPCC and ore sorting technologies in a hypothetical copper mining and mineral processing operation. Based on the assumed configurations and operating characteristics of the two systems, the results indicated that IPCC had 4% less (i.e. 3 kg CO(2)e/t ore or 0.16 kg CO(2)e/t ore.km) greenhouse gas emissions than truck haulage for the base case configuration. Using electricity generated from natural gas rather than black coal increased the greenhouse gas advantage of IPCC over truck haulage from 4% to about 22% (i.e. 14 kg CO(2)e/t ore or 0.74 kg CO(2)e/t ore.km). However, transport distance and annual plant feedrate affect the magnitude of these greenhouse gas reductions. A potential reduction of about 13 kg CO(2)e/t ore in greenhouse gas emissions was estimated from the use of ore sorting technology based on black coal generated electricity, while with natural gas-based electricity the reduction was only 8 kg CO(2)e/t ore. The mass rejection rate of the ore sorting device was the main operational variable affecting the magnitude of this reduction, although it is also affected by the specific comminution and concentration energy requirements of the ore. While the results indicate that ore sorting offers nearly four times the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than IPCC did at the same annual plant feedrate for the base case configuration with black coal-based electricity, the situation was reversed with natural gas-based electricity, with IPCC offering nearly double the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than ore sorting. However, it should be appreciated that due to the limited amount of publicly available data on these technologies at the present time, the results of this study should be viewed as first estimates only.

Prediction of Food Production Using Machine Learning Algorithms of Multilayer Perceptron and ANFIS,"Advancing models for accurate estimation of food production is essential for policymaking and managing national plans of action for food security. This research proposes two machine learning models for the prediction of food production. The adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) methods are used to advance the prediction models. In the present study, two variables of livestock production and agricultural production were considered as the source of food production. Three variables were used to evaluate livestock production, namely livestock yield, live animals, and animal slaughtered, and two variables were used to assess agricultural production, namely agricultural production yields and losses. Iran was selected as the case study of the current study. Therefore, time-series data related to livestock and agricultural productions in Iran from 1961 to 2017 have been collected from the FAOSTAT database. First, 70% of this data was used to train ANFIS and MLP, and the remaining 30% of the data was used to test the models. The results disclosed that the ANFIS model with generalized bell-shaped (Gbell) built-in membership functions has the lowest error level in predicting food production. The findings of this study provide a suitable tool for policymakers who can use this model and predict the future of food production to provide a proper plan for the future of food security and food supply for the next generations.",Not About Sufficiency
Numerical Analysis of the Effects of Ship Motion on Hydrogen Release and Dispersion in an Enclosed Area,"Hydrogen is an alternative to conventional heavy marine fuel oil following the initial strategy of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Although hydrogen energy has many advantages (zero-emission, high efficiency, and low noise), it has considerable fire and explosion risks due to its thermal and chemical characteristics (wide flammable concentration range and low ignition energy). Thus, safety is a key concern related to the use of hydrogen. Whereas most previous studies focused on the terrestrial environment, we aim to analyze the effects of the ship's motion on hydrogen dispersion (using commercial FLUENT code) in an enclosed area. When compared to the steady state, our results revealed that hydrogen reached specific sensors in 63% and 52% less time depending on vessel motion type and direction. Since ships carry and use a large amount of hydrogen as a power source, the risk of hydrogen leakage from collision or damage necessitates studying the correspondence between leakage, diffusion, and motion characteristics of the ship to position the sensor correctly.",Not About Sufficiency
Nutritional composition of aquatic species in Laotian rice field ecosystems,"The population of Laos PDR has increased rapidly in recent years, reaching 2.5% per annum. This growth threatens food security, which in Asia is often equated with rice production. The country has to feed almost 50% more people now than 16 years ago. The role of aquatic rice field species in rural Laotian diets has been underestimated, as almost 200 species are consumed, supplying a range of nutrients needed by the villagers. Nevertheless, national and regional food composition databases contain limited information on the nutritional composition of these species. Field sampling was undertaken in Champasak and Savannakhet provinces for nine species of aquatic animals, including fish, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs and insects. Four samples of fermented fish products were included. The objective was to gain knowledge on the nutritional composition of the aquatic species included in Laotian diets. The aquatic animals consumed on a daily basis contained high amounts of protein (11.6-19.7% for fish, crustaceans, molluscs, amphibians and insects and 3.3-7.8% for fermented fish), and a generally acceptable essential amino acid profile. They were also excellent sources of calcium, iron and zinc. However, they had low contents of fat (0.1-4.6%), fatty acids and vitamin A. Essential amino acids, iron and zinc are nutrients that are scarce in rural Laotian diets. As the food supply of rural households in rice farming areas of Laos is critically dependent on the environment, the sustainable existence of the rice field aquatic animals is a crucial factor for the nutritional status of the Laotians.

Obstacles to participation in carbon sequestration for nonindustrial private forest landowners in the southern United States: A diffusion of innovations perspective,"Forest carbon sequestration, resulting in increased carbon storage in forests, is an effective tool for climate change mitigation. Nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) landowner participation is crucial for increasing carbon stocks in the southern United States forests. Carbon sequestration is a relatively new practice, so NIPF land-owners are expected to have varied adoption responses depending on their different internal (socioeconomic, financial, and forest structure factors) and external (environmental, governmental policy, and market factors) environments. This study identified major obstacles for NIPF participation in carbon sequestration and grouped landowners into adoption categories with respect to carbon sequestration using the diffusion of innovations model. Principal component analysis was used to identify five major obstacles to participation in carbon sequestration programs: revenue implications, forest characteristics, owner preferences, normative reasons, and understanding. NIPF landowners were grouped into three adoption categories: adopters (18%), majority (60%) and laggards (22%). The adopters, compared to the other categories, were richer, more educated, relatively younger, and owned larger landholdings. These results provide a valuable insight about the adoption behavior of NIPF landowners with respect to climate change mitigation programs in the southern United States. Program planners and outreach professionals should consider these NIPF landowner adoption categories and the role of peer landowners in promoting new programs and policies for developing effective mitigation strategies.",Not About Sufficiency
"Ocean Warming, Heat Stress, and Coral Bleaching in Puerto Rico","Ocean warming threatens the provisioning of coral reef ecosystem services through the increasing frequency and intensity of coral bleaching and associated mortality events. Here, we quantified sea surface temperature warming trends and maximum annual degree heating weeks (DHW) from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch CoralTemp station-level data for Puerto Rico (1985-2023) and paired this with a review of coral bleaching observations to inform management and restoration efforts. Every region in Puerto Rico warmed at rates surpassing the hypothesized 0.10 degrees C per decade rate of coral adaptation and acclimatization, with warming rates increasing from 0.154 +/- 0.005 degrees C per decade in the west to 0.215 +/- 0.006 degrees C per decade in the east. Ecologically significant (DHW >= 4) or severe (DHW >= 8) coral bleaching heat stress events were observed in 2005-2006, 2010, 2019, and 2023, but varied in intensity between regions with consistently lower heat stress in the west. We found coral bleaching observations for 50% of years since 1969, but many observations lacked quantitative information and/or were biased towards the major areas of reef development. The National Coral Reef Monitoring Program island-wide stratified random sampling recorded moderate and/or severe coral bleaching at multiple sites in 2019 and 2021, but not for 2014 or 2016/2017. While regional variability in warming rates, heat stress, and climate model projections provide some indications for increased climate resilience in the west, coral bleaching observations and previous resilience assessments highlight the importance of local-scale variability. Climate models nonetheless project annual severe bleaching (DHW >= 8) across Puerto Rico by 2022 +/- 5 under the very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario.",Not About Sufficiency
The moderating effect of 'Green' HRM on the association between proactive environmental management and financial performance in small firms,"Research has shown an association between proactive adoption of environmental management practices and firm performance; however little of this research, particularly in the small firm context, has examined the impact of human resources management (HRM) practices on that association. Using data drawn from a sample of 158 small firms in the Australian machinery and equipment-manufacturing sector, this article contributes an empirical test of the moderating effect of HRM on the association between proactive environmental management and firm financial performance. In so doing, we draw on the concept of 'Green' HRM; that is to say, practices aligned with environmental sustainability goals and which aim at developing employees' abilities, motivation and commitment, and involvement in support of those goals at the firm level. The findings reveal that Green HRM positively moderates the association between proactive environmental management and financial performance, such that a high level of Green HRM increases the financial benefits of proactive environmental management compared with low levels of Green HRM. The findings show the added value that Green HRM provides when used as an enabler of proactive environmental management; this study should help allay concerns of small firms about the potential cost burden they may face from increasing governmental and social demands for environmental sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Oil palm 'slash-and-burn' practice increases post-fire greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient concentrations in burnt regions of an agricultural tropical peatland,"Fire is one of the major issues facing Southeast Asian peatlands causing socio-economic, human health and climate crises. Many of these fires in the region are associated with land clearing or management practices for oil palm plantations. Here we study the direct post-fire impacts of slash-and-burn oil palm agriculture on greenhouse gas emissions, peat physico-chemical properties and nutrient concentrations. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were measured using Los Gatos ultraportable greenhouse gas analyser one month after a fire in dry season and five months after the fire event, in wet season. Surface soil samples were collected from each individual GHG measurement points, along with 50 cm cores from both burnt and non-burnt control areas for lab analyses. As an immediate post-fire impact, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions, pH, electrical conductivity, and all macronutrient concentrations except nitrogen (N) were increased multi-fold, while the redox potential, carbon (C) and N content were greatly reduced in the burnt region. While some of the properties such as CO2 emissions, and electrical conductivity reverted to normal after five months, other properties such as CH4 emissions, pH and nutrient concentrations remained high in the burnt region. This study also found very high loss of surface peat C content in the burnt region post fire, which is irreversible. The results also show that surface peat layers up to 20 cm depth were affected the most by slash-and-burn activity in oil palm agriculture, however the intensity of fire can vary widely between different oil palm management and needs further research to fully understand the long term and regional impacts of such slash-and-burn activity in tropical peatlands.

Temporal resource partitioning mediates vertebrate coexistence at carcasses: The role of competitive and facilitative interactions,"Unravelling how biodiversity is maintained despite species competition for shared resources has been a central question in community ecology, and is gaining relevance amidst the current biodiversity crisis. Yet, we have still a poor understanding of the mechanisms that regulate species coexistence and shape the structure of assemblages in highly competitive environments such as carrion pulsed resources. Here, we study how large vertebrates coexist in scavenger assemblages by adapting their diel activity at large ungulate carcasses in NW Spain. We used camera traps to record vertebrate scavengers consuming 34 carcasses of livestock and hunted wild ungulates, which allowed us to assess also differences regarding carcass origin. To evaluate tem-poral resource partition among species, we estimated the overlap of diel activity patterns and the mean times of each scavenger at carcasses. We recorded 16 species of scavengers, 7 mammals and 9 birds, and found similar richness at both types of car-casses. Birds and mammals showed contrasting diel activity patterns, with birds using carcasses during daytime (mean= 11:38 h) and mammals mostly at night (23:09 h). The unimodal activity patterns of scavengers showed asynchronous peaks among species. Subordinate species modified their activity patterns at carcasses used by apex species to reduce temporal overlap. Also, diel activity patterns of vultures closely followed those of corvids, suggesting facilitation processes in which corvids would enhance carcass detection by vultures. Two mammal species (12.5%) increased nocturnality at carcasses of hunted ungu-lates, which could be a response to human disturbance. Our results suggest that both temporal segregation and coupling mediate the coexistence of large vertebrates at carcasses. These mechanisms might lead to richer scavenger assemblages and thereby more efficient ones in driving critical ecosystem functions related to carrion consumption, such as energy and nutrient recycling and biodiversity maintenance.

"Olive orchard amended with two experimental olive mill wastes mixtures: Effects on soil organic carbon, plant growth and yield","Amendments of olive orchard soil with two different preparations of olive mill solid waste (OMWMS) at the rate of 9 ton ha(-1) per year for five years in two different plots were compared with art industry Standard soil amendment using urea. Both the OMWMs amendments showed significant increases ill total organic carbon and humic Substances in soil of approximately 40% and 58%, respectively, without negative effects on tree growth and yield. This work has shown that olive oil mill waste (OMW) can be recycled safely using the bioremediation system used in this study. We Suggest that this system is particularly beneficial to organic farming and is an alternative solution to direct spreading of raw OMW on farm lands. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Opportunity Cost of Environmental Regulation in China's Industrial Sector,"In this paper, we employ a directional distance function to estimate the opportunity cost arising from environmental regulations in China's industrial sector. The change of opportunity cost is decomposed mathematically into two components including technical change and input change. Our results show that the opportunity cost attributed to environmental regulation is nil in some regions. The change of opportunity cost is marginal at the national level, as the positive effect of technical change is canceled out by the negative impact of input change on opportunity cost. Built on our mathematical decomposition, we further estimate the effects of environmental regulations on opportunity cost using a mediation model. It shows that environmental regulation has a significantly positive direct effect and a significantly negative indirect effect through foreign direct investment on opportunity cost. Our findings suggest, firstly, that inward FDI in China's industrial sector represents relatively dirty production technology; and, secondly, industrial production has transited towards a less carbon-intensive input mix. This paper, therefore, provides new insights for the recent dynamics of carbon abatement performance of China's industrial sector with policy implications.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimal Ecological Management Practices (EMPs) for Minimizing the Impact of Climate Change and Watershed Degradation Due to Urbanization,"Massive deforestation induced by unplanned urbanization in the hilly watersheds of Brahmaputra basin, India, has led to ecological imbalance and is gradually transforming this basin into a multi-hazard zone. Removal of green cover is also becoming a matter of global concern, as it can accelerate the adverse impacts of climate change. People coming in search of work generally reside in the hills, as they cannot afford the high cost of land in plains. This has led to deforestation of the hilly area and has resulted in increased surface erosion from the upper catchments. Though sediment and water yield from these degraded watersheds could have been minimized by implementing ecologically sustainable management practices (EMPs), such as grass land, forest land and detention pond, poor economic conditions of the people stands in the way of field implementation. On the other hand, major industries, which can be held responsible for emission of greenhouse gases, can be asked to finance greenery development in these hilly watersheds through implementation of selected EMPs to earn carbon credit for them. To convert this concept into reality, the EMP combination must be selected in such a way that it restricts sediment and water yield from the watershed within the permissible limit and maximizes its carbon sequestration capacity at minimum possible cost. Such optimal planning is a prerequisite for preparing an acceptable logical agreement between Government and private companies. Keeping this in mind, an optimization model was developed and applied to a micro watershed of Guwahati to explore its applicability in actual field. The model developed in this study provides most logical carbon credit negotiation, subject to the availability of reliable value of CO2 sequestration for different EMPs.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimal Selection and Location of BESS Systems in Medium-Voltage Rural Distribution Networks for Minimizing Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"This paper explores a methodology to locate battery energy storage systems (BESS) in rural alternating current (AC) distribution networks fed by diesel generators to minimize total greenhouse gas emissions. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is formulated to represent the problem of greenhouse gas emissions minimization, considering power balance and devices capabilities as constraints. To model the BESS systems, a linear relationship is considered between the state of charge and the power injection/consumption using a charging/discharging coefficient. The solution of the MINLP model is reached through the general algebraic modeling system by employing the BONMIN solver. Numerical results in a medium-voltage AC distribution network composed of 33 nodes and 32 branches operated with 12.66 kV demonstrate the effectiveness of including BESS systems to minimize greenhouse gas emissions in diesel generators that feeds rural distribution networks.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimal Trade-Offs between Housing Cost and Environmental Performance,"Housing units in the United States account for 18% of the total greenhouse gas emissions and 58% of public-supply water consumption. These negative environmental impacts of housing units can be reduced by integrating green building measures and fixtures, such as geothermal heat pumps and water-saving plumbing fixtures. The integration of these green measures often leads to an increase in the initial costs of the housing units, and therefore decision makers need to study and optimize the potential trade-offs between the environmental performance of housing units and their initial costs. This paper presents a multiobjective optimization model that is capable of optimizing housing design and construction decisions to generate optimal trade-offs between maximizing the environmental performance of housing units and minimizing their initial costs. The model was designed to maximize housing environmental performance during its operational phase by reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption. The model was developed in two main phases that formulated and implemented the model with the use of multiobjective genetic algorithms to provide the capability of generating Pareto optimal trade-offs between housing cost and environmental performance. Analysis of an application example is presented to demonstrate the use of the model and its capabilities in identifying Pareto optimal configurations of housing design and construction decisions. The primary contributions of this research to the body of knowledge include its comprehensive set of metrics and novel methodology that can be used to measure and quantify the impact of the design and construction decisions of housing units on their environmental performance, including greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, and its novel multiobjective optimization methodology that is capable of generating Pareto optimal trade-offs between the environmental performance of housing units and their initial costs.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimising containership speed and fleet size under a carbon tax and an emission trading scheme,"This paper addresses the problem of determining the ship speed, fleet size, and chartered ship number subject to environmental regulations consisting of a carbon tax and an emission trading scheme.

Optimization formulation of low carbon MSWIFA cement-based composites modified by nano SiO2,"The cementitious technique shows great potential as a solidification/stabilization treatment in the disposal of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWIFA). The utilization of MSWIFA as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM) offers the potential to substitute cement, thereby mitigating greenhouse gas emissions associated with conventional cement production. However, the lower active silicon content in MSWIFA diminishes its pozzolanic properties as an SCM. This paper explores a green and efficient pre-treatment approach for raw MSWIFA, and the treated MSWIFA was utilized as a SCM. The nano SiO2-modified MSWIFA cement-based composite (NMCC) was prepared by incorporating silicon-rich nano SiO2 (NS) to enhance the properties of the cementitious composite containing MSWIFA. The effects of MSWIFA content, water-to-binder ratio, and NS content on the NMCC were investigated in regards to its mechanical properties (compressive and flexural strength), fresh properties (fluidity and dynamic yield stress), and greenhouse gas emission (embodied carbon). The proportion and performance of NMCC were optimized by orthogonal experimental design. Range and variance analysis were applied to obtain the optimal formulation of NMCC. The findings suggest that NS can serve as an additional source of silicon to insufficient strength of cement-MSWIFA composites, which is attributed to the inadequate presence of silicon elements in MSWIFA. The comprehensive index analysis identified the NMCC with 15 wt% MSWIFA, 0.45 water-to-binder ratio, and 1.0 wt% NS as the optimal proportion. The optimal NMCC reduces embodied carbon by 38.91 kg CO2e/m3 compared to the cement control group, and can be effectively utilized in low-carbon buildings and engineering applications.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimization of hybrid grid-tie wind solar power system for large-scale energy supply in Cameroon,"In several countries around the world, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies is considered an inevitable trend for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of the environment. It also helps to minimize dependence on fossil fuels which are exhausted over time. In Cameroon, the use of renewable energies appears as an alternative for commercial companies which depend enormously on the public sector which is the only supplier of electricity thanks to hydroelectric dams. Installing solar power systems and wind power systems can help businesses and industrial facilities directly use electricity generated from clean energy sources. Moreover, the need to reduce electricity costs and to move toward solutions that improve the environment from being polluted is felt. In this article, the results of an optimization study for a cement plant in Garoua Province, Cameroon, show that the hybrid wind and solar grid-tied energy systems in Scenario 1 are considered more efficient; on the environmental, economic and technical level than the solar energy systems connected to the electrical grid in scenario 2. The robustness and feasibility of this system thanks to the Homer Pro software and the optimization by particle swarm shows a reduction in the cost of the installation as well as a contribution to the protection of the environment. The optimal configuration of the hybrid power system connected to the grid includes wind energy with a capacity of 300 kW and solar energy with a capacity of 1500 kW, this system has a net present cost (NPC) of 5,596,978 USD, the cost of energy (COE) of 0.0847 USD/kWh, the investment cost of 1,140,000 USD and the operating cost of 384,877 USD.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimizing a waste collection system with solid waste transfer stations,"In recent years, stricter environmental regulations, as well as an increased public concern, have progressively forced new landfills to be located more and more away from urban centers. This has stimulated the use of solid waste transfer stations, where the solid waste is transferred from small collection vehicles to large transportation vehicles. In this paper, we tackle the problem of determining the routes for both collection and transportation vehicles, as well as their synchronization at the transfer stations. We divide the problem into two phases and propose an exact approach utilizing a mathematical formulation, as well as a constructive heuristic and a matheuristic for the first phase, and a heuristic approach for the second phase. Computational results show that the approach combining the matheuristic for the collection phase with the heuristic for the transportation phase is able to achieve consistent reductions in terms of number of collection vehicles needed.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimizing inorganic carbon and salinity for enhanced biomass and pigment production in Colaconema formosanum: Implications for sustainable carbon sequestration and stress responses,"This study investigates a cultivation strategy for the macroalga Colaconema formosanum by determining optimal inorganic carbon concentration and salinity for maximizing biomass and photosynthetic pigment production while also facilitating carbon sequestration. The response surface method was used with a central composite design (CCD-RSM) to determine the optimal conditions. Results showed that adding 1.2 g/L of carbon increased the specific growth rate to 18%-19% per day. The maximum amount of pigment, including phycobiliprotein and chlorophyll, was achieved by adjusting both carbon content and salinity. This strategy enables mass pigment production and offers an eco-friendly approach to carbon sequestration while reducing culture period. This study also sheds light on algal mechanisms against enriched inorganic carbon and salinity content, contributing to an enhanced understanding of these vital processes.",Not About Sufficiency
Modelling the Temporal Dynamics of Groundwater Pollution Risks at the African Scale,"Groundwater pollution risk modelling is an important asset to improve groundwater management and protection. In this study, we assess the temporal dynamics of groundwater pollution risk at the continental scale, using the DRASTIC model. The approach was developed using continental-scale data on soil properties, topography, land use, geology, hydrogeology, and climate with a resolution of 15 x 15 km(2). We compared continental-scale groundwater pollution risk for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. The results showed significant inter-annual variations of the spatial distribution of pollution risk. Changes were mainly concentrated in the area of the Nile Delta, around the Lake Victoria, in North Africa, and in coastal West Africa (predominately in Nigeria). We found that the increase in pollution risk was mainly related to the increase in the population density in these regions. The proposed methodology for modelling the temporal dynamics of groundwater pollution risk could support the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goal 6, which focus in particular on the preservation of the freshwater resources against future threats.",Not About Sufficiency
Oxyfuel combustion based carbon capture onboard ships,"Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the shipping sector is a challenging task. While renewable fuels stand out as the most promising long-term solution, their near- and mid-term viability is hampered by limited availability and high costs. An alternative approach is onboard carbon capture, which can reduce emissions from new ships as well as retrofitted vessels. This paper examines the techno-economic potential of oxyfuel combustion based carbon capture on ships. The oxyfuel concept uses an oxygen-rich atmosphere in the combustion process, resulting in a mixture of carbon dioxide and water. After the condensation of water, the carbon dioxide rich gas can be directly stored on board. Various onboard oxygen supply concepts are investigated, including different technologies for onboard air separation and liquid oxygen bunkering. Influences on the ship energy system are studied by system simulation of a deep-sea container vessel. Benchmarked against a technologically mature post-combustion carbon capture system, the results show that the oxyfuel concepts have limited competitiveness because of reduced engine efficiencies and high energy demands for onboard oxygen supply. Avoiding onboard oxygen supply by using liquefied oxygen as a byproduct from onshore electrolysis increases energy efficiency and the competitiveness of oxyfuel combustion but requires additional storage space. Sensitivity analyses highlight that the engine combustion concept and engine efficiency are the most critical influences on the techno-economic performance.",Not About Sufficiency
Why are there so many definitions of eutrophication?,"Because of the first observations in the 1900s of the oligotrophic and eutrophic states of lakes, researchers have been interested in the process that makes lakes become turbid because of high phytoplankton biomass. Definitions of eutrophication have multiplied and diversified since the mid-20th century, more than for any other ecological process. Reasons for the high number of definitions might be that the former ones did not sufficiently describe their causes and/or consequences. Global change is bringing eutrophication more into the spotlight than ever, highlighting the need to find consensus on a common definition, or at least to explain and clarify why there are different meanings of the term eutrophication. To find common patterns, we analyzed 138 definitions that were classified by a multiple correspondence factor analysis (MCA) into three groups. The first group contains the most generic scientific definitions but many of these limit the causes to increased nutrient availability. A single definition takes into account all causes but would require additional work to clarify the process itself. Nutrient pollution, which is by far the primary cause of eutrophication in the Anthropocene, has generated a second group of environmental definitions that often specify the primary producers involved. Those definitions often mention the iconic consequences of nutrient pollution, such as increased algal biomass, anoxia/hypoxia and reduced biodiversity. The third group contains operational definitions, focusing on the consequences of nutrient pollution, for ecosystem services and therefore associated with ecosystem management issues. This group contains definitions related to regulations, mainly US laws and European directives. These numerous definitions, directly derived from the problem of nutrient pollution, have enlarged the landscape of definitions, and reflect the need to warn, legislate and implement a solution to remedy it. Satisfying this demand should not be confused with scientific research on eutrophication and must be based on communicating knowledge to as many people as possible using the simplest possible vocabulary. We propose that operational definitions (groups 2 and 3) should name the process ""nutrient pollution,"" making it possible to refine (scientific) definitions of eutrophication and to expand on other challenges such as climate warming, overfishing, and other nonnutrient-related chemical pollutions.",Not About Sufficiency
Paradoxes of the Italian Historic Centres between Underutilisation and Planning Policies for Sustainability,"The paper presents the analysis of the statistical data on population and real estate in 20 small-to-medium-sized cities in Northern Italy and shows a high rate of vacancy of housing and significant shrinkage of businesses and institutions in the historic centres, where urban heritage is concentrated.

Parametric Study for Optimising Building Form and Height: An Approach toward Net Zero Energy & Carbon in Buildings,"Due to the excessive use of natural resources and fossil fuels, our planet has started to show its weak points. Several ecological and economic crises have occurred in the last decades. The building sector is held primarily responsible for one-third of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and the advent of COVID-19 has not improved this with its containment. For this reason, improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reaching the net zero concept have become the primary objectives of all policies. Several measures are to be undertaken to achieve this concept, ranging from passive and active strategies to the use of renewable energy. This work aims to analyse and study the morphology of the building with geometric plan and height variables to know their influences on the energy consumption of residential buildings in three different types of Algerian climates, semi-arid, arid, and Mediterranean. Using SketchUp and the cloud-based simulation tool Sefaira, the results showed that the triangular-shape based plan has the best energy consumption, allowing a reduction of 18% from the worst-case scenario, and that the difference in height can save up to 17.5%, which is worth 51 kWh/m2/year.",Not About Sufficiency
"Parasite host-switching from the invasive American red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta elegans, to the native Mediterranean pond turtle, Mauremys leprosa, in natural environments","The red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans, is among the most over-exploited animals and is still exported annually from the USA all over the world. Once introduced into its new environment, feral populations may arise and pose threats to local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In France, it is in fact considered as a risk for the Mediterranean pond turtle, Mauremys leprosa, and the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis, as they may compete for resources and habitat. Freshwater turtles are also host to a variety of parasites including protozoans and helminths. When introduced turtles escape, parasites may spread to native species. The objective of this study was to document the extent of platyhelminth invasions from T. s. elegans to natural M. leprosa populations in northern Spain and southern France and to evaluate the risks that parasite host-switching may pose on indigenous freshwater turtle species. From DNA barcoding analysis based on the sequencing of the Cytochrome c Oxidase I gene, the Bayesian tree and p-distance comparisons of closely related haplotypes revealed a greater polystome richness within M. leprosa than expected, suggesting that host switching may take place in natural environments. Because these parasites most typically infest American turtles like Chrysemys picta marginata and Graptemys pseudogeographica in their natural home range and because parasites were also found within T. s. elegans feral populations, it is suggested that the red-eared slider would serve as a carrier for a variety of not strictly host-specific polystomes that are transmitted to M. leprosa throughout the south of France. The global trade in freshwater turtles thus provides opportunity for parasites to be transported to new destinations which could impact the physiology, behavior and survival of native turtle species.",Not About Sufficiency
Park size and prey density limit occurrence of Eurasian Sparrowhawks in urban parks during winter,"Background: Eurasian Sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) increasingly represent successful city-dwellers. Thereby, a rich food supply indicated by high numbers of small birds is believed to be the key driver for this bird-eating rap- tor species to settle in urban environments. However, as small passerine birds show particularly strong antipredator responses, sparrowhawks may not simply focus on patches of highest prey densities, but rather respond strategically to prey behavior, raising the importance of other parameters in determining the occurrence within urban landscapes. Methods: To deepen our knowledge on habitat requirements of urban sparrowhawks, bird surveys were carried out during winter between December 2005 and January 2017 in 36 city parks in Vienna, Austria. Besides food supply also park size, canopy heterogeneity and the connectivity with other green spaces were considered. Results: Occurrence of sparrowhawks was positively affected by increasing park size, prey density and the interaction between both. Bird feeder density and park connectivity with other green spaces were of minor importance in explaining the presence of this species. Canopy heterogeneity didn't affect city park occupancy by Eurasian Sparrowhawks. Conclusions: Our results suggest that large city parks, particularly when characterized by high prey densities, substantially contribute to protect and preserve ecologically important bird species such as raptors within the urban environment-a landscape already struggling with biodiversity losses and functional homogenization.",Not About Sufficiency
Participatory rural appraisal of ecosystem services of wetlands in the Amazonian Piedmont of Colombia: elements for a sustainable management concept,"Considering the rapid changes in land use in tropical countries and the difficulties of law enforcement in remote areas, management of ecosystems benefits from the landscape approach. Within the landscape approach it is important to assess the different livelihoods of the local populations, as well as the vulnerability of the ecosystems that are supporting these livelihoods. Specifically for wetlands in rural tropical areas that face fast developing agro-industrial land use change, there is little information available on the attitude of stakeholders considering the ecosystems they manage. We used a combination of participatory rural appraisal and participatory mapping methods on rural wetlands in the Amazonian Piedmont region in Colombia, an area that has hardly ever been studied. We found that 77.7 % of the current livelihoods depend directly on the provisioning ecosystem services delivered by the wetlands, where fishing and hunting are the most important services that contribute to the household income. Ecotourism, which is emerging as a promising source of income, was also pointed as one key ecosystem service. However, our results revealed that the wetlands in our study area are very vulnerable (up to 41 % endangered). The main causes for wetland deterioration were cattle ranching, invasive grasses, deforestation, drainage, and burning. We conclude with a brief overview on the pros and cons of reconciling wetland conservation and human development in sensitive regions such as the Amazonian Piedmont in Colombia and other similar regions in the Tropics.",Not About Sufficiency
Of questionable value: The role of practitioners in building sustainable cities,"The reshaping of South African cities is being guided by policies aiming to build socially and environmentally just communities. Despite widespread commitment to this goal, there is little consensus on what it means and how it should and could translate into practice. The paper shows that despite the emphasis on environmental justice and building sustainable communities in policy, the institutional context for implementation (including expert driven and deliberative approaches) do not always deliver on this mandate. Consequently, policy outcomes do not reflect those of the communities and households it is meant to serve, raising challenging moral and ethical questions for institutions involved in environmental governance. This paper shows how the institutional context of environmental assessment combined with the role played by the values held by environmental practitioners charged with influencing decision-making result in the perpetuation of environmental injustices. The lack of a clearly defined profession and professional body, reflecting a diversity of values, debating, regulating, defining and defending a set of principles to guide decision-making in cities is identified as a possible reason for the lack of congruence between the values reflected in policy with those held by the communities these interventions are intended to serve. The resulting value added by sustainable cities interventions in the light of this mismatch is therefore questionable, raising challenges regarding international calls for local action as well as an increasing policy focus in South Africa on the local level as the agent of political and spatial transformation of cities.

Where are all the self-employed women? Push and pull factors influencing female labor market decisions,"Previous research focuses on factors that influence self-employment participation, in part because entrepreneurship has been associated with economic growth. This literature has tended to focus only on men or the comparison of women to men, while ignoring substantial heterogeneity in employment decisions among women. By investigating the impact of individual, household, and local economic and cultural characteristics on the labor market outcomes of different groups of women, we get a more comprehensive picture of their self-employment decision. Recognizing self-employment as one of multiple labor market choices, we use multinomial logit and two confidential, geocoded micro-level datasets to study women`s career choices in urban areas. We find that the effects of various push and pull factors differ between married and unmarried women. In particular, more progressive gender attitudes pull married women into self-employment, while household burdens associated with children push them into self-employment. For unmarried women, the local business climate and individual characteristics have the strongest influence.

Sources and emission of greenhouse gases in Danube Delta lakes,"Production of methane and carbon dioxide as well as methane concentrations in surface waters and emissions to the atmosphere were investigated in two flow-through lake complexes (Uzlina-Isac and Puiu-RosuRosulet) in the Danube Delta during post-flood conditions in May and low water level in September 2006. Retained nutrients fuelled primary production and remineralisation of bioavailable organic matter. This led to an observable net release of methane, particularly in the lakes Uzlina, Puiu and Rosu in May. Input from the Danube River, from redbuds and benthic release contributed to CH4 concentrations in surface waters. In addition to significant river input of CO2, this trace gas was released via aerobic remineralisation within the water column and in top sediments. Emission patterns of CO2 widely overlapped with those of CH4. Generally, greenhouse gas emissions peaked in the lake complex adjacent to the Danube River in May due to strong winds and decreased with increasing hydrological distance from the Danube River. Intense remineralisation of organic matter in the Danube Delta lakes results in a net source of atmospheric greenhouse gases.",Not About Sufficiency

Exploring the impact of ESG factors on corporate risk: empirical evidence for New York Stock Exchange listed companies,"This paper aims to investigate the impact of influential ESG factors on risk, focusing on debt risk and liquidity risk. The influence on a sample of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange belonging to the NYSE index is analyzed over a 10-year period, 2012-2021. The quantitative framework covers a multitude of indicators regarding debt, liquidity, corporate governance, the environment, CEO characteristics, performance, and other variables, and the research methodology uses the method of least squares to highlight their impact, using regression models with fixed and random effects, both linear and nonlinear. By estimating regression models, the empirical results confirm the hypotheses found in the existing knowledge stage that debt risk and liquidity risk are significantly influenced by asset profitability, the CEO duality significantly influences debt, while CEO gender diversity has a negative influence on corporate risk, specifically debt and liquidity risk. Additionally, it is shown that the emergence of COVID-19 brings significant changes to company autonomy and their financial performance, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively influenced corporate risk through restrictions, economic uncertainty, and the amplification of risks. These research results are crucial for practitioners by the necessity of integrating ESG criteria into the risk assessment process and decision-making. Furthermore, concerning policy decision-makers, they help promote sustainability and a responsible approach. Therefore, ESG factors can impact companies' financial performance and influence how they are perceived by investors. By understanding and correctly evaluating these ESG factors, one can identify and manage risks more efficiently, achieve better long-term returns, make appropriate decisions, and promote sustainability in the business environment.",Not About Sufficiency
Pens and purse strings: Exploring the opportunities and limits to funding actionable sustainability science,"Producing actionable science to improve social and environmental well-being enables the scientific enterprise to uphold expectations that accompany public funding for science. While innovations in the management of science funding may help overcome institutional hurdles to generating actionable science, the role of program managers in implementing such changes is relatively underexamined. Using sustainability science and related fields as a case, this study examines program documents (n = 33) and interviews of program management staff (n = 61) from public science funding programs in the United States and Europe. The results illuminate program management perspectives on the changing relationship between science and society and their own role in shaping it. In many instances, program managers in both regions are actively experimenting with practices that may strengthen links between knowledge and action. In certain contexts, program manager discretion may also amount to a form of science policy formation. However, program managers may still be limited in their ability to enact changes due to capacity constraints and still prevalent norms expressed by the research community. These results provide a window, and basis for future research, into the contemporary practice of science funding program management and its implications for sustainability and the social contract for science.",Not About Sufficiency
"Perceived benefits from reclaimed rural landscapes: Evidence from the lowlands of the Po River Delta, Italy","The attention towards residents' perceptions of ecosystem services for an efficient management of rural landscapes is gaining momentum. One noteworthy aspect is the identification of links between perceived supply and societal demand of ecosystem services, as they can disclose leverages to improve rural policies. The objectives of this study are: i) to assess residents' perceptions of ecosystem services attributed to typical landscape elements; and ii) to characterise the perception of different groups of residents. We present the results from a residents' survey based on a phone-questionnaire carried out in a reclaimed coastal area, where vulnerabilities such as anthropic impact legacies and natural hazards are exacerbated. The aim of the questionnaire concerns the collection of information regarding people perception of benefits attached to a set of rural landscape elements and demand for services. The results show that awareness of regulating functions, the presence of disservices and the link with local food production relate with residents' perception of benefits from landscapes. Furthermore, we note that local landscape and the meaning attributed to historical land reclamation initiatives has a lasting influence on the perception of ecosystem services and that of such perceptions are significant for the design of land use policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Perceived sustainability initiatives: retail managers' intrinsic and extrinsic motives,"Purpose - Although awareness of environmental sustainability has increased over the past few decades, the current market share of sustainable products remains low. Because of their market position, large-scale and high-volume consumer interactions, food retailers are appropriate venues to entice consumers to buy more sustainable foods. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which food retailers are perceived to have embedded sustainability initiatives in their marketing strategies and to have taken sustainable tactical measures on the store floor. In addition, the study considered the roles played by social identification (SI) and by perceived external prestige (PEP). Design/methodology/approach - Based on a literature review and semi-structured qualitative interviews with the chief executive officers (CEOs) of Dutch food retailers, the authors conducted an online panel survey among the managers of these food retailers. Findings - The results of the study show the positive impacts of managers' SI with a sustainable consumer group and managers' PEP on the perceived environmental sustainability initiatives of Dutch food retailers. The study finds that managers' SIs are powerful ways to engender employee loyalty. Moreover, organisations that are perceived to have more external prestige are perceived as being more capable of developing sustainability policies.

Perceptions of bioenergy among Nepalese foresters - Survey results and policy implications,"Modern bioenergy technologies have been recognized as one of the potential energy sources in Nepal to address the current energy crisis and contribute to the rural development. Nepalese foresters play an important role in the natural resource management sector of Nepal. Their perceptions can be important considering their experiences in the forestry sector and awareness of the local situations especially in the remote and rural areas of Nepal. Therefore, the study through a questionnaire-based survey aimed to explore their perceptions of bioenergy development in Nepal including the policy issues. Total 65 Nepalese foresters were interviewed for the study working for various forestry related government organizations located in Kathmandu, Nepal. The study found that the Nepalese foresters perceived positively the importance of bioenergy development in Nepal for employment and rural income generation, and improving the current energy situation by supplying locally produced and affordable energy sources. The respondents held community participation in the future bioenergy projects as a key to its successful implementation in Nepal. However, there is a strong need, as perceived by the respondents, to formulate a separate bioenergy policy for Nepal. Among various policy interventions formulation of a new bioenergy policy, mobilizing community participation in bioenergy projects, developing bioenergy markets, and implementing new bioenergy projects were considered as urgent for Nepal.

Cooling has also been linked to all 17 sustainable development goals of the United Nations. Adequate cooling improves productivity and thermal comfort and can also prevent health risks. Meanwhile, policy initiatives such as the European Union's Green Deal require participants to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce energy use. Therefore, novel cooling systems that are capable of efficiently producing high levels of thermal comfort are needed. Radiant cooling systems provide a design capable of fulfilling these goals, but their application in hot and humid climates is limited due to the risk of condensation. In this study, we compare the performances of radiant cooling systems with and without dehumidification. The studied systems are supplied by geothermal energy. The study is conducted using building energy models of a small office building belonging to a three-building school complex located in Sant Cugat near Barcelona in Spain. The studied location has a Mediterranean climate. The simulations are conducted using IDA Indoor Climate and Energy 4.8 simulation software. The results show that the radiant cooling system with dehumidification (RCD) produces considerably improved thermal comfort conditions, with maximum predicted mean vote (PMV) reached during the cooling season being 0.4 (neutral) and the maximum PMV reached by the radiant cooling system without dehumidification (RC) being 1.2 (slightly warm). However, the improved thermal comfort comes at the cost of reduced energy and exergy efficiency. The RCD system uses 2.2 times as much energy and 5.3 times as much exergy as the RC system. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to assess the influence of selected input parameters on the simulation output. The results suggest that maximising dehumidification temperature and minimising ventilation flow rate can improve the energy and exergy efficiency of the RCD system while having a minor effect on thermal comfort.",Not About Sufficiency
Performance assessment of modern distribution networks conjoined with electric vehicles in normal and faulty conditions,"With global efforts underway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the world's finite oil sources, the advent of electric vehicles (EVs) has emerged as a viable solution to address these imperatives. The present study endeavors to establish a comprehensive framework for investigating the implications of EV integration within medium voltage distribution networks, considering both normal and faulty scenarios. Additionally, the study explores the impact of distributed generation units (DGs) on this integration. The impact assessment entails evaluating power losses and the total voltage stability index (TVSI) as indicators of normal system performance. In the case of abnormal conditions, the analysis shifts to examining fault currents. Notably, the study is conducted considering the uncertainty associated with both the loading ratio (LR) and the random power consumption of EVs during fast charging. To address this uncertainty, the proposed approach employs Hong's-Point Estimate Method (PEM), specifically utilizing the (2m+1) scheme. This methodology is applied to IEEE 69-bus and 85-bus systems using MATLAB software, supplemented by ETAP short circuit analysis to validate the results. In order to verify the framework, different locations of charging stations along the systems' buses are tested with varying their number between one and two charging stations, while assuming a total of 250 EVs, which doubles to 500 in subsequent analyses. The study explores the impact of EV stations placement in DG-integrated distribution networks on power losses, voltage stability, and fault current levels, suggesting a trade-off in allocation strategies. The results underscore the critical challenges posed by the widespread adoption of EVs, particularly in terms of increased power losses and fault current levels. While the number of charging stations has a limited effect, the total number of EVs and their load characteristics are the primary factors affecting system stability.",Not About Sufficiency
Performance evaluation of canal irrigation system at the tertiary level of Upper Ganga Canal using remote sensing,"This study underscores the critical importance of assessing the performance of the Upper Ganga Canal (UGC) and its minors, Harchandpur and Naserpur. The UGC serves as a lifeline, providing water for both agricultural and non-agricultural purposes in the region, making it vital for food security, rural economies, and environmental sustainability. The uniqueness of this study lies in its comprehensive evaluation of the efficiency of UGC using a multifaceted approach, encompassing meteorological data, field observations and remote sensing. The monetary aspects of the irrigation system performance, which were often ignored in previous studies, have also been included in this study. The study, conducted from 2012 to 2018, assesses various performance indicators. The findings reveal that the capacity of UGC to meet peak irrigation requirements highlights the potential for increased crop production. However, it also demonstrates a concerning decreasing trend in the availability of water, driven by rising non-agricultural water demands. Several performance indicators, such as relative irrigation supply (RIS), relative water supply (RWS), depleted fraction (DF), and crop water deficit (CWD), expose inefficiencies in the system, especially during the sugarcane growth period. Despite supplying ample water, sugarcane exhibits a water deficit, possibly due to the annual maintenance closure of the UGC. This calls for a revision of irrigation scheduling to address changing agricultural practices. Future research can expand this work to include climate change impact assessment, economic analyses, advanced technologies, and socio-economic factors. In summary, this study provides critical insights into the performance of UGC, highlighting the need for modernization and equitable water distribution to meet evolving agricultural demands while addressing the challenges of decreasing water availability and the changing climate.",Not About Sufficiency
Performance of a Solar Greenhouse Dryer for Water Hyacinth,"The development of new methods to utilize solar energy is critical to lower greenhouse gas emissions and provide sustainable livelihoods for small business owners in rural areas. Solar greenhouse dryers are simple and low-cost structures that can be modified for a variety of applications. This study evaluated the performance of a solar greenhouse dryer for drying water hyacinth. The solar dryer was established in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand and consisted of a parabolic roof structure covered with polycarbonate sheets. A ventilation system was designed using fans controlled by relative humidity sensors and powered by a solar panel. The drying system had an overall efficiency of 63% for 100 kg of fresh water hyacinth with a highest temperature of 59 degrees C. In comparison with natural sun drying, the solar dryer produced more product in a shorter amount of time. In addition to regulating the climatic conditions, this solar greenhouse prevented insect infestation, and improved the product quality. The payback period was estimated to be about 1.5 months. This study can be used as a guideline to produce dried water hyacinth for cushioning material, or other products. Also, this solar dryer offers a promising solution for effective drying of other agricultural or food products.",Not About Sufficiency
Peru-China international trade and its effect on inclusive economic growth in Peru 2000-2019,"From 2000 to 2019, trade between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Peru grew at an average annual rate of 22%, however, income and wealth inequality in Peru remained the same. The aim of this study is to understand the effect of trade between Peru and China on the inclusive economic growth of Peru from 2000 to 2019. The method used was the correlation of variables, and a linear regression between Peru and China trade and several indicators of inclusive economic growth in the Peruvian economy was performed using the Ordinary Least Squares model. The results suggest that there is sufficient statistical evidence to support that inclusive economic growth may depend on increased trade between Peru and China; the study show that if trade growth between Peru and China fluctuates by $1 million per year, labor income will increase by $10.3 per capita in the Economically Active Population (EAP). Moreover, for every 1% increase in trade between Peru and China, GDP per capita increases by 0.1057% and labor productivity increases by 0.0681740%. The variables poverty, vulnerable employment, GINI index and life expectancy at birth were not significant factors.(c) 2022 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.",Not About Sufficiency
The integrated global temperature change potential (iGTP) and relationships between emission metrics,"The Kyoto Protocol compares greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) using the global warming potential (GWP) with a 100 yr time-horizon. The GWP was developed, however, to illustrate the difficulties in comparing GHGs. In response, there have been many critiques of the GWP and several alternative emission metrics have been proposed. To date, there has been little focus on understanding the linkages between, and interpretations of, different emission metrics. We use an energy balance model to mathematically link the absolute GWP, absolute global temperature change potential (AGTP), absolute ocean heat perturbation (AOHP), and integrated AGTP. For pulse emissions, energy conservation requires that AOHP D AGWP - iAGTP/lambda and hence AGWP and iAGTP are closely linked and converge as AOHP decays to zero. When normalizing the metrics with CO2 (GWP, GTP, and iGTP), we find that the iGTP and GWP are similar numerically for a wide range of GHGs and time-horizons, except for very short-lived species. The similarity between the iGTP(X) and GWP(X) depends on how well a pulse emission of CO2 can substitute for a pulse emission of X across a range of time-horizons. The ultimate choice of emission metric(s) and time-horizon(s) depends on policy objectives. To the extent that limiting integrated temperature change over a specific time-horizon is consistent with the broader objectives of climate policy, our analysis suggests that the GWP represents a relatively robust, transparent and policy-relevant emission metric.",Not About Sufficiency
Individual tree biomass equations or biomass expansion factors for assessment of carbon stock changes in living biomass - A comparative study,"Signatory countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its supplementary Kyoto Protocol (KP) are obliged to report greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Changes in the carbon stock of living biomass should be reported using either the default or stock change methods of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) under the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry sector. Traditionally, volume estimates are used as a forestry measures. Changes in living biomass may be assessed by first estimating the change in the volume of stem wood and then converting this volume to whole tree biomass using biomass expansion factors (BEFs). However, this conversion is often non-trivial because the proportion of stem wood increases with tree size at the expense of branches, foliage, stump and roots. Therefore, BEFs typically vary over time and their use may result in biased estimates. The objective of this study was to evaluate differences between biomass estimates obtained using biomass equations and BEFs with particular focus on uncertainty analysis. Assuming that the development of tree fractions in different ways can be handled by individual biomass equations, BEFs for standing stock were shown to overestimate the biomass sink capacity (Sweden). Although estimates for BEFs derived for changes in stock were found to be unbiased, the estimated BEFs varied substantially over time (0.85-1.22 ton CO2/m(3)). However, to some extent this variation may be due to random sampling errors rather than actual changes. The highest accuracy was obtained for estimates based on biomass equations for different tree fractions, applied to data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory using a permanent sample design (estimated change in stock 1990-2005: 420 million tons CO2, with a standard error amounting to 26.7 million tons CO2) Many countries have adopted such a design combined with the stock change method for reporting carbon stock changes under the UNFCCC/KP.

pH-responsive copper-doped ZIF-8 MOF nanoparticles for enhancing the delivery and translocation of pesticides in wheat plants,"Metal-organic framework (MOF)-based ""nanopesticides"" with pH-responsive performance have attracted increasing attention for application in sustainable agriculture. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of nanocarriers on the translocation of nanopesticides in plants. Herein, copper-doped ZIF-8 bimetallic MOF nanoparticles (Cu@ZIF-8) were prepared as nanocarriers by in situ fabrication of ZIF-8. Fludioxonil-loaded Cu@ZIF-8 (Flu@Cu@ZIF-8) could be constructed, and the loading content was 23.9%. The average particle size of Flu@Cu@ZIF-8 was & SIM;80 nm. Flu@Cu@ZIF-8 exhibited acid-responsive release, with cumulative release of 79.5%, 69.9%, and 43.0% at pH values of 5, 7, and 9, respectively, after 48 h. Compared with free fludioxonil, Flu@Cu@ZIF-8 had similar percent inhibition against Fusarium graminearum, and the acute toxicity of fludioxonil against zebrafish could be reduced by up to 68% for Flu@Cu@ZIF-8 after 96 h of exposure. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that FITC-labeled Cu@ZIF-8 could be transported to all parts of a wheat plant from its roots. Flu@Cu@ZIF-8 exhibited stronger uptake and translocation in wheat plants, with a translocation factor 23-41% higher than that of fludioxonil alone. Overall, this work provides insights into the use of stimuli-responsive metal-doped MOF nanocarriers as pesticide-delivery systems in sustainable agriculture.",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of accession to the European Union on suicide rates: A cross-national time-series analysis,"Building upon prior research, this study examines the effects of European Union (EU) accession on suicide rates in the Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 using pooled cross-sectional time-series data that cover approximately 20years (1990-2011). Results from fixed-effects regression analyses indicate that EU entry has no effect on total suicide rates and suicide rates among males, but has a negative effect on female suicide rates in the fully specified models. In addition, we find that EU entry also has a negative effect on the ratio of suicide rates to an aggregated indicator of lethal violence (homicide rates+suicide rates, or the suicide-homicide ratio) for the total population and for the female population. Consistent with previous research, we find some significant negative effects on suicide rates for economic growth and life expectancy at birth, and a positive effect for females. When interpreted with reference to the stream analogy' for understanding the two major forms of lethal violence (suicide and homicide), our findings suggest that the impact of any increase in the flow' of lethal violence associated with EU entry is likely to be manifested in an outward' rather than inward' direction for the nations in the sample. Our analyses also reaffirm previous research documenting appreciable gender differences in lethal violence.",Not About Sufficiency
Planted forest is catching up with natural forest in China in terms of carbon density and carbon storage,"Over the last several decades, China has taken multiple measures for afforestation and natural forest protection, including setting the goal of carbon neutrality by the middle of 21th century. In order to support the practice of relevant policies from the scientific perspective, it is essential to precisely estimate the carbon storage of arbor forest, as it plays an important role in the carbon cycle of ecosystems. In this study, we first used the latest four phases of national forest inventory data to investigate the variation of carbon storage for both natural and planted arbor forest in China during the covered period (1999-2018). Then we used machine leaning methods to simulate the carbon density based on various kinds of environmental factors and analyzed the contribution of each influencing factor. Our results demonstrate that the total carbon storage for arbor forest in China kept increasing over the last two decades, but this increment was mainly brought about by the continuous expansion of forest land. The gap of carbon sequestration between natural forest and planted forest showed a significant trend of reduction. Additionally, tree age was identified as the dominant factor for influencing the spatiotemporal variation of carbon density among all the independent variables while the impact of climatic factor was limited. Therefore, the future improvement of carbon sequestration of arbor forest in should mainly rely on additional projects of afforestation, reforestation, green space conservation and reduction of emissions in China. Conclusions of this study have important implications for policy makers and other stakeholders to evaluate the previous achievement of environmental projects and can also help to set future plans and finally realize the goals of carbon neutrality.",Not About Sufficiency
"Plants breathing under pressure: mechanistic insights into soil compaction-induced physiological, molecular and biochemical responses in plants","Main conclusionThis review highlights the molecular, biochemical and physiological responses of plants under soil compaction and presents suitable strategies for optimizing soil compaction for sustainable and intelligent plant production.AbstractSoil compaction (SC) increases the mechanical impedance of agricultural crops, which restricts plant growth, root elongation, and productivity. Therefore, exploring the impacts of SC-induced alterations in plants and developing optimization strategies are crucial for sustainable agricultural production and ensuring global food security. However, the regulation of molecular, biochemical and physiological responses to SC in plants has not yet been well explored. Here, we conducted a thorough analysis of the relevant literature regarding the primary factors behind SC in agricultural soils, mechanistic insights into SC-mediated molecular and physiological alterations in plants, the impact of SC on plant productivity, and SC-minimization strategies for eco-friendly and intelligent agricultural production. The existing information suggests that plant roots sense SC-induced changes in soil properties, including decreased soil water content, hypoxia, nutrient deficiency and mechanical stimuli, through altering the expression of membrane-located ion channel- or stimulus receptor-related genes, such as MSLs, MCA1, and AHK. After signal transduction, the synthesis and transport of several plant hormones, mainly ABA, ethylene and auxin, change and restrict root deepening but promote root thickening. In addition, the changes in plant hormones in combination with decreased water availability and decreased root hydraulic conductance induced by SC affect aboveground physiological responses, such as decreasing leaf hydraulic conductance, promoting stomatal closure and inhibiting plant photosynthesis. Comprehensive physiological insights into SC in plants and SC optimization strategies could be useful to soil biologists and plant eco-physiologists seeking to improve soil management and sustainable agricultural plant production to promote global food security.",Not About Sufficiency
"Plugging methods for underground gas extraction boreholes in coal seams: A review of processes, challenges and strategies","Gas extraction is an important method to solve coal mine gas disasters, utilize coalbed methane (CBM) resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Construction of underground extraction boreholes in coal seams is a widely used method for pre-extraction gas in active coal mines in many countries. In most mines, the methane concentration is low and the methane flow decay rate is fast during the extraction process. One of the important reasons is the poor performance of borehole plugging and serious air leakage. Many plugging methods are applied to gas extraction boreholes, but a systematic comparison of the methods has not been conducted. This review analyzes reasons for the poor plugging performance of gas extraction boreholes through reviewing the main plugging methods of gas extraction in active mines. We find that the development range of fractures around a borehole needs to be studied comprehensively and the initial plugging depth and the length of a borehole need to be determined based on theoretical analysis. The grouting pressure cannot meet engineering requirements and plugging materials such as polyurethane and cement cannot effectively plug fractures around a borehole. This review also proposes strategies for improving the plugging performance. Firstly, time-dependent characteristics of the development of fractures around extraction boreholes under multiple damage conditions can be studied. Moreover, new plugging materials can be developed and plugging performances of materials can be tested. Lastly, reasonable plugging length and grouting pressure can be determined. This review can guide the design and optimization of plugging methods to enhance gas extraction efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
Biochar decreases the efficacy of the nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin in mitigating nitrous oxide emissions at different soil moisture levels,"Unprecedented increases in agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in recent years have caused substantial environmental pollution that leads to ozone depletion and global warming. Application of biochar and/or nitrification inhibitors (NIs) has the potential to reduce N2O emissions; however, it is not clear how biochar application may affect the efficacy of NI in reducing nitrification rates, soil enzyme activities, and N2O emissions under different soil moisture regimes. We conducted a 60-day laboratory incubation experiment to study the effects of manure biochar and nitrapyrin (as a NI) on N2O emissions from a urea fertilized soil with either 60 (low) or 80% (high) water-filled pore space (WFPS). Nitrification rates were significantly affected by biochar x NI x WFPS and biochar x WFPS interactions. Biochar initially increased and then decreased the rates, resulting in 45.2 and 26.6% (P < 0.001 for both) overall reductions in low and high WFPS, respectively while NI reduced the rates only in the first 10 days at 60% WFPS. Biochar decreased (P < 0.001) and NI increased (P = 0.007) beta-1,4-N-acetyl glucosaminidase activities while urease activities were increased (P < 0.001) by biochar across WFPS. Biochar had significant interaction with NI in cumulative N2O emissions with the efficacy of NI being reduced when co-applied with biochar. Cumulative N2O emissions were greater at high than at low WFPS; the emissions were decreased by biochar at 60% WFPS and NI at both 60 and 80% WFPS. We conclude that biochar reduces efficacy of nitrapyrin in mitigating N2O emissions and their effects on net nitrification rates, enzyme activities and N2O emissions are dependent on soil moisture level.",Not About Sufficiency
"Policies, Projects, and Initiatives for Sustainable Higher Education with Gender Equity: Literature Review and Case Study-Universidad de La Frontera","Today, sustainability in higher education is a key factor for our society, and women play a fundamental role. However, gender faces a series of inequalities in this field of action, and from this point of view, university education is not left out. It is necessary to incorporate strategies and initiatives to reduce these inequalities within the classroom, supported mainly through public policies, which represents a challenge. It is a practical and essential challenge for public and private universities to ensure that their students are prepared for a globalized, sustainable, and gender-sensitive world. In the 2030 Agenda, two Sustainable Development Goals are proposed to address these issues, targeting SDG 5 gender equality and SDG 4 inclusive education. This study considers that to address this issue, it is necessary to identify initiatives that aim to propose measures for sustainable education and reduce the gender gap, to know which and what types of policies or strategies aim to address these issues in higher education in the same way of identifying good practices focused on inclusive policies, models, and teaching styles, also considering scientific research for sustainable education. This study considers the review of policies to reduce gaps in the STEM areas of university education and whether these measures address the goal of sustainable development. As main findings and conclusions, this study highlights the initiatives and good practices found in the literature review since 2007 but concentrated during the last five years. In addition to the literature review, this bibliographic review is complemented by presenting a practical case study with real data from a public, state, and regional university in the south of the country of Chile that takes on this challenge and shares it.

Policy Implications of Uncertainty in Modeled Life-Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Biofuels,"Biofuels have received legislative support recently in California's Low-Carbon Fuel Standard and the Federal Energy Independence and Security Act. Both present new fuel types, but neither provides methodological guidelines for dealing with the inherent uncertainty in evaluating their potential lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions reductions are based on point estimates only. This work demonstrates the use of Monte Carlo simulation to estimate life-cycle emissions distributions from ethanol and butanol from corn or switchgrass. Life-cycle emissions distributions for each feedstock and fuel pairing modeled span an order of magnitude or more. Using a streamlined life-cycle assessment, corn ethanol emissions range from 50 to 250 g CO(2)e/MJ, for example, and each feedstock-fuel pathway studied shows some probability of greater emissions than a distribution for gasoline. Potential GHG emissions reductions from displacing fossil fuels with biofuels are difficult to forecast given this high degree of uncertainty in life-cycle emissions. This uncertainty is driven by the importance and uncertainty of indirect land use change emissions. Incorporating uncertainty in the decision making process can illuminate the risks of policy failure (e.g., increased emissions), and a calculated risk of failure due to uncertainty can be used to inform more appropriate reduction targets in future biofuel policies.",Not About Sufficiency
"Polyurethanes from seed oil-based polyols: A review of synthesis, mechanical and thermal properties","Polyurethanes (PUs) are multipurpose polymers that are increasingly used in many industrial fields. The main compounds used to synthesize PUs are still derived from petrochemicals. The last decade has witnessed an upsurge of research and technological innovations in developing PUs, especially the polyol component from bio-based resources. These efforts are primarily driven by uncertainty surrounding the crude oil reserves and environmental pollution. Among the bio-derived resources, seed oils are the most promising and intensely investigated raw materials in the PU industry due to their abundance, inherent biodegradability, and low price. There are numerous strategies to chemically functionalize the structure of seed oils by introducing hydroxyl groups and convert them into reactive polyols for PU synthesis. The seed oil-based polyols with different structures and functions enable synthesis of industrial PUs with mechanical and thermal characteristics comparable to those of petrochemical-based PUs. Herein we systematically review the literature on synthesis of PUs using polyols derived from seed oils with special focus on their mechanical performance and thermal properties. Given the potential of seed oil-based PUs in many industrial applications, we expect that they will attract increasing commercial interest and scientific research to bring these materials to the market in the near future.",Not About Sufficiency
The challenge of sustainable building renovation: assessment of current criteria and future outlook,"The building sector is one of the key consumers of energy worldwide. Thus, the retrofitting of existing buildings provides excellent opportunities for reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents a critical review of the research undertaken on housing retrofits and discusses the approaches driving the assessment of energy-efficiency measures. It is clear from the existing literature that many retrofitting strategies are quite similar in their approaches, the most common of these being passive strategies such as insulation of the envelope, replacement of windows, and air sealing. However, the assessment methodologies differ broadly and widely, which restricts a comparison of the results across various studies. This current state of the art review highlights the need to apply a life cycle approach in order to find the optimal retrofitting solutions, and to identify the real improvement potential of housing renovation. Life cycle assessment and life cycle cost methodologies have been analyzed by discussing the existing limitations, which can be mitigated by sensitivity analysis. Finally, whilst social impacts were addressed in a few studies, life cycle social assessment was not conducted in any of the papers reviewed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND THE AGING POPULATION,"The establishment of environmental barriers against the spread of disease is an important factor contributing to changes in the age composition of a population. Although the net result of the numerous forces working upon the population has been to increase the life span, a corollary effect has been to expose the individual longer to conditions which influence his function and development. This result produces health problems associated with an aging population. The objectives in environmental health are to establish physical barriers to prevent the spread of disease, and to provide surroundings that will help maintain vital resistance and promote positive health and a sense of well-being. The engineer directs his attention not to people but to the physical environment in which they live. He is equipped to prevent but not to cure. Environmental health measures must either await accumulation of essential knowledge, or be directed at raising the standard of living so as to benefit the public health. Some aspects of environmental health, as it relates to health problems associated with the aging population, are environmental cancer, heart disease, mental health, housing, accidents, atmospheric pollution, care of the chronically ill. The immediate problem of the engineer seems to be that of gathering and analyzing data concerning relationships between environment and the health of older people. There remain many unsolved problems, especially in radiological health and the hygiene of housing.

Is sustainability governance abetting inequality? Reflections from the South African wine value chain,"Private and public governance instruments seeking to ensure sustainability in agro-food value chains have become ubiquitous in the past three decades. Virtually all major retailers, agro-food processors and international commodity traders have been involved in one or another sustainability initiative or multistakeholder engagement. An emerging critical literature shows that achieving sustainability goals along value chains often comes at the cost of profitability at the production level. While some hope has been placed on South-driven sustainability standards to better reflect local needs and contexts, their record in doing so has been mixed. In this article, we examine how different kinds of sustainability governance affect inequality within and along the South African wine value chain. We show that sustainability governance is not paying off for many grape growers and wine producers in South Africa, nor is it supporting entry and ownership of historically disadvantaged persons (HDPs) - despite the government's stated transformation objectives. We conclude that sustainability governance is abetting existing inequalities and question the ability of current initiatives to shape more just, equitable and environmentally-friendly value chains. We also argue that any future discussion of sustainability and its governance in global value chains should also be a discussion of inequality.",Not About Sufficiency

Pore structure analysis via X-ray μCT: Enhancing soil macroaggregate models for water permeability and carbon sequestration,"Soil macroaggregates are crucial for carbon sequestration, water retention, and soil fertility. Their ecological functions are influenced by their pore characteristics. Yet, the relationship between pore structure and the movement of water and carbon within macroaggregates is not fully understood. In this study, the porosity, connectivity, and morphology of macroaggregate pores in three typical soil types in China were characterized. Additionally, water permeability and carbon sequestration were modeled based on in-situ CT-scanning images. The results indicated that the macropores within the macroaggregates serve as the primary channels for water permeability, while pore morphology of mesopores significantly influences carbon sequestration. The water permeability increased with the presence of macropores and enhanced connectivity within the macroaggregates. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed a pronounced correlation with oblate pores across all samples, and a more intricate structure offered more surface area space, trapping additional carbon particles. The established model not only elucidates how various pore structures influence the transport of carbon particles and carbon sequestration but also simulates the structural changes in macroaggregates throughout the process. This allows for an intuitive understanding of water and carbon distribution and migration. This research presents an innovative simulation of water and carbon distribution within macroaggregates using micron-scale CT data.",Not About Sufficiency
Crop Residue Management in India: Stubble Burning vs. Other Utilizations including Bioenergy,"In recent studies, various reports reveal that stubble burning of crop residues in India generates nearly 150 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), more than 9 million tons of carbon monoxide (CO), a quarter-million tons of sulphur oxides (SOX), 1 million tons of particulate matter and more than half a million tons of black carbon. These contribute directly to environmental pollution, as well as the haze in the Indian capital, New Delhi, and the diminishing glaciers of the Himalayas. Although stubble burning crop residue is a crime under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Air and Pollution Control Act (APCA) of 1981, a lack of implementation of these government acts has been witnessed across the country. Instead of burning, crop residues can be utilized in various alternative ways, including use as cattle feed, compost with manure, rural roofing, bioenergy, beverage production, packaging materials, wood, paper, and bioethanol, etc. This review article aims to present the current status of stubble-burning practices for disposal of crop residues in India and discuss several alternative methods for valorization of crop residues. Overall, this review article offers a solid understanding of the negative impacts of mismanagement of the crop residues via stubble burning in India and the other more promising management approaches including use for bioenergy, which, if widely employed, could not only reduce the environmental impacts of crop residue management, but generate additional value for the agricultural sector globally.",Not About Sufficiency

As such, this study investigates the potential of hydrothermal liquefaction of camel manure and subsequent upgrading into drop-in fuels in Qatar. Experimental characterisation of manure samples is conducted, while a small-scale plant is simulated and evaluated using Aspen Plus (R). Excess treated wastewater of Qatar is utilised as an alter-native to fresh water in the process, while power is completely generated on-site. The demonstrated results are promising; whereby, a biocrude yield of 37.9% (on dry and ash-free basis) is achieved, while the biocrude is upgraded into a high-quality bio-gasoline. The produced bio-gasoline contributes to a 7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to conventional gasoline. The project capital investment is estimated to be 38 M$, while the bio-gasoline's minimum selling price is at 0.87 $/kg, which is still above the market price of conventional gasoline in Qatar (similar to 0.6 $/kg). However, the conducted sensitivity analysis indicates that scaling-up the plant by 5-fold can shift the fuel's minimum selling price below the average market price. As such, it has a high potential to be locally commercialised especially at times of petroleum price hikes. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
El Niiio Southern Oscillation and Associated Climatic Conditions around the World during the Latter Half of the Twenty-First Centuryg,"Increases in greenhouse gas emissions are expected to cause changes both in climatic variability in the Pacific linked to El Ntho Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and in long-term average climate. While mean state and variability changes have been studied separately, much less is known about their combined impact or relative importance. Additionally, studies of projected changes in ENSO have tended to focus on changes in, or adjacent to, the Pacific. Here we examine projected changes in climatic conditions during El Nino years and in ENSO-driven precipitation variability in 36 CMIP5 models. The models are forced according to the RCP8.5 scenario in which there are large, unmitigated increases in greenhouse gas concentrations during the twenty-first century. We examine changes over much of the globe, including 25 widely spread regions defined in the IPCC special report Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX). We confirm that precipitation variability associated with ENSO is projected to increase in the tropical Pacific, consistent with earlier research. We also find that the enhanced tropical Pacific variability drives ENSO-related variability increases in 19 SREX regions during DJF and in 18 during JJA. This externally forced increase in ENSO-driven precipitation variability around the world is on the order of 15%-20%. An increase of this size, although substantial, is easily masked at the regional level by internally generated multidecadal variability in individual runs. The projected changes in El Ntho driven precipitation variability are typically much smaller than projected changes in both mean state and ENSO neutral conditions in nearly all regions.",Not About Sufficiency
"Predicting Urban Land Expansion and Local Economic Growth by Integrating CLUE-S and Economic Model: an Application to Ban Chang District, Thailand","Timely and granular information on urban and economic growth is necessary for achieving sustainable development goals. This study aims to predict economic growth and urban land-use change in one of the fastest-growing cities in Thailand-Ban Chang District-from 2021 to 2030. Geospatial and economic data obtained from Google Earth Engine and government agencies were utilized to meet the objective. This paper presents a newly developed modeling framework that integrates CLUE-S with a structural equation model to predict economic growth and urban land-use change at the district level. The obtained results show that the average spatial accuracy of the model is 92%. Under normal circumstances, the results suggest urban land expansion to take place in the central, western, and southern parts of Ban Chang District. In addition to urban land growth, the compound annual growth rate of Ban Chang's GDP between 2021 and 2030 is 5.6%. Operating based on open data and open-source software packages, the modeling framework developed in this study can be applied to other developing countries for timely monitoring the economic growth at the city or district level.",Not About Sufficiency
"Prey, management and landscape requirements of an endangered population of the Woodlark Lullula arborea in Southwest Germany","Vineyards can be valuable habitats for biodiversity conservation. For example, in Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany) over a third of the state's critically endangered Woodlark (Lullula arborea) population breeds in vineyards along the western margin of the Upper Rhine Valley. We here aim to elucidate how local ground cover management, food availability and the proximity to settlements affect territory selection by this bird species in the region. As climate, site conditions and management differ greatly from more continental or Mediterranean wine-growing areas, conditions for Woodlark conservation may differ as well. We compared 26 Woodlark territories in vineyards with 26 nearby reference areas from which Woodlarks were absent. We recorded vineyard ground cover in the inter-rows (% cover) as well as vegetation height and composition (forbs vs. grasses). Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps, since they are the main food resource of Woodlarks during the breeding season. In addition, the distance to built-up areas was measured. The vegetation in Woodlark territories was shorter (mean 14.2 vs. 19.6 cm) and more dominated by forbs (39% vs. 27% cover) than in absence areas. The vegetation cover in the inter-rows had no effect on Woodlark territory presence or absence. Woodlarks also favoured areas with a higher abundance of arthropods (mean abundance 69.1 vs. 57.5) and a greater distance to built-up areas (mean distance 554 vs. 373 m). We conclude that to promote the Woodlark in wine-growing areas, short, forb-rich swards should be created, facilitating arthropod detectability. This is likely to require low levels of nitrogen fertilization since fertilizers favour tall-growing grasses that outcompete forbs. Pesticide applications should be kept at a minimum to enhance arthropods as the main food source for Woodlarks and their chicks. In addition, the expansion of settlements into breeding areas of Woodlarks should be avoided.",Not About Sufficiency
The 3D characterisation of the zone of human interaction and the sustainable use of underground space in urban and peri-urban environments: case studies from the UK,"Meeting the challenges of sustainable development and regeneration to support city growth requires the provision of attributed 3D geological and geotechnical data, information and process understanding in the urban subsurface. This provides a 3D framework for the characterisation of the spatial variability of the properties and processes within the shallow subsurface to aid sustainable land use planning and regeneration. The subsurface has to provide the resources and ecosystem services to sustain and create economic growth and meet societal needs, now and in the future while minimising the environmental impact of development. The 3D variability of the ground results from anthropogenic (man-made) processes as well as geological. Human exploitation of the subsurface and rapid land use change in response to population growth and urbanisation, result in temporal and spatial modification of the ground. The integration of 3D geological and anthropogenic deposits models is therefore essential for the characterisation of urban ""zone of human interaction"" and its response to anthropogenic environmental change. Model integration to aid land use planning has been applied in the formerly heavily industrialised cities of NW England and Northern Ireland to provide a basis for linear transport assessment, urban planning and the assessment of aquifer vulnerability.",Not About Sufficiency
Pricing electricity from blue hydrogen to mitigate the energy rebound effect: A case study in agriculture and livestock,"As the world's second largest producer of natural gas, Iran relies heavily on natural gas for 70% of its energy needs. There are, however, challenges associated with energy supply in remote regions attached to the gas pipeline network, particularly during the cold season when fuel oil is required for heating and energy provisioning. To address this issue, this research proposes the use of alternative energy sources, such as hydrogen, for non-residential energy consumption, including agriculture and livestock. A key objective of this study is to develop an optimization model for the generation of electricity from hydrogen resources, as well as formulate a robust strategy to assist electricity producers in maximizing their profits. Using this model, producers are able to set prices in accordance with their risk tolerance and present them to the market, thus mitigating price fluctuations. In the targeted sectors, the results indicate that appropriate pricing models can prevent rebound effects. Specifically, the implementation of this model can reduce natural gas consumption by up to 20% and fuel oil usage by 15% during peak seasons. Additionally, the optimal pricing strategy can lead to a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The results of this research provide stable and reliable solutions to the energy supply challenges in these regions, thus making the energy market more resilient and environmentally friendly.",Not About Sufficiency
Privatisation and pensions: what does this mean for women?,"This paper considers the relationship between gender and private pension provision. It provides a brief history of private pensions before considering the implications of pension policy on women's private pension situation under New Labour and, briefly, the coalition government. For instance, there has been an emphasis on neoliberal concerns of private saving and individual responsibility as a means of reducing expenditure and encouraging long-term sustainability. The paper suggests that the focus on individual responsibility in pension saving leaves many women ill-equipped to save and dependent on means-tested pension provision, largely as a result of intermittent work histories.",Not About Sufficiency
The Dasgupta Review: resetting the stage for a new paradigm,"Assessing the impacts of unprecedented biodiversity loss on planetary resilience, The Economics of Biodiversity: the Dasgupta Review (""Dasgupta Review"") asserts that sustainable engagement with nature is crucial for sustaining the livelihoods of present and future generations. It further urges the integration of biodiversity into national accounting and science-based decision-making processes in order to advance the well-being of both people and the planet. Here, we present the salient features of the Dasgupta Review along with several recommendations for strengthening global biodiversity and ecosystem conservation efforts. Although institutional transformations at regional and national scales are essential to facilitate the recognition of economies' dependence on nature, behavioral changes at the level of the individual are also needed to better understand, value, manage, and utilize biodiversity. Formulation of inclusive policies prioritizing biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource consumption is also essential for averting future public health risks associated with ecosystem degradation and species loss.",Not About Sufficiency
Profile of developments in biomass-based bioenergy research: a 20-year perspective,"In an era of energy crisis, biomass-based bioenergy research has attracted the attention of R&D managers and policy makers around the world. This study explores the structural and dynamic patterns of biomass-based bioenergy research. We measure the profile of biomass research on both macro scales (nations) and meso level (institutions) in an international context. We find that biomass publications are intensively distributed in developed regions and some emerging economies. The U.S. leads in this emerging field as evidenced by research quantity, impact, and international collaboration links. China is developing rapidly in this domain in terms of publication volume and collaborative links but suffers from low research visibility.

Proglacial slopes are protected against erosion by trait diverse and dense plant communities associated with specific microbial communities,"Soil erosion is a severe threat for ecosystems and anthropogenic infrastructure. Glaciers are retreating rapidly due to global warming and the receding ice leaves unvegetated depositions of sediment, which are prone to mobilisation during precipitation events. Vegetation is known to serve as erosion protection, but how above- and belowground plant traits, vegetation cover and plant diversity on community level are jointly affecting erosion is unclear. Additionally, soil microbial communities may have effects on slope stability by promoting plant growth and function. We measured sediment transport on 30 plots of 2 x 3 m size on proglacial slopes of the Gepatschferner glacier (Kaunertal, Austria) over three years in a natural pristine high alpine environment. Vegetation cover, species abundances and relevant above- and belowground traits were measured for each occurring plant species on community level. Path model analysis revealed that dense and species-rich plant cover characterized by specific plant growth strategies and trait diversity was best suited to decrease erosion. Vegetation properties were also closely linked to the composition of soil microbial communities characterised by next generation amplicon sequencing, which may facilitate soil formation and further enhance the plants' soil stabilising potential. Our study illustrates that erosion control may benefit from a high vegetation cover, which is facilitated by diverse plant communities with complementary morphological traits. These vegetation properties also affect soil microbiota, but their impact on slope protection in combination with the vegetation remains to be elucidated. Our findings may inform nature-based solutions against erosion such as revegetation of alpine slopes using specific seed mixtures. (C) 2023 The Authors.

Progressing beyond colonization strategies to understand arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal life history,"Knowledge of differential life-history strategies in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is relevant for understanding the ecology of this group and its potential role in sustainable agriculture and carbon sequestration. At present, AM fungal life-history theories often focus on differential investment into intra- vs extraradical structures among AM fungal taxa, and its implications for plant benefits. With this Viewpoint we aim to expand these theories by integrating a mycocentric economics- and resource-based life-history framework. As in plants, AM fungal carbon and nutrient demands are stoichiometrically coupled, though uptake of these elements is spatially decoupled. Consequently, investment in morphological structures for carbon vs nutrient uptake is not in competition. We argue that understanding the ecology and evolution of AM fungal life-history trade-offs requires increased focus on variation among structures foraging for the same element, that is within intra- or extraradical structures (in our view a 'horizontal' axis), not just between them ('vertical' axis). Here, we elaborate on this argument and propose a range of plausible life-history trade-offs that could lead to the evolution of strategies in AM fungi, providing testable hypotheses and creating opportunities to explain AM fungal co-existence, and the context-dependent effects of AM fungi on plant growth and soil carbon dynamics.",Not About Sufficiency
Promoting Environmental Justice and Sustainability in Social Work Practice in Rural Community: A Systematic Review,"Social work's response to global climate change has dramatically increased over the last several years. Similarly, growing attention has been paid to rural social work; less clear, however, is how social work, responsive to global climate change, is developed, deployed, and understood in rural contexts; this systematic review elaborates on current social work contributions (research, practice, and policymaking), promoting environmental justice and sustainability in rural communities. Utilizing the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach, this article thematically analyzed and synthesized 174 journal articles on social work-specific interventions and environmental justice. The results illustrate insights into the experiences, practices, or objectives of rural social workers vis-a-vis climate change. Significant themes from the literature demonstrated that gender, age, and race limited access to social work services and climate-related disaster response support in rural settings; this article argues that rural community-driven social work practices focused on environmental justice and sustainability should be encouraged and that policy advocacy attentive to climate change and its impact on vulnerable and marginalized groups should be pursued. Current and prospective social work scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders should collaborate with local rural communities to address their unique needs related to climate change. In turn, grassroots strategies should be co-developed to promote climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, ultimately achieving the goal of building resilient, healthy, and sustainable rural communities.",Not About Sufficiency
Promoting mental well-being in Western Australia: Act Belong Commit® mental health promotion campaign partners' perspectives,"The Act Belong Commit (R) mental health promotion campaign aims to improve population mental well-being. Based on a social-franchising model, partnerships are sought with organizations offering 'mentally healthy activities' that foster social connectedness and mental well-being. There are four categories of partner organizations sought: Site (government agencies and health services), Associate (organizations with state-wide or national services), Community (local, grass-roots community groups) and Schools. This research explored organizational perceptions of the Act Belong Commit (R) Partnership Program. A purposive sample of 14 organizational representatives across all four partner categories participated in semi-structured interviews online or face-to-face between July and September 2021. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify three main themes: (a) A passion for promoting mental health; (b) Implementation, innovation, adaption and creation (e.g. the ability to adapt, create and deliver activities aligned with the campaign message; and (c) Future sustainability (e.g. recommendations for the sustainability of the programme). The use of reflexive thematic analysis enabled deeper insights into the complexity of the partnerships. Findings describe how the Act Belong Commit (R) Partnership Program supports mutually desirable objectives and extends the campaign reach. Embedded in a shared belief system that incorporates a passion for good mental health, the model supports the flexibility to adapt, create and deliver fit-for-purpose activities that promote mental well-being in the places where people live, work and play.",Not About Sufficiency
Proportion of Nonindustrial Private Forest Lands That Potentially Can Be Leased to Bioenergy Enterprises to Grow Short Rotation Woody Crops,"Determining how much nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) land could potentially be allocated to growing short rotation woody crops (SRWCs) is critical for estimating the future supply of woody biomass for biofuels and overall bioenergy production. This study estimated the proportion of the land NIPF landowners would be willing to allocate to SRWC cultivation. In view of the bounded nature of the dependent binary variable [0,1] and model performance, a fractional logit regression model was used to estimate model parameters. The estimated proportion of land allocated to SRWCs was positively influenced by the rental rate per acre, owning land for investment or fee-access hunting purposes, and the landowner's age. In contrast, size of the ownership, owning land for the production of agricultural products, and residing on the land negatively influenced the proportion of land allocated to SRWCs. Lease contract duration, location of the largest tract owned, owning land for personal recreation or ecosystem services, and landowner familiarity with the concept of alternative fuels production did not influence the proportion of land allocated to SRWCs. These results will contribute to a better understanding of SRWC biomass supply from NIPF land and provide important benchmark information for conducting feasibility analyses of biofuel and biopower manufacturing in Mississippi and other states with abundant woody feedstocks.Study Implications: To achieve targeted levels of bioenergy production and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions and diversify NIPF landowner income, participation of NIPF landowners in woody biomass feedstock production will be critical, because they own a majority of forestland in the region. Moreover, they have diverse reasons for owning land which has extensive implications not only in terms of incentive types or monetary compensation levels they might require for cultivating SRWCs but also policies related to the development of the bioenergy sector in Mississippi, the location of individual bioenergy processing facilities, and feedstock types that will be developed. Thus, forest managers and biomass procurement foresters might need to decide whether to focus their efforts on maximizing the land area allocated to growing SRWCs or considering a mix of SRWCs at lower lease rates per acre and material obtained from thinnings, which might be more amenable to landowners who value environmental amenities.",Not About Sufficiency
Proposal and assessment of a sustainable method for urban waste transportation and selling: real-life case study,"Increasing municipal solid waste (MSW) has caused severe environmental pollution and social problems, which require effective treatment and resource utilization. Therefore, combined with a sustainable approach, an urban vacuum waste collection (VWC) system was established in this study. To optimize VWC management, a bi-objective model is created to address the issue of waste management in this work in an environmentally friendly way. This model evaluates the economic benefits, social benefits, and environmental costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The proposed model is solved using the augmented e-constraint method. Numeric results show the efficiency of the mentioned method. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to verify the model. The results depict that the VWC model is sensitive to parameters such as budget, transfer station capacity, treatment facilities' capacity, and infrastructure costs.{GRAPHIACAL ABSTRACT}",Not About Sufficiency
Prospective life-cycle assessment of sustainable alternatives for road freight transport,"This study investigates decarbonization pathways for the road freight transport sector by evaluating three alternatives to conventional diesel trucks: trucks powered by biofuels, battery electric trucks, and fuel cell trucks with hydrogen. A prospective life cycle assessment of these options is conducted under two policy scenarios for decarbonization across 12 distinct regions over the century. Employing a cradle-to-grave approach, the assessment covers activities from fuel and electricity production to the end-of-life of truck components. Findings reveal that, in eight of the 12 regions examined, an early transition to battery electric trucks could increase life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70 % by 2030 compared to the continued use of conventional diesel trucks, underscoring the significance of liquid fuels for short to medium-term decarbonization. However, in the long term, as electricity mixes and hydrogen production are decarbonized, battery electric trucks and hydrogen fuel cell trucks emerge as superior alternatives in all regions, emitting, at least, 29 % less greenhouse gases than trucks powered by biofuels, and 45 % less than diesel trucks. The optimal transition from conventional diesel trucks to trucks powered by biofuels and, subsequently, to battery electric trucks and/or hydrogen could avoid 134-204 Gt CO2eq worldwide and prevent a temperature rise of 0.22-0.33 degrees C compared to the diesel-based scenario. This emphasizes the crucial role of appropriate policies for the timely transformation of the road freight transport sector. Despite this, battery and hydrogen trucks can impact human health up to 239-1200 % more than diesel, which is not to be taken lightly.",Not About Sufficiency

"Pruning waste management and climate change in Sierra Magina's olive groves (Andalusia, Spain)","In the context of climate change, concern is raising about the negative effects of some pruning waste management practices. On the one hand, burning of pruning residue is seen as controversial regarding its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, chipping the wood and using it as mulch is seen as highly risky regarding pest and disease control. Considering these issues, it is important to try to understand how and why these practices are adopted. In this study, we conducted in-depth interviews and survey questionnaires in the olive-growing region of Sierra Magina (Andalusia) in order to explore (1) which were the pruning waste management practices in place, (2) which had been these practices in the past, and (3) which were the factors influencing the choice of different practices. Since 2010, there has been a shift in pruning waste management practices in this region, from stubble burning to chipping. This change seems to be led by older/retired farmers that have young and non-inherited groves. Moreover, this change is shown not to be necessarily a result of ""greening"" in agriculture but rather a result of intensification and mechanization. These results are discussed regarding the processes of innovation adoption in the region and the possible unforeseen externalities that derive from this change in pruning waste management practices.",Not About Sufficiency

"Public health in linkage to land use: Theoretical framework, empirical evidence, and critical implications for reconnecting health promotion to land use policy","The increasing health burdens pose great challenge for planners and policy makers to create a more livable city. Recent literature has linked land use to a wide range of illness and death causes in developed nations. It therefore requires evidence-driven and replicable frameworks to inform land use decisions that integrate with health promotion. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for the mechanistic links between neighborhood land use and public health; and then quantifies their associations at district level, using the case of Shenzhen in developing China. Data for 15 health indicators in 2010 are collected at district level; and a set of standardized land use variables (individual land use type, general land use mix, and physical street conditions) are proposed to comprehensively reflect the neighborhood land use characteristics. Spatial regression is employed to analyze the relationships between health outcomes and land use variables. Results show that the land use exploratory variables vary with health indicators, but several key land use determinants are identified: green land abundance, green land morphology, institutional land proximity, industrial land proximity, blue land abundance, street walkability and street connectivity. Structural equation modeling is further applied to examine the possible mediators and it demonstrates that the casual pathways between land use and public health are quite complex. The developed set of standardized land use variables can serve as practical tools to facilitate land use decisions with health considerations. In practice, several complexities at governance levels challenge the efforts to reconnect land use policies and public health promotion. We put forward three useful solutions to enhancing health connection with land use policy across different international settings. This study captures the nuanced health disparities varied with districts and indicators, and therefore produces some more generalized knowledge that ultimately helps develop land use policies aimed at promoting public health at home and abroad.

A fairly representative Swedish sample (N = 2911) rated the acceptability of 44 environmental policies. Exploratory factor analysis indicated that participants' acceptability of policies forms three categories: push policies consisting of regulatory and market-based disincentives, pull policies consisting mainly of market-based incentives, and informational policies, such as ecolabeling. Sociodemographics had small but consistent effects on attitudes towards the three categories, while political ideology had a larger effect across the categories.

Pushing the frontier of sustainable service operations management Evidence from US hospitality industry,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to develop a performance measurement system of environmental sustainability in service settings and to empirically examine the relationship between the measured environmental sustainability and operating performance. Design/methodology/approach - This study applies exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to a six-year panel dataset of 984 US hotels to construct a two-factor standardized measure of environmental sustainability. The authors then conduct a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to investigate the relationship between the measured environmental sustainability and the operating performance frontier, considering the impact of operating structure. Findings - Customer behavior and operational decisions are two key drivers of environmental sustainability. There is a positive link between environmental sustainability and operating performance. Operating structure has a significant impact on the operating performance. The performance frontier varies across market segment and location characteristics such as degree of urbanization and climate condition. Practical implications - The findings indicate that service providers should actively involve customers, and manage both front-office and back-office operations in environmental sustainability initiatives. Operating structures that favor the alignment of multiple service supply chain partners' interests contribute positively to performance. The managers should be mindful of varying best-in-class performance due to operating unit characteristics such as market segment, and location characteristics. Originality/value - This study is among the first attempts to develop a performance measurement system of environmental sustainability. The resulted standardized measure of environmental sustainability considers both the revenue and cost impacts in service operations. This research is among the first generation of papers that bring the unique characteristics of service operations, particularly service co-production, into sustainability research.",Not About Sufficiency
A Comparative Feasibility Study of the Use of Hydrogen Produced from Surplus Wind Power for a Gas Turbine Combined Cycle Power Plant,"Because of the increasing challenges raised by climate change, power generation from renewable energy sources is steadily increasing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2. However, this has escalated concerns about the instability of the power grid and surplus power generated because of the intermittent power output of renewable energy. To resolve these issues, this study investigates two technical options that integrate a power-to-gas (PtG) process using surplus wind power and the gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC). In the first option, hydrogen produced using a power-to-hydrogen (PtH) process is directly used as fuel for the GTCC. In the second, hydrogen from the PtH process is converted into synthetic natural gas by capturing carbon dioxide from the GTCC exhaust, which is used as fuel for the GTCC. An annual operational analysis of a 420-MW-class GTCC was conducted, which shows that the CO2 emissions of the GTCC-PtH and GTCC-PtM plants could be reduced by 95.5% and 89.7%, respectively, in comparison to a conventional GTCC plant. An economic analysis was performed to evaluate the economic feasibility of the two plants using the projected cost data for the year 2030, which showed that the GTCC-PtH would be a more viable option.",Not About Sufficiency
"Quantification of the regional carbon cycle of the biosphere: Policy, science and land-use decisions","This paper addresses some issues related to the carbon cycle and its utilization by society. Traditional uses for agriculture, forestry, as a Source of fuel and other products, and for pastoral farming, among others, have recently been supplemented by identifying its potential for mitigating the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Through the Kyoto Protocol, carbon has become a commodity and the CO2-absorbing capability of the vegetation and soils an economically valuable asset. The multi-facetted roles of the C cycle and its sensitivity to human activities present a demand for techniques that permit accurate, timely and affordable characterization of the various components of this cycle, especially on land where most human activities take place. Such techniques must satisfy a range of demands in terms of purpose, clients for the information, and biosphere properties. However, if successful, they offer the potential to support monitoring, reporting, policy setting, and management of terrestrial biospheric resources. The context for these requirements and possibilities is illustrated with reference to the China Carbon Sequestration Project and its findings. Crown Copyright (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Quantifying Carbon Sequestration Service Flow Associated with Human Activities Based on Network Model on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,"The flow of ecosystem services between regions as a result of the mismatch of supply and demand has increasingly become a new research focus. Clarifying the spatial regularity of ecosystem service flow is of great significance for realizing regional sustainable development and improving human well-being. This study applied a network model to map the interregional carbon flow based on the supply and demand of carbon sequestration service, and the driving effect of various driving factors was further analyzed. The results showed that the demand for carbon sequestration service on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau increased steadily from 2000 to 2019, resulting in an increasingly significant difference between supply and demand with more than 20 million tons. In the carbon sequestration service flow network, the number of defined deficit nodes increased to 22 in 2010, but decreased to 21 in 2019. The interrupted edges continued to increase to 16, and the network density dropped to 0.022. The carbon sequestration service flow network on the northeastern parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was severely damaged. With the high-quality development of animal husbandry, the impact of grazing intensity on the difference between the supply and demand of carbon sequestration service has been weakened. When urbanization reached a certain level, the driving effects of urbanization and agricultural activities increased significantly.

"Quantifying Impacts of Regional Multiple Factors on Spatiotemporal the Mechanisms for Spatio-temporal changes of Net Primary Vegetation Productivity and Net Ecosystem Productivity: An Example in the Jianghuai River Basin, China","Despite much valuable research on the mechanisms for spatio-tempo-ral changesof net primary vegetation productivity (NPP) and net eco-system productivity (NEP), there is a paucity of information on assess-ing impacts of regional multiple factors on spatiotemporal researchs of NPP and NEP in the complex environment. This study attempts to bridge this information gap using the Jianghuai Basin in China as a case study. Using a field campaign, remotely sensed imagery, socioeco-nomic data, and meteorological parameters, we developed a frame -work based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, correlation technique, trend analysis, and landscape metrics to mea-sure spatiotemporal changes in NPP and NEP from 2001 to 2018. The derived changes were then linked to regional multiple factors including climate, landscape factors, human activity, and land use change.

Quantifying land-use change impacts on the dynamic evolution of flood vulnerability,"Recently, dramatic flood disasters have occurred incrementally in several regions of the world. Land-use change as one of the main affecting factors becomes a key component in flood risk management. This study strives to deal with quantifying how changes in land use to affect the dynamic evolution of flood vulnerability. The floodplains of Wuhan, which are located in the Yangtze River Basin, have been selected as an example. In this paper, we use GIS to gather different historical geometric data as sources of land-use information. By proposing the Simpsons-dominance index and location index to analyze the characteristics of land-use changes, and building a quantitative model to measure flood vulnerability, a series of flood vulnerability maps demonstrate differential flood vulnerability of floodplains of Wuhan in three inundation scenarios and four historical periods. Finally, the non-parametric correlation is used to reveal the interactive effect of land use and flood vulnerability. Based on this study, comprehensive flood disaster management strategies for land-use planning are proposed for government decision-makers to reduce the flood vulnerability of Wuhan in future.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying uncertainty in soot volume fraction estimates using Bayesian inference of auto-correlated laser-induced incandescence measurements,"Auto-correlated laser-induced incandescence (AC-LII) infers the soot volume fraction (SVF) of soot particles by comparing the spectral incandescence from laser-energized particles to the pyrometrically inferred peak soot temperature. This calculation requires detailed knowledge of model parameters such as the absorption function of soot, which may vary with combustion chemistry, soot age, and the internal structure of the soot. This work presents a Bayesian methodology to quantify such uncertainties. This technique treats the additional ""nuisance"" model parameters, including the soot absorption function, as stochastic variables and incorporates the current state of knowledge of these parameters into the inference process through maximum entropy priors. While standard AC-LII analysis provides a point estimate of the SVF, Bayesian techniques infer the posterior probability density, which will allow scientists and engineers to better assess the reliability of AC-LII inferred SVFs in the context of environmental regulations and competing diagnostics.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantitative distribution and quantized ecological threat of microplastics in farmland: Shanghai as an example,"The occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in farmlands poses a threat to soil health and crop yield. There needs to be more research on the role of cropping patterns in the accumulation of MPs and quantizing the threat of MPs on soil health and crop yield. In this study, a field study was carried out to explore the role of cropping patterns in the accumulation of MPs in agricultural soil in Shanghai, China. Furthermore, the specific effect and importance of MPs and each soil physicochemical indicator to soil health and crop yield were clarified, and the threat of MPs in reducing soil health and crop yield was quantized. Relative lower MPs abundance was detected in Shanghai. MPs abundance in vegetable fields was significantly higher than that in orchards. The broad source of MPs, the acceleration of plastics breaking under artificial disturbance and warmer temperatures, and the block of MPs exchange could account for the quicker accumulation of MPs in vegetable fields. MPs have a negligible effect on microbial diversity and metabolic activity which plays a role in soil enzyme activity. Besides, MPs served as one of the critical factors for rice yield reduction.",Not About Sufficiency
Queuing models to analyze dwell-point and cross-aisle location in autonomous vehicle-based warehouse systems,"Technological innovations in warehouse automation systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle based Storage and Retrieval System (AVS/RS), are geared towards achieving greater operational efficiency and flexibility that would be necessary in warehouses of the future. AVS/RS relies on autonomous vehicles and lifts for horizontal and vertical transfer of unit-loads respectively. To implement a new technology such as AVS/RS, the choice of a design variable setting, interactions among the design variables, and the design trade-offs need to be well understood. In particular, design decisions such as the choice of vehicle dwell-point and location of cross-aisles could significantly affect the performance of an AVS/RS. Hence, we investigate the effect of these design decisions using customized analytical models based on multi-class semi-open queuing network theory. Numerical studies suggest that the average percentage reduction in storage and retrieval transactions with appropriate choice of dwell-point is about 8 percent and 4 percent respectively. While end of aisle location of the cross-aisle is commonly used in practice, our model suggests that there exists a better cross-aisle location within a tier (about 15 percent from end of aisle); however, the cycle time benefits by choosing the optimal cross-aisle location in comparison to the end of aisle cross-aisle location is marginal. Detailed simulations also indicate that the analytical model yields fairly accurate results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Risky Borders: Traffic Pollution and Health Effects at US-Mexican Ports of Entry,"Delays and community traffic problems associated with US-Mexican border ports of entry have been criticized for causing economic losses and increasing social stressors. This paper draws attention to an overlooked issue, the potential for adverse health effects associated with being exposed to localized high levels of traffic pollutants on border crossers and nearby communities at ports of entry along the US-Mexican border. The literature on health effects of exposure to near-road traffic pollution is incorporated into an analysis of the situation along the USMexican border. This paper synthesizes the information available regarding excessive wait times at the border and describes preliminary studies linking these delays to elevated traffic pollution levels. We frame exposure to traffic pollutants at US-Mexican ports of entry as an environmental justice issue in that the burden of exposures and associated risks of health effects is borne by nearby low income minority communities. Mitigation strategies are explored and reduction of border crossing wait times is identified as the most feasible action. Adverse effects of exposure to near traffic pollution are likely applicable to congested borders throughout the world.",Not About Sufficiency
Race and Street-Level Firework Legalization as Primary Determinants of July 4th Air Pollution across Southern California,"Air pollution is a major public health threat that is associated with asthma, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and all-cause mortality. Among the most important acute air pollution events occurring each year are celebrations involving fireworks, such as the 4th of July holiday in the United States. In this community-engaged study, academic partners and residents collaborated to collect indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentration measurements in the disadvantaged city of Santa Ana, California, using low-cost AtmoTube sensor devices before, during and after the July 4th firework celebration, while also examining July 4th data extracted from the PurpleAir sensor network across over a hundred other cities in southern California. Average outdoor PM2.5 concentrations on July 4th were found to be three-to-five times higher than baseline, with hourly concentrations exceeding 160 mu g/m(3). Outdoor averages were roughly 30% to 100% higher than indoor levels. The most polluted cities exhibited 15-times higher PM2.5 levels compared with the least contaminated cities and were often those where household-level fireworks were legal for sale and use. Race/ethnicity was found to be the leading predictor of July 4th-related air pollution across three counties in southern California, with greater PM2.5 being associated with higher proportions of Hispanic residents and lower proportions of White residents. The findings from this study underscore the importance of environmental justice as it relates to firework-related air pollution exposure, and the critical role city- and county-level firework policies play in determining exposure.",Not About Sufficiency
SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth - A gendered analysis,"SDG 8 calls for promoting 'sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all'. Even as it highlights the importance of labour rights for all, it also makes visible some significant tensions. We note, for example, that despite many critiques of narrow economic measures of growth, the focus here remains on GDP and per capita growth. This is problematic, we argue, because the GDP productive boundary excludes much of social reproductive work. This puts SDG8 in tension with SDG 5 which calls for the recognition of the value of unpaid care and domestic work. There has been a significant increase in the rate of working women in the formal and informal sector. However, there has not been a subsequent gender shift in the doing of social reproductive work. In this paper we argue SDG 8's focus on decent work and economic growth is inadequate; that productive employment and decent work for all men and women by 2030 needs to take into account the value and costs of social reproduction. We trace key historical debates on work to argue that both gender and labour rights have to underpin SDG 8 if its promise of inclusive, sustainable and decent work is to be realized.

"Between Indians and ""cowboys"": the role of ICT in the management of contradictory self-images and the production of carbon credits in the Brazilian Amazon","In this paper, we draw upon Goffman's symbolic interactionism to analyze the ways in which new users in developing countries have adopted ICT to present and manage contradictory self-images to different groups of the public. In particular, we show that the Acapu, an indigenous group in the Amazon, present themselves through online videos and websites as ideal Indians: innate forest stewards aiming to mitigate climate change and ensure the planet's environmental sustainability. At the same time, the Acapu are also represented through a complex computer simulation model as destructive ""cowboys"": farmers and ranchers who are willing to develop by clearing their forests in the absence of financial compensation. This research shows that these two opposing self-images, while contradictory, are necessary for the implementation of REDD projects (a payment mechanism for reducing greenhouse emissions from deforestation). In order to obtain carbon credits from avoided deforestation, the project relies on the difference between deforestation measurements and high levels of predicted deforestation, which in turn, depend on the presentation of destructive self-images through the use of a complex computer simulation. But to sell these credits on a voluntary carbon market, it is necessary for the Acapu to openly market a self-image through the Internet which is attractive to corporate buyers willing to boost their eco-friendly profile. Based on this analysis, the paper challenges the narrative whereby Southern ICT users are passive receivers of technological black boxes. In contrast, it shows that in some cases these new users may participate in the creation of ICT artifacts to manage the impressions of distant audiences. Furthermore, the paper calls attention to the role of computer simulations and other ICT applications in concealing the paradoxes of neoliberal environmental management practices.",Not About Sufficiency
Comparative analysis of the combustion and emission characteristics of biojet and conventional Jet A-1 fuel: a review,"Conventional jet fuels derived from fossil sources contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, leading to climate change. Recent studies have shown that biobased jet fuels from different feedstocks offer a more sustainable alternative to conventional fuels as they are derived from renewable biomass, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The major feedstocks reviewed are jatropha curcas, camelina, karanja oil, waste cooking oil, and municipal solid waste. They offer diverse benefits for sustainable aviation fuel development. As a comparative analysis, this review examined jet fuel characteristics based on their physicochemical properties, namely energy content, viscosity, calorific value, cetane number, and freezing and flash points. The objective was to understand the influence of the properties on performance evaluation, environmental impact, and combustion characteristics. The properties of biojet fuels are compared with their fossil counterparts to validate their suitability as renewable alternatives and their benefits in terms of emissions reduction and engine performance. Biojet fuels perform better in terms of lower sulfur content, lower soot content, and a lower freezing point, their aromatic content, and their high cetane number. This study enhances the understanding of biojet fuels and their quality, and supports the development of sustainable fuel options. Overall, adherence to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D7566-18 standard is crucial for the acceptance and integration of biojet fuels into the aviation sector. Future research should explore feedstocks such as wood biomass, wastepaper, and agricultural residues for biojet fuels. It should also investigate the combustion and emission characteristics of biosourced aviation fuel at higher blending ratios (>50% by volume) with fossil Jet A-1.",Not About Sufficiency
"Convergence, Development, and Energy-Intensive Infrastructure in Africa: A Review of the Evidence","The structural changes in an economy that accompany its growth to high-income status have been predictable in Europe, the United States, and Asia, characterized by declining employment in agriculture and rising levels of urbanization driven by jobs in the modern industrial sector. As agricultural productivity rises, the share of people employed in agriculture declines, and both urbanization and employment in manufacturing increase. Food prices fall relative to wages, causing the share of income spent on food to decline to very low levels. Asian countries have followed a similar path, although at a much faster pace. Africa, however, is different. Despite a high share of the population in urban areas, most African countries have yet to see significant increases in agricultural productivity that might drive industrial growth and jobs. The rising share of urban population has not been matched by increases in agricultural productivity, falling food prices, or the emergence of a viable industrial sector. Available evidence shows that agricultural yields in Africa are low and food is costly, while the share of employment in agriculture remains high. For the process of structural transformation to get underway, African countries must invest in the manufacture of fertilizer, develop better methods of water control, improve transportation, and invest in cold storage. Each of these interventions requires significant amounts of energy, including energy from fossil fuels, and they are not replaceable-countries have managed structural transformation in different ways but to date none have leapfrogged the process.</p>",Not About Sufficiency
Range-wide breeding habitat use of the critically endangered Yellow-breasted Bunting Emberiza aureola after population collapse,"The population of the Yellow-breasted Bunting Emberiza aureola, a formerly widely distributed and abundant songbird of northern Eurasia, suffered a catastrophic decline and a strong range contraction between 1980 and 2013. There is evidence that the decline was driven by illegal trapping during migration, but potential contributions of other factors to the decline, such as land-use change, have not yet been evaluated. Before the effects of land-use change can be evaluated, a basic understanding of the ecological requirements of the species is needed. We therefore compared habitat use in ten remaining breeding regions across the range, from European Russia to Japan and the Russian Far East. We also assessed large-scale variation in habitat parameters across the breeding range. We found large variation in habitat use, within and between populations. Differences were related to the cover and height of trees and shrubs at Yellow-breasted Bunting territories. In many regions, Yellow-breasted Buntings occupied early successional stages, including anthropogenic habitats characterized by mowing, grazing, or fire regimes. We found that the probability of presence can be best predicted with the cover of shrubs, herbs, and grasses. Highest probabilities were found at shrub cover values of 40%-70%. Differences in habitat use along a longitudinal gradient were small, but we found strong differences across latitudes, possibly related to habitat availability. We conclude that the remaining Yellow-breasted Bunting populations are not limited to specific habitat types. Our results provide important baseline information to model the range-wide distribution of this critically endangered species and to guide targeted conservation measures.",Not About Sufficiency
Rapid innovation diffusion in social networks,"Social and technological innovations often spread through social networks as people respond to what their neighbors are doing. Previous research has identified specific network structures, such as local clustering, that promote rapid diffusion. Here we derive bounds that are independent of network structure and size, such that diffusion is fast whenever the payoff gain from the innovation is sufficiently high and the agents' responses are sufficiently noisy. We also provide a simple method for computing an upper bound on the expected time it takes for the innovation to become established in any finite network. For example, if agents choose log-linear responses to what their neighbors are doing, it takes on average less than 80 revision periods for the innovation to diffuse widely in any network, provided that the error rate is at least 5% and the payoff gain (relative to the status quo) is at least 150%.

Realising the potential of cultural heritage to achieve climate change actions in the Netherlands,"Climate change impacts on diverse cultural heritage is gaining scholarly and policy attention, yet little research has been conducted on how can diverse cultural heritage inform decisionmakers and policymakers in achieving climate change actions (i.e., climate change adaptation and mitigation). For this study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Dutch cultural heritage and environmental or climate change experts (n = 52) and participant observations across the Netherlands to explore the importance of cultural heritage benefits and their relation to climate change actions. We also explored the perceptions of cultural heritage management over time, including the influence of climate policy on heritage practice in the Netherlands. Our findings show that experts perceived a multiplicity of heritage benefits as important in supporting and informing present and future climate change actions. The most salient benefits were informational benefits where diverse cultural heritage is perceived as an important source of knowledge about past societal, economic and environmental developments and changes. Further, heritage management was perceived as constantly changing over time, reflecting the transformative nature of diverse heritage types. Experts agreed that climate policy has already influenced cultural heritage practice in the Netherlands. Lastly, the interrelationships between heritage benefits and management were identified and characterised. This study informs both cultural heritage and climate change research agendas and helps leverage diverse cultural heritage into climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Reassessing grain price variability in early modern Europe (c. 1500-1800),"Grain was the most important food source in Europe during the early modern period (c. c . 1500- 1800). The price level of grain and its volatility played a pivotal role in determining food security and, ultimately, societal and human well-being. Conflicting findings have been reported as to what extent early modern grain price volatility decreased over time. We systematically reassess early modern grain price variability, using 69 annual price series of barley, oats, rye and wheat, and different statistical methods to obtain insights into spatio-temporal changes. Over the entirety of Europe, the different grain types showed a strong price correlation, implying a low level of food security, but the price inter-correlation between grain types decreased over time - indicating an improved level of food security. Grain price volatility significantly decreased over time, especially after c . 1725 and at coastal locations, lessening the risk of food stress and reflecting market improvement from the perspective of consumers. Changes in price volatility closely followed changes in price levels until the mid-seventeenth century, when both started to be increasingly independent of each other, partly owing to less abrupt volatility changes. The largest increase in both price level and volatility is observed during the 'price revolution' of the late sixteenth century as well as during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). In general, a high-price-low volatility pattern (and vice versa) ) is found throughout the early modern period and especially during the seventeenth century. This relationship, however, exhibits a somewhat geographically heterogeneous pattern, although with lower prices but higher volatility predominating in inland regions. To summarise, our results support the assumption that the level of food security improved over time and especially during the eighteenth century, but at the same time reveal considerable differences between grain types, measures considered, and geographical regions. The findings of this study point towards the need for further research on the geographical patterns of grain price variability and the factors explaining them.",Not About Sufficiency

Recent advances in E-monitoring of plant diseases,"Infectious plant diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, such as fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, phytoplasma, and nematodes. Plant diseases have a significant effect on the plant quality and yield and they can destroy the entire plant if they are not controlled in time. To minimize disease-related losses, it is essential to identify and control pathogens in the early stages. Plant disease control is thus a fundamental challenge both for global food security and sustainable agriculture. Conventional methods for plant diseases control have given place to electronic control (E-monitoring) due to their lack of portability, being time consuming, need for a specialized user, etc. E-monitoring using electronic nose (e-nose), biosensors, wearable sensors, and 'electronic eyes' has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Detection, identification, and quantification of pathogens based on electronic sensors (E-sensors) are both convenient and practical and may be used in combination with conventional methods. This paper discusses recent advances made in E-sensors as component parts in combination with wearable sensors, in electronic sensing systems to control and detect viruses, bacteria, pathogens and fungi.

"Reducing car dependence in the heart of Europe: lessons from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland","Munich, Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna, and Zurich - the largest cities in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland - have significantly reduced the car share of trips over the past 25 years in spite of high motorisation rates. The key to their success has been a coordinated package of mutually reinforcing transport and land-use policies that have made car use slower, less convenient, and more costly, while increasing the safety, convenience, and feasibility of walking, cycling, and public transport. The mix of policies implemented in each city has been somewhat different. The German cities have done far more to promote cycling, while Zurich and Vienna offer more public transport service per capita at lower fares. All five of the cities have implemented roughly the same policies to promote walking, foster compact mixed-use development, and discourage car use. Of the car-restrictive policies, parking management has been by far the most important.

Regional variations in greenhouse gas emissions of biobased products in the United States-corn-based ethanol and soybean oil,"Regional variations in the environmental impacts of plant biomass production are significant, and the environmental impacts associated with feedstock supply also contribute substantially to the environmental performance of biobased products. Thus, the regional variations in the environmental performance of biobased products are also significant. This study scrutinizes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with two biobased products (i.e., ethanol and soybean oil) whose feedstocks (i.e., corn and soybean) are produced in different farming locations. We chose 40 counties in Corn Belt States in the United States as biorefinery locations (i.e., corn dry milling, soybean crushing) and farming sites, and estimated cradle-to-gate GHG emissions of ethanol and of soybean oil, respectively. The estimates are based on 1 kg of each biobased product (i.e., ethanol or soybean oil). The system boundary includes biomass production, the biorefinery, and upstream processes. Effects of direct land use change are included in the greenhouse gas analysis and measured as changes in soil organic carbon level, while the effects of indirect land use change are not considered in the baseline calculations. Those indirect effects however are scrutinized in a sensitivity analysis. GHG emissions of corn-based ethanol range from 1.1 to 2.0 kg of CO(2) equivalent per kilogram of ethanol, while GHG emissions of soybean oil are 0.4-2.5 kg of CO(2) equivalent per kilogram of soybean oil. Thus, the regional variations due to farming locations are significant (by factors of 2-7). The largest GHG emission sources in ethanol production are N(2)O emissions from soil during corn cultivation and carbon dioxide from burning the natural gas used in corn dry milling. The second largest GHG emission source groups in the ethanol production system are nitrogen fertilizer (8-12%), carbon sequestration by soil (-15-2%), and electricity used in corn dry milling (7-16%). The largest GHG emission sources in soybean oil production are N(2)O emissions from soil during soybean cultivation (13-57%) and carbon dioxide from burning the natural gas used in soybean crushing (21-47%). The second largest GHG emission source groups in soybean oil production are carbon sequestration by soil (-29-24%), diesel used in soybean cultivation (4-24%), and electricity used in the soybean crushing process (10-21%). The indirect land use changes increase GHG emissions of ethanol by 7-38%, depending on the fraction of forest converted when newly converted croplands maintain crop cultivation for 100 years. Farming sites with higher biomass yields, lower nitrogen fertilizer application rates, and less tillage are favorable to future biorefinery locations in terms of global warming. For existing biorefineries, farmers are encouraged to apply a site-specific optimal nitrogen fertilizer application rate, to convert to no-tillage practices and also to adopt winter cover practices whenever possible to reduce the GHG emissions of their biobased products. Current practices for estimating the effects of indirect land use changes suffer from large uncertainties. More research and consensus about system boundaries and allocation issues are needed to reduce uncertainties related to the effects of indirect land use changes.",Not About Sufficiency

Relationship between nitrogen functionality and wheat flour dough rheology: Extensional and shear approaches,"Nitrogen supplied to wheat crops to increase grain productivity is being scrutinized because of its role in greenhouse gas emissions. Nitrogen affects food quality as well as food security because it increases grain protein content and can change wheat protein composition, both of which affect the rheological properties of dough made from the grain. This review explores the relationship between nitrogen functionality, wheat protein content and the ratio of gliadins to glutenins through critical assessment of recent studies on nitrogen fertilization of wheat. Moreover, by studying how variations in protein content and the gliadins/glutenins ratio affect the shear and extensional rheological properties of the dough, this review elucidates the direct role of nitrogen on wheat flour dough behavior during processing because process operations primarily employ extensional and shear forces. Nitrogen uptake by wheat plants leads to an increase in wheat protein content and changes in the glia-dins/glutenins ratio. Confounding factors associated with wheat plant growth and dough preparation make it difficult to definitively separate effects of wheat protein content from effects of wheat protein composition on dough rheology. Nevertheless, in general, higher protein content is associated with larger gliadins/glutenins ratios, resulting in wheat flour doughs that are more extensible.",Not About Sufficiency
Relationship with the land as a foundation for ecosystem stewardship,"We examined the hypothesis that adapting to ecosystem change on working landscapes can be enhanced by supporting the place-based stewardship values of landowners. On the basis of responses to a survey of more than 500 landowners across a landscape dominated by working lands, we clustered landowners into five groups based on their sense of place meanings. Relationships with the land are differentiated by the degree to which an owner's land makes positive contributions to well-being and the degree to which the land supports livelihoods. Positive contributions to well-being are related to stronger stewardship-oriented management styles, yet a combination of well-being and livelihood dependence is most closely related to increased sensitivity to ecosystem transformation. In a social-ecological system dominated by private lands, understanding an individual's relationship with the land is central to understanding adaptive capacity and for identifying policy options to successfully respond to ecological transformation.",Not About Sufficiency
Remote sensing reveals scale-specific effects of forage crop mowing and landscape structure on a declining farmland bird,"The effectiveness of agri-environment schemes (AESs), the largest conservation-related expenditure for farmland biodiversity conservation within the European Union, is often compromised by a limited spatial scale of implementation. We focused on multiannual forage crops, a surrogate habitat for grassland birds, to assess the scale-dependent effects of mowing timing and frequency on the local population size of an iconic species, the skylark (Alauda arvensis). While there is much evidence for a negative impact of in-field mowing activities on grassland birds, whether such effects occur also at broader spatial scales is largely unknown. We surveyed breeding skylarks in the Po Plain (northern Italy) to determine (1) the association between landscape composition/configuration and abundance and (2) how abundance is affected by forage crop mowing timing and frequency. We addressed both questions through scale optimisation, identifying the most influential spatial scales for each covariate. Forage crop mowing timing was assessed through a novel remote sensing algorithm based on high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images. We observed a strong scale dependence on the importance of different habitats in determining skylark abundance. Abundance increased with an increasing cover of forage crops locally (200 m) and of winter crops at a landscape scale (2600 m), suggesting that the species is favoured by heterogeneous agroecosystems. Locally (150-350 m), skylarks were more abundant when crops were aggregated, being negatively impacted by crop fragmentation caused by urbanization and by seminatural habitats. At the landscape scale (1150 m), the timing of mowing was consistent across years, with early-mown areas supporting fewer skylarks. This is probably because, over longer temporal scales, early-mown forage patches have limited or null productivity, eventually limiting local population size. Synthesis and applications. We provide a new perspective on the overarching influence of spatial scale in driving the abundance of a declining farmland bird species, supporting the urgency of designing landscape scale-effective AESs. This should be framed within the new EU Common Agricultural Policy reform and operated by farmer collectives, whereby management interventions should be monitored by state-of-the-art remote sensing techniques. These results suggest that implementing scale-optimized AESs could be crucial for effective farmland biodiversity conservation.

"Renewable energy from willow biomass crops: Life cycle energy, environmental and economic performance","Short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) along with other woody biomass feedstocks will play a significant role in a more secure and sustainable energy future for the United States and around the world. In temperate regions, shrub willows are being developed as a SRWC because of their potential for high biomass production in short time periods, ease of vegetative propagation, broad genetic base, and ability to resprout after multiple harvests. Understanding and working with willow's biology is important for the agricultural and economic success of the system. The energy, environmental, and economic performance of willow biomass production and conversion to electricity is evaluated using life cycle modeling methods. The net energy ratio (electricity generated/life cycle fossil fuel consumed) for willow ranges from 10 to 13 for direct firing and gasification processes. Reductions of 70 to 98 percent (compared to U.S. grid generated electricity) in greenhouse gas emissions as well as NOx, SO2, and particulate emissions are achieved. Despite willow's multiple environmental and rural development benefits, its high cost of production has limited deployment. Costs will be lowered by significant improvements in yields and production efficiency and by valuing the system's environmental and rural development benefits. Policies like the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), federal biomass tax credits and renewable portfolio standards will make willow cost competitive in the near term. The avoided air pollution from the substitution of willow for conventional fossil fuel generated electricity has an estimated damage cost of $0.02 to $0.06 kWh(-1). The land intensity of about 4.9 x 10(-5) ha-yr/kWh is greater than other renewable energy sources. This may be considered the most significant limitation of willow, but unlike other biomass crops such as corn it can be cultivated on the millions of hectares of marginal agricultural lands, improving site conditions, soil quality and landscape diversity. A clear advantage of willow biomass compared to other renewables is that it is a stock resource whereas wind and PV are intermittent. With only 6 percent of the current U.S. energy consumption met by renewable sources the accelerated development of willow biomass and other renewable energy sources is critical to address concerns of energy security and environmental impacts associated with fossil fuels.",Not About Sufficiency
Indirect carbon dioxide emissions from producing bioenergy from forest harvest residues,"Forest harvest residues are important raw materials for bioenergy in regions practicing forestry. Removing these residues from a harvest site reduces the carbon stock of the forest compared with conventional stem-only harvest because less litter in left on the site. The indirect carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from producing bioenergy occur when carbon in the logging residues is emitted into the atmosphere at once through combustion, instead of being released little by little as a result of decomposition at the harvest sites. In this study (1) we introduce an approach to calculate this indirect emission from using logging residues for bioenergy production, and (2) estimate this emission at a typical target of harvest residue removal, i.e. boreal Norway spruce forest in Finland. The removal of stumps caused a larger indirect emission per unit of energy produced than the removal of branches because of a lower decomposition rate of the stumps. The indirect emission per unit of energy produced decreased with time since starting to collect the harvest residues as a result of decomposition at older harvest sites. During the 100 years of conducting this practice, the indirect emission from average-sized branches (diameter 2 cm) decreased from 340 to 70 kg CO2 eq. MWh-1 and that from stumps (diameter 26 cm) from 340 to 160 kg CO2 eq. MWh-1. These emissions are an order of magnitude larger than the other emissions (collecting, transporting, etc.) from the bioenergy production chain. When the bioenergy production was started, the total emissions were comparable to fossil fuels. The practice had to be carried out for 22 (stumps) or four (branches) years until the total emissions dropped below the emissions of natural gas. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for land-use-related indirect emissions to correctly estimate the efficiency of bioenergy in reducing CO2 emission into the atmosphere.",Not About Sufficiency
Reproductive allocation of two dioecious Rhamnus species in temperate forests of northeast China,"When a plant increases resource allocation to reproduction from its limited reserves, the allocation to the other functions is reduced. Because of these trade-offs, differences in reproductive allocation are believed to result in relative differences in life history traits. Dioecious plants provide an excellent opportunity for detecting such possible trade-offs in resource allocation. This study aims to present a finding about the gender-based cost of reproductive allocation. The trade-off between reproduction and foliage biomass allocation was examined in Rhamnus davurica and Rhamnus schneideri at different modular levels (shoot/sub-branch, branch, and shrub/tree level). There were no intra-annual trade-offs between reproduction and foliage biomass in either sex of either species at shoot/sub-branch level, branch level and shrub level. Inter-annual trade-offs were detected in females for both species. Inter-annual trade-offs existed at all three different modular levels in R. schneideri females, while the evidence of inter-annual trade-offs was only detected at branch level in R. davurica females. At the population level, the sex ratio was female-biased in 2010, and it did not significantly deviate from 1: 1 in 2011 in R. davurica. However, the sex ratios were significantly female-biased in both 2010 and 2011 in R. schneideri. This study show that the degree of autonomy of the different plant organs influences the trade-offs between reproduction and growth, which suggests a species- and sex-dependent modular autonomy.",Not About Sufficiency
Reptile assemblages across agricultural landscapes: where does biodiversity hide?,"Reptile assemblages across agricultural landscapes: where does biodiversity hide?-The transition from traditional to intensive farming, aimed at large scale production, has rapidly altered agricultural landscapes, leading to the reduction and fragmentation of natural habitats and to the consequent loss of biodiversity. Herpetofauna is seriously threatened by agriculture intensification worldwide, but less is known about its distribution in agro-ecosystems, especially at field scale. We analysed reptile abundance and diversity in eight agricultural and semi natural land uses, and inside vegetated buffer strips interspersed among fields. Interestingly, most reptiles were recorded in the buffer strips while intensive crops and pastures hosted just one lizard species. Richness of individuals and species increased when strips were connected to semi natural areas, independently of their width and vegetation structure. In view of our results, that highlight the role of minor landscape features for the presence of vertebrates in intensive agro-ecosystems, we recommend the implementation of buffer strips among the measures for vertebrate conservation in agricultural landscapes.",Not About Sufficiency
Research on a Carbon Reduction Optimization Model for a Megalopolis Based on Land-Use Planning and ICCLP Method,"For the primary purpose of minimizing carbon dioxide emissions in a megalopolis, an optimization model that remarkably reduces carbon emissions for the megalopolis, which is based on the inexact chance-constrained linear programming (ICCLP) method and incorporates interval linear programming (ILP), and chance constrained programming (CCP), has been constructed. The corresponding net emissions of carbon dioxide results in probability levels of default equalling p(i)=0.01, 0.05, 0.1 are [1,383.379, 1,825.311]x 10(4), [1,357.728, 1,800.841]x10(4), [1,338.671, 1,780.060]x10(4) tons in the megalopolis in 2015. Besides, the areas of different types of carbon-sinkable land of various cities within planned regions are obtained. The volume of energy consumption of dominating energy consumption industries in planned regions equals [965.52, 1,136.79]x10(4) tons, which is reduced by [14.97, 22.09]%, while the intensity of energy consumption is decreased by [18.00, 20.00]% compared with that in 2010. Meanwhile, the intensities of carbon emissions are reduced by 20.00%, 19.00%, and 18.08%, respectively, under the conditions of p(i)=0.01, 0.05, 0.1.

Resilience of an evolved retail agglomeration: case of rural periodic markets in emerging economies,"Purpose The objective of the study is to understand the reasons for the resilience of rural periodic markets. Small retailers patronise these markets, and by identifying the reasons for their continued market participation, an attempt has been made to explain the continued existence of these traditional evolved retail agglomerations. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research design was adopted for the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 35 small retailers, and responses were used to identify the reasons for their continued market participation. A mix of purposeful and snowball sampling was used to select the respondents. Findings In a novel endeavour, this study presents rural periodic markets as an evolved retail agglomeration. It identifies six factors responsible for the continued participation of small retailers in these markets.

Resource heterogeneity but not inbreeding affects growth and grouping behaviour in socially foraging juvenile cichlid fish,"1. Spatial food distribution determines resource profitability, defensibility and encounter rate of foragers. Clumped food distribution can promote aggressiveness and resource monopolisation, in turn increasing within-group variation in food intake and growth. However, the effects of food distribution may depend on foraging strategies. Little is known about the impact of spatial food heterogeneity on growth and grouping behaviour in social foragers in the absence of monopolisation. 2. Social foraging is present in many fishes, particularly at early juvenile life stages when fish are especially sensitive to environmental variation. Here, a heterogeneous food distribution may impair foraging success and growth and juveniles may increase sociability to attain social information about food resources. 3. We examined the impact of the spatial distribution of food as well as inbreeding on growth and social behaviour in juveniles of the cichlid fish Pelvicachromis pulcher. Inbred individuals often show poorer performance than outbred individuals (inbreeding depression), but inbreeding effects can be environment dependent. In the experiment, inbred and outbred fish were reared in a split-clutch design either under homogeneously distributed or spatially clumped food conditions for 8 weeks starting 1 week after juveniles could actively feed. We documented growth and performed a shoaling assay and a sociality test (choice between a large vs. a small shoal) after 6 weeks. 4. Spatial food distribution did not affect within-group body length variation, but individuals reared under clumped food conditions were smaller. Shoals of the different feeding conditions differed in social behaviour. Shoals of the clumped treatment group showed higher variation in inter-individual distances compared to shoals of the homogeneous treatment group. Furthermore, focal fish of the clumped treatment adjusted their association preference to the position of the groups' largest individual. We did not find significant inbreeding or environment-dependent inbreeding effects regarding growth or social behaviour. 5. Our study suggests that a clumped food distribution can impede localisation of food resources and thus growth in juvenile social foragers. Accordingly, in heterogeneous environments, the use of social information may be highly relevant to increase individuals' foraging success potentially explaining orientation on successful foragers, that is, large individuals. Inter-individual variation in juvenile's social behaviour may precede variation in food monopolisation capability and in growth emerging at later life stages.",Not About Sufficiency
Response of small mammals to variable agricultural landscapes in Central Europe,"The Central European agricultural landscape has undergone a number of changes over recent decades, with overall field area decreasing and adjacent habitats increasing. Here, we document changes in small mammal communities associated with crop fields and adjacent fallow land in a highly agriculture landscape of the Czech Republic. The most numerous species overall were wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and common voles (Microtus arvalis). Highest diversity, species richness and abundance were observed in fallow habitats and in crops providing long-term vegetation cover. Community composition and abundance were dependent on crop and season. Mice used all habitats depending on instantaneous vegetation stage, though some habitats only for a short period during seeding or harvest. Common voles reached highest densities in habitats providing a stable food supply. Mice and voles both preferred perennial ""non-crop"" plots during winter as they provided a diverse food supply and undisturbed nesting opportunities. Overall, fallow habitats supported the most abundant, diverse and stable small mammal communities and, as such, they have high biodiversity value. (C) 2016 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

Retirement pathways and pension inequality in China: a grounded theory study,"Purpose Existing research focuses on the pension systems and reforms in China from a macro-level and financial perspective. The expectations of mid-life Chinese people regarding their retirement and pensions have been ignored to date, and this research set out to address this lacuna. Design/methodology/approach The application of qualitative research methods is relatively novel in Chinese social science. As a grounded theory (GT) study, the research reported here deployed semi-structured interviews to investigate middle-aged Chinese women's and men's perceptions of their pensions and retirement. In total, 36 interviews were conducted, following the constructivist GT method. Findings The data point to disparities between the choices and perceptions of individuals on the one hand and the official assumptions underlying the current pension regime on the other hand. Research participants had varying interpretations of the inequality in retirement incomes in China, the main division being between enterprise workers and public-sector employees. Originality/value Although there are in principle rigidly fixed retirement ages for men and women in contemporary China, the phenomena of early retirement and working post-retirement are increasing. There are trade-offs between work/retirement and family needs, which influence the choices of middle-aged citizens.

"Retirement policy: a review of the role, characteristics, and contribution of the Australian superannuation system","With a market capitalisation of over $1.84 trillion dollars and large annual flows, the Superannuation Guarantee has been regarded as the backbone of Australia's retirement policy scheme and a primary driver of economic growth. However, losses encountered in the aftermath of the global financial crisis led to a major review of superannuation, mainly in response to the lack of accountability, comparability, and transparency discovered within default' investment options. An outcome of this review was the MySuper initiative, which imposes obligations on fund providers to reconfigure their default investment strategies in accordance with new regulatory requirements. Despite these policy reforms, other challenges remain, such as gender inequality, excessive superannuation fees, low financial literacy, and lack of member participation in growing retirement savings. The paper provides a review of literature pertaining to the background, significant policy changes, and ongoing development of the Australian superannuation system. We emphasise the role of superannuation in the economy; characteristics of the industry, plans, and funds on offer; recent policy initiatives; and perceived inadequacies of the system.

"Retrieval of chromium and mercury concentrations in agricultural soils: Using spectral information, environmental covariates, or a fusion of both?","The universal contamination of arable land with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) poses a severe threat to food security and jeopardizes worldwide efforts to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). How to obtain more reliable concentrations of PTEs in regional agricultural soils is a priority problem to be solved. Multispectral satellite remote sensing, with its advantages of high spatial and temporal resolution, broad coverage, and low cost, offers the potential to acquire spatial distribution of PTEs in agricultural soils over large areas. However, owing to the complexity of soil environments and the insufficiency of spectral information, the mechanism for retrieving concentrations of PTEs in agricultural soils via multispectral satellites is not yet clear, and the accuracy needs to be improved. In this study, we aimed to assess whether employing a fusion of spectral information and environmental covariates, results in more accurate retrievals of PTEs, specifically chromium (Cr) and mercury (Hg), in croplands than does employing spectral information alone. Three machine learning algorithms-kernel-based support vector machine (SVM), neural network-based back propagation neural network (BPNN), and tree-based extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-were developed to retrieve Cr and Hg concentrations in agricultural soils. The results showed that the fusion of spectral information and environmental covariates combined with the XGBoost model performed best in retrieving both Cr and Hg concentrations in agricultural soils with coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. Environmental covariates were important variables for determining Cr and Hg concentrations in agricultural soils, but the ability to retrieve these element concentrations by utilizing spectral information alone was limited. High Cr concentrations occurred in central towns and southern hilly mountains. High Hg concentrations were detected in the northwestern region and southern hilly mountains. The potential of fusing spectral information and environmental covariates to precisely retrieve PTE concentrations in agricultural soils can serve as a reference for agricultural soil health information monitoring worldwide.",Not About Sufficiency
Revealing Invisible Water: Moisture Recycling as an Ecosystem Service,"An ecosystem service is a benefit derived by humanity that can be traced back to an ecological process. Although ecosystem services related to surface water have been thoroughly described, the relationship between atmospheric water and ecosystem services has been mostly neglected, and perhaps misunderstood. Recent advances in land-atmosphere modeling have revealed the importance of terrestrial ecosystems for moisture recycling. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which vegetation sustains the supply of atmospheric moisture and precipitation for downwind beneficiaries, globally. We simulate land-surface evaporation with a global hydrology model and track changes to moisture recycling using an atmospheric moisture budget model, and we define vegetation-regulated moisture recycling as the difference in moisture recycling between current vegetation and a hypothetical desert world. Our results show that nearly a fifth of annual average precipitation falling on land is from vegetation-regulated moisture recycling, but the global variability is large, with many places receiving nearly half their precipitation from this ecosystem service. The largest potential impacts for changes to this ecosystem service are land-use changes across temperate regions in North America and Russia. Likewise, in semi-arid regions reliant on rainfed agricultural production, land-use change that even modestly reduces evaporation and subsequent precipitation, could significantly affect human well-being. We also present a regional case study in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil, where we identify the specific moisture recycling ecosystem services associated with the vegetation in Mato Grosso. We find that Mato Grosso vegetation regulates some internal precipitation, with a diffuse region of benefit downwind, primarily to the south and east, including the La Plata River basin and the megacities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. We synthesize our global and regional results into a generalized framework for describing moisture recycling as an ecosystem service. We conclude that future work ought to disentangle whether and how this vegetationregulated moisture recycling interacts with other ecosystem services, so that trade-offs can be assessed in a comprehensive and sustainable manner.",Not About Sufficiency
Review and combination of recent remote sensing based products for forest cover change assessments in Cameroon,"Two recent remote sensing derived products providing assessment of forest cover change in the Congo Basin for the last two decades were compared and combined to obtain estimates of forest cover change in Cameroon for the period 1990-2012. The intensity of deforestation in the whole region decreased from the 1990s to the 2000s. Forest loss is observed everywhere in Cameroon but present higher intensity nearby the Atlantic coast. The analysis of the spatial distribution of the forest loss in Cameroon reveals that an important part of the loss is happening outside the permanent and the non-permanent forest domain.

Review and investigations on geothermal energy extraction from abandoned petroleum wells,"Geothermal energy is a sustainable and renewable energy source, which can be used in electricity production, space heating/cooling, and other industrial applications. In the recent years, it has been gathering more and more attention due to its numerous advantages as low impact on the surrounding environment, continuous power outputs, low greenhouse gas emissions, and worldwide availabilities. All make the geothermal energy a significant contributor to the global energy productions in an environmentally friendly way. One big concern of geothermal sources' exploration is the expensive investment costs of geothermal wells. Utilizing abandoned petroleum wells for the purpose of geothermal extraction is a novel idea. Well temperature profiles help to estimate how much heat can be transferred and produced from the wells. In this paper, a literature review has been done to investigate the existing applications on geothermal energy extraction utilizing abandoned petroleum wells. Then, the case study demonstrates the importance of properties of working fluids, wellbore architecture, and operational parameters (circulation rate, inlet temperature, etc.) in geothermal energy production. The obtained results can be used to achieve an improved data interpretation and generate more optimal solutions. In geothermal projects, extensive knowledge of the heat transfer is of great importance for the economical aspect and the performance of wells. Our work demonstrates that it is a good approach to provide cost-effective solutions to enhance heat extraction from geothermal wells.",Not About Sufficiency

Reviewing the impacts of eco-labelling of forest products on different dimensions of sustainability in Europe,"Europe has been implementing eco-labelling on forest products for the last two decades as a market-oriented tool to combat forest degradation and manage forest resources sustainably. Numerous studies have investigated the impacts of eco-labelling from different perspectives and geographic locations. Nevertheless, holistic reviews to disentangle the impacts of eco-labelling on forest sustainability are lacking. This study proposes a conceptual framework to collate and qualitatively analyse the existing literature regarding forest eco-labels for disclosing its effects on social, ecological, and economic sustainability. With regard to social sustainability, forest eco-labelling has established itself as a credibility icon that enhanced end-consumption patterns and successfully institu-tionalised the discourse over customary rights, despite insufficient procedural justice for indigenous communities and workers. In the economic dimension, forest eco-labelling enhanced market competitiveness; however, increasing costs continue to be a huge setback for producers. The ecological dimension demonstrated restored landscapes as a result of disturbance reductions. Nonetheless, the insufficient preservation of trees and areas with high conservation values during felling have undermined forest integrity and biodiversity protection. More rigorous marketing strategies and campaigns might be needed to address the profitability issue. Also, quanti-tative measures for on-the-ground performance should be enacted to leverage the unique strengths of forest eco-labelling in institutionalising cross-sector cooperation and normalising environmental discourses in forestry.",Not About Sufficiency
Rewilding with large herbivores: Positive direct and delayed effects of carrion on plant and arthropod communities,"Carrion of large animals is an extremely nutrient rich, ephemeral resource that is essential for many species, but is scarce in the anthropogenic Western-European landscape due to legislative restrictions. Rewilding, a novel conservation strategy that aims at restoring natural processes with minimal human intervention, is increasing in popularity and could lead to increased carrion availability in the landscape. It is therefore important to understand the effects of carrion on biodiversity. We investigated the direct and delayed (five months) effects of red deer (Cervus elaphus) carcasses on plants and arthropods in the Oostvaardersplassen, the Netherlands, one of the oldest rewilding sites in Europe. Specifically, we tested whether carrion has a positive direct effect on the abundances and diversity of various arthropod functional groups, as well as a delayed effect on the vegetation and arthropods through the increased nutrient availability. During the active decomposition stage in spring, we, not surprisingly, observed higher abundances of carrion associated species (scavengers and their specialized predators) at the carrion sites than at control sites without carrion, but no higher abundances of predators or detritivores. In late summer, after nearcomplete decomposition, plant biomass was five times higher, and nutritional plant quality (C:N ratio) was higher at the carrion sites than at the control sites. Arthropod abundance and diversity were also manifold higher, owing to higher numbers of herbivorous and predatory species. Regression analysis showed that abundances of herbivores and detritivores were positively related to plant biomass, and predator abundances were positively related to abundances of herbivores and detritivores, suggesting bottom-up effects propagating through the food chain. Our results show that even in a naturally nutrient-rich ecosystem like the Oostvaardersplassen, carrion can have strong positive effects on local plant biomass and nutritional quality and arthropod abundances, lasting the whole growing season. We found evidence that these effects were first directly caused by the presence of carrion, and later by the enhanced nutrient availability in the soil. This highlights the importance of the indirect pathways by which carrion can structure arthropod communities.",Not About Sufficiency

"Benthic production, respiration and methane oxidation in Lobelia dortmanna lawns","Isoetid macrophytes such as Lobelia dortmanna and Littorella uniflora are engineering species with an extensive root system and high radial oxygen loss. Despite several studies on these macrophytes, the effect of their oxygenation on methane dynamics has never been investigated. In this study, we hypothesise that isoetids promote dissolved inorganic carbon fixation and methane oxidation in sandy sediments. Our whole-ecosystem approach study lasted 2 years (2013-2014) on two oligo-mesotrophic shallow lakes. Benthic chamber incubations confirmed that, as a result of primary production and methanotrophy, isoetid lawns had consistently lower benthic carbon fluxes than bare sediments. On a daily basis, vegetated areas acted as a carbon sink (-0.7 +/- 0.4 g C m(-2) days(-1), as DIC + CH4), whereas bare sediments acted as a net source (0.6 +/- 0.5 g C m(-2) days(-1), as DIC + CH4). Photosynthetic quotients of < 1 indicated that photosynthetically produced oxygen was not released into the water column, but accumulated in leaf lacunae or was transferred to the rhizosphere, that contributing to the alteration of net benthic fluxes at the sediment-water interface. This preliminary study highlights the necessity of further investigating the role that isoetids play in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from temperate shallow lakes.",Not About Sufficiency
A Stochastic Bayesian Artificial Intelligence Framework to Assess Climatological Water Balance under Missing Variables for Evapotranspiration Estimates,"The sustainable use of water resources is of utmost importance given climatological changes and water scarcity, alongside the many socioeconomic factors that rely on clean water availability, such as food security. In this context, developing tools to minimize water waste in irrigation is paramount for sustainable food production. The evapotranspiration estimate is a tool to evaluate the water volume required to achieve optimal crop yield with the least amount of water waste. The Penman-Monteith equation is the gold standard for this task, despite it becoming inapplicable if any of its required climatological variables are missing. In this paper, we present a stochastic Bayesian framework to model the non-linear and non-stationary time series for the evapotranspiration estimate via Bayesian regression. We also leverage Bayesian networks and Bayesian inference to provide estimates for missing climatological data. Our obtained Bayesian regression equation achieves 0.087 mm center dot day-1 for the RMSE metric, compared to the expected time series, with wind speed and net incident solar radiation as the main components. Lastly, we show that the evapotranspiration time series, with missing climatological data inferred by the Bayesian network, achieves an RMSE metric ranging from 0.074 to 0.286 mm center dot day-1.",Not About Sufficiency
Rights to carbon and payments for services rendered under REDD plus : Options for the case of Mexico,"Mexico is relatively advanced in its preparation for international policy on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) and has many of the pre-conditions needed to support a community approach in the implementation of a national REDD+ programme, particularly as regards tenure of forests and experience with community forest management and PES schemes, although these conditions do not pertain everywhere. One critical issue that is yet to be resolved concerns rights to carbon credits and distribution of the financial benefits flowing from REDD+. We demonstrate that attribution of carbon credits from reduced deforestation and degradation at the community level is virtually impossible from a technical viewpoint, since these credits are counterfactual. Payments based on assessment of performance of each community in terms of such reductions would moreover be inequitable and inefficient. Flat rate payments in return for agreed improvements in management are likely to be more motivating and much easier to administer. However, increases in carbon stock (forest enhancement) can be physically measured on site, and could be more easily attributed to each individual community. We therefore propose a system in which reduced deforestation and degradation are considered environmental services, with credits accruing to national government. The financial value of the credits may be used to finance flat rate payments to communities who agree to implement improved management. On the other hand, credits for forest enhancement, which reflect measurable increases in carbon in the communities' trees, would be considered environmental goods. These should be considered the direct property of the owners of the forest (in the same sense as wood or poles) and it would be possible for communities to sell these credits themselves. We acknowledge however that many other problems face implementation of REDD+ in Mexico, and provide a number of important examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Consumer Perceptions of Wine Quality Assurance Programs: An Opportunity for Emerging Wine Markets,"Quality assurance programs (QAPs) may add value to wines through reassuring consumers of wine quality prior to purchase and consumption. In Tennessee, the potential to use a wine QAP is being explored as a means to improve the industry's economic sustainability. To date, several QAPs exist, but studies directly related to their impact on consumer behavior for wines from emerging areas are scarce. We used an online survey instrument to elicit consumer perceptions of QAPs importance on wine purchasing decisions and how the presence of a QAP may impact their purchasing behavior for a wine from an emerging area (e.g., Tennessee). Wine involvement, QAP perceptions, and familiarity were also measured. A mixed-process model was used to estimate the two ordered probit models for importance of QAPs and the influence of QAPs on Tennessee wine purchases, where QAP importance was treated as a latent variable influencing Tennessee wine purchases. Ordinal probit estimates suggest that greater on-site spending and greater perceived benefits of QAPs (as indicators of quality and standardization) resulted in a higher probability of perceived QAP importance when making wine purchasing decisions. Reduced form estimates of the model of Tennessee wine purchases indicated distance to wine producing areas, female gender, and familiarity with Tennessee wines each negatively influenced the potential impact of QAPs on Tennessee wine purchases. However, on-site spending at wineries and perceived benefits of a Tennessee QAP increased likelihood of Tennessee wine purchases.",Not About Sufficiency
Riparian vegetation influences aquatic greenhouse gas production in an agricultural landscape,"Although riparian vegetation is widely acknowledged for its positive impact on soil and water quality and its role in regulating terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions in agricultural landscapes, there remains a gap in understanding how different types of riparian vegetation affect aquatic greenhouse gas production. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate whether the type of vegetation within riparian zones influenced aquatic environmental factors, subsequently impacting aquatic greenhouse gas emissions. To address this, we measured greenhouse gases in the aquatic environment bordered by riparian zones with herbaceous vegetation (GRS) compared to undisturbed natural riparian forests dominated by deciduous (UNF-D) or coniferous (UNF-C) vegetation or a rehabilitated riparian forest (RH). Our findings indicate that aquatic CO2 concentrations were not influenced (p < 0.05) by vegetation type ranging from 9 g L-1 to 11 g L-1. In contrast, aquatic CH(4 )concentrations were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in treed riparian zones, ranging from 14 mu g L(-1 )to 24 mu g L-1, compared to a riparian zone with herbaceous vegetation (34 mu g L-1). However, we observed significantly higher (p < 0.05) aquatic N2O concentrations in treed riparian zones (9.5 <mu>g L-1 to 10.3 mu g L-1), particularly those dominated by coniferous vegetation (23.0 mu g L- 1), compared to the riparian zone with herbaceous vegetation (7.7 mu g L- 1). The total CO2-C equivalent (i.e., CO2 + CH4 + N2O) was highest in the riparian zone with coniferous trees (UNF-C: 10,717 mg CO2-Ceq L-1), followed by the GRS (9494 mg CO2-Ceq L-1), RH (9423 mg CO2-Ceq L-1) and UNF-D (9,183 mg CO2-Ceq L-1) riparian zone. Moreover, riparian vegetation was influenced by various environmental factors that likely controlled physicochemical and biological processes related to the production of greenhouse gases within the aquatic environment.",Not About Sufficiency
Rising to the Kyoto challenge: Is the response of Canadian industry adequate?,"A major weapon in Canada's CO2-emissions reduction arsenal is reliance on moral suasion and voluntary action. In this regard, the Voluntary Challenge and Registry (VCR) program constitutes a major effort to encourage industrial firms to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we begin by providing a critical review of Canadian climate change policy and Canada's international commitments. We then investigate the effectiveness of Canadian policies by analyzing a survey of industrial firms, examining factors that determine firms' familiarity with, participation in and commitment to the VCR program, and their stated potential to reduce emissions by 2008-2012 (Kyoto's commitment period). Results indicate that voluntary programs are unlikely to make a significant contribution to emissions reduction, with industrial firms indicating that, on average, they plan to reduce emissions by some 1-2% below their 1990 level under the current policy approach, much lower than Canada's 6% reduction target.",Not About Sufficiency
RNAi-mediated resistance to whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) in genetically engineered lettuce (Lactuca sativa),"RNA interference (RNAi)-based transgenic technologies have evolved as potent biochemical tools for silencing specific genes of plant pathogens and pests. The approach has been demonstrated to be useful in silencing genes in insect species. Here, we report on the successful construction of RNAi-based plasmid containing an interfering cassette designed to generate dsRNAs that target a novel v-ATPase transcript in whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), an important agricultural pest in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The presence of the transgene was confirmed in T-0 and T-1 generations of transgenic lettuce lines, segregating in a Mendelian fashion. Seven lines were infested with whiteflies and monitored over a period of 32 days. Analysis of mortality showed that within five days of feeding, insects on transgenic plants showed a mortality rate of 83.8-98.1%. In addition, a reduced number of eggs (95 fold less) was observed in flies feeding on transgenic lettuce plants than insects on control lines. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed decreased expression level of endogenous v-ATPase gene in whiteflies feeding on transgenic plants. This technology is a foundation for the production of whitefly-resistant commercial crops, improving agricultural sustainability and food security, reducing the use of more environmentally aggressive methods of pest control.",Not About Sufficiency
Road project opportunity costs subject to a regional constraint on greenhouse gas emissions,"France has constrained the Aquitaine region to set up a climate plan to avoid an emission of 2883 ktCO(2)eq for the period 2007-2013. In parallel, the region has decided to carry out the construction of road infrastructures in order to avoid very high congestion costs. Those road projects will involve an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during that period. In the present context of strong sustainability, all emissions (direct and indirect) generated by those projects should be offset. At the regional level, the offsetting of GHG emissions is usually carried out by implementing carbon sequestration projects or projects that reduce energy demand. This paper aims at determining the maximum budget for financing GHG emissions offsetting projects, with computation being based on the opportunity costs of projects, the minimum cost of economic activity reduction required to offset emissions from those projects. The maximum budget devoted to GHG emissions offsetting projects should not exceed (sic)(2001) 1920 M to (sic)(2001) 3592 M, according to low/high traffic growth assumptions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"On the Definition of the Natural Capital of Soils: A Framework for Description, Evaluation, and Monitoring","The unknown consequences and potential impacts of mankind's ability to destroy, alter, or manipulate ecosystems on a vast scale drives our need to better understand the earth system. A fundamental challenge for soil science in the 21st century is to understand the role of soil processes in relation to the function of the earth system. The rationale for developing a definition of sod natural capital stems from the premise that we value 'things' based on their perceived value to human well-being. As a consequence, ignorance of the value of a resource, or system, may lead to its neglect and omission from decision making. Therefore, there is a need to develop a definition of soil natural capital, fitting within a broad framework, which can be used to assess soil ecosystem services that contribute to the function of the earth system. Though various definitions of soil natural capital have been proposed, mostly in the agricultural context, it still remains a nebulous and ill-defined term. The objective of this paper is to develop an embracing definition of soil 'natural capital' focusing on (i) mass, (ii) energy, and (iii) organization/entropy. Mass is further subdivided into solid, liquid and gas phases, and organization into physicochemical, biotic, and spatiotemporal structure. We differentiate between two aspects of capital, the quantity and the quality. As a result of our definition, soil moisture, temperature, and structure emerge as valuable stocks, alongside the more traditionally viewed stocks such as inorganic (mineralogy, texture) and organic materials (OM content). We go on to demonstrate how natural capital fits within the ecosystem services framework, and how using integrated valuation and process based models it can be evaluated. Finally we discuss measurement and monitoring needs that fit with this vision of evaluation.",Not About Sufficiency
Silvopasture policy promotion in European Mediterranean areas,"Silvopasture is the deliberate integration of a woody component with grazed pastures as understorey. It is one of the most extended agroforestry practices all over the world. Silvopasture use is key to increase the sustainability of livestock farming systems as silvopasture reduces the use of concentrates since the woody component provides feed for animals. However, it is not an extensively used practice in Europe. This paper aims at evaluating, from Eurostat, LUCAS database and the 118 rural development programs, the current situation of permanent grasslands in the Mediterranean area of Europe as well as the rural development programmes fostering silvopasture to better understand how sustainable land use systems are promoted and provide insights to foster silvopasture across Europe. The results of this study show that most of the policy measures related to silvopasture are adapted to the local necessity. The already existing agroforestry managed land (dehesas/montado) are related to measures supporting regeneration and maintenance while in those areas where agroforestry does not exist the measures are related to forest fire prevention.",Not About Sufficiency
Comparing multi-criteria evaluation and participatory mapping to projecting land use,"Projections pertaining to future land use and land use change may have diverse backgrounds. Often, both local and scientific knowledge encompass important pieces of information for such a projection. Acknowledging the diversity across the two types of knowledge, we investigated their differences and similarities in a twofold case study, conducting a participatory mapping (PM) exercise with local wine growers, as well as a Multi Criteria Evaluation (MCE) with non-local experts from science, government and industry. Hence, we not only utilised two different knowledge elicitation methods, but also two types of 'Knowledges'. Within a region dominated by vineyards, and with expected land use change, we compared the two results quantitatively, in a participatory evaluation workshop, and with annotations gained through the participatory mapping exercise. Both methods have their merits, with the results from the participatory mapping perceived as being more plausible, and the MCE scoring higher in terms of spatial resolution. Whilst the participatory mapping yields more and better contextualised information, the results from the MCE can be better compared across study areas.",Not About Sufficiency
Role of Brazilian Amazon protected areas in climate change mitigation,"Protected areas (PAs) now shelter 54% of the remaining forests of the Brazilian Amazon and contain 56% of its forest carbon. However, the role of these PAs in reducing carbon fluxes to the atmosphere from deforestation and their associated costs are still uncertain. To fill this gap, we analyzed the effect of each of 595 Brazilian Amazon PAs on deforestation using a metric that accounts for differences in probability of deforestation in areas of pairwise comparison. We found that the three major categories of PA (indigenous land, strictly protected, and sustainable use) showed an inhibitory effect, on average, between 1997 and 2008. Of 206 PAs created after the year 1999, 115 showed increased effectiveness after their designation as protected. The recent expansion of PAs in the Brazilian Amazon was responsible for 37% of the region's total reduction in deforestation between 2004 and 2006 without provoking leakage. All PAs, if fully implemented, have the potential to avoid 8.0 +/- 2.8 Pg of carbon emissions by 2050. Effectively implementing PAs in zones under high current or future anthropogenic threat offers high payoffs for reducing carbon emissions, and as a result should receive special attention in planning investments for regional conservation. Nevertheless, this strategy demands prompt and predictable resource streams. The Amazon PA network represents a cost of US$147 +/- 53 billion (net present value) for Brazil in terms of forgone profits and investments needed for their consolidation. These costs could be partially compensated by an international climate accord that includes economic incentives for tropical countries that reduce their carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.",Not About Sufficiency
Role of On-Site Generation in Carbon Emissions and Utility Bill Savings under Different Electric Grid Scenarios,"Energy-efficient and sustainable technologies are necessary to lower energy and carbon footprints. Many technologies are being pursued to meet the increasing energy demand in buildings. An attractive option is efficient utilization of available energy resources, including renewables, to support current and future building energy needs while targeting grid resiliency, energy, and environmental security at an affordable cost via on-site cogeneration-based approaches. This must include energy-efficient technologies with lower greenhouse gas emissions and optimized cost, performance, and reliability. This paper presents the economic and environmental benefits associated with power technologies such as thermionics and solid oxide fuel cells. Hybrid configurations consisting of heat pumps, power systems, and renewable photovoltaics in cogeneration and trigeneration modes of operation are presented. The role of such technologies in lowering CO2 emissions while improving energy resiliency and serving the needs of underprivileged communities is discussed. The key barriers of affordability and potential solutions for large-scale implementation of these promising technologies are reviewed.

Water-Quality Monitoring with a UAV-Mounted Multispectral Camera in Coastal Waters,"Remote-sensing ocean colour studies have already been used to determine coastal water quality, coastal biodiversity, and nutrient availability. In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral sensors, originally designed for agriculture applications, have also enabled water-quality studies of coastal waters. However, since the sea surface is constantly changing, commonly used photogrammetric methods fail when applied to UAV images captured over water areas. In this work, we evaluate the applicability of a five-band multispectral sensor mounted on a UAV to derive scientifically valuable water parameters such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and total suspended solids (TSS), including a new Python workflow for the manual generation of an orthomosaic in aquatic areas exclusively based on the sensor's metadata. We show water-quality details in two different sites along the Maltese coastline on the centimetre-scale, improving the existing approximations that are available for the region through Sentinel-3 OLCI imagery at a much lower spatial resolution of 300 m. The Chl-a and TSS values derived for the studied regions were within the expected ranges and varied between 0 to 3 mg/m(3) and 10 to 20 mg/m(3), respectively. Spectral comparisons were also carried out along with some statistics calculations such as RMSE, MAE, or bias in order to validate the obtained results.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of global change drivers on the expression of pathogenicity and stress genes in dryland soil fungi,"The impacts of global climate change on dryland fungi have been understudied even though fungi are extremely sensitive to changes in the environ ment. Considering that many fungi are pathogens of plants and animals, including humans, their responses to anthropogenic change could have important implications for public health and food security. In this study, we investigated the potential physiolog ical responses (i.e., metatranscriptomics) of pathogenicity and stress in dryland fungi exposed to global change drivers, drought, and the physical disturbance associated with land use. Specifically, we wanted to assess if there was an increase in the transcrip tion of genes associated to pathogenicity and stress in response to global change drivers. In addition, we wanted to investigate which pathogenicity and stress genes were consistently differentially expressed under the different global change conditions across the heterogeneous landscape (i.e., microsite) of the Chihuahuan desert. We observed increased transcription of pathogenicity and stress genes, with specific genes being most upregulated in response to global change drivers. Additionally, climatic conditions linked to different microsites, such as those found under patches of vegetation, may play a significant role. We provide evidence supporting the idea that environmental stress caused by global change could contribute to an increase of pathogenicity as global climate changes. Specifically, increases in the transcription of stress and virulence genes, coupled with variations in gene expression, could lead to the onset of pathogenicity. Our work underscores the importance of studying dryland fungi exposed to global climate change and increases in existing fungal pathogens, as well as the emergence of new fungal pathogens, and consequences to public health and food security. IMPORTANCE The effects of global climate change on dryland fungi and consequen ces to our society have been understudied despite evidence showing that pathogenic fungi increase in abundance under global climate change. Moreover, there is a grow ing concern that global climate change will contribute to the emergence of new fungal pathogens. Yet, we do not understand what mechanisms might be driving this increase in virulence and the onset of pathogenicity. In this study, we investigate how fungi respond to global change drivers, physical disturbance, and drought, in a dryland ecosystem in terms of pathogenicity and stress. We find that indeed, under global change drivers, there is an increase in the transcription and expression of genes associated to pathogenicity and stress, but that microclimatic conditions matter. Our study shows the importance of investigating dryland fungi exposed to global climate change and impacts on our society, which may include threats to public health and food security.",Not About Sufficiency
Bio-SNG production - concepts and their assessment,"A major goal of today's energy policy is to establish an energy system with less greenhouse gas emissions (cf. ""Renewable energy roadmap"" [1]). The energetic use of biomass seems to be a very promising option to contribute to this goal: biomass can be used demand-oriented and to produce different energy carriers (e.g. power, heat and biofuels) needed within the energy system. Due to high overall efficiencies, especially the thermo-chemical conversion of solid biofuels to the natural gas substitute Bio-SNG (Synthetic Natural Gas) seems to be very promising. Therefore, it is the goal of this paper to analyse Bio-SNG production processes as a part of integrated polygeneration processes. Different Bio-SNG concepts using a gas slip stream in a gas engine or a gas turbine and process heat in an organic rankine cycle or conventional steam cycle are assessed. Based on mass and energy balances these concepts are discussed from an energetic, economic and environmental point of view. The analysis shows increasing exergetic efficiencies as well as improved economic and environmental process characteristics with increasingly integrated processes. However, the economic competitiveness still remains a bottleneck for a Bio-SNG market implementation.

Lead (Pb) Hohlraum: Target for Inertial Fusion Energy,"Recent progress towards demonstrating inertial confinement fusion (ICF) ignition at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) has sparked wide interest in Laser Inertial Fusion Energy (LIFE) for carbon-free large-scale power generation.

For the LIFE concept to be viable, target costs must be minimized while the target material efficiency or x-ray albedo is optimized. Current ICF targets on the NIF utilize a gold or depleted uranium cylindrical radiation cavity (hohlraum) with a plastic capsule at the center that contains the deuterium and tritium fuel.

Challenges for land system science,"While considerable progress has been made in understanding land use change, land system science continues to face a number of grand challenges. This paper discusses these challenges with a focus on empirical land system studies, land system modelling and the analysis of future visions of land system change. Contemporary landscapes are contingent outcomes of past and present patterns, processes and decisions. Thus, empirical analysis of past and present land-use change has an important role in providing insights into the socio-economic and ecological processes that shape land use transitions. This is especially important with respect to gradual versus rapid land system dynamics and in understanding changes in land use intensity. Combining the strengths of empirical analysis with multi-scale modelling will lead to new insights into the processes driving land system change. New modelling methods that combine complex systems thinking at a local level with macro-level economic analysis of the land system would reconcile the multi-scale dynamics currently encapsulated in bottom-up and top-down modelling approaches. Developments in land use futures analysis could focus on integrating explorative scenarios that reflect possible outcomes with normative visions that identify desired outcomes. Such an approach would benefit from the broad and in-depth involvement of stakeholders in order to link scientific findings to political and societal decision-making culminating in a set of key choices and consequences. Land system models have an important role in supporting future land use policy, but model outputs require scientific interpretation rather than being presented as predictions. The future of land system science is strongly dependent on the research community's capacity to bring together the elements of research discussed in the paper, via empirical data collection and analysis of observed processes, computer simulation across scale levels and futures analysis of alternative, normative visions through stakeholder engagement.

New concepts can be drawn from this comparative analysis: 1) rural diversity cannot be explained exclusively by agglomeration forces and geographical distance from urban centres; b) multiple functions of rural areas, often rooted into sustainable agri-food systems or other forms of territorial capital, contribute to explain more autonomous roles of rural areas; c) organised or relational proximity is emerging in a context of a globalised economy and non-geographical networks, as a critical factor of connection between rural areas and distant regions/markets.

To explore how the digital turn shapes the struggle against CRSV, the article offers a three-part analytical framework. First, the article unpacks how digital technologies create corresponding ""digital bodies"" - comprised of images, information, biometrics and other data stored in digital space - which represent the bodies of individuals affected by sexual violence, and which interplay with the risks posed upon the physical bodies of those facing CRSV. Second, the article maps out the role of digital technologies in a cycle of intervention, including prevention of, response to, documentation of and accountability for CRSV. Third, recognizing the increasing importance of data governance to the struggle against CRSV, the article considers how divergent humanitarian, human rights and international criminal law approaches to data may create different pathways for CRSV data.

Hydrological Functioning and Water Availability in a Himalayan Karst Basin under Climate Change,"Karst springs are important water sources for both human needs and environmental flows. The responses of karst springs to hydrometeorological factors vary depending on local conditions. In this study, we investigated Martandnag spring in the Liddar catchment in the Kashmir valley of northern India. We used statistical time series (autocorrelation and cross-correlation) and machine-learning (ML) techniques (random forest regression (RFR) and support vector regression (SVR)) to characterize how rainfall, temperature, and snow cover affect the karst spring flow and predict the future responses of the spring stage based on climate scenarios, in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report 6. The statistical time series showed that the memory effect of Martandnag spring varies from 43 to 61 days, indicating moderate karstification and a relatively high storage capacity of the karst aquifer in the Liddar catchment. The delay between recharge and discharge varies from 13 to 44 days, and it is more strongly correlated to snow/ice melt than to rainfall. The ML analysis shows that SVR outperformed RFR in predicting spring flow. Under all climate scenarios, a trained SVR model showed that spring flow increased during the late winter to early spring, and decreased during the summer (except in August) and in autumn. Scenarios with increased greenhouse gas emissions further reduced flow in the summer and autumn.

Design/methodology/approach Six hypotheses derived from a systematic review of the literature were tested through structured equation modelling (SEM), based on data of 476 Brazilian men. Findings The results empirically sustain the positive influence of vanity and masculinity in grooming product consumption, with partial mediation of vanity between masculinity and consumption. Counterintuitively, it also confirms the negative influence of income. Age and marital status are not statistically relevant. Practical implications Practitioners should invest in marketing actions focusing on low-income men, who showed genuine interest in grooming products, promoting them as powerful tools to improve appearance and social recognition. Additionally, educational and wellness-related campaigns could be effective. Social implications Beyond profitability, economic growth and men's well-being, the results might affect the whole society through male cosmetics' contribution to blending gender paradigms.

"Scales and Historical Evolution: Methods to Reveal the Relationships between Ecosystem Service Bundles and Socio-Ecological Drivers-A Case Study of Dalian City, China","Ecosystem service (ES) bundles can be defined as the temporal and spatial co-occurrence of ESs. ES bundles are jointly driven by socio-ecological factors and form at different scales. However, in recent research, a few studies have analyzed the dynamic evolution and driving mechanisms of ES bundles at different scales. Therefore, this study explored the spatial patterns of six ESs supplied in Dalian (China) from 2005 to 2015 at three spatial scales, determining the distribution and evolution patterns of ES bundles and their responses to socio-ecological driving factors. Our results are as follows: (1) We identified four ES bundles representing ecological conservation, water conservation, ecological depletion, and food supply. The developmental trajectory of each ES bundle could be attributed to the combined effects of environmental conditions and urban expansion. In particular, the water conservation bundle and food supply bundle were changed to the ecological depletion bundle. Given the ongoing urbanization, the conflict between ESs has intensified. (2) The impact of socio-ecological driving factors on ES bundles vary with scale. At three spatial scales, the digital elevation model (DEM) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) had a great impact on ES bundles. Urbanization indicators also strongly explain the spatial distribution of ES bundles at the county and grid scales.

"""It's a toss up between my hearing, my heart, and my hip"": Prioritizing and Accommodating Multiple Morbidities by Vulnerable Older Adults","Nearly three quarters of older adults have multiple morbidities (MM). This study investigated which morbidities older adults prioritize, why, and how they accommodate these conditions, focusing on elders with two or more chronic conditions and low socioeconomic status. Methods. In-depth interviews were conducted with 41 older adults (most being African American women from the southeastern U.S., with two or more chronic illnesses). Results. Many participants reported worrying most about their heart disease, diabetes, and disability/mobility problems, and about their synergistic effects. Many worried that MMs might tip them into a downward spiral. Participants spent the most time and money on arthritis and diabetes. Few received help; when they did, relatives assisted with arthritis/mobility, diabetes, and effects of stroke. Discussion. Enhanced formal care coordination, increased use of technological innovations, and understanding elders' priorities are necessary to improve self-care/management and quality of life.",Not About Sufficiency
Future carbon sequestration in Europe - Effects of land use change,"Important land use changes are expected in the European Union (EU) the coming decades, having effects on carbon stocks in soil and vegetation. We assessed how future land use change (LUC) can influence future carbon stock change in soil and vegetation in the EU. The emphasis is on the role of LUC in the overall carbon balance of the EU biosphere. Because LUC is the most dynamic driving factor of terrestrial carbon stock change, it is important to account for the dynamics of LUC in carbon stock change modelling. The major challenge in coupling a carbon model and a LUC model is the difference in spatial and temporal resolution generally used in these modelling approaches. We used a high-resolution LUC model and a carbon bookkeeping approach that takes into account effects of soil and forest age on carbon stock changes. These approaches best fit the chosen resolution and extent in a consistent manner. Four SIZES scenarios that cover a range of possible future developments were evaluated: Global Economy (A1): lean government, strong globalization; Continental Markets (A2): lean government, regional cultural and economic development; Global Cooperation (B1): much governmental intervention, strong globalization; Regional Communities (B2): much governmental intervention, regional cultural and economic development. If land use remains unchanged, carbon sequestration rates are expected to decrease by 4% in 2030 relative to 2000. LUC causes an additional sequestration rate decrease in the A2 scenario of 2% in 2030. In the other three scenarios, sequestration rate increases by 9-16% in 2030 relative to 2000. In 2030, the terrestrial biosphere in the EU is expected to sequester between 90 and 111 Tg C year(-1). This is 6.5-8% of the projected anthropogenic emissions. In the B2 scenario, the highest sequestration rate increase is expected (15 Tg C year(-1)). Clear differences are found in the spatial distribution of sinks and sources between the scenarios, illustrating that land use is an important factor in future carbon sequestration changes that cannot be ignored.

Science and Citizen Collaboration as Good Example of Geoethics for Recovering a Natural Site in the Urban Area of Rome (Italy),"Natural sites in urban spaces can have a key role in citizen well-being, providing fundamental ecosystem services to the population and assuring a multitude of benefits. Therefore, cities should guarantee a number of green areas and their conservation in time as an essential part of urban architecture. In this framework, cooperation between scientists, decision makers and citizens is critical to ensure the enhancement of green public spaces. Social and scientific communities are called to work in a tuned way to combine scientific knowledge and methods to local socio-economic contexts, driven by the values of geoethics. The Bullicante Lake case study, discussed in this work, represents an example of application of geoethical values, such as inclusiveness, sharing, sustainability and conservation of bio- and geodiversity. This urban lake in Rome appeared following illegal excavation works in 1992 and remained closed until 2016 favouring re-naturalization processes. Over time, this site was often threatened by pending actions for building. The aim of this study was to highlight how fruitful cooperation between science and citizens is able to transform a degraded urban area into a place of knowledge, recreation, enjoyment and eco-systemic preservation. Moreover, on the basis of this experience, the authors proposed a generalised approach/strategy to be developed and applied in other contexts. The active involvement of citizens and the cooperation among scientists, artists and institutions were able to redress opportunistic behaviours well by preventing site degradation and its improper use, favouring environmental safeguarding and making possible the site's recognition as a natural monument. The results of these actions led to the improved quality of citizen life, showing an excellent example of virtuous cooperation between science and society.",Not About Sufficiency
"Science-policy interactions in Austrian, Dutch, and Swiss climate policy: a comparative account","Scientific expertise plays an important role in the complex field of climate policy. Consequently, science-policy interactions have been institutionalized in many countries. However, science-policy arenas vary considerably across countries. Scholars mainly attribute these differences to the influence of specific political cultures. The literature has primarily compared science-policy arenas of countries with diverging political cultures, whereas comparisons of countries with similar political cultures are rare. The latter is especially true for neo-corporatist cultures. Against this background, we compare the climate science-policy arenas of three neo-corporatist countries, Austria, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Conceptually, we draw on the literature regarding politico-cultural imprints in science-policy arenas. We operationalize national science-policy arenas along four dimensions: the knowledge actors, the organizational formats, the styles of science-policy interactions, and their transparency and visibility. Overall, the three arenas reveal many similarities and much fewer differences. Most similarities correspond to neo-corporatist patterns. However, some similarities consistently deviate from neo-corporatist patterns. Interestingly, almost all differences between the countries match national variations of neo-corporatism. In light of these observations and the specific problem structure of climate policy, we develop research questions to investigate potential explanations for correspondence to and deviation from neo-corporatist patterns.",Not About Sufficiency
Sea Turtles in the Anthropocene,"Sea turtle species have life cycles that have common features such as oviparity, nesting on sandy beaches, growing as juveniles in surface waters and moving to foraging grounds before migrating- often over long distances-to natal beaches to breed. They are therefore exposed to aquatic and terrestrial influences, both abiotic (e.g. temperature, weather) and biotic (e.g. food availability, predation). Humans have exploited sea turtles for millennia and pressure on their populations has increased dramatically during the ongoing Anthropocene as human influences have increased both in power and global reach. Fishing bycatches generated by powerful unselective gears have largely replaced direct fishing as an existential threat, but meat and egg poaching persist, while burgeoning global wildlife crime threatens sea turtles, especially hawksbills. Habitat loss caused by coastal development and exponential increases in beach-based tourism have reduced nesting success. Sustained losses of coral reef and seagrass habitats have removed foraging grounds for adult turtles and both habitat types are currently projected to disappear before 2100. Environmental degradation has taken several forms. Chemical pollution through the accumulation of organics and heavy metals have affected reproduction and facilitated the transmission of fibropapillomatosis. An emerging threat due to eutrophication also needs to be considered. Marine plastic pollution is already highly damaging to sea turtles; plastic fishing gears 'ghost-fish' indefinitely, capturing and killing all life-history stages except eggs, while ingestion of macro and microplastics blocks/damages guts. Rising global temperature has been identified as a potential existential threat for all species because of temperature-dependent sex determination and substantial sea level rise. However, climate change is also projected to cause an order of magnitude increase in the frequency of heat waves and extreme sea level highs, both of which can kill turtle embryos. This Praeger Review concludes with a description of sea turtle occurrences around the British Isles and the anthropogenic influences upon them.",Not About Sufficiency
Seasonal differences in soil respiration and methane uptake in rubber plantation and rainforest,"Rubber plantations expanded remarkably in South-East Asia, while the impact of this land use change on soil carbon dynamics and greenhouse gases emissions has not been sufficiently understood. We measured monthly soil CO2 fluxes during one year as well as CH4 fluxes during the rainy season in secondary rainforest, 9 and 22 year-old rubber monoculture and 22-year-old rubber-tea intercropping in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. Our aim was to assess the impact of the land use change on soil carbon fluxes and quantify the factors determining the difference in the carbon fluxes. A linear mixed effect model was used in studying the soil temperature and moisture variation and temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of soil respiration. The temporal pattern of soil respiration distinctly differed between sites during the rainy season: rainforest maintained a high soil respiration rate, while soil respiration became suppressed (by up to 69%) during the most moist period in rubber plantations. Rainforest soils thus emitted the highest amount of CO2 with an annual cumulative flux of 8.48 +/- 0.71 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), compared to 6.75 +/- 0.79, 5.98 +/- 0.42 and 5.09 +/- 0.47 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for mature rubber, rubber-tea intercropping, and young rubber, respectively. Additionally, the soil CH4 uptake was stronger in rainforest than in rubber plantations during the wet period. Soil temperature was the main factor explaining the overall seasonal variation of soil respiration. Adding a quadratic soil moisture term into the model accounted for moisture effects, identified moisture tipping points, and improved temperature sensitivity assessment when high soil moisture suppressed soil respiration under rubber. Temperature sensitivity of soil respiration was higher for rainforest soil compared to rubber plantations, O-10 values were 3.1 for rainforest and 1.7, 2.2 and 2.4 for mature rubber, rubber-tea intercropping and young rubber respectively. Converting rainforest to rubber plantations tended to reduce soil CO2 emissions and weakened CH4 uptake especially during the very wet period. The altered condition of soil aeration under converted land appears to have a pronounced impact on processes of carbon fluxes from the soil and thus mitigates the positive feedback of climate change given the large area of cultivated rubber.

"Seasonal variations in biomass, height, photosynthetic efficiency, and carbon and nitrogen contents of Suaeda japonica in Incheon salt marshes (Korea)","Salt marshes are known as major blue carbon ecosystems for their higher carbon sequestration capacity and productivity compared to terrestrial ecosystems. However, in Korea, salt marshes have been continuously decreasing since the 1980s. This study aims to identify seasonal changes in salt marsh plants and evaluate the carbon and nitrogen sequestration in these ecosystems. This study observed seasonal changes in the biomass, cover, height, photosynthetic efficiency, carbon and nitrogen content of Suaeda japonica in two salt marsh ecosystems in Incheon, Korea, Yeongjong (YJ) and Sorae (SR). In spring, plant density at SR. was significantly higher than at YJ. This higher density at SR inhibited growth and survival during summer and autumn. In addition, photosynthetic efficiency at SR decreased significantly in summer compared to spring. The different habitat densities between the two sites resulted in morphological variations. The plants at YJ, with lower density, grew wider with more branches and showed higher dry weight in comparison to those at SR. Carbon sequestration by S. japonica per unit area was 113.70 g/m2 at YJ, which was twice as high as at SR. The plant density and biomass of S. japonica were affected by differences in seawater inflow at each site. The tissue carbon content was highest in the roots, suggesting that carbon absorbed by the leaves is effectively stored in sediment. This study provides insights into the regional and seasonal changes of S. japonica, highlighting its significance as a blue carbon resource. The results can contribute to the evaluation and restoration of salt marshes to enhance their carbon sequestration potential.",Not About Sufficiency
Seasonality and Budgets of Soil Greenhouse Gas Emissions From a Tropical Dry Forest Successional Gradient in Costa Rica,"Limited information on greenhouse gas emissions from tropical dry forest soils still hinders the assessment of the sources/sinks from this ecosystem and their contribution at global scales. Particularly, rewetting events after the dry season can have a significant effect on soil biogeochemical processes and associated exchange of greenhouse gases. This study evaluated the temporal variation and annual fluxes of CO2, N2O, and CH(4)from soils in a tropical dry forest successional gradient. After a prolonged drought of 5 months, large emissions pulses of CO(2)and N2O were observed at all sites following first rain events, caused by the ""Birch effect,"" with a significant effect on the net ecosystem exchange and the annual emissions budget. Annual CO(2)emissions were greatest for the young forest (8,556 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)) followed by the older forest (7,420 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)) and the abandoned pasture (7,224 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)). Annual emissions of N2O were greatest for the forest sites (0.39 and 0.43 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)) and least in the abandoned pasture (0.09 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)). CH(4)uptake was greatest in the older forest (-2.61 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)) followed by the abandoned pasture (-0.69 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)) and the young forest (-0.58 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)). Fluxes were mainly influenced by soil moisture, microbial biomass, and soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations. Annual CO(2)and N2O soil fluxes of tropical dry forests in this study and others from the literature were much lower than the annual fluxes in wetter tropical forests. Conversely, tropical dry forests and abandoned pastures are on average stronger sinks for CH(4)than wetter tropical forests.",Not About Sufficiency
Sectoral wage share and its decomposition in China,"This paper investigates sectoral contributions to the trend of national wage share, or the labor income share, during 2000-2014 in China. I apply the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition, the method widely used in energy studies, to decompose the trend of the wage share. At a sectoral level, with rapid structural transformation, structural change negatively impacted the wage share through the between-sector effect - the structural and price effects - mainly from agriculture. This result confirms Arthur Lewis's hypothesis that structural transformation has a negative contribution to the wage share. At a national level, when the wage share declined before 2008, the between-sector effect was as significant as the within-sector effect - the wage and productivity effects. After 2008, the within-sector effect directed the increasing wage share trend. This implies that although structural transformation matters to the wage share in a large developing country like China, a wage-productivity nexus has been more influential and determined the increasing trend of the wage share since 2008.",Not About Sufficiency
"Sediment prokaryotic assembly, methane cycling, and ammonia oxidation potentials in response to increasing antibiotic pollution at shrimp aquafarm","Antibiotic pollution poses serious threats to public health and ecological processes. However, systematic research regarding the interactive effects of increasing nutrient and antibiotic pollutions on the prokaryotic community, particularly taxa that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, is lacking. By exploring the complex interactions that occur between interkingdom bacteria and archaea, biotic and abiotic factors, the responses of sediment prokaryotic assembly were determined along a significant antibiotic pollution gradient. Bacterial and archaeal communities were primarily governed by sediment antibiotic pollution, ammonia, phosphate, and redox potential, which further affected enzyme activities. The two communities nonlinearly responded to increasing antibiotic pollution, with significant tipping points of 3.906 and 0.979 mg/kg antibiotics, respectively. The combined antibiotic concentration-discriminatory taxa of bacteria and archaea accurately (98.0% accuracy) diagnosed in situ antibiotic concentrations. Co-abundance analysis revealed that the methanogens, methano-trophs, sulfate-reducing bacteria, and novel players synergistically contributed to methane cycling. Antibiotic pollution caused the dominant role of ammonia-oxidizing archaea in ammonia oxidation at these alkaline sediments. Collectively, the significant tipping points and bio-indicators afford indexes for regime shift and quantitative diagnosis of antibiotic pollution, respectively. Antibiotic pollution could expedite methane cycling and mitigate nitrous oxide yield, which are previously unrecognized ecological effects. These findings provide new insights into the interactive biological and ecological consequences of increasing nutrient and antibiotic pollutions.",Not About Sufficiency
Seeking a better path for the circular economy of solar panels: Global sensitivity analysis focused on socioeconomic and physical factors,"As more solar photovoltaic panels are expected to be introduced globally to promote the stabilization and decarbonization of electricity supply, concerns have been raised about the associated resource constraints and the environmental impacts. To promote circular economy initiatives, this study aims to provide insight into the variables and the conditions that play a key role in the expression of environmental impacts and find the better path for a circular economy of solar panels, which requires analyzing impacts on multiple indicators as a result of various factors and their cross-interactions. To achieve this goal, we constructed a resource circulation simulator that considers factors related to the business environment as well as physical factors. The simulation model was then applied to the largest administrative region in Japan, and the parameter space was explored by combining Regional Sensitivity Analysis, a global sensitivity analysis method, and Random Forest to consider the interactions among these variables. As a result of 30,000 Monte Carlo simulations performed on 26 input variables, it was found that the key parameters in final disposal and resource consumption potential differ between the two purposes; avoiding catastrophic loads and achieving ambitious reductions. In contrast, for greenhouse gas emissions, it is important to maintain or increase the efficiency of photovoltaic panel power generation for both purposes. Additionally, in the case where the key variables were optimized in terms of final disposal/resource consumption potential, it will effectively reduce the two impacts to 0.7 % and 12.6 %, respectively, with a minimal negative impact on greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, in the case when optimized in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, it has only a small impact on greenhouse gas emissions and large negative impacts on final disposal and resource consumption potential. Further refinement of the parameter space and thresholds in the analysis is a topic for future research.",Not About Sufficiency

Shared mobility and lifestyles as mechanisms to reduce environmental impacts from passenger transportation,"Despite the deployment of low- or zero-emission technologies, achieving emissions reductions in the passenger transportation sector remains challenging. Demand-side mechanisms can be instrumental in reducing environmental impacts of transportation and reconfiguring transportation systems in a way that shifts users away from private car ownership. In this article we look at the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States to quantify the environmental benefits from such shifts in passenger transportation, considering socio-technological drivers of transportation including well-being, digitalization, shared mobility, and electrification. We establish pathways for each of these countries considering their context. We frame these pathways using the avoid-shift-improve framework which shapes the scenarios that we quantify in our analysis. We use a travel demand model as an input to calculate carbon, energy, and air pollution footprints. We quantify direct emissions considering the characteristics of the private fleet and indirect using multiregional input-output analysis. The results show that target thresholds can be reached under the proposed supply and demand initiatives. For the United States, these actions are more dramatic than for the Netherlands and Sweden due to that country's stronger car dependence. A deep social transformation is needed to make these scenarios possible and enable a shift towards public, active and shared transportation in urban areas.",Not About Sufficiency

"Isolation and characterization of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria isolated from organically grown high yielding pole type native pea (Pisum sativum L.) variety Dentami of Sikkim, India","Organic farming is an eco-friendly and sustainable farming practice that enhances soil fertility and helps in improving soil quality. But with the commencement of more sophisticated advances in agricultural techniques, organic farming has gradually become limited in the world. Culture-dependent plant growth-promoting bacterial isolates were isolated from the bulk and rhizospheric soil, of the native high yielding pole type organic pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivar Dentami of Dentam, West Sikkim, India. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing identification of these isolates, it was found that from the bulk soil, Actinobacteria (58%) was the dominant phyla followed by Firmicutes (28%), and Proteobacteria (14%). In the rhizospheric soil it was dominated by Proteobacteria (56%), followed by Firmicutes (33%), and Bacteriodetes (11%). A total of 40 bacterial isolates were initially screened for the plant growth-promoting (PGP) activity and out of them only four bacterial isolates i.e., Bacillus cereus P8, Arthrobacter woluwensis DP2, Paenarthrobacter nitroguajacolicus PP3, and Bacillus mycoides PP10 with accession numbers MN589697, MN559516, MN519462 and MN589696 respectively were found to possess higher PGP activity (i.e. phosphorous, potassium solubilization and nitrogen-fixing activity) as compared to the other bacteria present in the soil. Based on the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) quantitative assay and siderophore production assay, it was found that Bacillus cereus (MN589697) produced the highest IAA (65.5 mu g mL 1) and siderophore (71%) when compared with the other isolates. The statistical correlation suggests that pH and available phosphorus were the strongest influencing factors for the distribution of Proteobacteria in the rhizospheric soil. The results indicate that these isolates can be potential plant growth promoter under the agroclimatic conditions of Sikkim, India.

"Temporal patterns in diversity and species composition of deep-sea benthic copepods in bathyal Sagami Bay, central Japan","Little is known about temporal changes in the diversity and species composition of deep-sea metazoan meiofauna and their relationships with changes in the food supply. Those changes were studied for benthic copepod assemblages based on 2-year time-series data at a bathyal site in Sagami Bay (1430 m depth), central Japan, where annual fluctuation in the abundance of benthic foraminiferans was previously observed. Species diversity of benthic copepods at the site was as high as, or slightly higher than, that observed at other deep-sea sites, but did not fluctuate temporally through the study period. Multivariate analyses did not reveal any clear seasonal or directional change occurring over the longer term in their species composition, although there was some consistent pattern. These results indicate a lack of, or only weak, seasonality in the diversity and species structure of the deep-sea benthic copepod assemblages, even though the fresh organic food supply fluctuates seasonally. They also suggest that there are differences between copepods and foraminiferans in the response to changes in environmental factors, and that spatial differences in the composition of copepod communities are greater than temporal ones at this deep-sea site.",Not About Sufficiency
Short-term feeding response of the scallop Argopecten purpuratus exposed to two different diets,"Argopecten purpuratus was exposed to two different diets which reflected short term variations in quantity and quality of the natural food supply typical in bays of southern Chile. No significant differences of clearance rate were observed over different time periods at either of two food concentrations. The scallop reduced its clearance rate significantly when it was exposed to the higher food concentration. Pseudofaeces production Occurred only at this high diet and the time factor had no significant effect on this process. The organic content of pseudofaeces was significantly lower than the organic content of the food, suggesting a pre-ingestive selection mechanism. Based on this capacity for particle selection, A. purpuratus was able to compensate for the differences in food quality of the experimental diets and ingesting particulate material containing, 38% organic matter as a result of the selection process when fed at the higher food concentration. Absorption efficiency was lower following exposure to the high food concentration, suggesting that the experimental time of 72 h was not sufficient to acclimate the digestive response to a food supply significantly different front that of its habitat of origin.

Contribution of REDD plus payments to the economy of rural households in Nepal,"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) is a global climate change mitigation strategy. Under the proposed REDD+ framework, financial incentives are provided, primarily to developing countries, for forest conservation to reduce carbon emissions. Projects labelled as REDD are being implemented in a wide variety of settings in different countries. Developing an effective benefit distribution mechanism between implementing agencies and local communities is a key challenge for the implementation of REDD+. We examined whether the REDD+ payment mechanism adopted in a REDD+ pilot project in Nepal is beneficial to the local forest users. We estimated economic contribution of the REDD+ payments to the total household income, calculated the role of payment in reducing income inequality at the household level and examined socio-economic heterogeneity represented by wealth and ethnicity among the payment recipient households. REDD+ payment provided economic benefits to the poorest households but the economic contribution of the payment to the household economy is very nominal and is insufficient to invest in livelihood enhancement activities. REDD+ payment to some extent helps to reduce income inequality among the households. Social heterogeneity of a household overshadowed household wealth status during the payment distribution among the sampled households creating social tension. Therefore, either alternative payment models or investment in community projects might yield better outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Growth-defence balance in grass biomass production: the role of jasmonates,"Growth-defence balance is the selective partitioning of resources between biomass accumulation and defence responses. Although it is generally postulated that reallocation of limited carbon pools drives the antagonism between growth and defence, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this regulation. Jasmonates (JAs) are a group of oxylipins that are required for a broad range of responses from defence against insects to reproductive growth. Application of JAs to seedlings also leads to inhibited growth and repression of photosynthesis, suggesting a role for JAs in regulating growth-defence balance. The majority of JA research uses dicot models such as Arabidopsis and tomato, while understanding of JA biology in monocot grasses, which comprise most bioenergy feedstocks, food for human consumption, and animal feed, is limited. Interestingly, JA mutants of grasses exhibit unique phenotypes compared with well-studied dicot models. Gene expression analyses in bioenergy grasses also suggest roles for JA in rhizome development, which has not been demonstrated in Arabidopsis. In this review we summarize current knowledge of JA biology in panicoid grasses-the group that consists of the world's emerging bioenergy grasses such as switch-grass, sugarcane, Miscanthus, and sorghum. We discuss outstanding questions regarding the role of JAs in panicoid grasses, and highlight the importance of utilizing emerging grass models for molecular studies to provide a basis for engineering bioenergy grasses that can maximize biomass accumulation while efficiently defending against stress.",Not About Sufficiency
Silicon distribution in meadow steppe and typical steppe of northern China and its implications for phytolith carbon sequestration,"Silicon (Si) not only plays an important role in plant growth but also contributes significantly to the long-term terrestrial carbon sink in the form of phytoliths. This study investigated Si content of 184 plant species in meadow steppe and typical steppe of northern China to examine the influential factors of Si distribution and evaluate the potential phytolith carbon sequestration of these grasslands. Our results indicated that the average Si content generally decreased in the following order of Equisetopsida > Monocotyledoneae > Dicotyledoneae. Within angiosperms, although most Si accumulator plants were commelinid monocots, many eudicots also accumulated abundant Si in their above-ground tissues. The Si content of plant above-ground parts in typical steppe (6.53 +/- 2.88 g/kg) was significantly higher than that in meadow steppe (2.15 +/- 0.92 g/kg). The estimated phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) production flux in typical steppe (0.81 +/- 0.36 kg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)) was higher than that in meadow steppe (0.54 +/- 0.23 kg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)). This study demonstrates that plant phylogeny influences the Si content of individual species, whereas grassland type with different mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature may significantly affect the abundance of high Si species. We conclude that increasing the abundance of grass species with high Si content in meadow steppe and appropriate grazing and fertilizer application in typical steppe will enhance the phytolith carbon sequestration in grasslands of northern China.",Not About Sufficiency
Simplified model and measurement of specific absorption rate distribution in a culture flask within a transverse electromagnetic mode exposure system,"In vitro experiments in bioelectromagnetics frequently require the determination of specific absorption rate (SAR) within a layer of cells on the bottom of a culture flask when the SAR has rapid spatial variation both horizontally within the cell layer and vertically in the medium bathing the cells. This problem has only recently been treated in the literature; and it is here approached differently for another irradiation system. It is shown that a simple two-dimensional frequency-domain guided-wave treatment yields results qualitatively comparable to those of more computationally intensive three-dimensional time-domain free-field scattering treatments. The problem of inferring local SARs from temperature-vs.-time curves is shown to be seriously confounded by thermal diffusion; and specific analytic and numerical results are presented to aid in understanding this effect. A novel experimental technique is introduced for measuring millikelvin temperature offsets with subsecond resolution, and illustrative experimental data are presented. Finally, present experimental and theoretical uncertainties are considered; and it is pessimistically asserted that, in a culture flask where spatial SAR variation is rapid, point SAR measurements by thermal methods may be in error by as much as +/-3 dB. More reliable thermal determinations will require extreme care, challenging technological innovations, or both. Bioelectromagnetics 20:183-193, 1999. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
"Simulation of geometallurgical variables through stepwise conditional transformation in Sungun copper deposit, Iran","Nowadays, geometallurgical modeling, as a rapidly growing discipline in mining engineering, has significant role in mine designing/planning especially for porphyry copper projects. In porphyry copper deposits, the copper ore often is composed of two main parts including oxide and sulfide ores. The oxide rock type consists a fraction of total copper which would be recovered by heap leaching. Flotation plant is used when the fraction of sulfide ore is high enough. The mineralogical inequality constraint linking both grade variables (total copper and oxide copper) is a difficulty which often complicates the joint modeling and simulation of variables. To simplify such complicated joint simulation, the stepwise conditional transformation technique is presented which transforms multiple variables to the univariate and multivariate Gaussian with no cross correlation. This makes it easy to simulate multiple variables with arbitrarily complex relationships. This study addresses the application of stepwise conditional transformation and sequential Gaussian simulation for reproduction of the total and oxide copper in different rock types of the Sungun porphyry copper deposit honoring the relationship between Cu-oxide and Cu-total of the initial data. Validation results show that the simulation model has a good agreement with the sample data and geological facts of deposit.",Not About Sufficiency
Simulation-based study on active tilt controlled narrow tilting three-wheeler considering road bank angle,"The issues like traffic congestion, parking space and vehicular emission can be reduced by adopting electric narrow tilting three-wheelers, which can also provide a cost-effective and safe mode of transport for low-income people. According to energy technology perspectives 2017, well-to-wheel global greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced up to 1.3 GtCO(2)-eq by 2060 by adopting electric mobility. This study presents a new and modified SDTC strategy and performance parameters that takes Road Bank Angle (RBA) into account so as to exhibit the adverse effects on rollover safety, ride comfort in terms of the perceived lateral acceleration and desired trajectory. Besides, this study identifies the importance of the RBA consideration in active tilt controlled vehicle for the scenario of parking on sloped surface. Simple electronic control architecture of the SDTC approach with real-time RBA consideration is proposed to address the limitations of SDTC and its supplementary advantages. This study evaluates the scenario of constant turn manoeuvre and vehicle parking on the banked roads. A multi-body model is used to capture the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle, whereas a characteristic of the Tilt Actuation System (TAS) and Active Steering (AS) system is incorporated in the form of a Transfer Function (TF) estimated using a system identification approach. The results indicate that the inclusion of a real-time RBA in the SDTC enables it to maintain steady-state torque and perceived lateral acceleration close to zero with the proposed controlled strategy, and it also keeps the vehicle upright on the sloped surface. It may be concluded that RBA compensation improves the ease of handling the vehicle while parking or riding on a sloped surface without significant control system alterations, which also makes it a viable alternative for physically disabled people.",Not About Sufficiency
Job analysis for a changing workplace,"Job analysis sits at the heart of all human resource practices, making it a critically important management activity in every organization. However, with increasing competition, shorter product life-cycles, rapid technological innovations, and the changing nature of organizational structures, its underlying assumptions are becoming increasingly questionable in today's dynamic work environment. Moreover, the methods used by traditional job analysis are simply not applicable to many new and emerging jobs and some authors feel it may even be an obstacle to organizational success. This has led to calls for a more proactive and strategic approach to job analysis so that the procedures will continue to be relevant. In this article, I emphasize the need for a strategic approach to job analysis, present a strategic job analysis framework, and discuss implications for organizations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Cross-taxon transferability of sugarcane expressed sequence tags derived microsatellite (EST-SSR) markers across the related cereal grasses,"Sugarcane is a crop of economic importance providing sugar and bioenergy resource which has a substantial contribution to the national GDP of India as well as other countries. Genomes of the several grasses have co-evolved which share large-scale synteny and genome collinearity; hence it is possible to employ EST-SSR markers of one grass species for genetic study of other related species. A set of sixty potentially informative EST-derived microsatellite (SSR) markers were employed to examine their cross-taxa transferability across the limit of taxonomic boundaries of different grass genomes. The high (96.6%) rate of SSRs cross-transferability observed in genus Saccharum followed by Erianthus (93.3%), Narenga (88.3%), Sclerostachya (86.3%), and Miscanthus (83.3%). Relatively lower rates of cross amplification were observed in other cereal crops including Sorghum bicolor, Pennisetum glaucum, Zea mays, Triticum aestivum, Oryza sativa, and Avena sativa. Cross-transferable EST-SSR markers were utilized to evaluate phylogenetic relationships among genus Saccharum, closely related genera of Saccharum complex, and other allied cereal grasses. The polymorphic information content values ranged from 0.35 to 0.95, with an average of 0.71. Such a high rates of cross-taxa transferability of the EST-SSRs make them a potent tool for genetic studies and comparative genomics across wide evolutionary distances within and across genera along with technologically simplicity and cost effectiveness. EST-SSRs will facilitate to devise potent tools for genetic improvement through advance molecular breeding of such crops for high grain productivity and better quality. They will especially be useful for the orphan grass species, which contribute a major part of the global food security.",Not About Sufficiency
"The detrimental effect of rainforest conversion to rubber plantations on soil dissolved organic carbon and C: N stoichiometry, mediated by altered soil biogeochemistry","Rainforest conversion into rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations (RP) alters global carbon cycling and contributes to climate change. However, the impact of this widespread tropical land use change on various elements of the carbon cycle is poorly understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the impact of rainforest conversion into RP on soil-dissolved organic carbon (DOC), one of the most mobile organic matter (OM) in the terrestrial ecosystem that causes the transformation and migration of C. We also explored the underlying edaphic factors regulating soil DOC changes. Our study sites were rubber monoculture, mixed-rubber plantations (H. brasiliensis, Ficus langkokensis, and Actinodaphne henryi), and a reference rainforest. We found that soil DOC concentration was 150-200% higher in RP than in rainforests, with an unchanged pattern across the seasons (dry and rainy) and plantation type. These results were concomitant with degradation in main soil properties, markedly including lower pH, electrical conductivity, SOC, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), following the RP establishment and explicitly having a significant negative correlation with DOC. Our fitted structure equation model (SEM) highlights that RP caused accelerated DOC production and a higher DOC/DN ratio by decreasing SOC (38.5%) and nutrients (TN and TP). Further, the SEM revealed a significant negative correlation between microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN) and the DOC/DN ratio, implying limited microbial degradation of DOC under RP. This is further supported by our findings of 81.1% lower MBC per unit DOC and 37.1% lower MBN per unit DN under RP compared to rainforests, indicating poor transformation of DOC to microbial biomass under RP. Collectively, our findings suggest that RP with high nutrient demands and altered soil properties lead to increased leaching of DOC due to its limited utilization by microbes. These findings underscore the importance of robust and sustainable soil management (such as optimizing plant density and legume intercropping) in RP to improve soil health and minimize DOC leaching and its potential environmental consequences.",Not About Sufficiency
Sisyphus' sisters: Can gender mainstreaming escape the genderedness of organizations?,"Currently, gender mainstreaming is presented as bringing new elan to gender equality policies. Gender mainstreaming is a gender equality strategy that aims to transform organizational processes and practices by eliminating gender biases in existing routines, involving the regular actors in this transformation process. In this article, we question the aspirations of gender mainstreaming. Can gender mainstreaming escape the genderedness of organizations; can it genuinely effect change, or does it inevitably become compromised? Our analysis of a case project within Human Resource Management in the Ministry of the Flemish Community in Belgium shows that gender mainstreaming does indeed bring about changes, but that it does not break down the genderedness of organizations substantially. While gender mainstreaming invokes an image of cooperation between equal parties that pursue a dual agenda of business needs and feminist goals, our analysis shows that crucial power differences between those parties determine the outcome. The complex social dynamics of gender mainstreaming entail compromises in the context of these power differences, which seriously hinder the transformative and innovative potential of gender mainstreaming.",Not About Sufficiency
Slow growth improves compensation ability: examining growth rate and starvation endurance in pit-building antlions from semi-arid and hyper-arid regions,"Different environments are expected to exert differential selective pressures, often generating distinct sets of traits in organisms inhabiting different geographic regions. Starvation endurance is an important trait for organisms in harsh (i.e., extreme climate and/or biotically poor) and unpredictable environments. This is especially true for sit-and-wait predators, such as antlions, which experience stronger fluctuations in prey arrivals than do actively searching predators. We conducted an experimental comparison of starvation endurance in pit-building antlions, originating from semi-arid and hyper-arid environments. We hypothesized that individuals from the climatically harsher and biotically poor environment (i.e., hyper-arid) should be better adapted to endure long starvation periods. Additionally, we posited that faster-growing individuals are expected to be more sensitive to starvation because of their need to sustain higher metabolic rates. We found that antlions originating from the semi-arid region maintained higher activity levels, which led to slightly higher mass loss rates during starvation, but enabled faster recovery when food supply was renewed. Conversely, antlions originating from the hyper-arid region had lower activity levels, consistent with their lower rate of mass loss during starvation, but this came at the expense of decreased response to prey and lower growth rate when food became available again. Each strategy holds its advantages for coping with long starvation periods, and we cannot say decisively which strategy is better. Results from both regions were consistent with the predictions of the growth compensation phenomenon: antlions that were fed less frequently pre-starvation grew at faster rates when food supply was renewed. Our study demonstrates that individuals originating from different environments adopt different strategies in order to endure starvation, exemplifying antlions' ability to compensate for mass lost during starvation.",Not About Sufficiency

"Social Isolation, Healthy Habits, Inequality and Mental Health in the United States","The objective of this work is to deepen the analysis of the socioeconomic determinants of mental health, paying special attention to the impact of inequality, not only in income distribution but also in gender, racial, health and education inequality, social isolation, including new variables to measure loneliness, and healthy habits, on the mental health status. For this purpose, a cross-sectional model for a sample of 2735 counties in the United States is estimated using Ordinary Least Squares in its robust version to solve the detected heteroscedasticity problems. The results obtained show that inequality, social isolation and certain lifestyles, such as smoking or insomnia, are detrimental to mental health, while sexual activity prevents mental distress. On the other hand, poor counties suffer more cases of suicide, with food insecurity being the main problem for mental health.

Our analysis highlights the importance of 'social listening' during the temporal and spatial progression of COVID-19 to: (a) facilitate the identification of agenda proxies reflected in strategic communications used by anti-slavery organisations, and (b) to provide insights into changing communication tactics deployed by these organisations in the context of mass-communication using social media as a result of the global pandemic.",Not About Sufficiency
Social Perception of Ecosystem Services in a Coastal Wetland Post-Earthquake: A Case Study in Chile,"Natural disasters can cause abrupt disturbances in coastal wetlands, affecting the social perception of ecosystem services (ES). The Tubul-Raqui coastal wetland is one of the most important wetlands in south-central Chile. Rich in biodiversity, these wetlands provide ES to a population of 2238 inhabitants. The recent M-W = 8.8 earthquake of 2010 caused a coastal uplift of 1.4 m and substantial morphological, social, and environmental changes. This paper analyzes the social perceptions of the inhabitants of the village of Tubul-Raqui following a large earthquake disturbance with regards to ES provision frequency and their future changes. A statistically representative semi-structured survey was conducted (175 valid surveys) and the data interpreted through factor analysis and statistical tests for independent categorical variables. The perception of cultural and regulating services was significantly greater than that of provisioning services, which were probably the most affected by the earthquake. Residents identified habitat for species, recreation, and hazard regulation as the most important ES. Perception was influenced by the categorical variables of gender, age, and ethnicity; for example, hazard regulation services varied strongly by gender. According to the respondents, the availability of ES will remain stable (50%) or decrease (40%) in the next 50 years, mainly due to anthropogenic drivers; the effect of natural disasters was not mentioned among the main drivers of change.",Not About Sufficiency
Social sustainability measurement framework: The case of employee perspective in a CSR-committed organisation,"The number of organisations putting the issue of sustainability on strategic agenda has been growing in the past few years. Although sustainable development gains more importance, discussion on measures of sustainability is continuing. Environmental and economic dimensions could be more easily evaluated by clearly expressed quantitative indicators. Social sustainability measurement requires a balance between quantitative and qualitative indicators, Furthermore, there is still some ambiguity around what social sustainability actually is. It seems that essentially the determinants of the ""social"" element depend on the underlying framework. However, the majority of the existing measurement frameworks do not fully address the employee perspective. To bridge this gap, the present study aims at substantiating the framework for measuring social sustainability from the employee perspective. The scientific value of the study is the contribution to social sustainability measurement literature by identifying the employee perspective. The proposed framework for social sustainability measurement incudes six dimensions: employee participation, employee cooperation, equal opportunities, employee development, health and safety, and external partnership. For reaching the aim of the paper, two methods are applied: interview of line managers and employee survey. The study is conducted in a CSR-committed organisation, which is a member of the Lithuanian Association of Responsible Business. The findings reveal some differences in the attitudes of employees concerning the social sustainability practices. Health and safety conditions were disclosed as the most important in terms of social sustainability. The findings also suggest incorporating the perspective of employees when measuring social sustainability. The study shows vital involvement of employees in social sustainability evaluation of an organisation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Social sustainability in the oil and gas industry: institutional pressure and the management of sustainable supply chains,"This article addresses certain gaps highlighted in the literature relating to the investigation of supplier selection through a theoretical lens, based on contextual factors, institutional pressure, and industrial features. Consequently, this article sheds light on how a government's strategic plans can drive organisations to incorporate elements of social sustainability into their supply chains. A successful case from Oman which demonstrates the social dimension of sustainability in selecting suppliers in the oil and gas sector is presented, along with the government's role and the mechanisms it has applied. A survey of purchasing, procurement and supply chain managers in Oman's major oil and gas organisations was conducted, along with interviews. The results of this research were further analysed through the lens of institutional theory, addressing a genuine research gap. It was found that: (a) coercive governmental pressure is not sufficient to truly develop socially sustainable practices in organisations if the organisations themselves do not show initiative, as this leads to compliant rather than innovative practice; and (b) policy makers need to be aware that coercive pressure alone does not lead to continuous improvement of social sustainability performance, due to the ceiling effect, i.e. organisations meeting only the minimum governmental requirements.",Not About Sufficiency

Social sustainability of biojet fuel for net zero aviation,"Biojet fuel, also known as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), is the only viable carbon neutral option for the aviation sector to become net zero by 2050 as of now considering the progress, development, and success of all the decarbonization routes. Environmental Life Cycle Assessment (ELCA) studies have also supported the fact that biojet fuel is superior over fossil jet fuel in mitigating climate change and protecting certain elements of the ecosphere. However, social sustainability of biojet fuel, characterized by elements and indicators like gender and social equity, food security, health & safety, employment, community engagement, organizational behavior & values, are hardly researched by the scientific community in adequate amount. This paper synthesized a detailed summary of the above-mentioned social sustainability elements and indicators, by reviewing a wide range of literature on social sustainability of bioenergy. The study found that commercialization of socially sustainable biojet fuel is achievable in very near future, however, integration and cooperation of all stakeholders and social stages at local, national, and international levels are aggressively required to achieve this goal. The study also recommends use of Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) tool to further strengthen R&D and economic policy support for biojet fuel for net zero aviation by 2050.",Not About Sufficiency

Social-ecological outcomes in recreational fisheries: the interaction of lakeshore development and stocking,"Many ecosystems continue to experience rapid transformations due to processes like land use change and resource extraction. A systems approach to maintaining natural resources focuses on how interactions and feedbacks among components of complex social-ecological systems generate social and ecological outcomes. In recreational fisheries, residential shoreline development and fish stocking are two widespread human behaviors that influence fisheries, yet emergent social-ecological outcomes from these potentially interacting behaviors remain under explored. We applied a social-ecological systems framework using a simulation model and empirical data to determine whether lakeshore development is likely to promote stocking through its adverse effects on coarse woody habitat and thereby also on survival of juvenile and adult fish. We demonstrate that high lakeshore development is likely to generate dependency of the ecosystem on the social system, in the form of stocking. Further, lakeshore development can interact with social-ecological processes to create deficits for state-level governments, which threatens the ability to fund further ecosystem subsidies. Our results highlight the value of a social-ecological framework for maintaining ecosystem services like recreational fisheries.",Not About Sufficiency
Socio-economic and environmental factors influenced pro-poor growth process: new development triangle,"The developmental triangle earlier comprises economic growth, income inequality, and poverty, while in this study, we extended it by incorporating environmental and resource factors, health and education factors, sectoral value added, and some other growth-specific factors for assessing pro-poor growth, by considering Bolivian economy as a case study. The elasticity estimates show that agriculture and industrial sector growth is not pro-poor due to account of high income inequality, while services sector played a vital role in country's economic development and supports poor livelihood in a country. Energy and environmental resources negatively impact on quality of life of the poor relative to non-poor, which create income differences among them. Health and education expenditures give favors to the poor and supported the notion of pro-poor growth, while country's per capita income and foreign direct investment inflows increase income inequality that lead towards pro-rich growth. The results conclude that, in general, Bolivian economy growth is fairly unstable, polluted, and unhealthy that biased to the poor relative to non-poor.",Not About Sufficiency
Socioeconomic Inequality in mortality using 12-year follow-up data from nationally representative surveys in South Korea,"Background: Investigations into socioeconomic inequalities in mortality have rarely used long-term mortality follow-up data from nationally representative samples in Asian countries. A limited subset of indicators for socioeconomic position was employed in prior studies on socioeconomic inequalities in mortality. We examined socioeconomic inequalities in mortality using follow-up 12-year mortality data from nationally representative samples of South Koreans. Methods: A total of 10,137 individuals who took part in the 1998 and 2001 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were linked to mortality data from Statistics Korea. Of those individuals, 1,219 (12.1 %) had died as of December 2012. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the relative risks of mortality according to a wide range of socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators after taking into account primary sampling units, stratification, and sample weights. Results: Our analysis showed strong evidence that individuals with disadvantaged SEP indicators had greater all-cause mortality risks than their counterparts. The magnitude of the association varied according to gender, age group, and specific SEP indicators. Cause-specific analyses using equivalized income quintiles showed that the magnitude of mortality inequalities tended to be greater for cardiovascular disease and external causes than for cancer. Conclusion: Inequalities in mortality exist in every aspect of SEP indicators, both genders, and age groups, and four broad causes of deaths. The South Korean economic development, previously described as effective in both economic growth and relatively equitable income distribution, should be scrutinized regarding its impact on socioeconomic mortality inequalities. Policy measures to reduce inequalities in mortality should be implemented in South Korea.",Not About Sufficiency
"Socio-economic trajectories, urban area expansion and ecosystem conservation affect global potential supply of bioenergy","Biomass energy is projected to be a critical resource for defossilization of the energy system. While urban area extension and land conservation would constrain potential biomass supply, there is little understanding of their impacts. This paper presents global and regional bioenergy supply potential estimates by newly implementing urban area expansion in an integrated assessment model AIM (Asia-Pacific Integrated Model). Scenarios were investigated as combinations of shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) with default and expanded urban area and conservation. The bioenergy potentials in 2050 with fixed urban area at base year level were in the range of 228 (SSP3) to 292 (SSP1) exajoules per year (EJ yr-1), corresponding to differences in fraction of land available for bioenergy crop production. The bioenergy potentials under urban expansion closely tracked trends in the reference SSP cases, but with decreases ranging from 4.48 (SSP1) to 6.95 (SSP5) EJ yr-1. While global total effects were small, regions experienced mixed results and in some cases a reversal of trends. Under conservation scenarios, reductions in bioenergy potential caused by urban expansion were observed to be lower except in some regions and scenarios. These results enhance the understanding of SSP patterns of bioenergy potential while at the same time revealing how global trends may fail to capture region-specific trends. The study concluded that: 1) urbanization may lack relevance for bioenergy at the global scale but becomes important for some regions, 2) loss of bioenergy potential can be curbed by encouraging compact urbanization as in SSP1 (Sustainable Development), zoning, and pursuing joint energy-conservation policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil Carbon Investigation in Three Pedoclimatic and Agronomic Settings of Northern Italy,"Sustainable agricultural management is needed to promote carbon (C) sequestration in soil, prevent loss of soil fertility, and reduce the release of greenhouse gases. However, the influence of agronomic practices on soil C sequestration depends on the existing pedoclimatic features. We characterized the soils of three farms far away each other in the Emilia-Romagna region (Northern Italy): an organic farm in the Northern Apennines, a biodynamic farm, and a conventional farm on the Po Plain. The total, inorganic, and organic carbon in soil, as well as the distinct humic fractions were investigated, analyzing both the elemental and isotopic (C-13/C-12) composition. In soils, organic matter appears to be variously affected by mineralization processes induced by microorganisms that consume organic carbon. In particular, organic carbon declined in farms located in the plain (e.g., organic carbon down to 0.75 wt%; carbon stock(0-30 cm) down to 33 Mg/ha), because of the warmer climate and moderately alkaline environment that enhance soil microbial activity. On the other hand, at the mountain farm, the minimum soil disturbance, the cold climate, and the neutral conditions favored soil C sequestration (organic carbon up to 4.42 wt%; carbon stock(0-30 cm) up to 160 Mg/ha) in humified organic compounds with long turnover, which can limit greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.

Different Hg mineral species, as well as As-rich minerals, are found in the ore deposits in this part of Spain. Metallurgical activity to extract Hg from these ores was also carried out at many sites. Consequently, the combination of emissions during mining of the ore and additional releases during the inefficient roasting operation gave rise to significant releases of Hg and As to the surrounding soils. All the Hg mines of the district were abandoned before the introduction of any environmental regulations; consequently, the environment is globally affected.

Soil spatial heterogeneity created by river-sea interaction influences Tamarix chinensis root features in the Yellow River Delta,"Salt-tolerant Tamarix chinensis roots are crucial in preserving wetland soil and carbon sequestration, which is essential for wetland ecology. Soil-water-salt conditions influence the growth of these roots in coastal saline areas, but the specific factors and their effects remain unclear. Using principal component and partial least square-structural equation modelling (SEM) methods, we studied T. chinensis root features in six Yellow River delta communities. Results showed varied root features across locations, with larger roots further inland. Root growth negatively correlated with soil texture and salinity and positively with groundwater levels. Soil texture and salinity decreased with distance from the coast, while groundwater increased with distance from the Yellow River. This suggests that geographical location influences soil-water-salt conditions, impacting root characteristics. The principal component analysis-derived root feature index captured 56.7% of root feature variation. SEM revealed geographical locations indirectly influence root features, with the Yellow River's proximity primarily affecting them through groundwater and coastal distance influencing via soil sand content and salinity.

Consequences of considering carbon-nitrogen interactions on the feedbacks between climate and the terrestrial carbon cycle,"The impact of carbon-nitrogen dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems on the interaction between the carbon cycle and climate is studied using an earth system model of intermediate complexity, the MIT Integrated Global Systems Model (IGSM). Numerical simulations were carried out with two versions of the IGSM's Terrestrial Ecosystems Model, one with and one without carbon-nitrogen dynamics. Simulations show that consideration of carbon-nitrogen interactions not only limits the effect of CO2 fertilization but also changes the sign of the feedback between the climate and terrestrial carbon cycle. In the absence of carbon-nitrogen interactions, surface warming significantly reduces carbon sequestration in both vegetation and soil by increasing respiration and decomposition (a positive feedback). If plant carbon uptake, however, is assumed to be nitrogen limited, an increase in decomposition leads to an increase in nitrogen availability stimulating plant growth. The resulting increase in carbon uptake by vegetation exceeds carbon loss from the soil, leading to enhanced carbon sequestration (a negative feedback). Under very strong surface warming, however, terrestrial ecosystems become a carbon source whether or not carbon-nitrogen interactions are considered. Overall, for small or moderate increases in surface temperatures, consideration of carbon-nitrogen interactions result in a larger increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration in the simulations with prescribed carbon emissions. This suggests that models that ignore terrestrial carbon-nitrogen dynamics will underestimate reductions in carbon emissions required to achieve atmospheric CO2 stabilization at a given level. At the same time, compensation between climate-related changes in the terrestrial and oceanic carbon uptakes significantly reduces uncertainty in projected CO2 concentration.",Not About Sufficiency
Solar Fuel Production Based on the Artificial Photosynthesis System,"Models of photosynthesis mimetic systems, the so-called artificial photosynthesis systems, have been investigated since the 1970s for the purpose of tapping solar energy. With the deterioration of the global environment in the 21st century, attributed to global warming and greenhouse gas emissions, it has become imperative to identify new fuel sources such as solar energy to replace fossil fuels. Among the new fuel production systems, those involving the use of solar energy have attracted attention; examples are systems that produce hydrogen through water photolysis and those that produce methanol by CO2 reduction with the aid of an artificial photosynthesis system. As hydrogen and methanol are low-carbon fuels (the emission of CO2 from the combustion of these fuels is low), they are considered to be alternatives to fossil resources. In this review, solar fuel production systems consisting of an artificial photosynthesis system, a catalyst, and an enzyme are discussed. These systems are expected to help in reducing CO2 and to promote the use of low-carbon fuels in the future.",Not About Sufficiency
Solar power and climate change policy in developing countries,"Solar energy is one option for reducing future greenhouse gas emissions, Offsetting 50% of all future growth in thermal electricity generation by photovoltaics (PVs) would reduce annual global carbon dioxide emission from projected increased levels by 10% in 20 years and 32% in 50 years, Several projects are under way worldwide to demonstrate the feasibility of PV systems, This paper examines the economic competitiveness of PV systems and concludes that even after including externality costs, without significant technological breakthroughs, the economics of PV applications are unlikely to allow for an unsubsidized, widespread adoption of this technology in the near future, Further, if the goal of PV transfer programmes is to limit future greenhouse gas emissions, there are larger and cheaper opportunities available in industrialized countries to achieve reductions, Alternative measures for ensuring a market for photovoltaics, hence providing manufacturers with opportunities to improve the current technology, include mandating that utilities install a certain quantity of solar technologies by a certain date, Finally, moving towards a renewable energy future that includes PV systems requires a sustained R&D programme that will lead to improvements in panel and other system efficiencies.",Not About Sufficiency

Spatial and Seasonal Controls on Eddy Subduction in the Southern Ocean,"Carbon export driven by submesoscale, eddy-associated vertical velocities (""eddy subduction""), and particularly its seasonality, remains understudied, leaving a gap in our understanding of ocean carbon sequestration.

We identify signatures of eddy subduction as subsurface anomalies in temperature-salinity and oxygen. The anomalies are spatially concentrated near weakly stratified areas and regions with strong lateral buoyancy gradients diagnosed from satellite altimetry, particularly in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current's standing meanders. We use bio-optical ratios, specifically the chlorophyll a to particulate backscatter ratio (Chl/bbp) to find that eddy subduction is most active in the spring and early summer, with freshly exported material associated with seasonally weak vertical stratification and increasing surface biomass. Climate change is increasing ocean stratification globally, which may weaken eddy subduction's carbon export potential.",Not About Sufficiency

The distribution of cropland is uneven across the regions of China. The North-East region of China shows more cropland area per capita than the South-East and North regions of China. During 1990-2000, cropland increased by 2.79 million ha, including 0.25 million ha of paddy land and 2.53 million ha of dry farming land. The North-East and North-West regions of China gained cropland area, while the North and South-East regions showed a loss of cropland area. Urbanization accounted for more than half of the transformation from cropland to other land uses, and the increase in cropland was primarily due to reclamation of grassland and deforestation. Most of the lost cropland had good quality with high productivity, but most gained cropland was poor quality land with less suitability for crop production. The globalization as well as changing environment in China is affecting land-use change. Coordinating the conflict between environmental conservation and land demands for food will continue to be a primary challenge for China in the future. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Spatial attribution of aircraft mass balance experiment CO2 estimations for policy-relevant boundaries: New York City,"To effectively address the unprecedented acceleration of climate change, cities across the United States are leading efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Coherent, aggressive, and lasting mitigation policies in controlling carbon emissions are beginning to be adopted to help strengthen climate resilience across different sectors. However, evaluating the effectiveness of current climate legislation requires careful monitoring of emissions through measurable and verifiable means to inform policy decisions. As a part of this effort, we developed a new method to spatially allocate aircraft-based mass balance carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In this work, we conducted 7 aircraft flights, performed downwind of New York City (NYC) to quantify CO2 emissions during the nongrowing seasons between 2018 and 2020. We used an ensemble of emission inventories and transport models to calculate the fraction of enhancements (F) produced by sources within the policy-relevant boundaries of the 5 NYC boroughs and then applied that to the bulk emissions calculated using the mass balance approach. We derived a campaign-averaged source-apportioned mass balance CO2 emission rate of (57 +/- 24) (1s) kmol/s for NYC. We evaluated the performance of this approach against other top-down methods for NYC including inventory scaling and inverse modeling, with our mean emissions estimate resulting in a 6.5% difference from the average emission rate reported by the 2 complementary approaches. By combining mass balance and transport model approaches, we improve upon traditional mass balance experiment methods to enable quantification of emissions in complex emission environments. We conducted an assessment using an ensemble of emission inventories and transport models to determine the sources of variability in the final calculated emission rates. Our findings indicate that the choice of inventory accounted for 2.0% of the variability in the emission estimates and that the atmospheric transport model contributed 3.9% at the campaign level. Additionally, on average, at the daily scale,the transport model contributed 7.6% and the inventory accounted for 14.1%.The daily flight-to-flight variability contributed a significant portion, at 42.1%. This approach provides a solution to the difficulty of interpreting aircraft-based mass balance results in complex emission environments.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatial characterization of cultural ecosystem services in the Ishigaki Island of Japan: A comparison between residents and tourists,"Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) are non-material benefits that are indispensable for the health and well-being of communities. CES are often spatially explicit and fluctuate according to the knowledge, beliefs, and perception of users of the location. Therefore, understanding the spatial patterns of CES perceived by people from different backgrounds is important for decision-makers to carry out proactive landscape planning. In this study, we investigated the differences in the perception of CES between residents and tourists on Ishigaki Island, Japan. The study employed a Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) approach to spatially present the respective perceptions of residents and tourists regarding six types of CES, namely recreational, therapeutic, educational, spiritual, aesthetic, and historic CES, that are recognized as key contributors to human health and well-being. For data collection, we employed a combination of household-level postal surveys and in-person questionnaire surveys targeting residents (n = 410) and tourists (n = 102), respectively. A series of statistical and spatial analyses was conducted on the survey results to understand the influence of the duration of residence and the frequency of visits in shaping the perceptions of CES, as well as the relationship between perceived CES and land-use types. This included the contribution of protected areas to the delivery of CES. The results showed that the average number of locations indicated by residents was significantly higher than that indicated by the tourists, resulting in density maps with distinct spatial patterns. In particular, the spatial pattern of CES identified by tourists was considerably simpler than that recognized by residents and centered on two popular tourist spots. As per the elements of landscapes and seascapes, the perception of ""aesthetic,"" ""recreational,"" ""therapeutic,"" and ""educational"" CES by residents was associated with ""forest"" and ""sea"" and that of ""spiritual"" and ""historic"" was associated with ""forest"" and ""farmland."" In contrast, the CES perception of ""recreational,"" ""educational,"" ""therapeutic,"" ""aesthetic,"" and ""historic"" by tourists was associated with ""sea"" and ""forest."" ""Spiritual"" CES was associated with ""forest"" and ""sea."" Lastly, a higher proportion of ""aesthetic"" CES locations were identified within protected areas compared to outside the areas. Overall, our findings revealed that residents and tourists perceive and appreciate the numerous CES arising from landscapes and seascapes of the island differently. This indicates a possible trade-off resulting from land or sea developments to the benefit among stakeholders, for example, tourists. Hence, to sustain CES that underpin equitable health and well-being benefits, spatial planning should consider the different perceptions of stakeholders, particularly of residents and tourists, regarding CES types and locations.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatial dynamics and competitive pricing in charging-as-a-service markets: The quest for cleaner urban development,"To redefine the mobility and energy usage patterns in urban cities, the exponential rise in fast-charging loads of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a new operating paradigm. In this context, a competitive market emerges where multiple oligarchic Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) providers vie for profit. However, analyzing such systems, especially in a long-term rolling horizon, poses significant challenges due to complex strategic interactions among multiple entities. This article proposes an agent-based model to analyze the evolution of spatial CaaS markets. Firstly, we propose a strategic pricing game among CaaS firms based on multinomial logit user choice model, and formally prove the existence of Nash equilibria. For equilibrium finding, an iterative algorithm method leveraging the Nikaido-Isoda function and Barzilai-Borwein step size rule is presented. Furthermore, an agent-based market simulation algorithm is developed to model investment decisions of CaaS firm agents based on equilibrium prices. The proposed model is validated using real world data from Shenzhen, and results indicate the efficacy of the equilibrium solving algorithm in reducing computational burden. This study reveals that deregulated competition among CaaS providers, while promoting social welfare, poses risks to long-term sustainability due to regional inequality and market saturation. Timely policy intervention is recommended to guide the sustainable evolution of the CaaS economy.",Not About Sufficiency
"Spatial Evolution and Critical Factors of Urban Innovation: Evidence from Shanghai, China","The critical role of urban innovation in sustaining urban economic resilience has been widely acknowledged by scholars. Yet there is far from a full spectrum of understanding about how innovation performs, despite China's innovation outputs having far outweighed most countries'. The perennial concern regarding the spatial patterns of innovation has been biased towards the macroscale, and long-standing efforts to explore the determinants of innovative vitality are focused on internal factors (e.g., research and development activities, and firm size). Considering these inadequacies, this research investigates how innovative activities are spatially distributed and how the pattern evolves in cities at the microscale, and examines influencing factors of the external environment. The patent data from 2000 to 2015 in Shanghai are geocoded and mapped into 1 km(2) hexagon grids to identify local clustering. Gini coefficient is computed to show the high concentration of innovation activities across space. The hot spot analysis based on the Getis-Ord (G(i)*) statistic shows that innovation exhibits a strong concentration propensity at the microscale and gradually moves toward a polycentric pattern. However, the extent of concentration decreases over the study period. Firms dictate innovation activities, and individuals and universities also play a role in downtown innovation growth. The regression using random effect model shows heterogeneous effects on different innovation actors. The overall urban innovation output, dominated by firms, is significantly influenced by public budget expenditures and green space areas. The science and technology grant has a positive impact on authorities but not university and research institutes. This research not only contributes to a methodological innovation for measuring and visualizing an innovation pattern but also enriches our understanding of spatial evolution and critical factors of innovation activities in urban China.",Not About Sufficiency

Spatial sampling design optimization of monitoring network for terrestrial ecosystem in China,"The rapid socioeconomic development leads to the deterioration of ecological environment. Ecosystem assessment has been conducted worldwide, e.g. the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment to assess consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being. To enhance ecosystem assessment in China, this study proposes the design of a monitoring network for the terrestrial ecosystem consisting of core stations and localized points. With focus on ecosystem services of NPP, water conservation, soil retention and sandstorm prevention, core stations of the monitoring network for observ-ing all four services are first selected by assessing and improving spatial representativeness in ecoregions of forest, grassland and desert ecosystems. Then a spatial sampling method is applied to choose localized points for observing each specific service. Eventually expert's knowledge is used to make final decisions of added stations and points by utilizing existing networks and considering factors such as topography, spatial coverage. Combining both aforementioned approaches and experts knowledge, 60 core stations and 176 localized points are finally determined for the monitoring network. For the forest ecosystem, 39 core stations are decided with 31 selected from existing networks and eight newly added core stations improve spatial representativeness by 51.58 %, 68.11 % and 75.55 % in Temper-ate grasslands, Temperate desert and Alpine vegetation in Tibet Plateau respectively. For the grassland and desert eco-system, 21 core stations are chosen with 18 from existing networks and three newly added core stations improve the representativeness by 21.60 % and 44.88 % in Tibet alpine grassland and Grassland in southern mountain areas respectively. Priorities in the implementation phase should be given to instruments installation for monitoring all four services in core stations from existing networks and setting up new stations in regions where representativeness are significantly improved.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatialization of Ecosystem Services at local space in a context of deforestation: what statistical approaches and what data?,"The development of approaches to quantify and spatialize ecosystem services (ES) are greatly encouraged by the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) and the REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation). Such approaches could allow the establishment of more appropriate and effective practices and policies for environmental management. Mapping of ES can be seen as a major management tool for places with high environmental issues. A study is conducted at the scale of three areas in the Brazilian Amazon affected by the deforestation front. Two biophysical processes delivering ES, water infiltration in soil and carbon storage in vegetation, were mapped with a spatial resolution of 30 x 30 m. Statistical models were developed in aim to link field measurements of biomass and infiltration rate in 135 sampling points and remote sensing data. These models provide an estimation of the processes for the sites and able us to identify the factors that influence them.

Spatial-modal scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions from commuting in Hong Kong,"Transportation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in cities. Multiple strategies including green technologies, transport management, urban planning and behavior changes are required to mitigate transport emissions. This paper aims to introduce an analytical framework to investigate the impacts of different spatial-modal strategies on reducing commuting emissions. Based on the optimization approach of excess commuting, the proposed framework incorporates the minimum, maximum and random (unpredictable) travel outcomes to inform planning of an urban form embedded with fewer emissions. This analytical framework is applied to Hong Kong to estimate the emissions ranges (the minimum and maximum amounts) under 42 spatial-modal scenarios - a combination of six spatial strategies (status quo, monocentric, highly polycentric, moderately polycentric, dual-centric and tri-centric) and seven modal strategies (status quo, pro-rail (high), pro-rail (moderate), pro bus (high), pro-bus (moderate), pro-car (high) and pro-car (moderate)). The findings illustrate the emissions impacts if Hong Kong is further developed following a job concentration or decentralization principle. It also indicates that if Hong Kong is reconstructed to be a city with multiple CBDs, a dual-centric strategy is desirable because both minimum and maximum commuting are shorter than that of a tri-centric strategy. Moreover, the modal strategy to actively promote rail usage shows more impacts on emissions reduction and car usage should be maintained at the current level. If commuter's travl is less predictable, the high rail usage under a dual-centric city form is a more sustainable spatial-modal strategy. The proposed analytical framework of city's commuting emissions affected by structural and modal changes is transferrable to other places and could offer planners different benchmarks of travel pattern to substantiate their sustainable city planning vision.

Spatial-Temporal Changes and Driving Factors of Land-Use Eco-Efficiency Incorporating Ecosystem Services in China,"With rapid urbanization in China, the dramatic land-use changes are one of the most prominent features that have substantially affected the land ecosystems, thus seriously threatening sustainable development. However, current studies have focused more on evaluating the economic efficiency of land-use, while the loss and degradation of ecosystem services are barely considered. To address these issues, this study first proposed a land use-based input-output index system, incorporating the impact on ecosystem services value (ESV), and then by taking 30 provinces in China as a case study. We further employed the super-efficiency slacks-based model (Super-SBM) and the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model to explore the spatial-temporal changes and driving factors of the evaluated land-use eco-efficiency. We found that the evaluated ESV was 28.09 trillion yuan (at the price of 2000) in 2015, and that the total ESV experienced an inverted U-shaped trend during 2000-2015.The average land-use eco-efficiency exhibited a downward trend from 0.87 in 2000 to 0.68 in 2015 with distinct regional differences by taking into account the ESV. Our results revealed that northeastern region had the highest efficiency, followed by the eastern, western, and central region of China. Finally, we identified a U-shaped relationship between the eco-efficiency and land urbanization, and found that technological innovation made great contributions to the improvement of the eco-efficiency. These findings highlight the importance of the ESV in the evaluation of land-use eco-efficiency. Future land development and management should pay additional attention to the land ecosystems, especially the continuous supply of human well-being related ecosystem services.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatiotemporal Changes in Leaf Area and Carbon Sequestration of Terrestrial Vegetation in China over the Last Two Decades,"Spatio-temporal change characteristic in leaf area index (LAI), gross primary productivity (GPP), total leaf area and total carbon sequestration of terrestrial vegetation at different geographic regions, provinces and land cover change types over China during 2000-2018 were clarified, respectively. The net increase in total leaf area and carbon sequestration over China from 2000 to 2018 is 1.7491 x 10(6) km(2) and 1957.36 TgC, and Southwestern part contributes the most with a contribution of 25.3% for leaf area and 20.1% for carbon sequestration, respectively. The overall contribution of northern provinces to enhanced carbon sequestration capacity is greater than that of southern provinces, with a maximum for Inner Mongolia, even though southern provinces have a much higher leaf area increase. The annual increase rates of LAI and GPP in returning cropland to forest-grassland and artificial restoration of forest-grassland are higher than that of self-rehabilitation of rapid growth stage for planted young vegetation. However, due to self-rehabilitation of forest-grassland has the largest area percentage of 59%, it contributes the most to the increases of leaf area and carbon sequestration among different land cover change types, except for northeastern China, where improved farmland productivity is a dominant factor. It should be noted that the leaf area and carbon sequestration exhibit upward trends in urbanized areas over China. whereas slight increasing and even negative trends are also observed in southwestern, southern, and eastern China (e.g., Shanghai), where artificial surface construction occupied more cropland during urbanization processing. Compared with climatic factors, LAI is the dominant factor influencing GPP increases over China since 2000, and gradually weakened coupling relationship between LAI and GPP is observed from north to south. For climatic factors, GPP is dominantly affected by precipitation in northern parts and by solar radiation in southern parts.",Not About Sufficiency
"Spatio-temporal evolution and trend prediction of urban ecosystem service value based on CLUE-S and GM (1,1) compound model","Ecosystem service value (ESV) is a significant indicator related to regional ecological well-being. Evaluating ESV premised on continuous time series land benefit data can provide an accurate reference for regional ecological civilization construction and sustainable development. Taking Shijiazhuang, the capital city of Hebei Province as an example, the study analyzed land use changes based on the land use data of the continuous time series from 2000 to 2020 and introduced a socio-economic adjustment factor and biomass factor adjustment factor to construct a dynamic assessment model of ecosystem service value. The spatiotemporal changes of the ecosystem service value in Shijiazhuang City were evaluated, and the dynamic prediction of the ecosystem service value was made using the CLUE-S model and the GM (1,1) model. (1) The changes in the overall ESV and spatial pattern in Shijiazhuang are strongly linked to the change in land use, and the contribution of cultivated land, woodland, and grassland to ecosystem service value exceeds 90%. (2) Between 2000 and 2020, the value of ecosystem services illustrated a dynamic change and gradually declined, with the total amount falling from 28.003 to 19.513 billion yuan. Among individual ecosystem services, the value of regulation services suffered the most serious loss. (3) CLUE-S and GM (1,1) perform well in the prediction of ESV. The prediction outcomes illustrate that the ecosystem service value of Shijiazhuang will continue to decline by 2025, and the ecosystem value will drop to 16.771 billion yuan. This research may offer a reference for the dynamic assessment of ESV of the continuous sequence and help to promote regional ecological protection and sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatio-temporal pattern and driving forces of construction land change in a poverty-stricken county of China and implications for poverty-alleviation-oriented land use policies,"Sustainable land use, targeted poverty alleviation (TPA) and integrated urban/town development are key issues for the poverty-stricken counties of China. This paper explored the spatio-temporal pattern and driving forces of construction land change in Longzhou, a typical poverty-stricken border county in southwest China, based on high-resolution remote sensing images and field investigations. The results showed that, from 2011 to 2016, the construction land in Longzhou increased by 10.08%. The largest increase shown by urban built-up areas (37.74%) followed by rural residential (25.48%), industrial and mining (20.96%), and transportation areas (15.49%) as well by tourist facility areas (0.33%). The accelerated urban development, rural housing construction, and construction of industrial parks and transportation facilities are main factors driving construction land expansion, while the implementation of TPA strategy and the booming of border trade activities are important policy drivers of the construction land expansion. Some of the major implications for improving povertyalleviation-oriented land use policies were further discussed. The authors argue that land use policy innovation could play a key role in breaking the Matthew effect (poor get poorer, rich get richer) of China's uneven regional development and generating and accelerating the transformation development of poverty-stricken counties. It is fundamental to meet the demand of construction land for TPA, meanwhile raise the intensive level of land utilization. The authors suggest that the government need to further improve and implement preferential land use policies for poverty-stricken counties from the provincial level, appropriately increase the quotas of construction land, and effectively strengthen the rational, efficient and intensive use of the quotas of construction land, and provide solid land policy support for poverty alleviation and thus achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with higher quality.",Not About Sufficiency

Novel Approach for Enhancing Challenging Terrains Using an Integrated Pyrolysis and Furrow-Diking Technology,"Poultry-processing industries generate substantial quantities of waste, posing significant environmental challenges due to the complexity of handling and disposal. This study explores an innovative solution that combines thermochemical treatment of poultry waste with furrow-diking technology to transform non-recyclable feathers and bones into biochar-a nutrient-rich soil amendment. The research identifies optimal pyrolysis conditions for biochar production and evaluates its effects on soil moisture retention, compaction reduction, and erosion control. Experimental trials on sloped terrains reveal that incorporating biochar into compartmentalized furrows enhances water-holding capacity and soil structure, providing a sustainable approach to addressing agricultural challenges. Pyrolyzing poultry waste at 500 degrees C produced biochar with high nitrogen content and stability, capable of retaining up to 90% of its mass in water and significantly reducing soil compaction. Furthermore, applying 10 metric tons of biochar per hectare can sequester 5-8 metric tons of carbon annually, contributing to long-term carbon mitigation and regenerative agriculture. This integrated methodology combines waste valorization with ecological restoration, unlocking new opportunities for scalable and sustainable soil-management solutions.",Not About Sufficiency

Macroeconomic Policies for a Sustainable World,"The urgency of the climate crisis is such that it needs to inform most policy-making. It represents a major threat to human development. Yet while the existence of the crisis is generally acknowledged, this has not affected macro-economic policy even though the climate crisis has major effects on the accepted objectives of macro-economic policy, including growth and economic stability. The paper explores changes in macro-economic policy needed for sustainability which should become an intrinsic and overriding objective of policy. Implications of doing so are explored, including replacing the growth objective with green/sustainable growth, altering the measurement of GDP accordingly; greatly increasing the weight given to the well-being of future generations with implications for interest and investment rates; and reforming taxes and expenditures. Ballooning of debt is justified to support a rapid transition to a carbon-free economy. Among high-income countries, the growth objective should be questioned. Low income countries need green growth to attain reasonable living standards. Large-scale resource transfers to low income countries are essential to support green expenditures for mitigation and especially adaptation.

Post-socialist gender transformations and women's experiences of employment Movements between continuity and change in Bulgaria,"Purpose - This paper seeks to demonstrate that gender research is crucial to understanding post-socialist transformations and wider changes in social life. Focused on employment experiences and gender identities of two generations of Bulgarian women, it aims to highlight the complex intertwining of social structure and individual agency and to point out how processes of continuity and change constitute the post-socialist transformation and individual life journeys. Design/methodology/approach - Informed by feminist analyses, of gender and citizenship, generation theory and qualitative interviews, the paper employs the notion of gender imaginaries in comparing continuity and change in gender policy and individual experiences. Findings - The paper argues that significant changes occurred after 1989 in the ways official gender imaginaries were constructed through law, policy, and public discourses. In comparison to this, individual women's gender imaginaries entailed not only change but also sustained attachment to paid work, rejection of domesticity, and continued feelings of gender equality. This suggests that stable and often unquestioned notions of gender had a significant role for individual imaginaries. In addition to this, some of the most considerable changes were manifested in the notions of risk and uncertainty, which have become central aspects of the post-socialist gender imaginary, particularly in relation to paid work. Originality/value - The paper engages in a comparison of employment experiences of two generations of women thus directing its enquiry to the combination of individuals' agency in crafting one's life journey and the constraints of social structures and existing gender inequalities. Thus, transformations in individual lived lives of women are seen as interrelated with social change and historic location.",Not About Sufficiency

Strategic spatial planning in emerging land-use frontiers: evidence from Mozambique,"Land-use frontiers are territories with abundant land for agriculture and forestry, availability of natural resources relative to labor or capital and predisposed to rapid land-use change, often driven by large-scale land investments and capitalized actors, producing commodities for distal markets. Strategic spatial planning (SSP) represents a consolidated long-term governance practice across high- and low-income countries. One of the objectives of SSP processes is to articulate a more coherent and future-oriented spatial logic for the sustainability of land-use patterns and typologies, natural-resources protection, and investments. SSP may thus constitute a useful approach in addressing some of the challenges affecting land governance in frontier settings; to date, its potential contribution to land-use frontiers lacks explicit exploration. In this paper, we examine how SSP can play a role in governing land-use frontiers through a case-study analysis of Mozambique as an emerging frontier, located on the southeast coast of Africa. We gathered empirical evidence by interviewing experts involved in resource management, territorial planning, and development in the country. The theoretical spine of the paper builds on the literature focusing on land-use challenges and SSP. We show that emerging land-use frontiers face several challenges, such as transnational land deals and the intensification of commercial plantations. Interview data show that several structural factors are hindering the establishment of a long-term territorial development strategy. These are, among others, the short-termism of political cycles and the absence of a long-term strategic vision. Our analysis reveals that SSP processes could contribute to addressing land-use challenges in frontier contexts, such as poverty traps and land degradation spirals, should various local and distant actors join forces and marry interests. We conclude by presenting a systematic rationale, explaining how SSP could play a role in governing land-use frontiers, with a view to promoting the well-being and sustainability of rural communities.",Not About Sufficiency

Strengthening of concrete beams by monolayer prepreg composites with and without graphene reinforcement,"Composite materials are widely used in different engineering fields and they are very efficient for engineering applications. Several composite materials are in use along with the technological innovations in materials and construction techniques. This study focuses on the monolayer prepreg (MP) composites and graphene-reinforced monolayer prepreg (GMP) composites and their structural contribution to the structural performance of concrete beams. The main objectives of the study are (1) to understand the mechanical properties of the MP and GMP composites, (2) to investigate the influence of graphene on the mechanical characterizations of the MP composites and (3) to compare the strengthening effectiveness and configurations of the MP and GMP composites applied to plain concrete (PC) beams. For this purpose, the MP and GMP composites are produced as continuous sheets and concrete beams are strengthened with these sheets considering four different internal and external strengthening configurations. The flexural behavior of the PC beams is compared to reinforced beams with MP and GMP composites through experiments, numerical simulations and statistical tests. The results indicate that the tensile strength of the MP composite increases by addition of graphene leading to more effective strengthening by the GMP composites, especially with external configuration, than the MP composites.

Effects of stump harvest and site preparation on N2O and CH4 emissions from boreal forest soils after clear-cutting,"Harvesting stumps after clear-cutting can increase bioenergy supplies and thus reduce needs for fossil fuels, but more knowledge is required about associated changes in greenhouse gas emissions from forest soils to assess the climatic impact of extracting stumps for this purpose. The soil disturbance caused by harvesting stumps may alter soil processes, including N mineralization. N availability is an important determinant of emissions of the potent greenhouse gases N2O and CH4. Effects of stump harvest on these gases are largely unknown. Therefore, they were explored in this study by monitoring differences in N2O and CH4 emissions associated with different types of disturbance during two years following stump harvest and site preparation (as well as their overall effects) at three mesic sites, using the chamber technique. N2O emissions at two of the sites were affected by the type of soil disturbance, but not at the other site. At one site, the N2O emissions were highest from undisturbed soil and mounds and significantly lower from mixed soil, bare mineral soil and wheel ruts. At this site the emission rates were clearly correlated with N availability across the disturbances. At the second site showing significant treatment effects, N2O emissions were higher from the bare mineral soil after site preparation than from other types of disturbed soil. At the third site there were no significant N2O emissions, possibly due to reductions in nitrogen availability caused by the fast establishment of vegetation at that site. The CH4 fluxes included both uptakes and losses, but were generally low following all types of soil disturbances, although they were substantial from wheel ruts and soil pits. In conclusion there were no, or minor, between treatment differences in N2O and CH4 emissions. Furthermore, the radiative forcing potential of these emissions was small compared to mean CO2 emissions from Swedish clear-cuts. Thus, our results indicate that stumps can be harvested without causing elevated emissions of N2O and CH4 on mesic sites. The effects on wetter sites remain to be illuminated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Poleward expansion of tropical cyclone latitudes in warming climates,"Hurricanes and typhoons are tracking further poleward due to the effects of climate change, according to a synthesis of numerical modelling results, observations and palaeoclimate records. Tropical cyclones (TCs, also known as hurricanes and typhoons) generally form at low latitudes with access to the warm waters of the tropical oceans, but far enough off the equator to allow planetary rotation to cause aggregating convection to spin up into coherent vortices. Yet, current prognostic frameworks for TC latitudes make contradictory predictions for climate change. Simulations of past warm climates, such as the Eocene and Pliocene, show that TCs can form and intensify at higher latitudes than of those during pre-industrial conditions. Observations and model projections for the twenty-first century indicate that TCs may again migrate poleward in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, which poses profound risks to the planet's most populous regions. Previous studies largely neglected the complex processes that occur at temporal and spatial scales of individual storms as these are poorly resolved in numerical models. Here we review this mesoscale physics in the context of responses to climate warming of the Hadley circulation, jet streams and Intertropical Convergence Zone. We conclude that twenty-first century TCs will most probably occupy a broader range of latitudes than those of the past 3 million years as low-latitude genesis will be supplemented with increasing mid-latitude TC favourability, although precise estimates for future migration remain beyond current methodologies.",Not About Sufficiency
Study on spatial pattern of land-use change in China during 1995-2000,"It is more and more acknowledged that land-use/cover dynamic change has become a key subject urgently to be dealt with in the study of global environmental change. Supported by the Landsat TM digital images, spatial patterns and temporal variation of land-use change during 1995 -2000 are studied in the paper. According to the land-use dynamic degree model, supported by the 1km GRID data of land-use change and the comprehensive characters of physical, economic and social features, a dynamic regionalization of land-use change is designed to disclose the spatial pattern of land-use change processes. Generally speaking, in the traditional agricultural zones, e.g., Huang-Huai-Hai Plains, Yangtze River Delta and Sichuan Basin, the built-up and residential areas occupy a great proportion of arable land, and in the interlock area of farming and pasturing of northern China and the oases agricultural zones, the reclamation I of arable land is conspicuously driven by changes of production conditions, economic benefits and climatic conditions. The implementation of ""returning arable land into woodland or grassland"" policies has won initial success in some areas, but it is too early to say that the trend of deforestation has been effectively reversed across China. In this paper, the division of dynamic regionalization of land-use change is designed, for the sake of revealing the temporal and spatial features of land-use change and laying the foundation for the study of regional scale land-use changes. Moreover, an integrated study, including studies of spatial pattern and temporal process of land-use change, is carried out in this paper, which is an interesting try on the comparative studies of spatial pattern on change process and the change process of spatial pattern of land-use change.",Not About Sufficiency
Development of over 30-years of high spatiotemporal resolution air pollution models and surfaces for California,"California's diverse geography and meteorological conditions necessitate models capturing fine-grained patterns of air pollution distribution. This study presents the development of high-resolution (100 m) daily land use regression (LUR) models spanning 1989-2021 for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and ozone (O3) across California. These machine learning LUR algorithms integrated comprehensive data sources, including traffic, land use, land cover, meteorological conditions, vegetation dynamics, and satellite data. The modeling process incorporated historical air quality observations utilizing continuous regulatory, fixed site saturation, and Google Streetcar mobile monitoring data. The model performance (adjusted R2) for NO2, PM2.5, and O3 was 84 %, 65 %, and 92 %, respectively. Over the years, NO2 concentrations showed a consistent decline, attributed to regulatory efforts and reduced human activities on weekends. Traffic density and weather conditions significantly influenced NO2 levels. PM2.5 concentrations also decreased over time, influenced by aerosol optical depth (AOD), traffic density, weather, and land use patterns, such as developed open spaces and vegetation. Industrial activities and residential areas contributed to higher PM2.5 concentrations. O3 concentrations exhibited no significant annual trend, with higher levels observed on weekends and lower levels associated with traffic density due to the scavenger effect. Weather conditions and land use, such as commercial areas and water bodies, influenced O3 concentrations. To extend the prediction of daily NO2, PM2.5, and O3 to 1989, models were developed for predictors such as daily road traffic, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)-NO2, monthly AOD, and OMI-O3. These models enabled effective estimation for any period with known daily weather conditions. Longitudinal analysis revealed a consistent NO2 decline, regulatory-driven PM2.5 decreases countered by wildfire impacts, and spatially variable O3 concentrations with no long-term trend. This study enhances understanding of air pollution trends, aiding in identifying lifetime exposure for statewide populations and supporting informed policy decisions and environmental justice advocacy.",Not About Sufficiency
Subnational assessment of legal and illegal deforestation in the Colombian Amazon: consequences for zero deforestation commitments,"Deforestation has been at the heart of the transformation of the Amazon. Global concerns over deforestation and its impact on climate change have resulted in the adoption of a number of initiatives in the framework of zero deforestation. However, undifferentiated application of the concepts of zero net, gross, and illegal deforestation has revealed a lack of understanding of their scope and of challenges to their implementation. Zero legal and illegal deforestation is, in particular, a controversial subject from the point of view of regulation and sovereignty but an essential aspect from the perspective of public policy design. In Colombia, zero deforestation commitments make no mention of legal deforestation. Papers that analyze deforestation and official data sources fail to incorporate the legal dimension in their analysis. This article addresses this gap by identifying areas where deforestation is legal and where it is illegal in one deforestation hotspot of the Colombian Amazon, the administrative department of Guaviare. Our results show that deforestation has increased since 2013, mainly occurs in illegal zones, and that Guaviare department, 85% of which is covered by forest, has very little legal deforestation potential. Our findings reveal that assessing the legality and illegality of deforestation is more complex than often assumed and must become a priority, especially in forested countries where regulation on forest and land management is shared between different level of governments and institutions.",Not About Sufficiency
Subterranean eco-dystopia in Istanbul: the concreted segregation of Tarlabaşı,"The underground layers of cities are constantly concreted with urban transformation projects. The studies on built environment mainly focus on the morphological changes, related dispossessions and observable aspects of urban landscape. However, the environmental costs of transformations are not limited to the impacts of above-ground interventions. In Istanbul, the major impact of subterranean interventions is the destruction of water and soil ecosystems as well as its multi-layered heritage as the large-scale urban transformation decisions are primarily applied to historic neighbourhoods where the existing building stock was appropriated by the urban precariat. The urban transformation projects in historic neighbourhoods of Istanbul come into question with socio-economic dispossessions rather than environmental justice. In this manuscript, the main aim is to address the socio-ecological impacts of planning and architectural design decisions disregarding subterranean construction density, through the case of Tarlaba & scedil;& imath; in Istanbul. Tarlaba & scedil;& imath; represents one of the most emblematic case in Istanbul's urban resistance history and evokes eco-dystopias, which may be attributed to the decisions that justify stigmatisation. With the context, conceptual frame and scope set by these problem definitions, while considering urban inequality a pre-condition of environmental justice, this manuscript examines the correlation between environmental policies, social stigmatisation and flexed environmental values in planning and architecture culture via local political ecology. The methodology employed in the study is based on qualitative analysis of the stages and legal decisions involved. Archival documents on the study area were used to identify the local variables contributing to the deterioration of socio-ecological unity for future discussions.",Not About Sufficiency
CO2 fluxes at northern fens and bogs have opposite responses to inter-annual fluctuations in water table,"This study compares eddy-covariance measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes at six northern temperate and boreal peatland sites in Canada and the northern United States of America, representing both bogs and fens. The two peatland types had opposite responses of gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) to inter-annual fluctuations in water table level. At fens, wetter conditions were correlated with lower GEP and ER, while at bogs wetter conditions were correlated with higher GEP and ER. We hypothesize that these contrasting responses are due to differences in the relative contributions of vascular plants and mosses. The coherence of our results between sites representing a range of average environmental conditions indicates ecosystem-scale differences in resilience to hydrological changes that should be taken into account when considering the future of peatland ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration under changing environmental conditions.

"Silvery mole-rats (Heliophobius argenteocinereus, Bathyergidae) change their burrow architecture seasonally","Little is known about seasonal changes in burrowing activity and burrow architecture in subterranean African mole-rats (Bathyergidae, Rodentia). The solitary genus Heliophobius is the least known genus of this family. We examined burrow systems of the silvery mole-rat (Heliophobius argenteocinereus) in Malawi in two periods of the dry season. Burrow pattern was influenced by the time of the year, becoming more reticulated at the peak of the dry season when soil was dry and hard. Overall digging activity did not cease during the dry season; yet burrowing strategy changed and the soil was deposited in tunnels rather than transported to mounds. The length of burrow systems was correlated with the body mass of the respective occupants. In spite of their solitary habits - and contrary to the prediction of the aridity food-distribution hypothesis - silvery mole-rats are able to occupy poor habitats with low food supply.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing leakage detectability at geologic CO2 sequestration sites using the probabilistic collocation method,"We present an efficient methodology for assessing leakage detectability at geologic carbon sequestration sites under parameter uncertainty. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) and risk assessment are integral and, in many countries, mandatory components of geologic carbon sequestration projects. A primary goal of risk assessment is to evaluate leakage potential from anthropogenic and natural features, which constitute one of the greatest threats to the integrity of carbon sequestration repositories. The backbone of our detectability assessment framework is the probability collocation method (PCM), an efficient, nonintrusive, uncertainty-quantification technique that can enable large-scale stochastic simulations that are based on results from only a small number of forward-model runs. The metric for detectability is expressed through an extended signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which incorporates epistemic uncertainty associated with both reservoir and aquifer parameters. The spatially heterogeneous aquifer hydraulic conductivity is parameterized using Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion. Our methodology is demonstrated numerically for generating probability maps of pressure anomalies and for calculating SNRs. Results indicate that the likelihood of detecting anomalies depends on the level of uncertainty and location of monitoring wells. A monitoring well located close to leaky locations may not always yield the strongest signal of leakage when the level of uncertainty is high. Therefore, our results highlight the need for closed-loop site characterization, monitoring network design, and leakage source detection. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Supplementary ungulate feeding affects movement behavior of brown bears,"Food availability plays a key role in animal movements. Anthropogenic p wisioning of food to wildlife is a common practice of unprecedented magnitude worldwide and is of increasing conservation concern. Ungulate supplementary feeding is widespread in game management; however its effects on non-target species have received little attention. Here, we investigate how ungulate feeding affects the movement behavior of a non-target species, the brown bear (Ursus arctos). We tracked bear movements in the Northeastern Carpathians (1500 km2) and inventoried 212 ungulate feeding sites. We analyzed encounter rates of nine GPS-collared bears with ungulate feeding sites (1658 km, n=49 tracks) and compared them with the corresponding encounter rate of simulated tracks. We also estimated the encounter rate with feeding sites using snow-tracking of unknown bears (232 km, n = 40 tracks). GPS-tracked bears encountered feeding sites three times more frequently (mean + SE= 0.154 +/- 0.022 per km travelled) than would be expected if they were moving randomly (0.054 +/- 0.0010 per km random walk). The rate was even higher for snow-tracked bears, which visited on average 0.926 +/- 0.271 feeding sites per kilometer travelled. This suggests a link between the winter activity of some individuals and their frequent use of feeding sites. Bears seemed to rely on spatial memory and patrol known sites, independent of whether food was available at the feeding sites. This alteration of the natural behavior of species with behavioral flexibility, such as brown bears, could be interpreted as a sign of environmental degradation. Our results demonstrate an important effect of ungulate feeding on the movement ecology of non-target species. We warn of the impacts of this practice on species and ecosystems and highlight the need to preserve natural movement behaviors and urgently reevaluate management practices involving food provisioning to wildlife.

Supply Chain Optimization Decisions for Environmentally Conscious Products with Preservation Investment and Carbon Tax Policy,"The traditional rules of profit maximization and cost-cutting constrain the industries. Their failure to stop environmental degradation has recently forced them to work on sustainable supply chain management. The government has developed many carbon emission regulations to decrease the potential risk of industry greenhouse gas emissions. So, the present analysis acknowledges the influence of carbon tax and partially backlogged shortages for products with demand driven by market potential, consumer desire for green products, and product pricing. Additionally, the deterioration of products over time, which is affected by investments in preservation technologies, is considered. The research formulates the unit green degree and preservation technology investment as decision variables to identify the inventory model's optimal total cost. The traditional optimization approach is used to determine the value of the decision variables.

"Support for utility-scale solar: Effects of information and heterogeneity among public officials, the general population, and landowners","In the United States, utility-scale solar initiatives face growing local resistance despite their cost-competitiveness and potential in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This study investigates the marginal effects of knowledge levels related to solar, information treatments, and their interconnections with peoples' attitudes toward utility- scale solar energy systems and explores some key drivers of the different knowledge levels. We designed and implemented a survey targeting both public officials and the general population in the U.S. state of Iowa. Among 862 respondents, 79.8% self-reported having a low level of knowledge about solar energy. Additionally, 77.7% expressed at least moderate support for hosting such projects in their community. Our empirical results suggest that individuals with a higher level of knowledge of utility-scale solar energy tend to express a higher degree of support for adopting such projects within their community. Individuals' attitudes are more responsive to the negative information treatment. Notably, there are significant differences between public officials and the general population in attitudes and responsiveness to information treatments. We also find that landowners' support for utility-scale solar projects is unlikely to change regardless of knowledge levels, while non-landowners show increased support with higher levels of knowledge. This study provides insights for developing context-specific outreach programs to enhance public awareness and support for utility-scale solar projects and promote future solar development.",Not About Sufficiency
SUPPORTING SUSTAINABILITY AND REDUCING INEQUALITY: IS THERE A CONFLICT BETWEEN THEM?,"This paper explores the relationship between inequality and sustainability both of which are dominant considerations today. Inequality was an important preoccupation of Kaldor, although he was not concerned with sustainability, as this has only recently become an all-important issue. The paper identifies relevant criteria for determining the desirable distribution of incomes from a sustainability perspective, including considerations of justice and of instrumentality. It concludes that justice demands much greater equality of emissions (and incomes) among individuals, given that the total ""safe"" global emissions of carbon dioxide are limited. Instrumental considerations are not so clear-cut, as evidence suggests that sometimes greater inequality leads to reduced emissions. However, meta considerations, including motivations for pursuing economic growth and conditions likely to realise international agreements on restraining emissions, suggest that more equality within and between countries is needed to promote sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Surrogate-Assisted Modeling and Robust Optimization of a Micro Gas Turbine Plant With Carbon Capture,"The growing share of wind and solar power in the total energy mix has caused severe problems in balancing the electrical power production. Consequently, in the future, all fossil fuel-based electricity generation will need to be run on a completely flexible basis. Microgas turbines (mGTs) constitute a mature technology which can offer such flexibility. Even though their greenhouse gas emissions are already very low, stringent carbon reduction targets will require them to be completely carbon neutral: this constraint implies the adoption of postcombustion carbon capture (CC) on these energy systems. Despite this attractive solution, an in-depth study along with a robust optimization of this system has not yet been carried out. Hence, in this paper, a typical mGT with exhaust gas recirculation has been coupled with an amine-based CC plant and simulated using the software ASPEN PLUS. A rigorous rate-based simulation of the CO2 absorption and desorption in the CC unit offers an accurate prediction; however, its time complexity and convergence difficulty are severe limitations for a stochastic optimization. Therefore, a surrogate-based optimization approach has been used, which makes use of a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model, trained using the ASPEN PLUS data, to quickly find operating points of the plant at a very low computational cost. Using the validated surrogate model, a stochastic optimization has been carried out. As a general result, the analyzed power plant proves to be intrinsically very robust, even when the input variables are affected by strong uncertainties.",Not About Sufficiency
The environmental impact of lightweight body in white structures in vehicle manufacturing,"The quest for sustainability and reduction of human impact on the planet has led to discussions about environmental efficiency in the manufacture and use of automotive vehicles. The advancement of environmental and government laws has encouraged the automotive industry to seek constant improvements in safety, fuel economy and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve these goals, reducing the weight of vehicles has been considered a relevant strategy, with several research and development efforts in search of high-tech materials and innovative design. The assessment of the life cycle of vehicles, from the extraction of raw materials to the end of their useful life, is essential for estimating environmental impacts. In this context, this paper focuses on the life cycle analysis of vehicles with new generation steel structures (Body in White Solution) compared to current steels (Body in White Baseline), aiming at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by reducing of the thickness of the steel plates, maintaining the mechanical properties necessary to guarantee the safety of the vehicle. The methodology of this study was divided into the evaluation of Body in White (BIW) mass in current steels (Baseline) and in advanced high resistance steels (Solution); detailing the vehicular life cycle from the extraction of materials to its end of life; in the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions through simulation and in the comparison of vehicle emissions with BIW in current steels and in advanced high resistance steels. As a result, it was possible to observe that, in the comparison of the CO 2 footprint, modeled in the Eco Audit, there is a 15% reduction in emissions in the CO 2 footprint for the BIW solution, as well as a 7% reduction in the C eq total , in the on -site test and a saving of 260.40 L in fuel consumption, that is, the reduction in vehicle weight plays a significant role in reducing CO 2 emissions, providing a mitigation factor for global warming.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability assessment and carbon budget of chemical stabilization based multi-objective remediation of Cd contaminated paddy field,"The feasibility of chemical stabilization-based strategy for extensive field application is under debate due to lacking a proper framework for its sustainability assessment during its life cycle. Herein, a comprehensive framework consisting of crop production, soil quality, and carbon footprintwas constructed for assessing agricultural land remediation based on a two-year paddy field trial. Results showthat between the two representative agents, biochar scenario substantially benefits for environmental, social, and agricultural sustainability, because of its more positive impacts on human health and ecosystem, public acceptance, soil reproductive, and rice yield. A notably higher sustainability score of 80.7 for biochar scenario than that of 47.0 for lime is found, in spite of the economical sustainability of lime. The net ecosystem carbon budget of the biochar scenario exhibits an unprecedentedly positive value of 17.8 t CO2-eq ha(-1), which can finely contribute to a positive carbon budget during remediation. Our finding demonstrates that biochar strategy enables a multi-objective achievement of soil quality - crop production - carbon budget during agricultural land remediation.

Sixteen key evaluation indicators were identified using the Delphi method, with the novel inclusion of a carbon emission reduction target achievement indicator, thereby promoting the goal of carbon neutrality in green buildings. To determine a more reasonable weight distribution, this paper combined the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process(fuzzy AHP) with the entropy weight method. Additionally, the study employed a fuzzy matter-element method enhanced by genetic algorithms for precise evaluation of green building construction sustainability.

Sustainability in Membrane Technology: Membrane Recycling and Fabrication Using Recycled Waste,"Membrane technology has shown a promising role in combating water scarcity, a globally faced challenge. However, the disposal of end-of-life membrane modules is problematic as the current practices include incineration and landfills as their final fate. In addition, the increase in population and lifestyle advancement have significantly enhanced waste generation, thus overwhelming landfills and exacerbating environmental repercussions and resource scarcity. These practices are neither economically nor environmentally sustainable. Recycling membranes and utilizing recycled material for their manufacturing is seen as a potential approach to address the aforementioned challenges. Depending on physiochemical conditions, the end-of-life membrane could be reutilized for similar, upgraded, and downgraded operations, thus extending the membrane lifespan while mitigating the environmental impact that occurred due to their disposal and new membrane preparation for similar purposes. Likewise, using recycled waste such as polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, tire rubber, keratin, and cellulose and their derivates for fabricating the membranes can significantly enhance environmental sustainability. This study advocates for and supports the integration of sustainability concepts into membrane technology by presenting the research carried out in this area and rigorously assessing the achieved progress. The membranes' recycling and their fabrication utilizing recycled waste materials are of special interest in this work.

"Sustainability, Self-Identity and the Sociology of Consumption","In order to develop a more nuanced model of consumer behaviour and the dynamics of behavioural change, this paper argues, the discourse of sustainable consumption needs to draw more fully upon the sociological literature addressing consumption, its varied drivers, and the complex roles it plays within contemporary life. Since its revival in the 1980s, the sociology of consumption has largely focused on the ways in which everyday consumption choices in affluent societies facilitate the process of creating and sustaining a 'self-identity'. While the literature in this field is not without its own flaws, framing sustainable consumption in relation to the problem of self-identity enables us to confront not only the psycho-cultural factors that maintain demand for material goods, but also the difficulties faced by ordinary people as they try to understand and respond ethically to large-scale social and ecological problems within an everyday environment that is highly commodified and individualized.

Despite growing attention among economic geographers and regional scientists to either green or inclusive regional development approaches, how to reconcile environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness in highly challenged left-behind places remains poorly understood. This editorial reflects on and critically discusses the literature on left-behind places and distils unifying conceptual characteristics of left-behindness. We argue that left-behindness is a temporal, relational, multidimensional, discursive, but not deterministic concept.

This article presents an empirical study of the well-being dividend among communities of ""zero waste"" in Chinese cities. Using 45 in-depth interviews and virtual ethnography of zero-waste practitioners, I explore how sustainable consumption could satisfy multiple human needs and enhance individual and collective well-being. This research highlights the significance of lifestyle communities in processes of needs fulfillment and points to how contemporary societies could enable sustainable needs fulfillment by giving special protections to synergic need satisfiers-starting by allowing green communities to flourish and thrive. Further, through the concept of ""teleoaffective regimes,"" this article brings to light how concerns over well-being give rise to shared ends, goals, and emotions within communities, hinting at the importance of engaging with people's core pursuit of well-being in sustainability transformations. Finally, the vast majority of studies on sustainable well-being have focused on Western countries. By contrast, this work provides insights into this topic from China and raises critical questions about the dynamics between growth, consumption, and well-being in developing nations.

Sustainable development and health assessment model of higher education in India: A mathematical modeling approach,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 has resulted in a transition from physical education to online learning, leading to a collapse of the established educational order and a wisdom test for the education governance system. As a country seriously affected by the pandemic, the health of the Indian higher education system urgently requires assessment to achieve sustainable development and maximize educational externalities. This research systematically proposes a health assessment model from four perspectives, including educational volume, efficiency, equality, and sustainability, by employing the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution Model, Principal Component Analysis, DEA-Tobit Model, and Augmented Solow Model. Empirical results demonstrate that India has high efficiency and an absolute health score in the higher education system through multiple comparisons between India and the other selected countries while having certain deficiencies in equality and sustainability. Additionally, single-target and multiple-target path are simultaneously proposed to enhance the Indian current education system. The multiple-target approach of the India-China-Japan-Europe-USA process is more feasible to achieve sustainable development, which would improve the overall health score from.351 to .716. This finding also reveals that the changes are relatively complex and would take 91.5 years considering the relationship between economic growth rates and crucial indicators.

"Sustainable energy solutions: Well retrofit analysis and emission reduction for a net-zero future in the Intermountain West, United States of America","To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, we need economic means of sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2) and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). We analyze the sequestration potential of the Intermountain West (IWest) region, US, as a primary energy transition hub through analysis of wellbore retrofit potential and emission reduction in both fugitive gas abatement and flare gas. We selected the I-West region due to its abundant energy sources and oil and gas production legacy. Preliminary analysis hints that well retrofits can breathe new life into a well at a fraction of the cost of a new drill. With millions of potential candidates in the US, even a modest fraction (1% or less) suitable for retrofit could accelerate the shift to large-scale CO2 sequestration. Fugitive gas, the unintentional release of wellbore gases such as methane, is a significant emissions source. Through conservative analysis, it is estimated that wellhead leakage alone may account for 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions. We conclude by assessing the CO2 emissions from flaring, which is the burning of associated gas during well operations, conservative analysis indicates flaring contributes another 2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions to the region. We find that with targeted retrofit and better controls on emissions sources, the I-West region can make a significant impact in the nation's push to become net-zero.

The aim of this paper is to create a practical framework for developing sustainable land use scenarios that has direct policy relevance. The framework was created and tested in a pen-urban area, Rocky Point in South-East Queensland, Australia. The framework, which is driven by participatory processes and consists of an iterative combination of three steps: context assessment, decision structuring and decision analysis. The participatory process involved a range of actors engaged through steering committees, public meetings, focus groups, questionnaires and interviews. The outputs from these activities were four landscape scale scenarios which were sustainably assessed by an impact matrix and equity matrix (relating to a dendrogram of coalition). Critically, these outputs also identified the possible formation of three new social alliances amongst key local actors considered necessary for the manifestation of any of the future scenarios. Application of this framework demonstrated its usefulness to inform policy by outcomes already being included in current policy documents. Additionally, the framework will inform future scenario developers by including: (i) a flexible participatory process able to respond to local contextual needs; (ii) capability to identify 'triggers for change' by actors to delineate alternate scenarios; and (iii) development of 'enabling policies' as part of the participatory process, to move towards target scenarios.

Sustainable microalgal biomass valorization to bioenergy: Key challenges and future perspectives,"The global trend is shifting toward circular economy systems. It is a sustainable environmental approach that sustains economic growth from the use of resources while minimizing environmental impacts. The multiple industrial use of microalgal biomass has received great attention due to its high content of essential nutrients and elements. Nevertheless, low biomass productivity, unbalanced carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio, resistant cellular constituents, and the high cost of microalgal harvesting represent the major obstacles for valorization of algal biomass. In recent years, microalgae biomass has been a candidate as a potential feedstock for different bioenergy generation processes with simultaneous treating wastewater and CO2 capture. An overview of the appealing features and needed advancements is urgently essential for microalgae-derived bioenergy generation. The present review provides a timely outlook and evaluation of biomethane production from microalgal biomass and related challenges. Moreover, the biogas recovery potential from microalgal biomass through different pretreatments and synergistic anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) with other biowastes are evaluated. In addition, the removal of micropollutants and heavy metals by microalgal cells via adsorption and bioaccumulation in their biomass is discussed. Herein, a comprehensive review is presented about a successive high-throughput for anaerobic digestion (AD) of the microalgal biomass in order to achieve for sustainable energy source. Lastly, the valorization of the digestate from AD of microalgae for agricultural reuse is highlighted.",Not About Sufficiency
SUSTAINABLE SOCIAL POLICIES IN AN ERA OF GLOBALISATION: LESSONS FROM THE SWEDISH CASE,"The welfare state is challenged by the globalisabon of the world economy and by the fact that ageing populations demand more redistribution. To promote political and social sustainability in this context, the ""destructive"" forces of market competition have to be met by ""constructive"" social policies In Europe, the Scandinavian countries are the best performers in combining inequality reductions with high employment rates and excellent growth records. A framework for reform inspired by this starts from the notion that in order to be successful in meeting new needs with restricted resources we must improve incentives, human resources, social services and employment opportunities The ageing of our societies means we also need to rethink our policies in other ways. The discussion has, however, been unduly focused on pension reforms and savings to ensure future living standards for the elderly. Instead, we should focus more on how social policy interacts with education, fertility and other fundamental determinants of the future tax base. In order to design social policies that are sustainable for the future, we need to put our children and youth first The Swedish case is relevant here, with its institutions that promote gender balance and investment in life-long learning. We should, however, make sure that we base our policy recommendations not on wishful thinking but on a knowledge-based and realistic assessment of how the world works.",Not About Sufficiency

Sustainable urban landscapes: South African perspectives on transdisciplinary possibilities,"The development of sustainable urban landscapes challenges all stakeholders, including local governments as the major custodians thereof. The majority of urban ecological research done describes European and North American cities. South Africa's position in the global South underlines the potential that local research has in contributing to global knowledge. South African urban landscapes are rich in biodiversity and characterized by cultural diversity and steep socio-economic gradients. Spatial inequality, specifically access to resources and green areas, greatly influences the perceived importance and need of urban green space to citizens and policy makers. This legacy is a major challenge to the implementation of sustainability oriented contemporary urban planning and environmental management practices in South Africa. Sustainable solutions call for transdisciplinary approaches, in which the contributions of both non-academic and academic role players are integrated. Therefore, we investigated the possible interface between urban ecology, urban planning, and environmental management, within current policy and legislation frameworks and within practice in South Africa. We highlight certain aspects of the three disciplines that could contribute to transdisciplinary planning approaches, such as mapping and valuation of ecosystem services, strategic and integrated thinking, prediction and scenario building, governance, and decision-making and participatory planning. We believe that awareness of the major contributions of each discipline would refine the linkages between social and ecological issues proposed by several existing conceptual frameworks, leading to a transdisciplinary approach to plan for sustainable urban landscapes. The South African perspective presented in this paper could guide other (similar) global scenarios with regard to transdisciplinary planning approaches that could enhance the development of sustainable urban landscapes.

Sustainable valorization of semiconductor industry tantalum scrap using non-hazardous HF substitute lixiviant,"Global tantalum production from mines averages 1800 tons per year and hardly increases, but demand for tantalum in the electronics industry consistently increasing. Globally, 50% of total tantalum produced is being used for tantalum capacitors manufacturing, almost all demand from various industries is mainly met by primary resources only. Tantalum production and supply predominantly dominated by Congo and Rwanda which accounts for > 50%, add disadvantages for the strategic and economic competitiveness of other nations. To address the monopoly dominated by Congo and Rwanda, and the disparity of tantalum primary reserve, exploitation of secondary resources can alternatively address the drawbacks of primary resource distribution. Currently, hardly < 1% of tantalum getting recycled, and the poor recycling rate of tantalum is mainly contributed by the lack of efficient and sustainable valorization technology for recycling tantalum-bearing scraps like electronic capacitors and semiconductor industry tantalum scrap. In the current investigation, a sustainable tantalum extraction process from scrap dominated by hydrometallurgical route has been developed. Tantalum scrap which is passive to leach for tantalum recovery was calcinated for oxidation of TaN content and followed by tantalum has been leached using a mixture of NaF and HCl, a specially developed novel lixiviant for the purpose as an HF substituent. Calcination process parameter like temperature and time requirement for oxidation was optimized varying one parameter at a time. Then, the efficient leaching condition was optimized for quantitative leaching of tantalum. The process can achieve 99.99% efficient leaching, the process can successfully be applied for feasible industrial-scale tantalum scrap recycling. The HF substituent lixiviant can add advantages to overcome occupational and industrial operation safety challenges associated with HF lixiviant. The reported valorization process can be a sustainable tantalum recycling process that simultaneously can address UNO sustainable development goal, WEEE directive, and UNEP E-Waste Management goal.",Not About Sufficiency

Synchrony matters more than species richness in plant community stability at a global scale,"The stability of ecological communities is critical for the stable provisioning of ecosystem services, such as food and forage production, carbon sequestration, and soil fertility. Greater biodiversity is expected to enhance stability across years by decreasing synchrony among species, but the drivers of stability in nature remain poorly resolved. Our analysis of time series from 79 datasets across the world showed that stability was associated more strongly with the degree of synchrony among dominant species than with species richness. The relatively weak influence of species richness is consistent with theory predicting that the effect of richness on stability weakens when synchrony is higher than expected under random fluctuations, which was the case in most communities. Land management, nutrient addition, and climate change treatments had relatively weak and varying effects on stability, modifying how species richness, synchrony, and stability interact. Our results demonstrate the prevalence of biotic drivers on ecosystem stability, with the potential for environmental drivers to alter the intricate relationship among richness, synchrony, and stability.",Not About Sufficiency
Synergistic Integration of Carbon Quantum Dots in Biopolymer Matrices: An Overview of Current Advancements in Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Active Packaging,"Approximately one-third of the world's food production, i.e., 1.43 billion tons, is wasted annually, resulting in economic losses of nearly USD 940 billion and undermining food system sustainability. This waste depletes resources, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and negatively affects food security and prices. Although traditional packaging preserves food quality, it cannot satisfy the demands of extended shelf life, safety, and sustainability. Consequently, active packaging using biopolymer matrices containing antioxidants and antimicrobials is a promising solution. This review examines the current advancements in the integration of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) into biopolymer-based active packaging, focusing on their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. CQDs provide unique advantages over traditional nanoparticles and natural compounds, including high biocompatibility, tunable surface functionality, and environmental sustainability. This review explores the mechanisms through which CQDs impart antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, their synthesis methods, and their functionalization to optimize the efficacy of biopolymer matrices. Recent studies have highlighted that CQD-enhanced biopolymers maintain biodegradability with enhanced antioxidant and antimicrobial functions. Additionally, potential challenges, such as toxicity, regulatory considerations, and scalability are discussed, offering insights into future research directions and industrial applications. This review demonstrates the potential of CQD-incorporated biopolymer matrices to transform active packaging, aligning with sustainability goals and advancing food preservation technologies.",Not About Sufficiency
Systematic review of gender differences and similarities in online consumers' shopping behavior,"Purpose This study aims to systematically examine gender specific behavioral differences and similarities in online shopping consumers, underlying theories for such differences and similarities and moderating and mediating roles of gender in studying the effects of online marketing strategies. This synthesis explores gender differences and similarities from a wide range of online settings, including readiness for adoption of new technology, willingness to make online payments, trust in online vendors, perception and behavior toward online business websites and perceived online service quality. Design/methodology/approach A systematic approach was adopted to derive and then analyze the existing literature. The authors accessed relevant literature from three electronic databases. After a thorough screening process and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study shortlisted 61 academic articles from an initial pool of 187 papers. Findings The findings reveal more differences than similarities between men and women as online consumers. Men generally have more favorable attitudes toward e-tailers (electronic retailing), online purchase/re-purchase and e-payments than women do. Social influences positively affect the online purchase intentions of men and women, but they have a more substantial effect on women. Privacy concerns negatively affect the online trust of men and women, but they also manifest a more significant influence on women. Practical implications Findings of review guide practitioners in formulating effective positioning and communication strategies that enable them to appeal to gender-specific consumer segments in multiple products and business contexts. It offers guidelines to online businesses for developing e-business platforms (websites) that persuade the target audience across gender groups, based on consumer browsing and web navigation preferences.

Targeting payments for forest carbon sequestration given ecological and economic objectives,"We identify optimal spatial targets for payments for forest carbon sequestration under the multiple objectives of maximizing forest carbon storage cost efficiency and maximizing economic impacts of payments. A further purpose is to evaluate the tradeoff between the two objectives. These objectives are used as targeting criteria in our case study of the Central and Southern Appalachian Region of the United States, a heavily forested, low-income region that could benefit from payments for forest carbon sequestration. The concave-shaped Pareto optimal frontiers between forest carbon storage and economic impacts triggered by payments provide evidence that the increase in economic impacts is relatively higher than the sacrifice in forest carbon benefits when the initial weight assigned to economic impacts is relatively lower than the initial weight assigned to forest carbon benefits and vice versa. Our projections of county-level forest carbon storage and economic impacts can help conservation agencies anticipate regional heterogeneity in forest carbon storage and economic impacts and access their tradeoffs.",Not About Sufficiency

"Technical, allocative, and total profit efficiency of loblolly pine forests under changing climatic conditions","Forest ecosystem services (ES) provide significant value to society. Without means to adequately capture that value, societal ES values have little influence on landowners' management decisions, leading to inefficiencies in forest-based ES provision. To understand these inefficiencies, we employ data envelopment analysis (DEA) to assess three types of efficiency - technical, allocative and total profit - of planted pine forests using loblolly pine (Pines taeda L.) in the Southern US as an example. Field data from n = 28 plots are used to assess stand level efficiency in the production of timber, carbon sequestration, and species richness considering inputs such as site index, age and number of trees, precipitation and temperatures. Given the impacts of climate change on key inputs, we also assess efficiency under climate scenarios representing moderate (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emissions pathways. We find that 96% of forest plots are technically efficient in providing timber, carbon sequestration and species richness and 75% are allocative or total profit efficient With climate change, allocative or total profit efficiency remains similar to the initial conditions, and total profit substantially increases (42.8% and 45.6% for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). These findings highlight the increasingly important role that forests play in providing sodally valuable ES. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Techno-economics of lignocellulose biorefineries at South African sugar mills using the biofine process to co-produce levulinic acid, furfural and electricity along with gamma valeractone","Lignocellulose biorefineries process biomass into 'green' chemicals and bioenergy and play a key role in sustainable bio-economies. Using sugarcane bagasse and trash feedstocks, biorefineries were simulated in Aspen Plus (R) v 8.6 to generate mass and energy balances. Four scenarios with electricity and furfural as common products were generated. Scenario A in addition produced high volume, low value levulinic acid whilst scenarios B1 and B2 generated low volume, high value levulinic acid at varied feedstock capacities. Scenario C produced low volume, high value levulinic acid and bulk gamma valerolactone. The four biorefineries were also compared to a combined heat and power plant that only produced steam and electricity. Aspen Plus (R) Economic Analyser and a discounted cash flow rate of return methodology were used to determine the economic feasibility of the bioenergy self-sufficient biorefineries annexed to a conventional South African sugar mill. Levulinic acid production via the Biofine process makes economic sense when produced for niche markets, due to the anticipated decrease in market prices when production volumes increase. Scenario (C) co-producing a low volume of levulinic acid (0.15 t h(-1)) together with 3.3 t h(-1) furfural, electricity (14 MWh) and 6.8 t h(-1) gamma valerolactone, was the most profitable.

Techno-environmental assessment of methanol production using chemical looping technologies,"In light of the growing energy demand, fossil fuels (e.g., coal, gas or crude oil) continue to play an essential role in meeting the world's energy requirements. Methanol shows great potential both as an energy carrier or as a building block for several products including methyl tert-butyl ether, dimethyl ether, formaldehyde, acetic acid, etc. The current research focuses on methanol production via CO2 hydrogenation since it is the technology with the largest development perspective at commercial scale. The much-needed H2 and CO2 are obtained using chemical looping technologies involving calcium oxide (CaO), iron oxide (Fe2O3), and CaO-CuO as oxygen carriers. The proposed technologies are compared against conventional technology involving the steam methane reforming process for H2 generation, as well against green methanol production (i.e., electrolytic H2 generation using renewable sources). CHEMCAD software is employed to perform the modelling and simulation aspects with all investigated scenarios considering a daily production capacity of 2400 tons of methanol. The environmental analysis is carried out based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology using mass and energy balance data retrieved from process modelling and simulation section. One ton of methanol is set as functional unit. Based on the technical evaluation, even though sorption enhanced reforming (SER) configuration provides the highest H2 efficiency (78.62 %), the iron-based chemical looping (CLH) system offers higher carbon capture rate with similar efficiency (76.61 %). Green methanol manufacturing scores best, getting the lowest effect score in eight out of twelve impact categories; yet, its performance is heavily dependent on the availability of renewable power sources. Of the looping technologies, the use of iron-based chemical looping has the least negative effects in eight of them, including global warming potential (GWP), fossil depletion potential (FDP) and freshwater eutrophication potential (FEP). It is found that, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, direct methanol synthesis using chemical looping technology proves competitive against the traditional natural gas approach.",Not About Sufficiency

TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION ON THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE NETWORK,"Technological innovations generate knowledge spillovers-non-innovators benefit through the adoption, imitation, and extension of new technologies. International trade facilitates technology diffusion by providing importing countries access to technical knowledge that they can potentially internalize. Previous studies of the effect of trade on technology diffusion typically only consider the impact of direct (bilateral) trade on indirect measures of technology (e.g., total factor productivity). We contend that the analysis of trade's impact on technology diffusion would be more accurately assessed by using direct measures of specific technologies (e.g., intensity levels) and by allowing for the influence of both the direct and indirect effects of trade in the analysis. The latter is accomplished by modeling the international trade system as a weighted network, which quantifies both direct and indirect trade linkages. Combining trade data with data on the adoption of specific technologies, we find that the network effects of trade play a significant role in technology diffusion. In most cases, countries that are better-connected on the trade network have higher technology intensities. Further support for the importance of trade is provided by the finding that for ""outdated"" technologies, better-connected countries have lower technology intensities because of their adoption of newer, substitute technologies.",Not About Sufficiency
TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF LAND USE AND ITS DRIVERS IN THE DONGTING LAKE REGION (2000-2020),"Land use change is a complex process driven by a range of socio-economic and environmental factors. This study investigates the temporal and spatial dynamics of land use change in the Dongting Lake Region of China from 2000 to 2020. Using remote sensing data and advanced modeling techniques, including binary-logistic regression and cellular automaton (CA)-Markov models, the patterns and drivers of land use change in the region were analyzed. It was found that construction land expanded rapidly at the expense of agricultural land, while forest and grassland areas experienced moderate declines. These changes are primarily driven by topographic factors such as slope and elevation, as well as socio-economic factors such as population density and gross domestic product (GDP). Based on these findings, an optimized spatial configuration of land use, derived through an overlay analysis, was obtained under the ecological security framework. This configuration was informed by the simulation results of land use under the CA-Markov model and the optimized zoning results formed by the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model. This study projects future land use patterns in the region up to 2035 and identifies key areas for ecological conservation and sustainable land management.

Temporal Dynamics of CO2 Fluxes over a Non-Irrigated Vineyard,"Some knowledge gaps still remain regarding carbon sequestration in non-irrigated agroecosystems, where plants may experience drought stress during summertime. Therefore, by the combination of the eddy covariance (EC) and soil chamber techniques, we determined the role of a non-irrigated grassed vineyard in carbon sequestration in the Slovak Republic. Based on the EC data, the cumulative net uptake of CO2 (NEE) for the whole growing season was weak and was ca. -97 (g C m(-2)). This value resulted from -796 (g C m(-2)) carbon uptake from the atmosphere through photosynthesis (GEE) and 699 (g C m(-2)) carbon released to the atmosphere through respiration (Reco). Carbon emissions through Reco were considerable and accounted for ca. 88% of GEE, which points out the importance of Reco for managing non-irrigated agroecosystems. Data from the soil chamber indicated that ca. 302 g C m(-2) was released by the vineyard through soil respiration (Rsoil) over a growing season, which was constantly lower than Reco and accounted for ca. 44 +/- 18% of Reco. This finding implies that the vineyard soil was not a main source of carbon emissions. Rsoil was mainly driven by temperature (exponentially ca. 69-85%). Meanwhile, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature appeared to be the most important limiting factors for GEE, NEE, and Reco, particularly when they exceeded a certain threshold (e.g., temperature > 17 degrees C, and VPD > 10 hPa).",Not About Sufficiency
"Temporal trends in respiratory mortality and short-term effects of air pollutants in Shenyang, China","Short-term exposures to air pollution are associated with acute effects on respiratory health. This study aimed to describe 10-year temporal trends in respiratory mortality in the urban areas of Shenyang, China, according to gender and age and estimate the effects of air pollution on respiratory diseases (ICD-10J00-J99) and lung cancer (ICD-10 C33-C34) using a case-crossover design. During the study period 2013-2015, the exposure-response relationship between ambient air pollutants and mortality data was fitted by a quasi-Poisson model. Age-standardized mortality rates for a combined number of respiratory diseases and for lung cancer declined in Shenyang; however, death counts increased with aging. Deaths from respiratory diseases increased by 4.7% (95% CI, 0.00-9.9), and lung cancer mortality increased by 6.5% (95% CI, 1.2-12.0), both associated with a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in exposure to particulate matter < 2.5 mu g in diameter (PM2.5). Moreover, males in Shenyang's urban areas were more susceptible to the acute effects of PM2.5 and SO2 exposure; people aged >= 65 years had a high susceptibility to ozone, and those aged < 65 years were more susceptible to other air pollutants. These results provided an updated estimate of the short-term effects of air pollution in Shenyang.

"Terrestrial carbon sequestration under future climate, nutrient and land use change and management scenarios: a national-scale UK case study","Carbon sequestration (C-seq) in soils and plant biomass is viewed as an important means of mitigating climate change. Recent global assessments have estimated considerable potential for terrestrial C-seq, but generally lack sensitivity to climate warming, nutrient limitations and perspective on local land use. These are important factors since higher temperatures can accelerate the decomposition of soil organic matter, nutrient availability affects plant productivity, while land use pressures put broader constraints on terrestrial organic matter inputs and storage. Here, we explore the potential for C-seq under changing land use, climate and nutrient conditions in a UK-based national scale case study. We apply an integrated terrestrial C-N-P cycle model with representative ranges of high-resolution climate and land use scenarios to estimate C-seq potential across the UK. If realistic UK targets for grassland restoration and afforestation over the next 30 years are met, we estimate that an additional 120 TgC could be sequestered by 2100 (similar to current annual UK greenhouse gas emissions or roughly 7% of net emission cuts needed in meeting net zero), conditional on climate change of <2 degrees C. Conversely, we estimate that UK arable expansion would reduce terrestrial carbon storage by a similar magnitude. The most pessimistic climate trajectories are predicted to cause net losses in UK soil carbon storage under all land use scenarios. Warmer climates substantially reduce the potential total terrestrial carbon storage gains offered by afforestation and grassland restoration. We conclude that although concerted land use change could make an important moderate contribution to national level C-seq for countries like the UK, soil C-seq only provides a contribution if we are on a low emission pathway, and is therefore conditional on deep global cuts to emissions from fossil fuels, deforestation and soil degradation.",Not About Sufficiency
"The ""Bury your Gays"" trope in contemporary television: Generational shifts in production responses to audience dissent","""Bury Your Gays"" is the popular name used to describe the common television trope in which characters who are ostensibly gender- or sexually-diverse are denied happy endings or ""killed off"". Widespread online commentary among audiences reacting to incidents of ""Bury Your Gays"" are indicative of a public concern over the repetitiveness of this trope in contemporary popular culture. This paper investigates the cultural frameworks through which television producers respond to audience anger at ""Bury Your Gays"" incidents in order to provide a production perspective to scholarship on the topic. We compare two cases separated by a generation: the 2002 case of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the 2016 case of The 100. We argue that the difference in responses is indicative of (i) a solidification of the producer-audience relationship since the advent of social media; (ii) the further embedding of a transactional approach to viewership in which ""queerbaiting"" is considered ""false advertising"" and (iii) the growth of cancel culture which fosters expectations that television representation will align with positive depictions and socially-progressive cultural values. The paper argues that these cultural shifts underscore the way in which producers respond, no longer justifying the death of a queer character based on narrative need, but now balanced with attention to audience identity and social demand.",Not About Sufficiency
The amenity value of climate to households in Germany,"Despite the importance of as comprehensive as possible damage cost estimates to cost benefit analyses of global attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, few researchers have attempted to monetize the direct impact of climate change on households. This study uses the hedonic technique to measure the amenity value of the climate to German households. Evidence suggests that the amenity value of climate variables is capitalized mainly into hedonic house price differentials. Overall, German households appear to prefer warmer winters with less rainfall. Combining estimates of amenity values with the predicted changes in climate associated with the IPCCs A2 emissions scenario we find that the overall impact of climate change on German households, whilst negative, is typically not statistically different from zero. This occurs in part because the prediction is for warmer but wetter winters and also because the amenity value of some climate variables cannot be measured with sufficient precision.",Not About Sufficiency

Methods Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 on adults aged 18 years and older were analysed (n = 10 723). Primary predictors were overall food security (food-secure/ food-insecure) and household food security (full, marginal, low and very low). The main outcome was any untreated dental caries (none/ >= one). Multiple logistic regression analyses were done to estimate the adjusted odds ratio after controlling for confounders. Results Food-insecure adults were more likely to have untreated dental caries than food-secure adults after adjusting for potential confounders (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 0.9-1.5). Adults from households with marginal (OR:1.4; 95% CI:1.5-2.2), low (OR:1.3, 95% CI:1.3-2.0) and very low food security (OR:1.3; 95% CI:0.9-1.5) had higher odds of untreated caries than adults from households with full food security. Following age stratification, marginal, low and very low food-secure adults had higher prevalence of untreated dental caries than full food-secure adults across all age groups. Conclusions Our findings suggest that food-insecure adults had higher odds of untreated dental caries than food-secure adults.

Structures of global governance can be reinforced through greater subsidiarity; that is, by enhancing the participation of local authorities, by the involvement of civil society and the private sector and by regionalising initiatives, where appropriate. Furthermore, globalisation's scope should be extended to comprise the shared governance of all global public goods and elements affecting human security. This essay outlines how this transformation could work for the four policy areas of global trade, food security, public health and climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
The challenge of population aging for mitigating deaths from PM2.5 air pollution in China,"Estimating the health burden of air pollution against the background of population aging is of great significance for achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 3.9 which aims to substantially reduce the deaths and illnesses from air pollution. Here, we estimated spatiotemporal changes in deaths attributable to PM2.5 air pollution in China from 2000 to 2035 and examined the drivers. The results show that from 2019 to 2035, deaths were projected to decease 15.4% (6.6%-20.7%, 95% CI) and 8.4% (0.6%-13.5%) under the SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenario, respectively, but increase 10.4% (5.1%-20.5%) and 18.1% (13.0%-28.3%) under SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios. Population aging will be the leading contributor to increased deaths attributable to PM2.5 air pollution, which will counter the positive gains achieved by improvements in air pollution and healthcare. Region-specific measures are required to mitigate the health burden of air pollution and this requires long-term efforts and mutual cooperation among regions in China. Estimating health burden of air pollution against the background of population aging is of significance for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3.9. Here, the authors show that population aging is expected to be the leading contributor to increased deaths attributable to PM2.5 in China by 2035, which will counter the positive gains achieved by improvements in air pollution and healthcare.",Not About Sufficiency
The Commodification of Chinese in Thailand's Linguistic Market: A Case Study of How Language Education Promotes Social Sustainability,"In recent decades, the commodification of the English language has aroused intensive research interest in the sociolinguistics on a global scale, but studies on the commodification of the Chinese language are relatively rare. Most studies take a critical approach in relation to its adverse impacts on minority rights and social justice. This study examined the language landscape in Chiangmai, Thailand, and the linguistic beliefs of local Thai Chinese language learners. Based on their feedback, this study investigated the commodification of Chinese language education in the community of Chinese language learners in Chiangmai. We found that from a less critical perspective, the commodification of a second language provides more accessible and affordable educational opportunities for learners, especially those from low-income families, and at the same time language proficiency can broaden learners' career choices and provide employees with additional value in industries, such as tourism, commerce, and services. This finding implies that language commodification, rather than typically being associated with linguistic imperialism and unbalanced socio-economic status, can be a contributing factor in promoting higher-education availability and social sustainability in certain circumstances. There may be some mediating factors between the commodification of language and changes in the sustainable balance of language, opening up space for future research to explore.",Not About Sufficiency
The Consequences of a Grabbing Hand: Five Selected Ways in Which Corruption Affects the Economy,"This article provides a survey of the existing literature on the effects of corruption on economic growth, foreign direct investment, income inequality, human development, and natural resources sector. Both the theoretical arguments and the empirical evidence are considered. It is found that: i) Several studies support a negative impact of corruption on growth (sand the wheel hypothesis), but there are also studies supporting a positive impact (grease the wheels hypothesis); ii) Concerning the impact of corruption on foreign direct investment, the evidence is also mixed since there are studies supporting a negative effect (the ""grabbing hand"" view), a positive effect (the ""helping hand"" view), and even no significant effect; iii) The great majority of studies find that corruption generates more income inequality, although some studies find an inverse relationship in regions where the informal sector is large; iv) There is a strong consensus regarding that corruption hampers human development by affecting aspects like poverty, education and health; v) Most of studies show that there is a direct association between corruption and the natural resources sector, especially in the mining, oil and gas industries. In addition, research challenges of economics of corruption in aspects like the definition of corruption, multidisciplinary perspective, econometric specification, and data issues are discussed.",Not About Sufficiency
The contribution of forest carbon credit projects to addressing the climate change challenge,"This article addresses the question of how forestry projects, given the recently improved standards for the accounting of carbon sequestration, can benefit from existing and emerging carbon markets in the world. For a long time, forestry projects have been set up for the purpose of generating carbon credits. They were surrounded by uncertainties about the permanence of carbon sequestration in trees, potential replacement of deforestation due to projects (leakage), and how and what to measure as sequestered carbon. Through experience with Joint Implementation (JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) forestry projects, albeit limited, and with forestry projects in voluntary carbon markets, considerable improvements have been made with accounting of carbon sequestration in forests, resulting in a more solid basis for carbon credit trading. The scope of selling these credits exists both in compliance markets, although currently with strong limitations, and in voluntary markets for offsetting emissions with carbon credits. Improved carbon accounting methods for forestry investments can also enhance the scope for forestry in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that countries must prepare under the Paris Agreement.",Not About Sufficiency
The contribution of traditional-homegardens to bird conservation in human-modified landscapes,"Traditional-homegardens are important for the food security, economy, and culture of rural communities, but also contributing to biodiversity conservation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of traditional-homegardens as a refuge for birds, how the birds used them, and which of their attributes were associated with the frequency of bird visits. We compared the percentage of visits among groups of birds by habitat preference. Also, we compared the frequency of visits to different vegetation strata and the use that birds made within traditional-homegardens (forage, perching or nesting). Finally, we analyzed the relationship between the number of visits and some characteristics of the traditional-homegardens (size area, richness of large plants and distance to the nearest forest fragment). Birds visited different vegetation stratum of traditional-homegardens to perch, to forage, and even to nest. In general, we found that larger traditional-homegardens area increased the number of bird visits, while distance to the native forest fragments and the species richness of large plants did not have significant effects. Insectivores and frugivores had a similar pattern to the general; to the granivores, the distance to the forest fragment had a positive effect on the number of visits; to the omnivores, the species richness of large plants had negative effect, to the nectarivores, none of the variables had a significant effect. Overall, this study sheds light on the significance of traditional-homegardens not only for human communities but also for biodiversity conservation by providing valuable habitats for a variety of bird species.",Not About Sufficiency
The costs of occupational gender segregation in high-tech growth and productivity across US local labor markets,"Theories of endogenous economic growth propose that the exchange of information between workers with different knowledge facilitates innovation. In this study, we explore whether occupational gender segregation poses a barrier to endogenous growth by limiting the extent to which women and men workers exchange information, ideas and perspectives. Focusing on technology industries as a sector where information exchange plays a large role, we use error correction models to test for the potential long-term costs of occupational gender segregation on industry growth and productivity across US local labor markets from 2005 through 2019. Results indicate that occupational gender segregation stalls tech growth, while also hindering productivity. Conversely stated, the occupational integration of women and men provides a boon to growth and productivity in local tech sectors. As regions strive to be competitive in the new economy, those fostering collaboration between women and men will be better positioned to succeed.",Not About Sufficiency
The Determinants of Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Empirical Evidence from Canadian Provinces,"The main objective of the present study is to examine the determinants of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada using panel data of 10 provinces from 1990 to 2019. The pooled ordinary least squares method is used to estimate the models. The main findings of the basic model show that provinces with larger populations, younger ages, and more income produce higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The results of the extended model (per capita greenhouse gas emissions as the dependent variable) show that only five factors (out of ten potential determinants identified)-oil production per capita, gas production per capita, motor vehicles registered per capita, electricity generation intensity, and heating degree days-are significant determinants of per capita greenhouse gas emissions. The results also reveal that the provinces with older populations have lower per capita greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. However, both trend variables played an important role in explaining the greenhouse gas emissions per capita in Canada. Moreover, there were no significant differences among the patterns of the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in Canada after 2005.",Not About Sufficiency

The effect of traffic at speed bumps in residential areas on noise and air pollution,"Although transportation systems are an increasing necessity in today's connected world, the over-reliance on internal combustion engine vehicles has caused an increase in air and noise pollution. Air and noise pollutions are among the negative environmental factors that contribute to disease occurrence due to their negative health consequences. Literature has showed that air and noise pollutions were responsible for thousands of premature deaths in Europe. This has pushed scientists to search for models to calculate the effect of traffic on air and noise pollution, to help predict future scenarios, and to work on ways to mitigate that increase in pollution. In this paper, a statistical model is done by using data measured for 25 speed bump locations in Kuwait, which included traffic flow data in the form of vehicle count and classification, as well as noise level measurements taken through an Amprobe SM20 sound meter, in addition to air pollutant data obtained from the Environment Public Authority (EPA) in Kuwait. The results of the multivariate linear regression model showed that high traffic counts resulted in significantly higher noise levels, reaching more than 70 decibels in certain locations, which is considered unhealthy for extended time periods. The model also showed that sulfur dioxide levels were impacted by both light and heavy vehicles, while particulate matter less than 10 mu m was affected mainly by heavy vehicles. An online survey on speed bumps was completed by 803 participants to understand the behavior of people at speed bumps in Kuwait and understand if age and gender might be a predictor of how people would behave, and this was done by doing Pearson's chi-squared correlation tests on the results obtained from the survey.",Not About Sufficiency

Two experimental factors were tested: factor A - fertilisation with organic and mineral materials (sewage sludge fresh and composted, hard coal incineration ashes, calcium carbonate, mixture of this components) and factor B - mineral fertilisation. The observed effects are indicative of the legitimacy of applying sewage sludge and its mixture with hard coal ash to fertilise agricultural crops as this would reduce reliance on mineral fertiliser, which is very desirable in sustainable agriculture. Mineral fertilisation applied to both the test plants significantly reduced their contents of calcium and magnesium but it increased their content of potassium.",Not About Sufficiency
The environmental sustainability assessment of building ceramic manufacturing based on the LCA-emergy approach,"As the world's largest ceramics producer and exporter, China's ceramic industry is being sharply watched because of excessive resource consumption and pressing environmental issues. Given the specific performances of the ceramic production system, a full set of improved emergy indicators have been adopted to assess environmental sustainability. By taking a typical building ceramic tile plant as an example, this paper conducted a case study, including emergy analysis, ecological indicators, sensitivity analysis, and industrial pollutant emergy analysis (exhaust gas, wastewater, and solid waste). The results demonstrate that (1) non-renewable resource accounts for 57.7% of the total emergy amount and is the primary factor for the emergy analysis; (2) clay is the major contributor to non-renewable resource emergy (26% of the entire emergy; (3) emergy sustainability index is 0.041, which displays poor environmental sustainability; (4) the unit emergy value of building ceramic tile plant is 4.01E+12 sej/kg in the paper; (5) sensitivity analysis results of two assumptions illustrate the non-renewable resources has the biggest fluctuation (5.77%) in hypothesis 1 and the clay (2.63%) have the dominant status in hypothesis 2; (6) the solid waste is the major contributor and accounts for 3.69% of the entire emergy and 95.56% of the industrial pollutant emergy. In light of comprehensive discussions, two positive measures are proposed to improve environmental sustainability, containing enhancing the proportion of renewable energy input and recycling material replacement, respectively.",Not About Sufficiency
The Future of Autonomous Vehicles: Lessons from the Literature on Technology Adoption,"The introduction and adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) will likely reshape the transportation system and many economic activities. The economic literature on technology adoption, based on studies in agriculture and other sectors, provides lessons on the diffusion of AVs and its social and economic impacts. We rely on the threshold model of diffusion, where heterogeneous agents make decisions pursuing their self-interests. Applications of the threshold model point to case studies of other technologies where one can gain information and make predictions about the future of AVs. We find that private ownership of AVs may prevail after a transition period, as was the case in other technologies like computers, tractors, and conventional vehicles. With technological progress, the cost of privately owning AVs may decline. Further, there will be an increase in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita, there may be more vehicles on the road, and perhaps the transportation user-base will expand to include those currently facing limited mobility. Congestion is likely to depend on the tradeoff between the expansion of VMT and increased efficiency of AVs to communicate and help regulate traffic. Furthermore, differentiation of vehicles will increase as driving time becomes freed for other activities. These trends may lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and expansion of the transportation sector. Finally, the technology will evolve and may result in complementary innovations needing to be addressed, including the ""last 10 feet"" problem. It is evident that the future of the transportation system governed by AVs is most likely not going to be sustainable. This necessitates the importance of developing and enforcing rigorous policies at the metropolitan level and TNC levels to ensure a sustainable evolution of the future of transportation mobility.",Not About Sufficiency
The global warming debate: A review of the state of science,"A review of the present status of the global warming science is presented in this paper. The term global warming is now popularly used to refer to the recent reported increase in the mean surface temperature of the earth; this increase being attributed to increasing human activity and in particular to the increased concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere. Since the mid to late 1980s there has been an intense and often emotional debate on this topic. The various climate change reports (1996, 2001) prepared by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), have provided the scientific framework that ultimately led to the Kyoto protocol on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (particularly carbon dioxide) due to the burning of fossil fuels. Numerous peer-reviewed studies reported in recent literature have attempted to verify several of the projections on climate change that have been detailed by the IPCC reports. The global warming debate as presented by the media usually focuses on the increasing mean temperature of the earth, associated extreme weather events and future climate projections of increasing frequency of extreme weather events worldwide. In reality, the climate change issue is considerably more complex than an increase in the earth's mean temperature and in extreme weather events. Several recent studies have questioned many of the projections of climate change made by the IPCC reports and at present there is an emerging dissenting view of the global warming science which is at odds with the IPCC view of the cause and consequence of global warming. Our review suggests that the dissenting view offered by the skeptics or opponents of global warming appears substantially more credible than the supporting view put forth by the proponents of global warming. Further, the projections of future climate change over the next fifty to one hundred years is based on insufficiently verified climate models and are therefore not considered reliable at this point in time.",Not About Sufficiency
The governance of plastic in India: towards a just transition for recycling in the unorganised sector,"In the case of plastic waste regulations, this framework ignores that recycling in developing countries is largely undertaken within the unorganised sector.

This paper seeks to identify the global framework of waste minimisation and the lacunae in its implementation in the case of plastic waste in India. This will be based on analysis of national level regulations on plastic waste, court cases in the High Courts of India, and results of a primary field survey of unorganised sector plastic recycling units in Mumbai. By doing so, this paper seeks to explain the importance of recycling as a productive activity, and the need to incorporate concerns of workers and small-scale enterprise owners from the unorganised sector, in order to achieve a just transition to sustainable plastic waste management.",Not About Sufficiency
The HIV and urban food security nexus in Africa,"The relationship between HIV and food security has been characterized by a tendency to view both as primarily rural phenomena.

Recently, attention has turned to related issues such as the value of nutrition supplementation, the nutritional implications of anti-retroviral therapy and the impact on both of rising food prices. This paper argues that the focus on rural food insecurity, the individual PLHIV and the nutritional aspects of food security, while valuable and necessary, are limiting our ability to understand the social and economic relationships that are central to the HIV-food security nexus in urban contexts. Rapid urbanization makes food security in the urban context a complex issue with a number of different and overlapping dimensions. Understanding the reciprocal relationship between HIV and urban food security requires a new social framework which incorporates, but is not constrained by, a focus on the nutritional impacts of the epidemic.",Not About Sufficiency

The Impact of Airspace Discretization on the Energy Consumption of Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (Drones),"Promising massive emissions reduction and energy savings, the utilization of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in last-mile parcel delivery is continuously expanding. However, the limited UAV range deters their widescale adoption to replace ground modes of transportation. Moreover, real-world data on the impact of different parameters on the operation, emissions, and energy consumption is scarce. This study aims to assess the impact of airspace planning and discretization on the energy consumption of autonomous UAVs. We utilize a novel open-source comprehensive UAV autonomous programming framework and a digital-twin model to simulate real-world three-dimensional operation. The framework integrates airspace policies, UAV kinematics, and autonomy to accurately estimate the operational energy consumption via an experimentally verified energy model. In the simulated case study, airspace is discretized by both a traditional Cartesian method and a novel dynamic 4D discretization (Skyroutes) method. This allows for the comparison of different routing and trajectory planning algorithms for ten missions. The results show a variation in the energy consumption by up to 50%, which demonstrates the criticality of airspace discretization and planning on UAV charging infrastructure design, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and airspace management.",Not About Sufficiency

Results support that the economic complexity index in the 10th and 25th quantiles and pooled OLS regression positively affects ecological footprint, but not in the 75th and 90th quantiles. Gross Domestic Product in the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th quantiles have a positive effect on ecological footprint.

The impact of national policies on Europe-wide power system transition towards net-zero 2050,"This research aims to investigate the potential impact of national policies on the attainment of Europe's goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Specifically, it analyses the effects of policies on the power sector, by evaluating capacity expansion portfolios, import reliance, and costs by 2050. A linear programming model, the IESA-EUPS, is utilized to optimize the expansion and operation of the power system, considering 28 nodes and hourly temporal resolution. The study includes five scenarios from 2020 to 2050, with varying levels of biomass and nuclear penetration based on existing member state policies. Results show that by 2050, changes mainly occur in the interplay between firm capacities and cross-border transmission levels. Limiting biomass can significantly increase nuclear energy generation, while enforcing all policies leads to a 40 % rise in cross-border transmission by 2050, due to imbalances between countries. Some member states, such as Spain and Finland, are less affected, whereas others are heavily reliant on firm nuclear capacities. Western European countries with strict biomass and nuclear restrictions may see a boost in nuclear installations in countries allowing it. Member states without both nuclear and biomass may rely more on variable renewables, resulting in surplus electricity and increased LCOE.",Not About Sufficiency

The Impact of Renewable Versus Non-renewable Natural Capital on Economic Growth,"In a dataset on 83 countries covering the years 1960-2009, we find a negative indirect effect of the share of renewable natural capital in wealth on economic growth transmitted through demographic factors, more specifically, population fertility. In contrast, in countries with lower income inequality and higher institutional quality, the share of non-renewable natural capital in wealth has a direct positive impact on growth. We also find that countries with higher income per capita, human development, and institutional quality have a higher share of renewable natural capital per capita, but a lower share of renewable natural capital in wealth. Renewable natural capital is thus valuable for the population and of primary concern for empowered countries, even though it contributes less to wealth and economic growth. Our results raise serious questions about the way wealth and growth are defined in economics when one investigates the impact of natural capital and point to the importance of preserving natural capital, particularly, in less developed countries.",Not About Sufficiency
"The impact of soybean expansion on mammal and bird, in the Balsas region, north Brasilian Cerrado","In order to analyse the impact of land use change, it is particularly important to know how organisms use resources distributed across a heterogeneous landscape. The main objective of this study is to analyse the potential impact of land use change on bird and mammal fauna, by using a coupled model approach. The CLUE (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects) model has been applied to obtain the spatial pattern of land use change for a scenario with soybean expansion in the Cerrado of Maranhao State in Brazil. These land use change maps were used as the input for the LEDESS (Landscape Ecological Decision and Evaluation Support System) model to evaluate the impact of habitat fragmentation on mammal and bird species. The scenarios demonstrated that high quality habitat for all studied species will be lost in the future when current trends in agricultural expansion continue, but these changes will have species-specific impacts. The most relevant ecological impact under the explored scenarios was habitat fragmentation expressed by the increase the number of habitat clusters. The coupled model approach of LEDESS and CLUE made it possible to project the spatial impact of soybean expansion on habitat dynamics in the studied region. This model approach can help to design effective ecological infrastructure to facilitate species survival and to implement an effective habitat network in the Balsas region.

"The impact of urbanization and climate change on ecosystem services: A case study of the city belt along the Yellow River in Ningxia, China","Understanding the impacts of climate and land use changes driven by urbanization upon ecosystem services (ESs) has great importance in ES management and policy making. However, knowledge of their impacts on ESs correlation and bundles are still lacking. This study quantified five ESs in a spatially explicit manner for 1989-2017 in the City Belt along the Yellow River in Ningxia, China. Ten scenarios based on two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 2.6 and 8.5) and five urban expansion policies, were used to predict the potential change of ESs in 2017-2045. Temporal trade-off and synergy relations among ESs were analyzed using correlation analysis, while ES bundles were delineated and mapped through a self-organizing map. Results indicated that climate change has larger impacts on sand fixation and carbon sequestration, especially in mountain areas. In 2017-2045, RCP 8.5 would result in a larger increase in sand fixation (by 1.75 times to 2045) and a slight decrease in carbon sequestration (by 1.62%) than RCP 2.6. Land use change has a more substantial impact on the other three ESs than climate change, especially in the central plain. Specifically, cropland reclamation during 1989-2017 and urban expansion in 2017-2045 caused the most intense alterations in ESs. Reclamation can increase food production and nutrient retention, but reduce recreational opportunity, while urban expansion has the opposite impacts. Encouraging compact urban growth, creating riparian vegetation buffers and environment protection policies can effectively reduce the trade-offs and simultaneous losses among ESs. Specific recommendations are proposed for different sub-regions indicated by the ES bundle classification. Our results can provide references for urban planning to enhance ESs under future global warming.",Not About Sufficiency
The impacts of population and agglomeration development on land use intensity: New evidence behind urbanization in China,"The impacts of population growth and agglomeration development on urbanization are complex. They cannot be effectively disentangled by simple fixed-effect regression analyses. This study introduces the land use intensity (LUI) metric to measure urbanization, and further applies quantile and threshold regression models to examine the impacts of population (POP) and agglomeration development (AGD) on land use intensity using a sample of 297 Chinese cities. The results reveal the heterogeneous effects that POP and AGD have on LUI. Variation is also observed in the effects of POP and AGD on LUI by POP/AGD intervals. As POP increases, its pressure on LUI increases. In contrast, the accumulative effects of development are beneficial in restraining overdevelopment of land resources within a specific range. The findings suggest that understanding complex human and development effects provides valuable insights, references, and implications for urban development and land use policies, which can guide cities with greater potential land development space in reducing the risk of unsustainable urbanization.

Associated changes in river runoff are simulated using a global hydrological model, for four spatial patterns of change in temperature and rainfall. There is a considerable difference in hydrological change between these four patterns, but the percentages of change avoided at the global scale are relatively robust. By the 2050s, the Mitigation scenario typically avoids between 16 and 30% of the change in runoff under the Reference scenario, and by 2100 it avoids between 43 and 65%. Two different measures of exposure to water resources stress are calculated, based on resources per capita and the ratio of withdrawals to resources. Using the first measure, the Mitigation scenario avoids 8-17% of the impact in 2050 and 20-31% in 2100; with the second measure, the avoided impacts are 5-21% and 15-47% respectively. However, at the same time, the Mitigation scenario also reduces the positive impacts of climate change on water scarcity in other areas. The absolute numbers and locations of people affected by climate change and climate policy vary considerably between the four climate model patterns. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The Influence of Covid-19 on Perceived Health Effects of Wetland Parks in China,"Wetland parks are designed to support urban ecological protection, flood control and human well-being. Existing research mainly focuses on their influence on ecology and economy. However, their influence on human well-being and health is rarely studied. In China, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (Peak), people were very concerned about health, while at the same time wetland parks which are generally considered beneficial to health were closed. Thus, this study explores the public's perception of the health effects of visiting wetland parks and the impact of the pandemic on the perception. From March 5th to 8th, 2020, before the Peak in China was over, 1,400 respondents participated in a nationwide online survey. It was found that the perceived benefits from visiting wetland parks were higher in terms of mental health than in physical health. Also, the perceived health benefits of wetland parks after the Peak were slightly higher than before the pandemic. The results highlight that wildlife habitat services were considered to be the most important ecosystem services that promote the perceived health benefits. Interestingly, the perceived health benefits of wetland parks by health experts appear to be lower than in other groups, indicating that the health benefits of visiting wetland parks may be overestimated by lay-people or underestimated by health experts. The results provide empirical evidence for managing ecosystem services as delivered by these urban wetlands, in the context of COVID-19 or potential future pandemics, for promoting public health.",Not About Sufficiency
The influence of environmental knowledge on green purchase intention in the air travel industry: the mediating role of green attitude,"The air travel industry, which is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, has placed environmental concerns at the forefront of its operations and marketing efforts. This study aims to examine the influence of environmental knowledge on green purchase intention while considering the mediating effect of green attitude. To this end, conceptual model was tested using the partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM) technique and ADANCO, with 156 valid responses from Turkey collected via a structured questionnaire administered to passengers. The results indicated that both environmental knowledge and green attitude have positive and significant impacts on green purchase intention. Additionally, green attitude mediates the relationship between environmental knowledge and green purchase intention. These findings suggest that an increase in consumers' environmental knowledge has both direct and indirect effects on their inclination to purchase environmentally friendly air travel products.",Not About Sufficiency
The Influence of Gender Relations on Women's Involvement and Experience in Climate Change Adaptation Programs in Bangladesh,"The nexus between poverty and climate change is a major concern, especially in a country like Bangladesh where lack of resources is a significant problem in both rural and urban areas. Climate change affects a wide demographic of the population in Bangladesh, and among those affected, women are more vulnerable to climate change impacts, as is evident from the history of climate-induced disasters in the country. Climate change increases women's socio-economic vulnerabilities by directly impacting their family's food security, water consumption, and livelihood. Hence, their roles and contributions are critical in responding through adaptation. Nonetheless, in Bangladesh, challenges remain to incorporate women as distinct actors and active agents in climate adaptation programs considering the gender power dynamics that exist. In this context, this study focuses on women's contributions as individuals or as a group and reveals their significant influence in climate change adaptation practices.",Not About Sufficiency
The Influence of Photovoltaic Self-Consumption on Water Treatment Energy Costs: The Case of the Region of Valencia,"Energy consumption is one of the principal components of the operative costs incurred by providers of water services, both financial and environmental. Fortunately, in recent years solar panel technology has improved substantially, and photovoltaic self-consumption has become a tool that can reduce the costs of water reuse and other water services. Regions with a scarcity of water resources make a considerable use of non-conventional sources, consuming a significant amount of energy, which has a high financial and environmental cost and compromises the sustainability of the water supply. This research analyses the possibility of replacing part of this energy with self-consumption through photovoltaic panels based on data obtained for the Region of Valencia in order to analyse the impact of energy substitution on energy costs. Performing a Cost-Benefit Analysis, self-consumption projects require an electricity market price of between 0.14 and 0.18 EUR/kWh, so in financial terms it is not a particularly attractive alternative. However, the avoided greenhouse gas emissions have a high value, and including them in the calculations, the price needed to be in feasible amounts of 0.04-0.10 EUR/kWh for a small installation and 0.02-0.08 EUR/kWh for a large one. In other words, photovoltaic self-consumption is still today an alternative with financial difficulties, but the associated environmental benefit justifies public intervention as it is a beneficial energy alternative in a context of high greenhouse gas emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
The influence of the instantaneous fuel mix for electricity generation on the corresponding emissions,"Since it would be unwise to apply an environmental measure before its impact is estimated, tools are needed to simulate the system to which the measure is applied. In this paper, a tool and a methodology are discussed in order to simulate scenarios for demand and supply side options and to quantify the emissions and the energy use related to electricity generation. To supply the electricity demand, the composition of the active power system evidently changes with the variations in demand. The instantaneous composition of the power system is determined by the activation order (set by a chosen criterion) of all power plants. Because of their specific nature, some problems are dealt with separately in the model. Pumping plants are both customer (pump-mode) and provider (turbine-mode) of electric power. Therefore, they are not modeled as other plants, but as an adaptation in the demand pattern for other plants. Outages are mostly unpredictable but very important for the instantaneous energy use and emissions. Therefore, the model contains a component in which an average outage schedule can be calculated. The possible deviation of this average result is dealt with in the calculation of the uncertainties. Also, other parameters, like accidental unavailability of plants, human decisions in activation and deactivation of plants and the unpredictable availability of cogeneration units, are included in the calculation of the uncertainties. A simulation tool is necessary, because a-priori ""linear"" estimates do not always appear to be accurate. Results are highly dependent on the composition of the power system and the activation order of the individual plants. Demand and supply side actions are therefore simulated. Simulations for Belgium have pointed out that variations in electricity-related greenhouse-gas emissions (per unit of electricity generated) can be larger than a factor two, depending on the time segment in which the electricity is consumed. For SOx and NOx emissions this variation can be even larger. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"The interconnectedness between landowner knowledge, value, belief, attitude, and willingness to act: Policy implications for carbon sequestration on private rangelands","Rangelands can be managed to increase soil carbon and help mitigate emissions of carbon dioxide. This study assessed Utah rangeland owner's environmental values, beliefs about climate change, and awareness of and attitudes towards carbon sequestration, as well as their perceptions of potential policy strategies for promoting carbon sequestration on private rangelands. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews and a statewide survey of Utah rangeland owners, and were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate statistics. Over two-thirds of respondents reported some level of awareness of carbon sequestration and a generally positive attitude towards it, contrasting to their lack of interest in participating in a relevant program in the future. Having a positive attitude was statistically significantly associated with having more ""biocentric"" environmental values, believing the climate had been changing over the past 30 years, and having a stronger belief of human activities influencing the climate. Respondents valued the potential ecological benefits of carbon sequestration more than the potential financial or climate change benefits. Additionally, respondents indicated a preference for educational approaches over financial incentives. They also preferred to work with a private agricultural entity over a non-profit or government entity on improving land management practices to sequester carbon. These results suggest potential challenges for developing technically sound and socially acceptable policies and programs for promoting carbon sequestration on private rangelands. Potential strategies for overcoming these challenges include emphasizing the ecological benefits associated with sequestering carbon to appeal to landowners with ecologically oriented management objectives, enhancing the cooperation between private agricultural organizations and government agencies, and funneling resources for promoting carbon sequestration into existing land management and conservation programs that may produce carbon benefits.

Practices that often advocate a direct relationship with the ""real"" without the mediation of artistic formalities.

The Intersection of Incarceration and Injustice: Environmental Burdens in Prison Communities,"Background: This study examines environmental justice (EJ) indicators in communities surrounding 165 prisons in 10 U.S. states, contributing to timely and critical discussions of both decarceration and EJ in smaller towns and rural areas of the United States.Methods: Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool (EJSCREEN) was used to characterize environmental burdens in communities surrounding state and federal prisons. Based on findings, brief case studies of five prison communities with multiple EJ concerns are presented.Results: Communities surrounding 40% of the prisons exceeded an 80th percentile threshold EJ Index for one indicator; nearly one-quarter exceeded this threshold for multiple EJ Indexes. The prisons tended to be in less-densely populated areas; only 4% of prisons in these 10 states were in cities. States with higher incarceration rates tended to have a greater number of elevated EJ Indexes for communities surrounding prisons.Discussion: Findings support the existence of many rural EJ communities, and a multitude of pollution sources may contribute to environmental conditions in communities surrounding prisons. Although EJ concerns impact a broad set of stakeholders, prison inmates represent a unique population: involuntary subjects of environmental burdens they are unable to escape during the period of their incarceration. Study findings are also discussed in the context of proposed actions under the Biden Administration's Justice40 Initiative.Conclusion: Intersectional approaches are needed to understand and solve complex problems. This study finds that rural communities, increasingly the sites of prisons, present EJ concerns worthy of further examination.",Not About Sufficiency
The key determinants of individual greenhouse gas emissions in Germany are mostly domain-specific,"Individual behavior plays a pivotal role in mitigating climate change but our understanding of the multifaceted, determining factors of sustainable behavior remains incomplete. Here we conducted a comprehensive, cross-sectional survey of German households in 2021 (N = 10,813), assessing various potential determinants and measuring behavior in greenhouse gas emissions across various life domains (shelter, mobility, consumption, and diet). Machine learning models were employed to predict emissions from determining factors and benchmarked against commonly used linear models. Our findings indicate that machine learning models excel in capturing complex relationships between personal and situational factors, offering a more nuanced understanding of how determinants interplay and contribute to emissions. Notably, some factors like perceived behavioral control or habits consistently affected emissions, while others like infrastructural barriers and pro-environmental attitudes were domain-specific. These insights about key determinants of sustainable behavior are valuable for policymakers crafting effective climate change strategies at the individual level. The behavioral factors responsible for individual greenhouse gas emissions in Germany interact and differ mainly across life domains such as mobility and diet, suggests a machine learning-based analysis of cross-sectional survey among German households.",Not About Sufficiency
The Limits of the Current Consensus Regarding the Carbon Footprint of Photovoltaic Modules Manufactured in China: A Review and Case Study,"A transition to low-carbon energy sources is pivotal in addressing the escalating challenges of climate change and environmental degradation.

However, accurately assessing the carbon footprint of PV modules is essential for guiding policy, industry practices, and research. This paper reviews the state of the current literature and highlights the difficulties in estimating the carbon footprint of PV modules manufactured in China. It emphasises the inherent limitations of Process-Based Life Cycle Assessments (PLCAs), including data collection challenges, dynamic environmental changes, and subjective methodological choices. Through the case study of Ecoinvent 3.7 the study underscores the need for improved transparency, standardisation, and reproducibility in Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) to provide more accurate and reliable environmental impact evaluations.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Logic of ""War on Deforestation"": A Military Response to Climate Change in the Colombian Amazon","The renewed global efforts to contain climate change have meant a gateway for some Latin American countries to declare new military actions. The ""war on deforestation,"" announced in 2021 by Ivan Duque, the former president of Colombia, is a paradigmatic example. Through Operation Artemis (Operacion Artemisa), the Colombian armed forces were assigned to protect the forests against threats from armed non-state actors (ANSAs) predominantly located in the country's Amazon rainforests. We argue that this war was a rhetorical and political model of the Duque government that sought, based on the re-elaboration of the counterinsurgent categories shared with the United States for half a century, to implement in the Amazon the first state military strategy to reach global agreements against climate change. Why does a state wage war in the name of protecting forests? We argue that in this novel rhetorical, military, and criminal framework, the war on deforestation encouraged the renewal of the war on drugs and the transformation of the internal enemy. Drawing on analyses of presidential policies passed since 1970 and, more recently, green crime law, this article showcases a new chapter on the state's goal of achieving territorial control through green militarization.",Not About Sufficiency
The Market Evolution of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants: A Global Supply Chain Analysis and an Application of the Delphi Method in the Mediterranean Area,"There is an increasing evidence for the significant value and potential of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (MAPs) worldwide. Among other non-wood forest products, MAPs are considered a key element of sustainable forest management and economic development. As part of Mediterranean cultural heritage, these plants are a major driver of rural tourism, in many areas representing an important raw material for various bio-based industrial sectors. Besides their economic value, MAPs enhance social integration and maintain gender balance as harvesting and processing MAPs is clearly a female dominated task. Despite the prominent contribution of MAPs to local development, conservation of biodiversity and the development of the traditional Mediterranean food system, many challenges and knowledge gaps could potentially place the sector's development at risk. The aim of this work is to examine the present situation of the MAPs sector in the most productive countries around the Mediterranean and to identify future challenges and priority actions to develop the MAPs sector in the region. To do so, a supply chain analysis was performed to identify the main stakeholders involved. Various experts from Croatia, France, Greece, Spain, and Tunisia participated in the SWOT analysis and the Delphi approach employed in this study. The results highlight the main challenges facing the sector in Mediterranean countries. Five groups of challenges are identified, related mainly to certification and labelling, life quality and wellbeing, market development, research development, and transforming and processing. To overcome these challenges, a set of actions is validated by the interviewed experts with the aim of improving marketing strategies and including various innovations related to political, legal, organisational, and institutional frameworks.",Not About Sufficiency

The Mesoamerican milpa agroecosystem fosters greater arthropod diversity compared to monocultures,"Agricultural intensification, including the conversion of agroecosystems into monocultures, is a leading cause of global biodiversity loss. Preserving smallholder farms that use traditional mixed cropping systems is one strategy to prevent further declines in arthropod biodiversity and maintaining crucial ecosystem services, such as those provided by natural enemies of pests. We investigated the impact of crop diversity on both the abundance and diversity of herbivores and their natural enemies within the traditional milpa intercropping system, with a particular focus on diversity in response to its widespread decline. We compared arthropod abundance, species richness and evenness as measured by the Shannon diversity index in replicated (n =15) plots (2 m x 2 m) of monocultures, bicultures and tricultures of maize, beans, and squash in an agricultural field in Oaxaca, Mexico. Our findings support the hypothesis that the milpa system fosters higher levels of arthropod diversity compared to monocultures, primarily due to independent effects of each crop species in an additive manner. Notably, our observations also revealed non-additive effects on herbivore diversity within the squash-maize bicultures, through the increase and decrease in abundances of less and more dominant insect groups, respectively. Overall, however, we did not detect an effect of crop diversity on aggregate arthropod abundance. Our results show that polycultures effectively increase biodiversity, but they also emphasize the need of considering plant interactions when selecting specific crop combinations.",Not About Sufficiency
"The mobile phone revolution, the Internet and rural electricity: What are the implications for food security in Africa?","The theorized benefits of mobile phone and Internet penetration have not been sufficiently tested, especially on cross-country data. Using a dataset involving 48 regionally grouped African countries and a robust dynamic system GMM model, this study attempts to fill this gap. In carrying out this study, we adopted an empirical strategy that allowed us to estimate the specific and complementary impacts of mobile phone, Internet, and rural electricity on food security, from panel and regional comparative perspectives. The findings indicate that: the incremental and intra-temporal effects in food security situation linger awhile; the promotional effects of ICT development on food security are more induced by mobile phone development than by Internet development; mobile phone and Internet have a robust and stable synergistic effect on food security; contrary to expectations, there is no complementarity between ICT protocols and rural electricity, with the impact of the latter on food security being more distortive than promotional; and that the promotional benefits of ICT protocols on food security are dependent on a country's capacity to resolve inherent deficiencies in rural electricity energy supply, climate conditions and credit challenges. Policy-wise, the findings confirm how the convergence and complementarity between mobile phone and Internet connectivity can conditionally be enhanced in the case of Africa; and how such convergence can potentially facilitate the catch-up between the lagging Internet access and the booming mobile phone subscription and to enhance the quality, quantity and relevance of the information contents of the ICT protocols.",Not About Sufficiency

We also discuss the remaining issues regarding the characteristics of thermosensors and the urgency required to explore the basis of acclimation under multifactorial stress combination.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Monteregie Connection: linking landscapes, biodiversity, and ecosystem services to improve decision making","To maximize specific ecosystem services (ES) such as food production, people alter landscape structure, i.e., the types of ecosystems present, their relative proportions, and their spatial arrangement across landscapes. This can have significant, and sometimes unexpected, effects on biodiversity and ES. Communities need information about how land/use activities and changes to landscape structure are likely to affect biodiversity and ES, but current scientific understanding of these effects is incomplete. The Monteregie Connection (MC) project has used the rapidly suburbanizing agricultural Monteregien landscape just east of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to investigate how current and historic landscape structure influences ES provision. Our results highlight the importance of forest connectivity and functional diversity on ES provision, and show that ES provision can vary significantly even within single land-use types in response to changes in landscape structure. Our historical analysis reveals that levels of ES provision, as well as relationships among individual ES, can change dramatically through time. We are using these results to build quantitative ES-landscape structure models to assess four future landscape scenarios for the region: Periurban Development, Demand for Energy, Whole-System Crisis, and Green Development. These scenarios integrate empirical and historical data on ES provision with local stakeholder input about global and local social and ecological drivers to explore how land-use decisions could affect ES provision and human well-being across the region to the year 2045. By integrating empirical data, quantitative models, and scenarios we have achieved the central goals of the MC project: (1) increasing understanding of the effects of landscape structure on biodiversity and ES provision, (2) effectively linking this knowledge to decision making to better manage for biodiversity and ES, and (3) creating a vision for a more sustainable social-ecological system in the region.",Not About Sufficiency
The Multi-level System of Global Climate Governance - the Model and its Current State,"Multi-level global governance was introduced at the United Nations summit in Rio in 1992 as a new model to achieve a broad global mobilization of different actors in sustainable development. This model has been extended to climate governance. It has become a global system with its own inherent logic, dynamics and stabilization mechanisms. This article deals with the systemic dimension (the architecture) of global multi-level climate governance across levels and sectors. It refers to the model and its practical implementation at different levels. The text poses four hypotheses: (1) the global multi-level system of climate governance can be regarded as a structure which offers opportunities for ambitious innovation-based climate strategies; (2) each level of the global system has its own specific responsibilities, challenges, opportunities and mechanisms for lesson-drawing; (3) the main lesson to be learned is to make use of the co-benefits characteristic to climate mitigation; and (4) the system's multi-sectoral and multi-actor structure provides additional opportunities to address such co-benefits and to mobilize different interests in the pursuit of climate policy objectives. After outlining these hypotheses in more detail, the article will then conclude with a set of policy recommendations. (c) 2017 The Authors.

The new Malthusian challenge in the Sahel: prospects for improving food security in Niger,"The world economy has largely overcome the Malthusian challenge, but there are regions such as the Sahel where this challenge remains formidable and food insecurity is exacerbated by multiple threats of climate change, low agricultural productivity, and high population growth. While the interactions among these forces governing long-term food security are widely discussed for policy making in the Sahel, analysis of the comparative magnitude of the forces in the resulting food security outcomes is largely absent. In this paper, we identify the relative contribution of these long-term drivers of food security outcomes in rural and urban Niger into 2050. We then consider three policy scenarios to address food security issues: accelerated investments in agricultural R & D (supply side), reduction of fertility rates (demand side), and market integration. We use a historically validated partial equilibrium model tailored to Nigerien agriculture, with data inputs gleaned from various sources, including household and farm surveys and grid-cell level production data. Our study finds that among growth in population, income, and agricultural productivity and climate change impacts on yields and labor productivity, population growth in Niger will remain the single largest driver of crop output growth and undernourishment in the country. Three fourths of the increase in undernourished population is projected to be among the urban population. Climate change impacts on agricultural productivity will have differential impacts on undernourishment prevalence among rural and urban population, pushing an additional 2 million people into undernourishment by 2050. The relative impacts of climate change are larger among the rural population offsetting revenue gains from increased crop prices. We emphasize that feasible advancements in agricultural productivity are likely to be outpaced by rapid population growth and climate change setbacks unless simultaneous actions are taken on the demand side. On the supply side, interventions are required in transforming R & D spending into higher farm productivity. Greater integration into regional markets will also aide in mitigating undernourishment prevalence.",Not About Sufficiency
"The nexus between financial development, globalization, and environmental degradation: Fresh evidence from Central and Eastern European Countries","Global warming and greenhouse gas emissions have become a severe threat to our ecosystem. Prior studies on environment posit that ample exhaustion of fossil fuels for energy is one of the fundamental causes of environmental degradation and naturally replenished energy sources are affordable over fossil fuels. This study set out to examine the role of financial sectors and globalization (in the presence of energy and renewable energy consumption) for a sustainable environment in the panel of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries in One Belt and One Road initiative perspective. The current study uses annual data of 16 CEE countries covering the period of 1980 to 2016. After confirmation of cross-sectional dependency and co-integration among variables, we applied the Dynamic Seemingly Unrelated Regression and Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality approach for long-run estimations and to check the causal relationship, respectively. The empirical findings of the study certify the existence of an environmental Kuznets curve for the selected panel countries. Globalization is enhancing the environmental quality of the CEE economies. It is important to note that energy consumption and renewable energy consumption have a positive and statistically significant whack on carbon emission. In addition, we do not find a significant link between financial development and carbon emission. Granger casualty test confirms a two-way causal relationship between economic growth and carbon emission, globalization and environmental degradation, globalization and renewable energy consumption, economic growth and renewable energy consumption, and between financial development and energy consumption. Moreover, we found one-way causality from energy consumption (renewable and non-renewable) to carbon emissions.

The oral vaccination with Paenibacillus larvae bacterin can decrease susceptibility to American Foulbrood infection in honey bees-A safety and efficacy study,"Pollination services to increase crop production are becoming more and more important, as we are facing both climate change and a growing world population. Both are predicted to impact food security worldwide. High-density, commercial beekeeping has become a key link in the food supply chain, and diseases have become a central issue in hive losses around the world. American Foulbrood (AFB) disease is a highly contagious bacterial brood disease in honey bees (Apis mellifera), leading to hive losses worldwide. The causative agent is the Gram+ bacterium Paenibacillus larvae, which is able to infect honey bee larvae during the first 3 days of their lives. It can be found in hives around the world with viable spores for decades. Antibiotics are largely ineffective in treating the disease as they are only efficient against the vegetative state. Once a hive shows the clinical manifestation of the disease, the only effective way to eradicate it and prevent the spread of the disease is by burning the hive, the equipment, and the colony. Because of its virulent nature and detrimental effects on honey bee colonies, AFB is classified as a notifiable disease worldwide. Effective, safe, and sustainable methods are needed to ensure the wellbeing of honey bee colonies. Even though insects lack antibodies, which are the main requisites for trans-generational immune priming (TGIP), they can prime their offspring against persisting pathogens. Here, we demonstrate an increased survival of infected honey bee larvae after their queen was vaccinated, compared to offspring of control queens (placebo vaccinated). These results indicate that TGIP in insects can be used to majorly enhance colony health, protect commercial pollinators from deadly diseases, and reduce high financial and material losses to beekeepers.

The performance advantage of a high resting metabolic rate in juvenile salmon is habitat dependent,"1. Basal levels of metabolism vary significantly among individuals in many taxa, but the effects of this on fitness are generally unknown. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) in juvenile salmon and trout is positively related to dominance status and ability to obtain a feeding territory, but it is not clear how this translates into performance in natural conditions. 2. The relationships between RMR, dominance, territoriality and growth rates of yearling Atlantic salmon Salmo salar were examined in relation to predictability in food supply and habitat complexity, using replicate sections of a large-scale controlled semi-natural stream. 3. Estimated RMR was a strong predictor of dominance, and under conditions of a predictable food supply in a structurally simple habitat, high estimated RMR fish obtained the best feeding territories and grew faster. 4. When the spatial distribution of food was made less predictable, dominant (high estimated RMR) fish were still able to occupy the most profitable feeding locations by periodically moving location to track the changes in food availability, but RMR was no longer a predictor of growth rate. Moreover, when a less predictable food supply was combined with a visually more complex (and realistic) habitat, fish were unable to track changes in food availability, grew more slowly and exhibited greater site fidelity, and there were no relationships between estimated RMR and quality of occupied territory or growth rate. 5. The relative benefit of RMR is thus context dependent, depending on both habitat complexity and the predictability of the food supply. Higher habitat complexity and lower food predictability decrease the performance advantages associated with a high RMR.",Not About Sufficiency
"The policy discourse on negative emissions, land-based technologies, and the Global South","Negative emissions are increasingly seen as a policy option to limit climate change. However, the most readily available technologies that could deliver negative emissions require, if deployed at scale, large amounts of land, with huge risks for livelihoods and the environment. This land is often assumed to be in the Global South. This article analyzes the nascent policy discourse on negative emissions by assessing 116 policy documents by 97 organizations with a focus on land-based technologies (afforestation and reforestation, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, biochar, soil carbon sequestration). We conclude that this policy discourse is largely centered in the Global North (mostly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany), with only five organizations directly linked to the Global South. 61% of the organizations in our sample, however, somehow refer to the Global South in their contributions, with nongovernmental organizations being most strongly focused on the role of the Global South and in particular the risks for vulnerable countries. While the earlier policy discourse on negative emissions was linked to a more general ""geoengineering"" discourse, this link has loosened in the last years. Overall, in the documents that we studied, negative emissions technologies seem to become more accepted, and parts of the discourse shift towards deployment. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage seems more often associated with risks if compared to other land-based negative emissions technologies, especially with a view to the Global South.",Not About Sufficiency

"The politics of gender and the Soviet paradox: neither colonized, nor modern?","This article examines scholarly debates that cast Soviet policies for the emancipation of women in Central Asia as instances of colonial domination, as the modernizing endeavours of a revolutionary state or as combinations of both and takes them to task for overlooking the gendered consequences of the 'Soviet paradox'. This paradox is evident in the combined and contradictory operations of a socialist paternalism that supported and legitimized women's presence in the public sphere (through education, work and political representation), with a command economy and nationalities policy that effectively stalled processes of social transformation commonly associated with modernity. Post-Soviet gender ideologies do not represent a simple return to national traditions, interrupted by Soviet policies, but constitute a strategic redeployment of notions of cultural authenticity in the service of new ideological goals. The politics of gender, thus, plays a crucial role in signalling both a break from the Soviet past and in creating new imaginaries of the nation that enhance social solidarity in increasingly fractured post-Soviet societies. The official endorsement of Islam, as a central tenet of national identity and the simultaneous rejection and policing of its more radical expressions contributes further to the politicization of gender, while the promotion of gender equality by the international donor community carries limited credibility in a context where the core of women's former claims to citizenship-through welfare entitlements and social protection by the state-has been thoroughly eroded.",Not About Sufficiency
The potential of Estonian semi-natural grasslands for bioenergy production,"High biodiversity of Estonian semi-natural grasslands can only be maintained through continuous management. One option for the usage of biomass from these areas is bioenergy production, if both the herbaceous biomass yield and the chemical characteristics of the cut meet the needs. In 2007 the largest average annual biomass yield per area was achieved in floodplain meadows (5.7 t dry mass/ha), which also have the highest potential for biomass production among Estonian semi-natural grasslands (more than 113,000 t dry mass). The area of mesic meadows is larger, but due to lower average yield per area (2.5 t dry mass/ha), the potential of this meadow type was less than half of that of floodplain meadows (53,000 t dry mass). The corresponding numbers for wooded meadows were 1.6 t dry mass/ha and 12,000 t dry mass, respectively. Chemical characteristics of herbaceous biomass from wooded meadows significantly differed from mesic and floodplain meadows, giving the highest values of Ca, K, Mg, crude protein and ash (1.3%, 2.4%, 0.3%, 10.9% and 9.5% of the dry biomass, respectively). The energetic value of the biomass from different meadow types varied between 18.1 kJ/g and 18.6 kJ/g. Therefore, various options for bioenergy conversion should be considered depending on the local plant community and restrictions to the harvest time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The precautionary principle in context: US and EU scientists' prescriptions for policy in the face of uncertainty,"Objective. Our objective is to explain how scientists interpret less-than-certain scientific findings to inform policymakers' choices on controversial science policy issues. We focus on two particularly difficult policy cases concerning global climate change and low-dose radiation protection. Methods. Our method is to analyze data from a unique multination survey of scientists to analyze the ways their views about what is scientifically correct are translated into judgments about appropriate policy. The surveys asked scientists, randomly drawn from U. S. and E. U. subscribers to the journal Science, to indicate the ""most likely'' relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and average global temperatures and between radiation dose and incidence of cancer in humans. Follow-up questions asked for their judgments about appropriate policy targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emission and safety standards for radiation exposure. The data permit analysis of the relationships between scientific certainty and policy judgments in these two cases. Results. Our results shed light on when and how scientists reach precautionary policy conclusions, demonstrating that scientists' application of precaution is dependent on context. In the case of radiation protection, greater certainty is associated with less precaution. But with respect climate change, we found the opposite relationship. Conclusions. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for the role of scientists, and scientific advice, in the policy process.",Not About Sufficiency
The prospective use of biochar as adsorption matrix - A review from a lifecycle perspective,"Biochar is obtained from the thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment. Beyond its use for soil amendment and carbon sequestration, other value-added applications, such as a green environmental sorbent for different types of pollutants, are also of increasing interest. This paper reviews the available literature on the use of various feedstocks for biochar production as an initial step to compile the required inventory data from material flow data analysis. The environmental evaluation of different schemes of biochar production in a life cycle perspective reports the environmental impacts of the different alternatives, with more sustainable profiles than the use of activated carbon as conventional adsorption material. Moreover, most systems were validated as negative carbon processes with favorable performance regarding climate change mitigation. In particular, materials based on lignocellulosic waste were responsible for the highest environmental benefits, mainly due to their largest energy potential in comparison with other feedstocks.",Not About Sufficiency

The relationship between municipal solid waste and greenhouse gas emissions: Evidence from Switzerland,"Municipal solid waste generation is becoming a prominent issue in the environmental arena. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship among municipal waste generation, greenhouse gas emissions, and GDP in Switzerland over the period 1990-2017. We apply both time series procedures (stationarity and causality tests) and a Machine Learning approach. Empirical findings underline a bidirectional causal relationship between municipal solid waste generation and GDP, indicating that the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis holds for Switzerland. Moreover, we found that waste recovery (recycling and composting) is a key driver in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, in the Tree Model, the probability that a change in the waste recovery variable could lead to a reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions registered a value of 87%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The relationship between pollinator community and pollination services is mediated by floral abundance in urban landscapes,"It is often argued that biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are linked by both habitat and species composition, and that this relationship is particularly critical for mobile ecosystem service providers. This may be especially true for pollinators, which are essential for the reproduction of the majority of flowering plant species, are highly mobile, and can exhibit dramatically different foraging behaviors across ecosystems. Understanding how habitat and community composition impact pollination is especially relevant in urban environments where pollinators can promote food security. We examined the relationships between local resource density, landscape composition, pollinator abundance and richness, and pollination services in an urban agricultural system spanning >125 km of the California central coast. We used a replicated, experimental approach to evaluate the reproductive success of jalapeno peppers across urban gardens and conducted a greenhouse experiment to evaluate the benefits of insect-mediated pollination to pepper reproduction. In the greenhouse, we found that jalapeno fruit weight and seed number was significantly greater with insect-mediated pollination than without. In the field, we found that jalapeno seed number increased significantly with herbaceous (weed, crop, and ornamental) plant richness and the number of perennial trees and shrubs at the site level, but decreased with the amount of natural landscape cover. We also found that higher pollinator richness enhanced seed number in floral-dense gardens, likely due to the greater functional complementarity of a more diverse pollinator community. Furthermore, there was a positive relationship between pollinator abundance and seed number, but it weakened in gardens with more flowers, likely through lower per-plant pollinator visitation in the presence of competing floral resources. As in past studies, we found that mulch had a negative impact on pollinator abundance, highlighting that abiotic factors commonly managed by gardeners can directly impact ecosystem service providers. This study demonstrates that local conditions can significantly influence ecosystem service provision and that urban gardeners need to optimize for both pollinator richness and floral resource availability to achieve optimal pollination.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Relationship between Environmental Regulation, Green-Technology Innovation and Green Total-Factor Productivity-Evidence from 279 Cities in China","This paper employs the SBM-DDF method to measure the index of green total-factor productivity (GTFP), based on the panel data of 279 prefecture-level cities in China from 2007 to 2019, and constructs a spatial Durbin model (SDM) and a threshold effect to empirically test the effects of dual environmental-regulations and green technological innovation on GTFP. The results are as follows: (1) the SDM supports a nonlinear contribution of dual environmental-regulations spillover to GTFP. The relationship between formal environmental-regulation and GTFP is an inverted U-shape, while a U-shaped nonlinear relationship is found between informal environmental regulation and GTFP. (2) Green technology innovation has a significant negative moderating effect on the process of dual environmental-regulations affecting GTFP in local regions, but a positive moderating effect on informal environmental regulation in neighboring regions. (3) There is a significant green technology innovation threshold effect of dual environmental-regulations affecting GTFP. Specifically, the promotion effect of dual environmental-regulations on GFFP gradually increases as the level of green technology innovation increases.",Not About Sufficiency
The response of the regional longwave radiation balance and climate systemin Europe to an idealized afforestation experiment,"Afforestation is an important mitigation strategy for climate change due to its carbon sequestration potential. Besides this favorable biogeochemical effect on global CO2 concentrations, afforestation also affects the regional climate by changing the biogeophysical land surface characteristics. In this study, we investigate the effects of an idealized global CO2 reduction to pre-industrial conditions by a Europe-wide afforestation experiment on the regional longwave radiation balance, starting in the year 1986 on a continent entirely covered with grassland. Results show that the impact of biogeophysical processes on the surface temperatures is much stronger than that of biogeochemical processes. Furthermore, biogeophysically induced changes of the surface temperatures, atmospheric temperatures, and moisture concentrations are as important for the regional longwave radiation balance as the global CO2 reduction. While the outgoing longwave radiation is increased in winter, it is reduced in summer. In terms of annual total, a Europe-wide afforestation has a regional warming effect despite reduced CO2 concentrations. Thus, even for an idealized reduction of the global CO2 concentrations to pre-industrial levels, the European climate response to afforestation would still be dominated by its biogeophysical effects.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Role of Environmental, Economic, and Social Dimensions of Sustainability in the Quality of Life in Spain","Environmental sustainability can positively affect quality of life by reducing environmental degradation and increasing access to natural resources, while economic sustainability initiatives can have both positive and negative impacts on quality of life, depending on the context. Social sustainability initiatives can also have both positive and negative impacts on quality of life, particularly for marginalized communities and low-income populations. The investigation draws on a comprehensive national survey in Spain encompassing 2,270 responses, ensuring representative profiles in terms of gender, residence, income, age, and economic sector. Considering the aforementioned factors, this research aims to underscore the necessity of recognizing the interconnections between sustainability and quality of life in policy and decision-making processes towards social happiness. To achieve this, an analysis of variance is presented, enabling the examination of significant differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of Spanish citizens across the three dimensions defining sustainability. Specifically, income, age and population size are key in determining the relationship between sustainability and social happiness. Furthermore, an econometric analysis has demonstrated a positive relationship between sustainability and quality of life in Spain. The key factors are safety, trust, income, and accessibility. The findings of this study can provide valuable insights to inform policy decisions aimed at promoting sustainability and enhancing the overall quality of life.

The role of glycoconjugates as receptors for insecticidal proteins,"This review focuses on the role of carbohydrate binding in the toxicity of the most utilized group of Bt pesticidal proteins-three domain Cry (3D-Cry) toxins. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins are an environmentally safe and effective alternative to chemical pesticides and have been used as biopesticides, with great commercial success, for over 50 years. Global agricultural production is predicted to require a 70% increase until 2050 to provide for an increasing population. In addition to agriculture, Bt proteins are utilized to control human vectors of disease-namely mosquitoes-which account for >700 000 deaths annually. The evolution of resistance to Bt pesticial toxins threatens the progression of sustainable agriculture. Whilst Bt protein toxins are heavily utilized, the exact mechanisms behind receptor binding and toxicity are unknown. It is critical to gain a better understanding of these mechanisms in order to engineer novel toxin variants and to predict, and prevent, future resistance evolution.

The role of insulin signaling with FOXO and FOXK transcription factors,"Insulin is an essential hormone for animal activity and survival, and it controls the metabolic functions of the entire body. Throughout the evolution of metazoan animals and the development of their brains, a sustainable energy supply has been essential to overcoming the competition for survival under various environmental stresses. Managing energy for metabolism, preservation, and consumption inevitably involves high oxidative stress, causing tissue damage in various organs. In both mice and humans, excessive dietary intake can lead to insulin resistance in various organs, ultimately displaying metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Insulin signals require thorough regulation to maintain metabolism across diverse environments. Recent studies demonstrated that two types of forkhead-box family transcription factors, FOXOs and FOXKs, are related to the switching of insulin signals during fasting and feeding states. Insulin signaling plays a role in supporting higher activity during periods of sufficient food supply and in promoting survival during times of insufficient food supply. The insulin receptor depends on the tyrosine phosphatase feedback of insulin signaling to maintain adipocyte insulin responsiveness. alpha 4, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), has been shown to play a crucial role in modulating insulin signaling pathways by regulating the phosphorylation status of key proteins involved in these pathways. This short review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular mechanism related to the regulation of insulin signals.",Not About Sufficiency

The experiments were conducted in three replicates with six treatments (four Pseudomonas strains, AMF and control) and three rates of P-fertilizer (0, 75, 150 kg P ha(-1)). Application of higher phosphate rates decreased total antioxidant capacity, total phenolic and flavonols content, whereas AMF and Pseudomonas strains increased quality and P concentration of fruit. The use of AMF and Pseudomonas strains resulted in better quality when used along with 75 kg P ha(-1). These results demonstrated that the rhizospheric microorganisms improved the quality of fruit, especially when they applied in combination with lower rates of chemical fertilizers.

"The second wave of earthworm invasions in North America: biology, environmental impacts, management and control of invasive jumping worms","The invasion of jumping worms, a small group of pheretimoid earthworm species from Asia, has increasingly become an ecological, environmental and conservation issue in forest ecosystems and urban-suburban landscapes around the world. Their presence is often noticed due to their high abundance, distinctive ""jumping"" behavior, and prominent granular casts on the soil surface. Although they are known to affect soil carbon dynamics and nutrient availability, no single paper has summarized their profound impacts on soil biodiversity, plant community, and animals of all trophic groups that rely on soil and the leaf litter layer for habitat, food, and shelter. In this study, we summarize the biology, invasion, and ecological impacts of invasive jumping worms across North America. We highlight potential impacts of this second wave of earthworm invasion, contrast them with the preceding European earthworm invasion in temperate forests in North America, and identify annual life cycle, reproductive and cocoon survival strategies, casting behavior and co-invasion dynamics as the key factors that contribute to their successful invasion and distinct ecological impacts. We then suggest potential management and control strategies for practitioners and policy makers, underscore the importance of coordinated community science projects in tracking the spread, and identify knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to understand and control the invasion.",Not About Sufficiency
The Seven Debtly Sins: An Institutionalist Explanation of Why Consumer Debt Levels are So High,"Consumer debt has risen dramatically in the United States since the early 1980s. Household debt-to-disposable income rose from around 65% in 1980 to 135% in 2022. As we have shown previously, rising debt levels mean that the problem of income inequality is worse than currently thought, and the living standards of Americans are lower than measured. In The Affluent Society, John Kenneth Galbraith builds on Thorstein Veblen's work, The Theory of the Leisure Class, arguing that emulation and persuasion lead not only to more debt but also to an eventual crash and, thus, to greater economic volatility. Excessive debt also makes it harder for people to save for retirement, emergencies, and their children's education, and it exerts a drag on consumer spending overall and economic growth since money used to repay past debt (and the interest on that debt) cannot be used to purchase new goods and services. The article concludes with some institutionalist policy solutions to improve the issuance, repayment, and discharging of household debt in ways that will dampen the destabilization of household finances and the macroeconomy.",Not About Sufficiency
The short and long run effects of land use consolidation programme on farm input uptakes: Evidence from Rwanda,"Food security remains a major concern, as efforts to commercialise and specialise in agricultural production have been constrained. This is partly due to land scarcity, compelling smallholder farmers to operate on fragmented lands. Land reforms that seek to consolidate lands and promote crop specialisation can be welfare-enhancing because they can stimulate investment in agricultural innovation. Rwanda's 2008 land use consolidation (LUC) programme merges parcels of land and promotes crop specialisation. After more than a decade of its implementation, the beckoning question is whether LUC programme has improved technology adoption. Relying on previous three rounds of national survey data, capturing before and after the implementation of LUC pro-gramme, this paper contributes to the literature by (1) assessing the short-and long-run relationships between LUC and improved input uptake and (2) determining what conditions could influence the way LUC impact technology adoption. The result shows that the implementation of LUC leads to uptake of agricultural inputs both in the short-and long-run, but the impact is more in the long run. While in the short run, access to finance and asset ownership act as the underlying conditioning factors, in the long run, the dominant complementary factor is access to credit. These results suggest that there might be underlying structural factors that may inhibit the influence of LUC on technology adoption and hence the attainment of the goal of food security in Rwanda.",Not About Sufficiency
The significance of boring FinTech: technology imaginaries and value vernaculars in established banks,"How do financial professionals work with technological visions of the future of banking? Such visions are prompted by the technology sub-sector known as FinTech, a broad phenomenon of start-ups and technological innovations aimed at financial services markets, characterised by claims that banking could be radically different. Drawing on pragmatic studies of finance and Cornelius Castoriadis's theory of creative imagination, this paper explores the imaginative limits of technology innovation in established banks. Through analysis of semi-structured interviews with banking and FinTech professionals, observations at industry events, and analysis of documents obtained from banks, the findings highlight an interplay between dominant vernaculars of 'strategic value' and organisational imaginaries of traditional banking. This interplay delimits the boundaries of technological imagination through reshaping the moral and temporal claims of FinTech disruption discourse. This entails a move from the moral modality of what should be, found in FinTech disruption narratives, to a modality of what can be; a shift from the dramatic narratives of changing powerful structures, drawing on the discursive repertoires of social movements and religious myths, to the non-heroic, pragmatic expectations of the art of the possible.",Not About Sufficiency

The socio-economic effects of a Marine Protected Area on the ecosystem service of leisure and recreation,"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are an important tool for the maintenance of marine ecosystem functionality and health and ensuring the onward flow of beneficial ecosystem services that support human well-being. Social and economic factors influence whether and how stakeholders exploit resources or cooperate to conserve them. Environmental managers are now turning from designating MPAs to monitoring their effectiveness. Combining spatial analysis with quantitative and qualitative survey methods this research shows that an MPA (Lyme Bay, SW England) has had varying effects on the delivery of the beneficial ecosystem service of leisure and recreation. In the survey years 2008-2011 dive businesses have increased their frequency of activity inside and outside the MPA and report an increase in turnover; though they perceive little or no effect of the MPA on business. Charter boat operators have seen an overall decline in the frequency of activity outside the MPA and an increase inside the MPA. They perceive that the MPA has increasingly had a positive effect on their business. Sea angling activity has declined at sites outside the MPA and increased at sites within the MPA, suggesting a redistribution of spatial activity. Diving activity has increased both inside and outside the MPA. Divers report that the MPA has influenced where they choose to dive. This corresponds to a potential increase in value of the MPA resource (represented as the proportional expenditure and associated turnover by these groups) of 2.2 million. This research demonstrates that the use of the resource has changed following designation and that MPAs can attract a greater proportion of the leisure and recreation expenditure and associated turnover to sites within the MPA boundary. Moving forward it is important to assess effects both inside and outside MPAs. Integrating high quality social science at MPA sites to track effectiveness can help to adapt and refine management strategies to reflect the needs of the stakeholders and support effective conservation.

The spatial structure of Antarctic biodiversity,"Patterns of environmental spatial structure lie at the heart of the most fundamental and familiar patterns of diversity on Earth. Antarctica contains some of the strongest environmental gradients on the planet and therefore provides an ideal study ground to test hypotheses on the relevance of environmental variability for biodiversity. To answer the pivotal question, ""How does spatial variation in physical and biological environmental properties across the Antarctic drive biodiversity?"" we have synthesized current knowledge on environmental variability across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine Antarctic biomes and related this to the observed biotic patterns. The most important physical driver of Antarctic terrestrial communities is the availability of liquid water, itself driven by solar irradiance intensity. Patterns of biota distribution are further strongly influenced by the historical development of any given location or region, and by geographical barriers. In freshwater ecosystems, free water is also crucial, with further important influences from salinity, nutrient availability, oxygenation, and characteristics of ice cover and extent. In the marine biome there does not appear to be one major driving force, with the exception of the oceanographic boundary of the Polar Front. At smaller spatial scales, ice cover, ice scour, and salinity gradients are clearly important determinants of diversity at habitat and community level. Stochastic and extreme events remain an important driving force in all environments, particularly in the context of local extinction and colonization or recolonization, as well as that of temporal environmental variability. Our synthesis demonstrates that the Antarctic continent and surrounding oceans provide an ideal study ground to develop new biogeographical models, including life history and physiological traits, and to address questions regarding biological responses to environmental variability and change.",Not About Sufficiency

The time course of metabolic plasticity and its consequences for growth performance under variable food supply in the northern pike,"Many species up- or downregulate their resting metabolic rate (RMR) when they encounter favourable or unfavourable feeding conditions, respectively. This is thought to promote faster growth when food is abundant and conserve energy reserves when food is scarce. The time it takes to express metabolic plasticity remain little studied. Here, we develop a conceptual model showing how rapid or slow metabolic plasticity alter growth trajectories in response to changes in food supply. We test predictions from the model in a food manipulation experiment with young-of-the-year northern pike, Esox lucius, a species that experience drastic changes in food supply in nature. We find that metabolic plasticity is expressed gradually over several weeks in this species. Rapid changes in food supply thus caused apparent trait-environment mismatches that persisted for at least five weeks. Contrary to predictions, pike grew faster at high food levels when they had previously experienced low food levels and downregulated their RMR. This was not owing to increases in food intake but probably reflected that low RMRs increased the energetic scope for growth when feeding conditions improved. This highlights the important but complex effects of metabolic plasticity on growth dynamics under variable resource levels on ecologically relevant time scales.",Not About Sufficiency
The use of recycled semiconductor material in crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules production - A life cycle assessment of environmental impacts,"To offset the negative impact of photovoltaic modules on the environment, it is necessary to introduce a long-term strategy that includes a complete lifecycle assessment of all system components from the production phase through installation and operation to disposal. Recycling of waste products and worn-out systems is an important element of this strategy. As the conclusions from the previous studies have shown, thermal treatment provides an efficient first step in the recycling process, while chemical treatment was more advantageous in the second step. This study aims to assess the environmental impact of recovering and recycling the valuable semiconductor silicon wafer material from photovoltaic solar cells. A comparison was made between producing new solar cells with or without recycled silicon material. The analysis of the photovoltaic cell life cycle scenario including material recycling presented in this article was performed using SimaPro software and data combined and extended from different LCI databases. The idea is that the use of recycled materials, which were energy-consuming in the primary production stage, allows to meaningly reduce the energy input in the secondary life cycle. All stages of the silicon cell life cycle contribute to the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas emissions reductions through the use of recycled silicon material represented 42%.

The valuation of older adult homecare services under a joint medical-social budgetary perspective,"Background Homecare, a cornerstone of public health, is essential for health systems to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of universal health coverage while maintaining its own sustainability. Notwithstanding homecare's system-level significance, there is a lack of economic evaluations of homecare services in terms of their system-wide cost-savings. Specifically, decisions informed by a joint medical-social budgetary perspective can maximize the allocative efficiency of assigning a diverse service mix to address the complex needs of the older adult population. However, little is known regarding which homecare service mix is most system-wide cost-effective when paired with which clinical profiles.Methods Valuation of homecare's complex interventions was performed under a generalized cost-effectiveness analysis (GCEA) framework with proportional hazard-adjusted metrics representing the common numeraire between medical and social care.Results Instrumental homecare, on its own or combined with either one or both of the other homecare services, yielded the greatest cost savings compared to other services or the lack thereof.

The way to break the resource curse: New evidence from China,"Although the resource curse has achieved much attention in the past few years, very little research has fully demonstrated the influence of resource dependence on environmental sustainability concerning the way to break the resource curse.

Considering the differences in the level of economic development and resource endowments of different countries, it is necessary to explain the cause of the resource curse in developing countries through resource-oriented development. In this regard, this study estimated the role of resource dependence on carbon dioxide emissions (CO2 emissions) in the background of 250 Chinese peripheral cities from 2000 to 2018. The results confirm that resource dependence has significantly accelerated CO2 emissions and the condition of the resource curse may still exist in the view of CO2 emissions at the prefecture level.

Traditionally, the Olympic Movement actively promotes global sport through initiatives such as Olympic education programs, instilling moral dimensions, cultural values, and essential life skills. Recent Olympic Games are scrutinized for their organizers' focus on safety, pandemic management, environmental sustainability, and gender equality. This paper addresses crucial policy options, spanning human rights, social inclusion through sport, and the pervasive issue of inactivity affecting public health. Noteworthy successes in leveraging sports for refugees and combating substance use disorders are discussed, alongside joint efforts by the World Health Organization and the International Olympic Committee, to combat inactivity and promote health through sports. Exploration of gender equality in the Olympic Movement recognizes challenges and suggests actions, including increasing female participation and addressing sexual harassment. The intersection of sports, climate change, and environmental responsibility is examined, with a focus on the ambitious 'climate-positive' goals of the Paris 2024 Olympics. However, since most of the IOC actions are rather symbolic and not substantial, many organizations are called upon to take active initiatives. Actionable recommendations urge countries to prioritize physical activity policies, organize exercise programs, and collaborate across sectors for health and environmental sustainability.

One significant characteristic of this system is its ability to generate hydrogen, which is later combined with the inlet fuel of the gas turbine. This novel methodology presents a more environmentally friendly fuel alternative, showcasing its potential to enhance combustion efficiency in a sustainable manner. To ensure the viability and feasibility of the system, a MATLAB function was utilized for calculating the base case scenario, followed by a GA optimization technique with the aid of a machine learning model to minimize run-time. In the given scenario, the total cost rate is measured at 3726 $/h, with an exergy efficiency of 54% and a normalized CO2 emission of 305 kg/GJ. Following the optimization process, significant enhancements can be observed. The cost rate decreases by 2202 $/h, the exergy efficiency improves from 54% to 55.61%, and the annual CO2 emissions decrease from 133,760 metric tons to 50,320 metric tons. Moreover, the implementation of blended fuel leads to a 10% decrease in normalized CO2 emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
Thermochemical Recycling of Household Polyolefin Waste,"Many plastic wastes, particularly contaminated plastic packaging or fabrics, cannot be easily recycled. Among chemical recycling methods, pyrolysis combines low greenhouse gas emissions with low infrastructure requirements. A shaker reactor was adapted to model rotary kilns for cold start pyrolysis, where the waste is progressively heated, and fluidized beds/stirred reactors for hot start pyrolysis, where the waste is introduced into a hot reactor and kept at a constant temperature. For cold start pyrolysis, no feedstock preprocessing is necessary, and liquid yields of up to 80% by weight (wt %) were achieved, with no observable effect from different vapor residence times. Hot start pyrolysis gave similar yields but is more complex to implement. Thus, cold start pyrolysis is preferred. The hydrocarbon products from both conditions were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Cold start product distributions clustered according to polyethylene and polypropylene-based materials but were unaffected by vapor residence times. The reaction start type did not significantly affect the median molecular carbon count, with the hot start yielding more aromatics. The heat requirements for cold start pyrolysis were 1.0 kJ/g for polyethylene-based feedstocks and 0.8 kJ/g for polypropylene-based feedstocks. This heat may be provided by renewable sources or by combusting less than one-third of the pyrolysis gases.",Not About Sufficiency

Time traveling through research: Bibliometric analysis of biodiversity finance in agricultural sector for SDGs,"Climate change, natural disasters, and harmful human activities adversely affect land fertility, leading to food scarcity and biodiversity loss. However, sustainable biodiversity management in the agricultural sector can be the only solution that requires huge funding. Biodiversity finance can be a way to strengthen the agriculture sector and attain sustainable development goals (SDGs). It is a relatively new concept and is still in its developing stage. It requires an in-depth bibliometric analysis highlighting the past, present, and future trends in the agriculture sector from the SDGs perspective. Therefore, a bibliometric study is conducted from 1985 to 2024. Data is extracted from the Scopus database. Results are evident in the increasing trend of publications and citations. The scope of biodiversity finance is not limited to finance but is also theoretically linked with other areas: economics, environmental, and social sciences. The most prominent SDG for framing the research questions is SDG 15 with SDGs (2, 3, 13, 14). The USA is the most productive country, with the highest multiple and single- country productions, and about 60 % of the top ten institutions are in the USA. It included the network and content analysis to explore the homogeneous research areas and determine potential future directions. Furthermore, the study highlighted four research streams: (1) integrated strategies for agricultural financing, development, and governance, (2) strategic approach to biodiversity conservation and financial management, (3) sustainable development and finance, and (4) biodiversity financing for sustainable agriculture. The findings highlight the significance of financial incentives to support sustainable biodiversity management that can help in agricultural revitalization and accomplishing SDGs.",Not About Sufficiency
Land-use and soil depth affect resource and microbial stoichiometry in a tropical mountain rainforest region of southern Ecuador,"Global change phenomena, such as forest disturbance and land-use change, significantly affect elemental balances as well as the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the importance of shifts in soil nutrient stoichiometry for the regulation of belowground biota and soil food webs have not been intensively studied for tropical ecosystems. In the present account, we examine the effects of land-use change and soil depth on soil and microbial stoichiometry along a land-use sequence (natural forest, pastures of different ages, secondary succession) in the tropical mountain rainforest region of southern Ecuador. Furthermore, we analyzed (PLFA-method) whether shifts in the microbial community structure were related to alterations in soil and microbial stoichiometry. Soil and microbial stoichiometry were affected by both land-use change and soil depth. After forest disturbance, significant decreases of soil C:N:P ratios at the pastures were followed by increases during secondary succession. Microbial C:N ratios varied slightly in response to land-use change, whereas no fixed microbial C:P and N:P ratios were observed. Shifts in microbial community composition were associated with soil and microbial stoichiometry. Strong positive relationships between PLFA-markers 18:2n6,9c (saprotrophic fungi) and 20:4 (animals) and negative associations between 20:4 and microbial N:P point to land-use change affecting the structure of soil food webs. Significant deviations from global soil and microbial C:N:P ratios indicated a major force of land-use change to alter stoichiometric relationships and to structure biological systems. Our results support the idea that soil biotic communities are stoichiometrically flexible in order to adapt to alterations in resource stoichiometry.",Not About Sufficiency
To shake or not to shake: <SUP>13</SUP>C-based evidence on anaerobic methane oxidation in paddy soil,"The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) removes most of the biologically produced methane (CH4) from marine ecosystems before it enters the atmosphere and thus mitigates greenhouse gas emissions. As compared to marine environments, surprisingly little is known about the role of AOM in terrestrial ecosystems. Particularly, how AOM controls the CH4 budget of paddy soils is unexplored, partly reflecting analytical difficulties in analyzing CH4 turnover. To date, the most commonly used method to study AOM in soils is in vitro incubation of microcosms with CH4 injection into the headspace with/without shaking of slurry. Shaking, however, introduces various errors and disturbances. Here we measured AOM in rice paddy soil using a new alternative approach that introduced C-13-labelled CH4 directly into soil slurry via a silicone tube without shaking. The results were compared to those obtained by the classical approaches (i.e., with and without tubes and/or shaking). In all batches, C-13 enrichment of CO2 after (CH4)-C-13 injection clearly confirmed the occurrence of AOM in paddy soil. The cumulative AOM during 84 days reached 0.16-0.24 mu g C g(-1) dry soil without shaking, but it was 33-80% lower with shaking. Unexpectedly, the effect of silicone tubes on AOM was insignificant either with or without shaking, suggesting that the CH4 concentration in water (slurry) was not the main limiting factor for AOM. Without shaking, the controls without CH4 addition revealed a steady increase of CH4 in the headspace/tube, whereas the CH4 concentration in jars with shaking was constantly low during 59 days. This suggests that shaking inhibited methanogenesis. There was a strong linear correlation between the amount of CH4 oxidized and CH4 produced with shaking (R-2 = 0.91), whereas without shaking this relationship followed a power growth regression. Based on the current and reported AOM rates, rough upscale to paddy soils in China showed recycling of ca. 2.0 Tg C of CH4 each year, making AOM a crucial terrestrial CH4 sink.",Not About Sufficiency
"Military expenditures and political regimes: Evidence from global data, 1963-2000","This paper examines the determinants of military expenditures with a special focus on political regimes for more than 130 countries for the period of 1963-2000 by employing a dynamic panel data analysis. The paper aims at contributing to the literature by utilizing a recently constructed political regime data set and controlling for income inequality, a key variable that has not received substantial attention in the context of political regimes, economic growth and military expenditures. Covering a large set of countries and an extended time period, the paper reveals further evidence on the linkage between democracy and military expenditures. Our results yield two crucial facts. First, social democratic political regimes have a tendency to spend less on armaments as a share of the national income; compared to social democracy, all other political regimes are likely to have higher military burdens, confirming previous findings of the negative relationship between level of democracy and military burden. Second, the analysis shows that a higher income inequality is associated with a higher military burden. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
ECOSEL: Multi-objective optimization to sell forest ecosystem services,"ECOSEL is a voluntary market mechanism that attempts to match willing sellers of forest ecosystem services with willing buyers.

The case study is suggestive of one of the most sophisticated uses of ECOSEL that might work for some but not all forest landowners. Examples of less involved uses are also given to illustrate low transaction cost applications both within and beyond forestry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Tourism innovation in the forestry sector: comparative analysis between Auckland Region (New Zealand) and Trentino (Italy),"Innovation is a primary aspect of economic growth and development and depends on the ability of entrepreneurs to create economic value by introducing new products or services, designing different production processes or rearranging organisational practices. The spreading of innovation is a key element in all economic sectors, including the forestry sector. Four types of innovation can be found in the forestry sector: product innovations (e. g., wood assortments), service innovations (e. g., biodiversity conservation and forest recreation), technological innovations (e. g., the introduction of new machinery, such as harvesters, processors or forwarders) and organisational innovations (e. g., changes in the production process or in the firm's organisational structure). In this paper, we focus on service innovations linked to tourism and recreation in the forest using a comparative investigation. In particular, three types of recreational innovations in the forest (adventure parks, educational farms, and cultural attractions) were analysed within two case studies located poles apart (Auckland Region in New Zealand and Trentino in Italy). The results of a questionnaire, submitted during face-to-face interviews, to a sample of New Zealand and Italian entrepreneurs indicated the level of innovation in the forestry sector, the elements of weakness and strength of the innovation process, and the potential of the transferability of novelties into each of the two contexts.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards a broader perspective on the forms of eco-industrial networks,"This paper explores various forms of eco-industrial networks in advancing environmental sustainability. Prior research on environmental sustainability primarily identifies industrial actors as autonomous entities or considers the role of networks in advancing environmental sustainability from a rather narrow perspective. However, the networks of ties in which industrial firms are embedded profoundly impacts not only their own performance, but also the natural environment in which they operate. Based on a systematic literature review, we identify four forms of eco-industrial networks that have the potential to advance environmental sustainability: 1) symbiosis networks, 2) sustainable supply networks, 3) environmental issue networks and 4) environmental solution networks. The paper presents important insights on the operational logic for each of these network forms and the dimensions of their network architecture. The main implications of this comparison are that policy-makers and practitioners need to become aware of the various mechanisms through which inter-organisational networks can reduce environmental load. Furthermore, there is a need to build broad coalitions of organisations that are mobilised to address environmental issues. We suggest that network architecture which maximises its members' capability to self-organise while also including a coordinating organisation can be highly suitable for eco-industrial networks. We also suggest some fruitful avenues for future research on eco-industrial networks. In integrating research on eco-industrial networks with existing research on inter-organisational alliances and networks, the paper provides more understanding on the multifaceted role played by various forms of eco-industrial networks in advancing sustainability.

Towards a Sustainable Future: Economic Cybernetics in Analyzing Romania's Circular Economy,"The Circular Economy represents an essential strategy for a more sustainable future, both for the environment and for the economy and society. The main purpose of this article is to conduct a holistic analysis that highlights Romania's perspectives in the transition and integration process towards the Circular Economy. In this research, we will use economic cybernetics and complex adaptive systems to uncover the complexity of the Circular Economy. Our aim is also to identify the connections and interactions among its various components. To complete this holistic analysis framework, multiple linear regression (MLR) and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models were employed. MLR was applied to assess the impact of variables such as Waste per capita, Recycling rate by region, Labor productivity, Production of environmental goods, and Circular material use rate on real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. The time series are extracted from Eurostat databases and cover the period 2010-2021. Given the results obtained through MLR, we applied the ARDL model to study the long-run and short-run causal impact of independent variables on real GDP per capita. The analysis results led us to create an ARDL model from another perspective, namely, to examine how greenhouse gas emissions from production activities and labor productivity per person employed and hour worked affect the generation of municipal waste per capita. Our study delves into the Circular Economy as a pivotal strategy for fostering sustainability, offering an exhaustive, data-backed analysis of its effects on economic performance and environmental health in Romania. In light of our findings, we strongly recommend that future policy development in Romania should be aligned with the National Strategy for the Circular Economy. This would facilitate a more effective transition to sustainable practices, not only enhancing economic indicators but also reducing environmental impact.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards circular economy in production planning: Challenges and opportunities,"In the actual era of the international trade, global warming and depletion of Earth's natural resources, the willingness to generate sustainable and competitive benefits determines us to stop thinking linearly (produce, consume and dispose) and to shift towards a circular approach by closing material loops. The latter falls within the concept of circular economy that, in turn, derives from reverse logistics. This paper proposes a comprehensive state-of-the-art review around the topic of circular economy and reverse logistics with a particular emphasis on mid-term production planning under discrete time settings. The broad spectrum of reviewed publications is categorized and discussed with respect to the main recovery operations, namely: (i) disassembly for recycling, (ii) from product to raw material recycling, and (iii) by-products and co-production. For each of the aforementioned recovery options, this paper elucidates the related definitions, reviews the mathematical formulations jointly with a structured overview of the solution methods, and discusses their industrial implications. Given the legislative pressure to mitigate environmental impacts caused by production processes, a special attention is paid to the greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. A cross-cutting analysis of the reviewed literature brought forward a number of research gaps and revealed multiple research opportunities to support the development of the circular economy. The key findings show an ever-growing interest in making sustainable the traditional linear industrial processes within a circular economy context. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Towards greater socio-economic equality in allocation of wastewater discharge permits in China based on the weighted Gini coefficient,"Although there are many methods based on efficiency and equality in allocating discharge permits, developing both reasonable and feasible discharge permit allocation methods remains a challenge. This study proposes an allocation method that aims to achieve equitable allocations with respect to population, land area, environmental receiving capacity, and Gross Domestic Product, which are incorporated into a multi-index Gini coefficient. Previous methodological advances are enhanced by assigning weights to each index using the Analytic Hierarchy Process; and by introducing a new Inequality Factor to quantify the residual inequality. These methods are applied to a case study of chemical oxygen demand discharge permit allocation among 13 cities in Jiangsu Province, China. The allocations obtained by optimizing this method reduce the current level of inequality and are considered more feasible for achieving pollution reduction targets than the equal ratio or average amount benchmark methods. In the case study, the Inequality Factor was used to identify the cities that are the greatest beneficiaries and losers under the allocation scheme. A potential option for improving equality is to relax the constraints imposed on the allocation reductions; however little sensitivity to this was found implying that the limits are not barriers to equality. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to exam the uncertainty in the weights, showing significance for individual cities, but low significance for province-level equality. It is concluded that the integrated use of the Weighted Gini coefficient and Inequality Factor can offer new insights into regional and the city-level equality of discharge permit allocations.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards Healthy and Sustainable Human Settlement: Understanding How Local Communities Perceive and Engage with Spa Tourism Development Initiatives in Rural Areas,"This study investigated the intersection of healthy and sustainable human settlement, and land use for spa tourism in rural areas. Recognizing the crucial role of youth in shaping the future of tourism, this research aimed to provide an insight into the young local rural community representatives' perception of sustainable spa tourism development and to identify whether these attitudes are shaped by their socio-demographic characteristics. The applied methodology was the Sustainable Tourism Attitude Scale (SUS-TAS). A total of 254 respondents took part in this research. Using SPSS 30.0.0, the gathered data were subjected to additional analyses based on factor analysis, descriptive statistics, and the general linear model. The results showed a general positive attitude of local community members towards the further development of spa tourism in their communities. The especially important factors were the following: long-term planning of development, environmental protection, negative attitudes towards spa tourism development, economic benefits, as well as community participation. By providing an empirical analysis based on the use of robust tools for measuring youth attitudes, this research offers valuable insights for policymakers, planners, and community leaders into how they can design and implement tourism strategies that align with sustainability principles while fostering local economic development and environmental stewardship. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the broader discussion on developing healthy, sustainable human settlements that balance economic benefits with ecological and social well-being. Synergy/harmony between communities and their natural surroundings is essential for the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of rural human settlements.

"Towards integrated governance for water, health and social-ecological systems: The watershed governance prism","This article proposes a shift toward the integrated governance of watersheds as a basis for fostering health, sustainability and social-ecological resilience. The authors suggest that integrated watershed governance is more likely when different perspectives, including health and well-being, are explicitly understood, communicated, and sought as co-benefits of watershed management. A new conceptual device - the watershed governance prism - is introduced in relation to the multiple facets of governance that characterize contemporary water resources management and examined as an integrative framework to link social and environmental concerns with the determinants of health in the watershed context. The authors assess the diagnostic and communicative potential of such a framework, discussing its utility as a concise depiction of multiple, interacting policy priorities and as a guide to integrate different research and policy domains into the governance of water, health and social-ecological systems.

Towards more biomimetic and sustainable infant formula: challenges and future opportunities,"Background: Infant formula (IF) requires further optimization as there are still differences in health consequences between human milk (HM) and IF. Scope and approach: The present review addresses the challenges and future opportunities inherent in the pro-duction of more biomimetic and sustainable IF. After presenting the targets, limitations and challenges for IF optimization, process innovations that could contribute to designing the next-generation of IF are discussed. The final section describes how such improvements should be addressed by means of a more systemic approach. Key findings and conclusions: Gaps in our knowledge of the compounds and structures in HM and their effects on digestion and health still exist, rendering the biomimicry of HM more difficult. Overall, optimizing IF is complex and requires trade-offs between synergistic and conflicting objectives, which include HM biomimicry, safety, functionality, ingredient sourcing as well as environmental, economic and social sustainability issues. Process innovations and optimized technological routes, including minimal processing, offer opportunities to implement new ingredients and improve the preservation of IF compounds, while ensuring microbial safety and addressing several pillars of sustainability through energy costs or reductions in gas emissions. Given the complexity of producing biomimetic and sustainable IF, a multi-objective optimization strategy is proposed, reliant on a multidisciplinary approach, where nutrition and process engineering would play pivotal roles with assistance from other disciplinaries such as biochemistry, microbiology, pediatric medicine, data and consumer sciences and public health.

Tradeoffs and synergies of optimized management for maximizing carbon sequestration across complex landscapes and diverse ecosystem services,"Forest natural climate solutions such as improved forest management and reforestation have been identified as a cost-effective way to mitigate climate change. Several US states have GHG reduction policies, often citing forests as a key to meeting mitigation targets despite not knowing how specific practices impact carbon and other forest ecosystem services at the regional level. In response, we link a regional forest landscape model (LANDIS -II) with economic and policy data to assess how shifting forest management in Maine, USA, impacts the region's future carbon sequestration, timber supply, biodiversity, and landowner returns. Scenario analysis results show consistent tradeoffs between carbon sequestration and timber supply, with impacts diminished when managers shift to a land-sparing and balanced management approach consisting of permanent set -asides and intensive clearcut with planting regimes. We also estimate that carbon sequestration can increase by 15-25% over the reference case while still maintaining harvest levels by shifting to a broader mix of intensive and extensive practices. Further, we estimate that harvests could grow by 20% above the baseline and still positively affect forest carbon. In all cases, shifts in practices had a mixed impact on biodiversity due to the diverse habitat indicators evaluated for this study. Overall, we find that changes in forest management can lead to improved outcomes for both carbon and other forest ecosystem services of interest, provided managers are given the policy, economic, and social incentives to do so.",Not About Sufficiency
Transcriptional networks revealed late embryogenesis abundant genes regulating drought mitigation in aromatic Keteki Joha rice,"Climate change has become increasingly intertwined with the occurrence and severity of droughts. As global temperatures rise due to greenhouse gas emissions, weather patterns are altered, leading to shifts in precipitation levels and distribution. These exacerbate the risk of drought in many regions, with potentially devastating consequences. A comprehensive transcriptome analysis was performed on Keteki Joha, an aromatic rice from North East India, with the aim of elucidating molecular responses to drought. Numerous genes linked to drought were activated, with both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways playing crucial roles. Upregulated genes were enriched with gene ontology terms with response to abscisic acid and abscisic acid-activated signalling pathway, suggesting the existence of an ABA-dependent pathway for drought mitigation. The upregulated genes were also enriched with responses to stress, water, heat, jasmonic acid, and hydrogen peroxide, indicating the presence of an ABA-independent pathway alongside the ABA-dependent mechanism. Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified 267 genes that specifically govern drought mitigation in Keteki Joha. The late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) gene family emerges as the most overrepresented in both RNA sequencing data and WGCNA analysis, suggesting their dominant role in mitigating drought. Notably, 31 LEA genes were induced in seedlings and 32 in mature stages under drought stress. The LEA3-1, LEA14/WSI18, RAB16A, RAB16B, DHN1, DHN6, LEA1, LEA3, LEA17, and LEA33 exhibited and established co-expression with numerous other drought stress-related genes, indicating their inseparable role in alleviating drought.

Transition Metal Ion Doping on ZIF-8 Enhances the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction,"The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to diverse value-added chemicals is a unique, environmentally friendly approach for curbing greenhouse gas emissions while addressing sluggish catalytic activity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) of electrocatalysts. Here, zeolite-imidazolate-frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) containing various transition metal ions-Ni, Fe, and Cu-at varying concentrations upon doping are fabricated for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to carbon monoxide (CO) without further processing. Atom coordination environments and theoretical electrocatalytic performance are scrutinized via X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon optimized Cu doping on ZIF-8, Cu0.5Zn0.5/ZIF-8 achieves a high partial current density of 11.57 mA cm(-2) and maximum FE for CO of 88.5% at -1.0 V (versus RHE) with a stable catalytic activity over 6 h. Furthermore, the electron-rich sp(2) C atom facilitates COOH* promotion after Cu doping of ZIF-8, leading to a local effect between the zinc-nitrogen (Zn-N-4) and copper-nitrogen (Cu-N-4) moieties.

Translating MC2 DGVM Results into Ecosystem Services for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,"Ecosystem services (ES) were conceived to emphasize the role of ecological processes in supporting societal needs and to allow their inclusion in the decision-making process. Currently climate change mitigation is one of the most important services ecosystems can provide to enhance sinks of greenhouse gas emissions as the planet warms and related extreme events take their toll on societies. Because ES cannot always be directly measured and because measurements are often cost prohibitive, process-based models are used to estimate their supply, delivery and/or value. We ran the MC2 dynamic global vegetation model for the conterminous US with/without land use for several future scenarios. We translated results into key ES such as carbon sequestration, which contributes to climate regulation, into a regulatory service or aboveground forest carbon into timber biomass, a provisioning service, and evaluated constraints to maintain them.

Transmission of antibiotic resistance through organic amendments in arable land: A 3-year field study with pigeonpea -wheat cropping system,"The worldwide emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a substantial risk to human health and environmental stability. In agriculture, organic amendments (derived from organic sources such as manure, and plant residues) are beneficial in restoring soil properties and providing essential nutrients to crops but raise concerns about harboring antibiotic resistance, which emphasizes the need for vigilant monitoring and strategic interventions in their application. The current study assessed the impact of farming practices (organic and conventional) in a three-year field experiment with pigeonpea-wheat cropping system, focusing on the transmission of AMR using culture-dependent and -independent approaches, and soil nutrient content.

Trends in Satellite Earth Observation for Permafrost Related Analyses-A Review,"Climate change and associated Arctic amplification cause a degradation of permafrost which in turn has major implications for the environment. The potential turnover of frozen ground from a carbon sink to a carbon source, eroding coastlines, landslides, amplified surface deformation and endangerment of human infrastructure are some of the consequences connected with thawing permafrost. Satellite remote sensing is hereby a powerful tool to identify and monitor these features and processes on a spatially explicit, cheap, operational, long-term basis and up to circum-Arctic scale. By filtering after a selection of relevant keywords, a total of 325 articles from 30 international journals published during the last two decades were analyzed based on study location, spatio-temporal resolution of applied remote sensing data, platform, sensor combination and studied environmental focus for a comprehensive overview of past achievements, current efforts, together with future challenges and opportunities. The temporal development of publication frequency, utilized platforms/sensors and the addressed environmental topic is thereby highlighted.

Distinct geographical study hot spots were revealed, while at the same time large portions of the continuous permafrost zone are still only sparsely covered by satellite remote sensing investigations. Moreover, studies related to Arctic greenhouse gas emissions in the context of permafrost degradation appear heavily underrepresented. New tools (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)), methodologies (e.g., deep learning or data fusion etc.) and satellite data (e.g., the Methane Remote Sensing LiDAR Mission (Merlin) and the Sentinel-fleet) will thereby enable future studies to further investigate the distribution of permafrost, its thermal state and its implications on the environment such as thermokarst features and greenhouse gas emission rates on increasingly larger spatial and temporal scales.",Not About Sufficiency
Tropical forest carbon assessment: integrating satellite and airborne mapping approaches,"Large-scale carbon mapping is needed to support the UNFCCC program to reduce deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). Managers of forested land can potentially increase their carbon credits via detailed monitoring of forest cover, loss and gain (hectares), and periodic estimates of changes in forest carbon density (tons ha(-1)). Satellites provide an opportunity to monitor changes in forest carbon caused by deforestation and degradation, but only after initial carbon densities have been assessed. New airborne approaches, especially light detection and ranging (LiDAR), provide a means to estimate forest carbon density over large areas, which greatly assists in the development of practical baselines. Here I present an integrated satellite-airborne mapping approach that supports high-resolution carbon stock assessment and monitoring in tropical forest regions. The approach yields a spatially resolved, regional state-of-the-forest carbon baseline, followed by high-resolution monitoring of forest cover and disturbance to estimate carbon emissions. Rapid advances and decreasing costs in the satellite and airborne mapping sectors are already making high-resolution carbon stock and emissions assessments viable anywhere in the world.",Not About Sufficiency
"Tropical forest cover dynamics for Latin America using Earth observation data: a review covering the continental, regional, and local scale","The tropical forest cover has varied greatly over the last few decades. The rapid advance of agricultural crops and illegal clearings in natural areas has resulted in the conversion of the majority of the world's forest into desolated patches. Although rates of deforestation have decreased compared to previous years, forest loss still remains a crucial concern. Latest studies conducted on a global scale identified the Latin American continent as one of the regions exhibiting the highest rates of deforestation in the world.

"Tropical savanna conversion to exotic pastures negatively affects taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetle assemblages, but not dung removal","1. The replacement of natural systems with agricultural lands is the main factor resulting in land use change in tropical regions. Tropical savannas cover more than 20% of the global land surface, and one-fifth of the world's population depends directly on these systems.2. Here, we aim to understand how the conversion of tropical savanna into exotic pastures affects the taxonomic and functional metrics of communities and dung removal, using dung beetles as a focal group in a biodiversity hotspot-the Brazilian Cerrado biome. We used species richness, abundance, total biomass, and species composition as assemblage metrics, and functional richness, equitability and dispersion indices, and functional composition as functional diversity metrics.3. The replacement of native savanna with exotic pastures negatively affected taxonomic and functional metrics, suggesting a simplified system where some disturbance-tolerant species become dominant.

Optimal stimulation of Citrus reticulate for bioenergy extraction in MFCs and antioxidant activity via traditional Chinese medicine processing methods,"Background: Value added production of polyphenolic rich citrus peels in the form of agricultural waste valorization and as a medicinal herb holds exceptional practicality. Potential applications as natural electron shuttles for bioenergy production further valorizes citrus peels in a bid to promote sustainable energy generation. This first-attempt study thus tended to decipher the stimulating effects of traditional medicinal processing methods to augment the electron mediating capabilities of Citrus reticulate peels.Methods: Dried C. reticulate peels were subjected to stir-frying with individual adjuvants (e.g., vinegar, honey, soil, and bran) and analyzed via phytochemical analysis, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, microbial fuel cells were used to evaluate the electron shuttling characteristics of the processed C. reticulate for bioenergy extraction. Significant findings: It was indicated that solid adjuvants (e.g., bran and soil) coupled with stir-frying were found to increase the phytochemical content (e.g., total phenols, flavonoids, and condensed tannins) of C. reticulate peels. Consequently, according to comparative analysis, bran stir-fried extracts with optimal processing methods further stimulate the ES characteristics of C. reticulate for bioenergy extraction. Enhanced power generation capacity was attributed to the chemical and physical changes of the bioactive compounds as a result of the processing methods. Furthermore, principal component analysis reveals that FRAP assay and total flavonoid content serve as a preliminary investigation for revealing the electron transport characteristics of C. reticulate.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimization of the Thermal Insulation Level of Residential Buildings in the Almaty Region of Kazakhstan,"Kazakhstan is country rich in energy resources, but to raise the living standards of the country's population, the government regulates prices of heating energy, which are significantly lower comparing to those in the global energy market. Such an approach encourages the construction of residential buildings without concern for their energy efficiency, which significantly increases energy consumption in the sector and leads to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions into the environment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the impact of regulated low prices of heating energy on long-term energy use in buildings, to determine optimal levels of building thermal insulation at current energy prices and following global energy price trends, and to demonstrate the impact of more efficient building thermal insulation on heating energy consumption from a long-time perspective. The cost-optimal method used in EU countries was chosen for the optimization of building thermal insulation and energy consumption to compare the impact of energy prices on the optimal thermal insulation of buildings. The results of the study showed that maintaining low energy prices hinders the implementation of energy-efficient solutions in buildings and does not provide an economic justification for prolonging the heating season by ensuring the quality of the indoor microclimate. As a practical result of this study, a recommendation was made to introduce optimal thermal insulation requirements in building regulations and to redistribute part of the energy subsidies for implementation of energy-efficient measures in the residential building sector.",Not About Sufficiency
Two N-visualisation tools: game versus reality,"This article describes two different visualisation instruments that can be used for awareness raising and educational purposes: Nitrogenius and the N-visualisation tool. Both instruments aim to convey the complex interactions that occur in the nitrogen (N) cycle and the need for integrated measures when aiming to reduce N-related environmental problems such as eutrophication, acidification or global warming. Nitrogenius was developed in the year 2000. This four-player computer ""game"" focuses on the Dutch N problems caused by N2O, NH3 and NOx emissions as well as nitrate in surface and ground water. Underlying the glossy user interface is a set of comprehensive models and a database with potential measures that were considered to be feasible at the time. Since 2000, the model has been used for educational purposes annually at Wageningen University. About 150 MSc students played the game, with the aim to solve the N-related problems in the Netherlands. This article analyses these games, and presents the surprising correlation for the period 2000-2007 with the actual environmental trends in the Netherlands. The second tool is an N- visualisation tool that was developed in 2007. This tool provides both a historic overview of the nitrogen issue and demonstrates the effect of seven potential measures on the world wide N cycle. The effects of increased biomass use and intensification of agriculture are examples of included measures. The net effect on global warming, food availability and biodiversity are output parameters of this instrument. The calculations and assumptions underlying this tool are easily accessible through an open source spreadsheet. This tool was used in 2008 and 2009 at Wageningen University for educational purposes.

Type II methanotrophs: A promising microbial cell-factory platform for bioconversion of methane to chemicals,"Methane, the predominant element in natural gas and biogas, represents a promising alternative to carbon feedstocks in the biotechnological industry due to its low cost and high abundance. The bioconversion of methane to value-added products can enhance the value of gas and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Methanotrophs, methane-utilizing bacteria, can make a significant contribution to the production of various valuable biofuels and chemicals from methane. Type II methanotrophs in comparison with Type I methanotrophs have distinct advantages, including high acetyl-CoA flux and the co-incorporation of two important greenhouse gases (methane and CO2), making it a potential microbial cell-factory platform for methane-derived biomanufacturing. Herein, we review the most recent advances in Type II methanotrophs related to multi-omics studies and metabolic engineering.

Life cycle assessment of enzymatic poly(ethylene terephthalate) recycling,"Enzymatic hydrolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a chemical recycling approach intended to enable a circular economy for polyesters. To quantitatively compare this technology to other recycling and synthesis approaches for PET, it is critical to conduct rigorous and transparent process analyses. We recently reported a detailed process model that was used to conduct economic, energy, and greenhouse gas emissions analyses for enzymatic PET recycling. Here, we expand upon this previous work by conducting a process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) of the same enzymatic hydrolysis system, to produce both terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) for use in a closed-loop PET recycling scheme. This LCA shows that enzymatic hydrolysis currently performs 1.2 to 17 times worse than virgin TPA and PET production across most impact categories, excepting ecotoxicity and fossil fuel depletion. The top contributors to these impacts include post-consumer PET collection and processing, sodium hydroxide, and electricity. Sensitivity analysis shows that improving yields throughout the recycling process and eliminating certain process steps, such as amorphization pre-treatment and reaction pH control, can reduce the overall environmental impacts of enzymatic PET recycling to levels statistically equivalent to virgin TPA and PET production, thereby highlighting crucial areas for further research and innovation.",Not About Sufficiency
"Exploring the historical roots, advantages and efficacy of phage therapy in plant diseases management","In the drug -resistance era, phage therapy has received considerable attention from worldwide researchers. Phage therapy has been given much attention in public health but is rarely applied to control plant diseases. Herein, we discuss phage therapy as a biocontrol approach against several plant diseases. The emergence of antibiotic resistance in agriculturally important pathogenic bacteria and the toxic nature of different synthetic compounds used to control microbes has driven researchers to rethink the century -old strategy of phage therapy"". Compared to other treatment strategies, phage therapy offers remarkable advantages such as high specificity, less chances of drug resistance, non -harmful nature, and benefit to soil microbial flora. The optimizations and protective formulations of phages are significant accomplishments; however, steps towards a better understanding of the physiologic characteristics of phages need to be preceded to commercialize their use. The future of phage therapy in the context of plant disease management is promising and could play a significant role in sustainable agriculture. Ongoing research will likely affirm the safety of phage therapy, ensuring that it does not harm non -target organisms, including beneficial soil microbes. Phage therapy could become vital in addressing global food security challenges, particularly in regions heavily impacted by plant bacterial diseases. Efforts to create formulations that enhance the stability and shelf -life of phages will be crucial, especially for their use in varied environmental conditions.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the socioeconomic drivers of deforestation in Bangladesh: The case of Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary and its surrounding community,"Bangladesh is experiencing deforestation within its protected forest areas (PAs). One reason for its inability to stem deforestation is the lack of a proper understanding of the deforestation process and the drivers responsible for it. This study aims to elucidate the socioeconomic factors influencing deforestation within a PA on the coast of Bangladesh known as Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS). In the quest to understand the drivers of deforestation, the extent of community involvement in the deforestation process was explored. The local community was grouped based on their involvement in various deforestation drivers. These groups were then compared to determine the socioeconomic factors influencing the likelihood of their involvement in deforestation. The community survey covered 10% of households in the community surrounding TWS and involved interviewing 5769 household heads. This study found that 2150 households (37% of all surveyed households) were engaged in fuelwood collection, 623 (11%) were encroaching on the TWS, and 506 (9%) were cultivating betel leaves. Therefore, 45% of households were engaged in some form of deforestation driver. Among the socioeconomic factors, new households with small properties had a higher likelihood of being involved in deforestation drivers. Moreover, comparatively poor households had a significantly higher probability of being engaged in deforestation. Regarding occupations, farmers and laborers had a higher likelihood of being associated with deforestation. This study sheds light on the complex interplay of socioeconomic factors influencing the deforestation process occurring within a specific PA in Bangladesh under existing forest policies. This understanding can be useful for policymakers and forest managers in developing effective forest policies and managing forests more sustainably.",Not About Sufficiency
Uncertainties in the 20th century carbon budget associated with land use change,"Uncertainties in the 20th century carbon budget associated with the treatment of land use change (LUC) are assessed using the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) first-generation Earth System Model (CanESM1). Eight coupled climate carbon cycle simulations are performed using different reconstructions of 1850-2000 land cover derived from historical information on changes in cropland and pasture area. The simulations provide estimates of the emissions associated with LUC, the relative contribution of changes in cropland and pasture to LUC emissions and the uncertainty associated with differences among historical data sets of crop area as well as in the manner in which the historical land cover data are constructed. The resulting estimates of the amount of biomass deforested over the 1850-2000 period range from 63 to 145 Pg C with cumulative implied LUC emissions ranging from 40 to 77 Pg C. These values of LUC emissions are considerably lower than Houghton's estimate of 156 Pg C. The year 2000 atmospheric CO2 concentration ranges between 371.1 +/- 3.7 ppm depending on the data set used and the manner in which historical land cover is constructed. This compares to the observed value of 369.6 ppm at Mauna Loa and is 17.3 +/- 6.3 ppm larger than for simulations without LUC. Although increases in cropland result in the expected increase in LUC emissions, changes in pasture area decrease these emissions because of carbon sequestration in soils.",Not About Sufficiency
Understanding the behaviour of house prices and household income per capita in South Africa: application of the asymmetric autoregressive distributed lag model,"Purpose Homeownership provides shelter and is a vital component of wealth, and house purchase signifies a lifetime achievement for many households. For South Africa confronted with social and structural challenges, homeownership by the low and lower middle-income household is pivotal for its structural transformation process. In spite of these potential benefits, research on the affordable housing market in the context of South Africa is limited. This study aims to contribute to this knowledge gap by answering the question ""do changes in household income per capita have a symmetric or asymmetric effect on affordable house prices?"" Design/methodology/approach A survey of the international literature on house prices and income revealed that linear modelling that assumes symmetric reaction of macroeconomic variables dominates the empirical strategy. This linearity assumption is restrictive and fails to capture possible asymmetric dynamics inherent in the housing market. The authors address this empirical limitation by using asymmetric non-linear autoregressive distributed lag models that can test and detect the existence of asymmetry in both the long and short run using data from 1985Q1 to 2016Q3. Findings The results revealed the presence of an asymmetric long-run relationship between affordable house prices and household income per capita. The estimated asymmetric long-run coefficients of logIncome[+] and logIncome[-] are 1.080 and -4.354, respectively, implying that a 1% increase/decrease in household income per capita induces a 1.08% rise/4.35% decline in affordable house prices everything being equal. The positive increase in affordable house prices creates wealth, helps low and middle-income household climb the property ladder and can reduce inequality, which provides support for the country's structural transformation process. Conversely, a decline in affordable house prices tends to reduce wealth and widen inequality. Practical implications This paper recommends both supply- and demand-side policies to support affordable housing development. Supply-side stimulants should include incentives to attract developers to affordable markets such as municipal serviced land and tax credit. Demand-side policy should focus on asset-based welfare policy; for example, the current Finance Linked Income Subsidy Programme (FLISP). Efficient management and coordination of the FLISP are essential to enhance the affordability of first-time buyers. Given the enormous size of the affordable property market, the practice of mortgage securitization by financial institutions should be monitored, as a persistent decline in income can trigger a systemic risk to the economy. Social implications The study results illustrate the importance of homeownership by low- and middle-income households and that the development of the affordable market segment can boost wealth creation and reduce residential segregation. This, in turn, provides support to the country's structural transformation process. Originality/value The affordable housing market in South Africa is of strategic importance to the economy, accounting for 71.4% of all residential properties. Homeownership by low and lower middle-income households creates wealth, reduces wealth inequality and improves revenue collection for local governments. This paper contributes to the empirical literature by modelling the asymmetric behaviour of affordable house prices to changes in household income per capita and other macroeconomic fundamentals. Based on available evidence, this is the first attempt to examine the dynamic asymmetry between affordable house prices and household income per capita in South Africa.",Not About Sufficiency
Universities and social innovation for global sustainable development as seen from the south,"Potential contributions of universities to social innovation are explored with special attention to Southern countries. The normative guide is the notion of Sustainable Human Development understood as stressing the agency of least-advantaged sectors. The main challenges stem from decreasing sustainability and increasing inequality. Their impacts are highly dependent on how the tension between economic growth and environmental protection is managed. Improving actual perspectives demands harnessing advanced knowledge to foster inclusive and frugal innovation. For this to occur, universities need to be main actors. The context in which they act is analyzed with reference to the National Systems of Innovation conceptualization. Possible evolutions of universities as agents of social innovation are discussed with the aid of the Multi-Level Perspective. The importance of the Southern experience of innovating in scarcity conditions is highlighted and illustrated with the specific experience of a Latin American university.

Unlocking Synergies: Sufficiency Economy Philosophy for Sustainability,"The 2030 Agenda, represented by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), signifies a global commitment to peace, prosperity, and sustainability. However, the lack of a unified strategy has slowed progress, raising concerns about meeting the 2030 deadline. Thailand's progress toward the SDGs has been influenced by various factors, including the role of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP). This study uses corporate-level data and Refinitiv ESG ratings as proxies for sustainability performance to assess the impact of SEP score, as a proxy for SEP disclosure, on corporate sustainability. We find that Thai firms with higher SEP scores tend to exhibit better sustainability performance, especially in the environmental and governance dimensions. Our analyses reveal a causal relationship between SEP scores and corporate sustainability performance, with a one standard deviation increase in the SEP score leading to a 35% increase in sustainability performance. The findings support our hypothesis that SEP fosters stakeholder engagement and long-term value creation while aligning corporate strategies with sustainability goals, thereby contributing to the SDGs.

This commentary contends that nature-based activities (NBAs) have a potentially important, but currently neglected, role to play in supporting those experiencing eco-anxiety. However, existing research limitations hinder their adoption in the United Kingdom's social prescribing agenda and they remain a largely untapped therapeutic resource that need to be mainstreamed into clinical and social care provision.

Untargeted metabolomic profiling of Sphagnum fallax reveals novel antimicrobial metabolites,"Sphagnum mosses dominate peatlands by employing harsh ecosystem tactics to prevent vascular plant growth and microbial degradation of these large carbon stores. Knowledge about Sphagnum-produced metabolites, their structure and their function, is important to better understand the mechanisms, underlying this carbon sequestration phenomenon in the face of climate variability. It is currently unclear which compounds are responsible for inhibition of organic matter decomposition and the mechanisms by which this inhibition occurs. Metabolite profiling of Sphagnum fallax was performed using two types of mass spectrometry (MS) systems and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR). Lipidome profiling was performed using LC-MS/MS. A total of 655 metabolites, including one hundred fifty-two lipids, were detected by NMR and LC-MS/MS-329 of which were novel metabolites (31 unknown lipids). Sphagum fallax metabolite profile was composed mainly of acid-like and flavonoid glycoside compounds, that could be acting as potent antimicrobial compounds, allowing Sphagnum to control its environment. Sphagnum fallax metabolite composition comparison against previously known antimicrobial plant metabolites confirmed this trend, with seventeen antimicrobial compounds discovered to be present in Sphagnum fallax, the majority of which were acids and glycosides. Biological activity of these compounds needs to be further tested to confirm antimicrobial qualities. Three fungal metabolites were identified providing insights into fungal colonization that may benefit Sphagnum. Characterizing the metabolite profile of Sphagnum fallax provided a baseline to understand the mechanisms in which Sphagnum fallax acts on its environment, its relation to carbon sequestration in peatlands, and provide key biomarkers to predict peatland C store changes (sequestration, emissions) as climate shifts.",Not About Sufficiency
Unveiling Anxiety Factors in Orthorexia Nervosa: A Qualitative Exploration of Fears and Coping Strategies,"Orthorexia nervosa represents a controversial phenomenon in the realm of eating practices, characterized by an obsessive fixation on consuming only foods deemed 'healthy', and a preoccupation with food purity. While the existing literature has identified the presence of stressful behaviors among individuals with orthorexia, the precise factors and circumstances eliciting these stress-inducing emotions remain the subject of ongoing inquiry. This study aims to explore the triggers and situations that precipitate stressful beliefs and emotions among individuals who self-identify as preoccupied with healthy eating, as well as the coping mechanisms developed to manage these feelings. Through conducting one-to-one interviews with thirteen individuals, thematic analysis was employed to elucidate the nuances of their experiences. Participants articulated concerns regarding the contamination of foods available in supermarkets and restaurants, thereby prompting the meticulous selection of food sources and aversion to dining out. The prospect of trying new foods and engaging in social gatherings involving food emerged as anxiety-inducing scenarios, prompting individuals to adhere to monotonous dietary patterns and impose self-isolation. Additionally, medical appointments were perceived as stressful, driven by health concerns underpinning the adoption of stringent dietary practices. These findings underscore the spectrum of fears and coping mechanisms exhibited by individuals with orthorexia nervosa, which hold profound implications for their overall well-being.",Not About Sufficiency
Upturn in secondary forest clearing buffers primary forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon,"Brazil contains two-thirds of remaining Amazonian rainforests and is responsible for the most Amazon forest loss. Primary forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon has declined considerably since 2004 but secondary forest loss has never been quantified. We use a recently developed high-resolution land use/land cover dataset to track secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon over 14 yr, providing the first estimates of secondary forest loss for the region. We find that secondary forest loss increased by (187 +/- 48)% from 2008 to 2014. Moreover, the proportion of total forest loss accounted for by secondary forests rose from (37 +/- 3)% in 2000 to (72 +/- 5)% in 2014. The recent acceleration in secondary forests loss occurred across the entire region and was not driven simply by increasing secondary forest area but probably a conscious preferential shift towards clearance of a little-protected forest ecosystem (secondary forests). Our results suggest that secondary forests loss has eased deforestation pressure on primary forests. However, this has been at the expense of a lost carbon sequestration opportunity of 2.59-2.66 Pg C over our study period. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon affects both older (primary) and younger (secondary) forests. This study finds that most forest loss over the period 2008-2014 was from secondary forests and that the almost 190% rise in deforestation buffered losses from primary forests.",Not About Sufficiency

Use of waste derived fuels in cement industry: a review,"Purpose - Cement production has advanced greatly in the last few decades. The traditional fuels used in traditional kilns include coal, oil, petroleum coke, and natural gas. Energy costs and environmental concerns have encouraged cement companies worldwide to evaluate to what extent conventional fuels can be replaced by waste materials, such as waste oils, mixtures of non-recycled plastics and paper, used tires, biomass wastes, and even wastewater sludge. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The work is based on literature review. Findings - The clinker firing process is well suited for various alternative fuels (AF); the goal is to optimize process control and alternative fuel consumption while maintaining clinker product quality. The potential is enormous since the global cement industry produces about 3.5 billion tons that consume nearly 350 million tons of coal-equivalent fossil and AF. This study has shown that several cement plants have replaced part of the fossil fuel used by AF, such waste recovered fuels. Many years of industrial experience have shown that the use of wastes as AF by cement plants is both ecologically and economically justified. Originality/value - The substitution of fossil fuels by AF in the production of cement clinker is of great importance both for cement producers and for society because it conserves fossil fuel reserves and, in the case of biogenic wastes, reduces greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the use of AF can help to reduce the costs of cement production.",Not About Sufficiency

Utilization of Biomass at the Recycling of Heavy Metal Containing Wastes,"Metal production and recycling industries are typically characterized by a high demand on energy. Besides this, in the reduction processes necessary in metallurgy, high amounts of reducing agents are also used in this field of the industry. Normally this high demand on carbon is covered by fossil carbonaceous materials, which results in high amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn enhance global warming. For that reason, companies are being forced by environmental legislation to reduce their carbon footprint. Therefore, one option would be the substitution of fossil based materials with carbon-neutral alternatives. In order to describe some approaches, two options for the utilization of reducing agents based on biomass in heavy metal recycling processes are described in this paper. For that reason biomasses from agriculture like different tree cuttings were converted into metallurgical charcoal by means of a special carbonization reactor. With these charcoals electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) was reduced and recycled in a lab-scale rotary kiln. Furthermore, the by-product of the carbonization process-the pyrolysis gas-was used for the treatment of Waelz slag in a retort process. In both cases, nearly the entire zinc contained in the residue (EAFD and Waelz slag) could be recovered by means of alternative reducing agents. In the retort process also the iron in the remaining slag could be highly metalized. With such a replacement of fossil materials, the CO2 emissions from current dirty industry sectors such as heavy metal recycling can be dramatically reduced. This could lead special industries to be pioneers in matters of environmental protection.",Not About Sufficiency

Valorization of microalgae fermentation waste for a close-loop process,"Heterotrophic microalgae culture has given new insights to the commercial biomass and biofuel production. Ultrahigh density microalgae cultures have been reported by many studies in this decade, while the waste management has not been comprehensively addressed in this regime and now a critical environmental concern. For this purpose, current review has attempted to design a close-loop fermentation process by recycling of water and nutrients from waste stream (spent culture media and lipid extracted microalgae biomass slurry) to the secondary microalgae fermentation. The idea of close-loop process is novelty of this study, which has been addressed by qualitative analysis of the existing studies in the fields of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic microalgae cultures along with bacterial and yeast fermentation. Secondary fermentation has challenges of heat based sterilization, excessive salts, organic growth inhibitors, carbon to nitrogen ratio, and turbidity. These problems are resolvable by effective pretreatments (membrane separation, activated carbon and enzymatic hydrolysis), nutrient alternatives and non-heat based sterilization processes. At the end, application of close-loop microalgae fermentation is concluded to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication, raw material consumption and biomass production cost of the scale-up heterotrophic microalgae fermentation.

Four different thermal degradation stages were considered to get the kinetic triplets from its pyrolysis. The activation energy was obtained for each stage of thermal decomposition utilizing four classical isoconversional methods (Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, and Starink). The activation energies obtained through these isoconversional methods for the four valorization zones of R. hookeri were in the range of 151.15-192.62 kJ mol-1. The pre-exponential factor (A) showing the chemical nature of each reaction step was extracted from the kinetic compensation effect and has values in the range of 1.99 x 1020 to 2.63 x 1012 min-1. The thermodynamic parameters revealed the non-spontaneous, endothermic and complex nature of the pyrolysis process of Rhizoclonium biomass. The thermokinetic data showed that Rhizoclonium biomass has bioenergy potential like other macroalgae and is a suitable feedstock for the large-scale pyrolysis process.

We propose a transfer function in which developing countries are linearly rewarded for having a positive stock of forest, and where the amount of donations is negatively related to the rate of deforestation. This transfer function enables the international community to improve long-term forest conservation as well as the rate of deforestation during the adjustment period.",Not About Sufficiency
Vanadium-lithium alumina a potential additive for coke oxidation by CO2 in the presence of O2 during FCC catalyst regeneration,"The possibility of performing the regeneration of spent fluid catalytic cracking catalysts in rich CO2 atmosphere can simultaneously reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce CO for sequential uses. Herein alumina modified by vanadium and lithium was revealed a remarkable catalyst (or additive) for this goal. High CO2 conversion was observed in the presence of helium (for instance at 720 and 800 degrees C, 39 and 76% of CO2 was converted during the first 5 min of reaction respectively) and it was reduced by less than 5% in the presence of oxygen. Moreover the catalyst works effectively regardless the coke type on spent catalyst, i.e. produced by means of hydrocarbon or bio feed cracking. This catalyst was tested as an additive and works properly up to one part to ten of spent USY. By means of either labeled CO2 or coke (both with carbon 13) it was shown that primary (CO2)-C-13 forms (CO)-C-13 followed by oxygen mobility between alumina and USY promoting coke oxidation. (CO2)-C-12 formed in-situ similarly to (CO2)-C-13 readily reacts with coke producing CO. These effects improve the coke burning by CO2 and remarkably increase the CO/CO2 ratio even in the presence of O-2. Finally these results strongly support that the FCC regeneration step can be kept under auto-thermal condition in CO2 rich atmosphere. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Varieties of capitalism, increasing income inequality and the sustainability of long-run growth","We model US household debt accumulation during the neoliberal boom (1990-2007) as a response to emulation effects and the decline of the social wage, which has 'privatised' an increasing share of the costs of providing for services such as health and education. The debt dynamics of the US economy are then studied under alternative assumptions about the configuration of distributional variables, which is shown to differ across varieties of capitalism that have 'neoliberalised' to different degrees. A key result is that distributional change alone will not make contemporary US capitalism financially sustainable due, in part, to the paradoxical nature of inequality as a spur to household borrowing, and hence a source of both demand-formation and financial fragility. Achieving sustainability requires, instead, more wide-ranging reform.",Not About Sufficiency
Varieties of multi-stakeholder governance: selecting legitimation strategies in transnational sustainability politics,"Multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) are often referred to as the 'gold standard' of private governance. However, existing MSIs vary strongly in their institutional designs and the ways in which they use inclusiveness, procedural fairness and, expert-based strategies to create legitimacy for their rules. This article investigates these institutional choices. It reviews arguments about demand from legitimacy-granting audiences, isomorphic pressures, and the role played by institutional entrepreneurs, and intergroup bargaining. It explores these mechanisms in an empirical investigation of the formation of three MSIs in the field of sustainable agriculture. Its findings advance our understanding of the conditions under which MSIs adhere or depart from normative ideals of democratic governance.",Not About Sufficiency

Vegetation restoration in dryland with shrub serves as a carbon sink: Evidence from a 13-year observation at the Tengger Desert of Northern China,"Dryland area accounts for approximately 40% of worldwide land area, which plays a significant role in regulating the carbon sequestration capacity of land. Vegetation restoration in drylands adopted to prevent land degradation, and may also serve as a carbon sink in the earlier stage. However, the persistence of the carbon sink for the revegetated ecosystem in drylands is still unknown. Can the well-established restoration vegetation in dryland areas serve as a carbon sink in long-run? To address this question, we investigated the carbon sequestration capacity of planted vegetation in dryland areas with 13 years of observation (2009-2021) for established vegetation restoration, which began in 1989. We found that the revegetation area serves as a carbon sink in all years. The mean annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is 91.61 +/- 36.17 gC m(-2) yr(-1) (mean +/- standard deviation). Annual NEP showed a significant increasing trend over the study period with a rate of 5.65 gC m(-2) yr(-1) yr(-1) (p < 0.05). The increase in spring temperature, the earlier start of net carbon uptake and the longer duration of net carbon uptake contribute to the gradual trend of NEP. The amount of annual NEP is predominantly determined by summer precipitation. Meanwhile, our results revealed that the increase in net carbon uptake by revegetation did not lead to excessive consumption of water resources. Our results have suggested that appropriate vegetation restoration in arid areas can increase ecosystem carbon sequestration over longer timescales and mitigate climate change, with relatively low environmental consequences and risks. Considering the vast area of degraded land in the global drylands, the carbon sequestration effect of this model should be given more attention.",Not About Sufficiency
Deforestation and land use effects on micromorphological and fertility changes in acidic rainforest soils in Venezuelan Andes,"With the aim of determining the impact on soil caused by deforestation and replacement by pasture in the rainforests of the Venezuelan Andes, three representative plots were selected: one under natural forest (F), another deforested (D), and the third one under pasture (P). The chemical analyses of the soils were complemented with a micromorphological study. The analysis of thin sections revealed major differences in the microstructure and porosity, as well as in the characteristics of the fine fraction and organic constituents, together with other pedological features, corroborating the different dynamics and types of soil in the natural or altered forest landscape. The change in soil use leads to the reorganization of the solid fraction, evidenced in the intensity of the processes of transference and accumulation of materials in the different soil horizons. The results confirm that the change in land use is determinant in the current fertility and evolution of the soils. The main consequences of the land-use change are: a change in the soil organic-matter cycle with a greater degree of maturation in the disturbed soils (C/N in Ah horizon: 28.5 (F); 19.8 (D); 18.4 (P)), in which moder humus from undisturbed forest soils transforms into an acidic mull in the anthropogenic disturbed ones; illuviation of organic matter and minerals appears to have occurred after deforestation (colour (dry-wet) in Ah-Bt1-Bt2 horizons: 3/2-2/2, 4/ 4-3/4, 4.5/4-3.5/4 (F); 5/4-4.5/4, 5/6-4/6, 5/6-4.5/6 (D); 4.5/4-4/3.5, 5/6-4/4, 5/6-4/4 (P)); the amount of kaolinite and the degree of browning increased gradually with deforestation; other changes observed (bioturbation, microstructure, porosity and distribution of organic constituents) may also be related to the different activity of the soil fauna in disturbed (oribatids) and undisturbed soils (worms). Thus the porosity changes in the following form: the percentage of packing voids in the surface samples decreases from a 80% in the forest soil to a 70% and 65% in deforested and pasture soils, respectively. Moreover in depth a dominance of channels in forest-soil porosity changes into an abundance of planar voids in the other two types of soils studied. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Vertebrate scavenger assemblages and their functioning differ between artificial and natural wetlands: Implications for ecosystem management,"Natural wetlands perform essential ecological functions, but their area has dramatically decreased. Partly to counteract this loss, artificial wetlands have been created. While studies comparing animal communities between artificial and natural wetlands abound, research on their comparative ecological functions is scarce. In particular, vertebrate scavengers in aquatic ecosystems have been little studied despite their critical role in nutrient cycling. This study compared vertebrate scavenger assemblages and their consumption patterns in natural and artificial wetlands in Donana, Spain, to evaluate the effects of wetland management (natural vs. artificial hydrology) across different seasons. We placed 120 carcasses (carp and chicken) in natural and artificial wetlands. We recorded 22 vertebrate scavenger species efficiently consuming 100 % of carrion in an average of less than two days, highlighting their role in nutrient recycling. Carrion of aquatic-origin was consumed faster and by a greater variety of species than that of terrestrial-origin, facilitating the transport of essential nutrients from water to land. Artificial wetlands exhibited higher efficiency in carrion removal (twice as fast as natural wetlands). However, they hosted less diverse assemblages, dominated by opportunistic and non-native species. This suggests that artificial wetlands are not replacing natural wetlands in terms of biodiversity, despite sustaining water levels and functions. Importantly, 'kidnapping' water for irrigation reduces the ability of natural wetlands to maintain ecological functions provided by scavengers. Urgent regulation of water abstraction from aquifers, especially for crop irrigation, is necessary to maintain minimum groundwater levels, preserving the functionality and ecological processes of this critical wetland complex.",Not About Sufficiency
Voluntary Disclosure of Environmental Performance: Do Publicly and Privately Owned Organizations Face Different Incentives/Disincentives?,"Public and private differences have been a central topic in public administration research. This study explores electric utilities' voluntary disclosure of environmental performance and examines if private (investor-owned) and public (government-owned) utilities have different drivers for voluntary disclosure. In particular, this study analyzes the panel data on electric utilities' participation in the Department of Energy's Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Registry program (VGGR) from 1995 to 2005 and attempts to explain the different participation patterns between public and private utilities based on two perspectives-public-private distinction and corporate environmentalism-which probes private firms' voluntary environmental actions in particular. The findings show that private utilities tend to participate in the VGGR program when they have better performance, higher consumer interaction and market pressure, and also when they anticipate further regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. This is consistent with the existing theoretical and empirical studies on corporate environmentalism, which suggests private firms under intensive government regulation and market pressure actively use voluntary disclosure strategy to preempt future regulations and to gain economic benefit or legitimacy. On the other hand, it is found that public utilities tend to participate in the VGGR program when other related mandatory rules exist. This suggests that public utilities' voluntary disclosure is primarily being driven by other mandatory requirements.",Not About Sufficiency
Voluntary National Reviews on Implementation of Sustainable Development Goals: Key Lessons from East African Member States,"Regular, inclusive, and country-driven Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) of sustainable development goals (SDGs) are being conducted by many countries across the globe in the quest to realign development priorities toward Agenda 2030. However, there are limited studies on the progress of the implementation of SDGs. This paper used literature review and document content analysis to review the VNRs from East Africa for the first time in order to explore their reporting practices and document the progress of SDG implementation. Results substantiate that Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan are committed to achieving a high quality of life for their people through periodic VNR reporting. To augment, these positive efforts, countries have established a favorable multi-stakeholder legal and policy environment for SDG implementation. Moreover, remarkable impacts have been witnessed, including; reduced poverty, improved access to basic services, enhanced environmental protection, improved economic growth, improved gender equality, and improved stakeholder participation in sustainable development. Additionally, global best practices on SDG implementation are emerging from the region, especially through the tendency to formulate national strategies and policies targeting specific development sectors and resources. However, results also show that there are numerous social-political, economic, and environmental barriers to achieving the SDGs. As such, this paper recommends increasing SDGs awareness, building technical capacity, leveraging technology, fostering transparency and accountability, encouraging collaboration, addressing cultural barriers, and supporting political stability. Implementing these interventions can help to promote sustainable development in the region. Key Lessons from East African Countries on Achieving Sustainable Development Goals[Purpose] This paper seeks to review the voluntary national reviews (VNRs) for East African states to document the progress of implementation (achievement, impacts, and barriers), identify similar features in the reviews, and make suggestions for future studies in East Africa. [Methods] The paper has applied a sound and well-designed methodology, clearly describing the methods used and how they were applied. The methodology is appropriate to the research question and is able to withstand scrutiny and replication. [Conclusions] The paper recommends increasing SDGs awareness, building technical capacity, leveraging technology, fostering transparency and accountability, encouraging collaboration, addressing cultural barriers, and supporting political stability. [Implications] There are limited studies on the progress of the implementation of SDGs, especially in East African member states. The paper summarizes the VNRs outlook and then delves into the progress of SDG implementation in the country cases. [Limitations] Despite the few study limitations, particularly the lack of data for South Sudan and the extent of reference documentation, implementing the highlighted interventions can help promote sustainable development in the East Africa region.",Not About Sufficiency
A Comprehensive Review of the Diversity of Fungal Secondary Metabolites and Their Emerging Applications in Healthcare and Environment,"Fungi and their natural products, like secondary metabolites, have gained a huge demand in the last decade due to their increasing applications in healthcare, environmental cleanup, and biotechnology-based industries. The fungi produce these secondary metabolites (SMs) during the different phases of their growth, which are categorized into terpenoids, alkaloids, polyketides, and non-ribosomal peptides. These SMs exhibit significant biological activity, which contributes to the formulation of novel pharmaceuticals, biopesticides, and environmental bioremediation agents. Nowadays, these fungal-derived SMs are widely used in food and beverages, for fermentation, preservatives, protein sources, and in dairy industries. In healthcare, it is being used as an antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and immunosuppressive drug. The usage of modern tools of biotechnology can achieve an increase in demand for these SMs and large-scale production. The present review comprehensively analyses the diversity of fungal SMs along with their emerging applications in healthcare, agriculture, environmental sustainability, and nutraceuticals. Here, the authors have reviewed the recent advancements in genetic engineering, metabolic pathway manipulation, and synthetic biology to improve the production and yield of these SMs. Advancement in fermentation techniques, bioprocessing, and co-cultivation approaches for large-scale production of SMs. Investigators further highlighted the importance of omics technologies in understanding the regulation and biosynthesis of SMs, which offers an understanding of novel applications in drug discovery and sustainable agriculture. Finally, the authors have addressed the potential for genetic manipulation and biotechnological innovations for further exploitation of fungal SMs for commercial and environmental benefits.",Not About Sufficiency
The Critical Effect of Subgrid-Scale Scheme on Simulating the Climate Impacts of Deforestation,"Land surface schemes (LSSs) in Earth System Models simulate how vegetation regulates land-atmosphere fluxes of heat, water, carbon, and momentum. Despite advances in the spatial resolution of regional climate modeling, significant land cover changes occured at sub-grid scale still not properly treated. Here, we investigate the response of evapotranspiration, representing the fluxes of heat and water, to deforestation in Southeast Asian Massif by employing three LSSs (Noah mosaic, Noah-MP and Community Land Model (CLM)) with different approaches in representing sub-grid variability, implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Two experiments, with and without satellite-observed deforestation, were performed for each scheme. Results show that the simulations are highly sensitive to the subgrid-scale approaches embedded in the LSSs. Compared with the observed historical climate, CLM outperforms other schemes and Noah mosaic shows the largest bias. However, if we target the simulation of the climate impacts of land cover change, the Noah mosaic scheme taking the sub-grid approach can better capture the response of evapotranspiration to deforestation. The NoahMP and CLM schemes underestimate the evapotranspiration response in the grid cells where the dominant land cover type has not changed, but overestimate the response in those grid cells with dominant type changed, which is a characteristic of dominant-grid approach. To improve our understanding of climate impacts induced by fine-scale land cover change, future efforts to better represent subgrid-scale variability and land-atmosphere flux exchange in climate models are desirable.",Not About Sufficiency
Electrochemical CO2 Activation and Valorization on Metallic Copper and Carbon-Embedded N-Coordinated Single Metal MNC Catalysts,"The electrochemical reductive valorization of CO2, referred to as the CO2RR, is an emerging approach for the conversion of CO2-containing feeds into valuable carbonaceous fuels and chemicals, with potential contributions to carbon capture and use (CCU) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Copper surfaces and graphene-embedded, N-coordinated single metal atom (MNC) catalysts exhibit distinctive reactivity, attracting attention as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2RR. This review offers a comparative analysis of CO2RR on copper surfaces and MNC catalysts, highlighting their unique characteristics in terms of CO2 activation, C-1/C2(+) product formation, and the competing hydrogen evolution pathway. The assessment underscores the significance of understanding structure-activity relationships to optimize catalyst design for efficient and selective CO2RR. Examining detailed reaction mechanisms and structure-selectivity patterns, the analysis explores recent insights into changes in the chemical catalyst states, atomic motif rearrangements, and fractal agglomeration, providing essential kinetic information from advanced in/ex situ microscopy/spectroscopy techniques. At the end, this review addresses future challenges and solutions related to today's disconnect between our current molecular understanding of structure-activity-selectivity relations in CO2RR and the relevant factors controlling the performance of CO2 electrolyzers over longer times, with larger electrode sizes, and at higher current densities.",Not About Sufficiency
Study on the Synergistic Effects of Karst Carbon Sink and Vegetation Carbon Sink in Watersheds under Different Geological Backgrounds-A Case Study of Darongjiang and Lingqu Watersheds,"In this study, the hydrochemistry-runoff method and remote sensing estimation method were used to calculate the karst carbon sink flux (KCSF) and the forest vegetation carbon sequestration flux (FVCSF) in Darongjiang (DRJ) and Lingqu (LQ) watersheds. The results show the following: (1) The KCSF in DRJ and LQ watersheds is 238.43 x 10(5) t<middle dot>y(-1) and 353.44 x 10(5) t<middle dot>y(-1), respectively. Influenced by changes in flow rate, the two watersheds both show that their KCSF is higher in the rainy season than in the dry season. (2) The FVCSF in DRJ and LQ watersheds was 680.78 x 10(7) t<middle dot>y(-1) and 229.63 x 10(7) t<middle dot>y(-1), respectively. Through comparison, it can be seen that the FVCSF is much higher than the KCSF in both watersheds, but the FVCSF and the KCSF are at the same order of magnitude. (3) Through further analysis of the influence factors on the FVCSF and the KCSF, we found that the highest values of FVCSF are mainly distributed around Kitten Mountain on the upper reach and along the LQ watershed. That may be because most of the upper reach areas are mountainous forestland, and the strong weathering of rocks in the LQ watershed promotes the development of forest vegetation carbon sequestration. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is a certain synergistic effect between the karst carbon sink (KCS) and the forest vegetation carbon sequestration (FVCS) in the study area, and such a synergistic effect is caused by rock weathering.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the relationship between cultural ecosystem services and human well-being of Qiandao Lake in China: insights from tourists and residents,"Landscapes of lakes have a significant impact on people's perceptions of Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES), as well as on their overall sense of well-being. However, there is limited understanding of how best to manage land landscapes and how different approaches influence these perceptions. To explore these questions, a case study of China's Qiandao Lake was conducted, using a survey of 416 tourists and residents based on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework. The relationship between CES and Human Well-Being (HWB) was examined using Structural equation Modeling (SEM), followed by the application of the Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) method to identify which aspects should be targeted in management strategies. The results revealed several key findings. Firstly, there were significant differences in satisfaction with CES between tourists and residents. Tourists showed higher satisfaction levels in spiritual service, aesthetic service, inspiration, and education and science aspects. In contrast, residents prioritized cultural heritage and sense of place, indicating a deeper connection to the cultural and historical elements of their environment. Secondly, age, education, and income levels played important roles in shaping perceptions of CES. Thirdly, the study underscored the impact of CES on HWB, with aesthetic service having the greatest influence on tourists' HWB, and spiritual service having the most impact on residents' HWB. Lastly, using the IPA model, indicators with low satisfaction but high importance were identified, suggesting areas for improvement, particularly in cultural integration and unique environmental features.

"Waste Activated Sludge-High Rate (WASHR) Treatment Process: A Novel, Economically Viable, and Environmentally Sustainable Method to Co-Treat High-Strength Wastewaters at Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants","High-strength wastewaters from a variety of sources, including the food industry, domestic septage, and landfill leachate, are often hauled to municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for co-treatment. Due to their high organic loadings, these wastewaters can cause process upsets in both a WWTP's liquid and solids treatment trains and consume organic treatment capacity, leaving less capacity available to service customers in the catchment area. A novel pre-treatment method, the Waste Activated Sludge-High Rate (WASHR) process, is proposed to optimize the co-treatment of high-strength wastewaters. The WASHR process combines the contact stabilization and sequencing batch reactor processes. It utilizes waste activated sludge from a municipal WWTP as its biomass source, allowing for a rapid start-up. Bench-scale treatment trials of winery wastewater confirm the WASHR process can reduce loadings on the downstream WWTP's liquid and solids treatment trains. A case study approach is used to confirm the economic viability and environmental sustainability of the WASHR process compared to direct co-treatment, using life-cycle cost analyses and greenhouse gas emissions estimates.",Not About Sufficiency

Water and Carbon Footprints of Biomass Production Assets: Drip and Center Pivot Irrigation Systems,"Studies on the environmental footprints of agricultural production have strong links with 4 out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) established by the United Nations. Irrigation systems are essential tools for increasing agricultural yields, particularly in arid regions. However, the production and assembly of these systems can have significant environmental impacts, including excessive water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Although studies have approached biomass production, few of them have provided data about asset depreciation, such as irrigation systems, machinery, etc. Trying to fill this gap, this study aimed at determining the water and carbon footprints of two commonly used irrigation systems: center pivot and drip. Several variables, including the irrigated area, pump power, filter type, system flow, and pipe length, were analyzed to determine the carbon and water footprints of each component of the irrigation systems. The results reveal that the materials used for pipes and filters had the most significant impact on the water and carbon footprints, with galvanized steel pipes and sand filters having the highest footprints. Additionally, the irrigated area affected the center pivot and drip systems differently, with the depreciation of the irrigation systems being a significant variable for both water and carbon footprints. These results can support the development of sustainable irrigation practices that reduce environmental impacts while enhancing agricultural yields. Decision-makers can use this information to establish a life-cycle database and evaluate the impact of irrigation systems on water and carbon footprints.",Not About Sufficiency
Water pollution in India - Current scenario,"Expanding populations, intensive agriculture, climate change, water pollution and depleting natural water resources are the main drivers of water scarcity in India. Improvisations in wastewater treatment processes for the degradation of pollutants by cost-effective means are critical to ensure safe wastewater discharge and its reuse. While advancements in technology and science have provided alternatives to the traditional activated sludge process; owing to lack of infrastructure, funding and awareness; the majority of wastewaters being discharged remain untreated.

The research employed a qualitative methodology in which data were collected through 40 key informant interviews, informal conversations, and observations during 2020-2021 including a relevant literature review. We note that both ""too much and too little water' pose risks to water insecurity. Also, water security cannot be ensured by only dealing with water inadequacy without building a resi-lient water system and robust institutions. We found that water scarcity has affected other components of water security such as equity, quality, and affordability. Excess water has impacted water infrastructures degrading the water quality, and risking human health and well-being. The responses to the water challenges were hindered by several constraints such as the limited capacity of the water institutions, frequent leadership changes, political influence, and emerging challenges in the federal context.

What Does It Take to Clean the Ganga? Gendered Dimensions of Protest and Policy Perspectives,"In the last two decades, pollution in the river Ganga has become a serious issue, affecting the socio-economic activities and the health of the communities living on the banks and adjacent areas of the river. The impact has been greater on women, because their day-to-day activities for survival are intimately connected with this water resource. The response of the government has been to drastically improve its environmental policies. Social activists on the other hand continued to mobilize civil society in regional protests, which finally led to the beginning of the 'Save Ganga' movement. Yet, both the strategies to clean the river pollution have been colossal failures. An analysis was undertaken of various government policies, reports and court judgements on the river's pollution and a primary survey was done on three sites: Garhwal in Uttarakhand and in Varanasi and Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh to gauge the nature of women's participation in the movements. It was found that there was greater participation by women in the hilly Garhwal region than in the plains of Uttar Pradesh. The research proved that women's knowledge and experiences in environmental conservation had led to greater sustainability, in contrast to the results of the modern-technocratic approach of state officials and so-called environmentalists.

What Is Design for Social Sustainability? A Systematic Literature Review for Designers of Product-Service Systems,"Social sustainability is concerned with the wellbeing and flourishing of societies now and in the future. Despite its importance, it has been largely overlooked compared with environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability. Additionally, although there is a longstanding history of design being used to tackle social and sustainability problems, the concept of design for social sustainability is not well-understood. In light of this, the current study aims to conceptually develop design for social sustainability. It specifically focuses on how this concept can be developed for the design of product-service systems. A systematic literature review of social design and sustainable design literature is conducted to synthesise fragmented knowledge on design for social sustainability. A total of 69 articles are analysed with respect to terminology, context, methods, focus and key themes. In doing so, it helps to summarise current knowledge and identify several promising areas for further research. In particular, it calls for additional contextual and place-based perspectives; development of appropriate metrics, methods and tools; and research on the linkages between design for social sustainability and existing sustainable design approaches and methods. This article contributes to knowledge in three ways: (1) it integrates disparate knowledge on design for social sustainability within the domain of product-service systems, (2) it defines design for social sustainability and makes progress toward operationalising the concept by identifying its key dimensions, and (3) it identifies current gaps in the literature and highlights areas for further research. This study is important for designers of product-service systems because it sheds a light on what is desirable and achievable.",Not About Sufficiency
"What is the evidence that counter-wildlife crime interventions are effective for conserving African, Asian and Latin American wildlife directly threatened by exploitation? A systematic map","Counter-wildlife crime (CWC) interventions-those that directly protect target wildlife from illegal harvest/persecution, detect and sanction rule-breakers, and interdict and control illegal wildlife commodities-are widely applied to address biodiversity loss. This systematic map provides an overview of the literature on the effectiveness of CWC interventions for conserving African, Asian and Latin American wildlife directly threatened by exploitation, including human-wildlife conflicts that trigger poaching. Following our systematic map protocol (Rytwinski, ockerman, et al., 2021), we compiled peer-reviewed and grey literature and screened articles using pre-defined inclusion criteria. Included studies were coded for key variables of interest, from which we produced a searchable database, interactive map and structured heatmaps. A total of 530 studies from 477 articles were included in the systematic map. Most studies were from Africa and Asia (81% of studies) and focused on African and Asian elephants (16%), felids (14%) and turtles and tortoises (11%). Most evaluations of CWC interventions targeted wildlife products (rather than species) and the transfer of those products along the wildlife crime continuum (40% of cases). Population/species outcomes were most commonly measured via indicators of threat reduction (65% of cases) and intermediate outcomes (25%). We identified knowledge clusters where studies investigated the links between (1) patrols and other preventative actions to increase detection and population abundance and (2) information analysis and sharing and wildlife crime/trade levels. However, the effectiveness of most interventions was not rigorously evaluated. Most investigations used post-implementation monitoring only (e.g. lacking a comparator), and no experimental designs were found. We identified several key knowledge gaps including a paucity of studies by geography (Latin America), taxonomy (plants, birds and reptiles), interventions (non-patrol-based CWC interventions) and outcomes (biological and the combination of biological and human well-being outcomes). Our map reveals an opportunity to improve the rigour and documentation of CWC intervention evaluations, which would enable the evidence-based selection of effective approaches to improve wildlife conservation and national security. Results of our systematic map indicate that despite a relatively large evidence base on the effectiveness of counter-wildlife crime (CWC) interventions for conserving wildlife, most interventions have not been rigorously evaluated. Studies often lacked comparators and experimental designs. We also identify several knowledge gaps that deserve further study, including further investigations in Latin America, on plants, birds and reptiles, for non-patrol-based CWC interventions, and in relation to biological, and the combination of biological and human well-being outcomes. Our assessment of the evidence base provides important first steps towards improving our understanding of CWC intervention effectiveness and making evidence-informed management and funding decisions.image",Not About Sufficiency
What is the Global? Rise and Demis of the Metanarrative on Global Change,"In the past, historians tended to perceive the global as a set of encompassing processes that made the world smaller and generated an upward trajectory of economic development in the industrialized countries, as we saw in the nineteenth and the better part of the twentieth centuries. At the core of the processes were the technological innovations, the rise of humanism, and the emergence of democratic systems, all of which were closely associated with western European culture. Only recently, have we begun to comprehend not only the multiplexity of the global, but also the deterritorialized, dispersed, and regionalized nature of global change. In this article, I suggest that the global is only the reification of the local. Instead of studying the global, we should focus on the changes in the local societies.",Not About Sufficiency
What is the relationship between ecosystem services and urbanization? A case study of the mountainous areas in Southwest China,"China is undergoing a rapid urbanization process, and urbanization will have a direct impact on regional ecosystems and affect regional ecosystem services. Considering the mountainous counties in Southwestern China as the research object, this study reveals the spatial clustering characteristics of four typical ecosystem services (food production, soil conservation, water yield and carbon sequestration) as well as the trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services in different urbanized areas. At the same time, piecewise linear regression is used to determine the threshold of the influence of urbanization on ecosystem services. The results indicate that: 1) There are spatial autocorrelations among the four typical ecosystem services; with strong clustering characteristics, the positive correlation types are ""clustered"" locally; and with significant spatial heterogeneity, the negative correlation types are scattered and mainly appear in the highly urbanized area. 2) There are also remarkable differences in the relationship among various ecosystem services in different urbanized areas, and in particular, there are marked trade-offs between food production and carbon sequestration in the moderately urbanized area and the highly urbanized area. However, there are synergies between them in the lowly urbanized area. 3) With an increase in the compounded night light index (CNLI), water yield, carbon sequestration, food production and overall ecosystem services values present an increasing-decreasing trend, the soil conservation function value shows a decreasing-increasing trend. The response of water yield, carbon sequestration, food production, and overall ecosystem services to the compounded night light index (CNLI) has a threshold of 1.2642, 1.4833, 1.3388, 1.5146 and 1.2237, respectively. Based on the detected relationships between urbanization and ecosystem services, this study provides a theoretical reference for the selection of urbanization development models in key ecological functional areas.",Not About Sufficiency
What is the value of scientific knowledge? An application to global warming using the PRICE model,Governments must cope with the enormous uncertainties about both future climate change as well as the costs and benefits of slowing climate change. This study analyses the value of improved information about a variety of geophysical and economic processes. The value of information is estimated using the ''PRICE model'' which is a probabilistic extension of earlier models of the economics of global warming. The study uses five different approaches to estimating the value of information about all uncertain parameters and about individual parameters. It is estimated that the value of early information is between $1 and $2 billion for each year that resolution of uncertainty is moved toward the present. We estimate that the most important uncertain variables are the damages of climate change and the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Resolving the uncertainties about these two parameters would contribute 75 percent of the value of improved knowledge.,Not About Sufficiency
"What transitions for climate change mitigation? Global transformations, societal dimensions and insights for decision makers","The IPCC Special report on ""Global Warming of 1.5 degrees C '' identifies the greenhouse gas emissions trajectories compatible with the global mitigation goal of the Paris Agreement, presents the mitigation actions required to follow these trajectories and analyses the synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development objectives. The assessment highlights the necessity to implement drastic global carbon emissions reductions in the short term, to reach global carbon neutrality between 2050 and 2070 and to implement targeted actions to limit other greenhouse gases. To this aim, rapid and far-reaching transformations are required in energy, industrial, infrastructure and land-use systems. Adopting systemic strategies combining policy packages elaborated according to the specificities of each country context and with a long-term perspective is a requirement for ensuring that these low-emission transformations can be compatible with the achievement of socio-economic and development objectives.",Not About Sufficiency
Which management measures lead to better performance of China's protected areas in reducing forest loss?,"Protected areas (PAs) are considered essential for biodiversity conservation, and concerns about the effectiveness of PAs in terms of reducing deforestation are growing. However, few studies have identified the management measures that best reduce deforestation within existing PAs. Here, we carried out 10-year (from 2007 to 2016) field surveys and obtained a database of 10 management measures of 227 PAs mainly protecting forest ecosystems in China. We examined the contributions of the above 10 management measures in relation to the effectiveness of 227 PAs in reducing deforestation. Our results indicated that 52.68% of PAs had positive effects related to reducing deforestation (E > 0, P < 0.05). while 16.52% of PAs had negative effects (E <0, P < 0.05). The most important management measures affecting the effectiveness of PAs in reducing deforestation were funding, infrastructure, and scientific research and monitoring. Thus, our study provides evidence indicating that improved funding and scientific research benefit the effectiveness of PAs. The findings have global implications for guiding PAs to take explicit measures to improve the outcomes of biodiversity conservation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Who Among the Elderly Is Most Vulnerable to Exposure to and Health Risks of Fine Particulate Matter From Wildfire Smoke?,"Wildfires burn more than 7 million acres in the United States annually, according to the US Forest Service. Little is known about which subpopulations are more vulnerable to health risks from wildfire smoke, including those associated with fine particulate matter. We estimated exposure to fine particles specifically from wildfires, as well as the associations between the presence of wildfire-specific fine particles and the amount of hospital admissions for respiratory causes among subpopulations older than 65 years of age in the western United States (2004-2009). Compared with other populations, higher fractions of persons who were black, lived in urban counties, and lived in California were exposed to more than 1 smoke wave (high-pollution episodes from wildfire smoke). The risks of respiratory admissions on smoke-wave days compared with non-smoke-wave days increased 10.4% (95% confidence interval: 1.9, 19.6) for women and 21.7% (95% confidence interval: 0.4, 47.3) for blacks. Our findings suggest that increased risks of respiratory admissions from wildfire smoke was significantly higher for women than for men (10.4% vs. 3.7%), blacks than whites (21.7% vs. 6.9%), and, although associations were not statistically different, people in lower-education counties than higher-educated counties (12.7% vs. 6.1%). Our study raised important environmental justice issues that can inform public health programs and wildfire management. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires, evidence on vulnerable subpopulations can inform disaster preparedness and the understanding of climate change consequences.",Not About Sufficiency
Why CAFE worked,"The 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act established mandatory fuel economy standards for passenger ears and light trucks sold in the US. Since that time the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards have often been criticized as costly, inefficient, and even unsafe, despite the general absence of direct empirical evidence to support such claims. This paper reviews empirical evidence on the impacts of the CAFE standards and explains why properly designed and executed fuel economy regulations may be preferable to other policies for reducing petroleum dependence and carbon emissions. It appears that the standards substantially achieved their objective of restraining US oil consumption without producing significant negative side-effects because they were set at levels that could be achieved by cost-effective or nearly cost-effective technological innovations.

Will consumers follow climate leaders? The effect of manufacturer participation in a voluntary environmental program on consumer preferences,"In 2002, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) established a voluntary environmental program called the Climate Leaders (CL) Program. Participating firms developed greenhouse gas emissions inventories, set emissions reductions goals, and annually reported progress toward those goals. While the program was not designed to function as an eco-labeling program, one possible motivation for participation in the program was to positively influence consumer perceptions for firm products and services. USEPA discontinued the CL program in 2011. In this study, data from a contingent choice experiment from a national online survey are used to examine whether the CL program could have been effectively adopted as a consumer product labeling program. Results suggest that consumers are willing to pay more for refrigerators manufactured by CL program participants and that willingness-to-pay is influenced by both respondent characteristics and attitudes.",Not About Sufficiency
Wind farms in the Icelandic highlands: Attitudes of local residents and tourism service providers,"Over the last decades the harnessing of wind power has gained increasing popularity and is currently believed to be one of world's best environmental options in seeking to meet the international target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by the year 2050. There is undeniably an abundance of wind resources in Iceland. But what impact would the harnessing of this power have on the country's growing tourism industry? This paper focuses on the dynamics existing between wind farming, residents and tourism. Its overall aim is to evaluate the attitudes of local residents and tourism service providers in Southern Iceland towards the country's first proposed wind farm, which is to be located at the edge of Iceland's Southern highlands, and to critically discuss the causal relationship between the landscape and these attitudes. An on-site questionnaire was distributed to residents in the municipalities adjacent to the proposed wind farm. Interviews were also conducted with residents and tourist service providers. The results indicate that the relationship between residents and the landscape of the proposed site is based on its use as highland pasture and the residents' romantic conception of the landscape, which for centuries has been characterized by wildness and remoteness. This conception seems to linger on despite gradually increasing hydropower production in the area. The associations made by tourist service providers with the area differ since they are selling a certain image, that of unspoilt nature and wilderness. Wind turbines would be a new and prominent presence in the Icelandic landscape likely to transform the area from its previous perceived wild and natural state. As such, social acceptance of the location of wind farms in the Icelandic highlands is more critical than in the case of more traditional ways of harnessing renewable energy.",Not About Sufficiency
Wind power in Brazil - transition using German experience,"The development of the installed capacity of wind energy converters in Germany shows that a significant increase of its contribution to the energy supply is possible, depending on the measures introduced by the state. In contrast to Germany, Brazil has not been very concerned about its greenhouse gas emissions yet, as more than 90% of the electricity is generated by hydropower. However, due to the current energy crisis Brazil has to search for alternatives in order to stabilize the energy matrix and diminish the dependence on precipitation, especially as a new capacity of about 4 GW has to be installed each year. The intention of the authors is to present the German conditions that led to the current favorable situation for wind energy and to compare these to the Brazilian circumstances that exist for an extended application of this energy source. At the same time special attention is paid to the newest legal developments in Brazil. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Winning coalitions for just transitions: Insights from the environmental justice movement,"In recent years, attention within the sustainability transitions literature has focused on the politics of deliberately accelerating sustainability transitions. One core strand of this research has been to understand the role of coalition-building in supporting or undermining decarbonisation efforts. This scholarly work has clear synergies with the on-the-ground environmental justice movement, yet to date there has been limited exchange between this new literature and environmental justice movements. This perspective paper addresses this gap through examining three core areas of important and meaningful overlap between the environmental justice movement and the scholarly literature. These synergies centre around the praxis of building coalitions, understandings of power and appreciation of justice. In the context of climate breakdown, and the need to accelerate transitions to more just and sustainable futures, this perspective paper aims to lay the groundwork for more meaningful ex-change between the scholarly literature and on-the-ground environmental movement.",Not About Sufficiency

"Women, Peace and Security in a changing climate","In this article, we argue that the effort to get the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda implemented in a series of bureaucratic institutions has pulled the agenda quite far from its original motivating intent. Indeed, going down the bureaucratic implementation rabbit hole has made it almost impossible for advocates to stay in touch with the foundational WPS question: how do you get to gender-just sustainable peace? As we approach the twentieth anniversary of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, we argue that WPS advocates need to return to that question, but in doing so, must also acknowledge the changed context. One striking change is that climate breakdown is both more acute and more apparent than in 2000, and any attempt to build gender-just sustainable peace will face serious climate-induced challenges. However, the climate crisis creates not only challenges for the WPS agenda, but also opportunities. The sustainability of peace and of the planet are inextricably linked, and we argue that the realization of the WPS agenda requires transformations to social, political, and, most importantly, economic structures that are precisely the same as the transformations needed to ward off greater climate catastrophe.",Not About Sufficiency
"Women's political agency in difficult settings: Analysis of evidence from Egypt, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Pakistan","MotivationMale gatekeeping and biased social norms in difficult settings characterized by fragility, authoritarianism, and conflict create challenges for women's political participation. This article explores the nature of challenges experienced by women and how they exercise political agency in such settings-as voters, claimants, and brokers of services, and as activists. PurposeI investigate the range of expressions of women's political agency and responses they secure from public authorities in difficult settings. I ask the question: how and to what effect do women exercise political agency in difficult settings? Analysis of the range of expressions of political agency allows a broader view of women's engagement in politics. Methods and approachThe article develops a framework to identify the range of expressions of women's individual and collective agency from Action for Empowerment and Accountability (A4EA) studies conducted in Egypt, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Pakistan. This synthesis explores social norms and male gatekeeping; strategies women use to navigate these and limit backlash; and the changes that result from women taking action. FindingsEvidence shows that social norms and male gatekeeping limit women's engagement in politics and their relations with multiple public authorities that operate in difficult settings. Women use gender-specific repertoires to organize protests and make claims on authorities and specific strategies to reduce the risk of backlash from their own communities and security agencies. The findings show that, while there is some success in claim-making on specific issues and that at a personal level women feel more empowered, these do not necessarily lead to systemic change. Policy implicationsDonors and local authorities need to develop interventions that tackle male gatekeeping within political parties and communities to facilitate women's political engagement. Flexibility in funding will enable donors to work directly or indirectly with grassroots and national women's rights groups in difficult settings for developing contextualized, bottom-up interventions. Strengthening pro-gender-equality alliances and spaces for deliberation will help to ensure that gender equality is not co-opted by authoritarian leaders and populist groups and will sustain counter-narratives.",Not About Sufficiency

Working in (Slow) Progress: Socio-Environmental and Economic Dynamics in the Forestry Sector and the Contribution to Sustainable Development in Europe,"Forest ecosystems are increasingly subject to disturbances, such as extreme (climate) events, fires and pathological outbreaks, which exert significant (and still poorly quantified) economic impacts, despite their intrinsic resilience. How forest management addresses these challenges will have profound effects on human health, environmental diversity, (ecological and economic) productivity and the ability of forest ecosystems to recovery from exogenous shocks. Assuming forests as ensuring ecosystem services that are vital to society and human well-being, in addition to providing wood material, a better knowledge of forest ecosystems appears a key requirement to delineate a developmental strategy that guarantees environmental protection objectives and achievement of climate and energy targets. In the context of Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, the information available on forest management practices in Europe still seems not completely suitable to provide a comprehensive overview of ecosystem conditions, their economic value, and their biodiversity. Based on a literature review, the present contribution focuses on recent dynamics of the forestry sector in Europe, delineating the inherent complexity in the environmental-economic nexus. Additionally, the extensive use of a key natural resource such as wood exerts social implications for local districts adapting to ecological change-from climate warming to landscape transformations. In line with earlier studies, our paper confirms the role of the technical-economic dimension of forestry in sustainable development paths of districts and regions, affecting together (i) short-term economic dynamics, (ii) the growth prospects of the sector, (iii) the organization of the supply chain, (iv) the interconnections between companies, and (v) investment strategies at large. One of the major issues is the low reliability of official statistics to provide a coherent picture of the actual status of forest resources. At the same time, forestry practices are pivotal in maintaining habitats and species while increasing the timber production that remains (too) sustainable. This is the policy direction constantly given by the European Commission to stimulate over time public bodies and private (in whose hands is about 60% of European forests) to start virtuous paths in the circular economy with considerable repercussions in terms of additional jobs, recycled materials, mt of CO2 equivalent avoided, and increase in community added value. In this context, forestry should assure a more 'holistic' contribution to sustainable development paths at various spatial scales. This means concentrating on both economic and environmental targets based on the identification of significant (ecological-economic) dimensions that may delineate future lines of investigation and policy intervention, while increasing between member countries and regional authorities.",Not About Sufficiency
Working-class ecology and union politics: a conceptual topology,"This paper argues that Environmental Labour Studies may benefit from incorporating the perspective of environmental justice. We offer a theorization of working-class ecology as the place where working-class communities live and work, being typically affected by environmental injustice, and of working-class environmentalism as those forms of activism that link labour and environmental struggles around the primacy of reproduction. The paper's theoretical section draws on a social ethnography of working-class ecology in the case of Taranto, a mono-industrial town in southern Italy, which is experiencing a severe environmental and public-health crisis. We show how environmental justice activism since the early 2000s has allowed the re-framing of union politics along new ways of politicizing the local economy. We conclude by offering a conceptual topology of working-class ecology, which situates different labour organizations (confederal, social/community, and rank-and-file unions) according to their positioning in respect to environmental justice.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysis of arable land distribution around human settlements in the riparian area of Lake Tanganyika in Africa,"Land use changes in the tropics under the pressure of population growth have attracted wide attention. In this study, the riparian area with more settlements was selected to explore the land use temporal-spatial characteristics of the less developed Lake Tanganyika region. The study methods employed mainly included land use transition matrix, kernel density estimation, grid and buffer analysis of the ArcGIS software and remote sensing image processing. The changes of land use mainly reflected in the transformation between different land types, among which the conversion from forestland into arable land constituted the major event. Though the land use change rate was not so significant for the whole region, dramatic changes occurred around the towns especially in the northern area. It was found that a circle of arable land of about 6 km in width and more than 40% arable land density composed the farming hinterland of the major towns. Moreover, with the forest transition theory the change trends of land use and their influencing factors were analysed. The findings in this study should be helpful for the land use simulation and planning in similar riparian areas. For better understanding the dynamic of land use change, a future additional in-depth study at extensive spatial and temporal scale is appealed.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatiotemporal Evolution and Prediction of Land Use and Carbon Stock in Shanghai,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) constitutes a critical component of carbon reservoirs within terrestrial ecosystems. The ramifications of urban land use transitions on SOC dynamics, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions such as Shanghai, remain insufficiently elucidated. This investigation synergizes a predictive land use change model (Logistic-CA-Markov) with an ecosystem service quantification framework (InVEST), aiming to delineate the interplay between SOC variability and Land Use and Land Cover Change (LUCC) under natural development and ecological protection scenarios. Empirical observations from 2010 to 2020 reveal a contraction in Shanghai's agricultural land of 34,912.76 hectares, juxtaposed with an expansion of urban built-up areas of 36,048.24 hectares. Projections for 2030 under an ecological protection scenario indicate a moderated urban sprawl, reducing built-up area expansion by 13,518 hectares relative to the natural development scenario. Notably, the net carbon sequestration capacity of Shanghai is anticipated to diminish by approximately 0.418 million tons between 2020 and 2030. This trend is observed under both considered scenarios, forecasting a cumulative reduction in SOC stocks exceeding 1 million tons by 2030. The natural development pathway portends a more pronounced and accelerated depletion of SOC reserves. Although ecological conservation measures show the potential to decelerate this loss, they appear insufficient to reverse the ongoing decline in SOC stocks. This study advocates for strategic urban planning interventions focused on constraining the growth of building densities and augmenting the preservation and management of eco-lands. Such measures are imperative for bolstering Shanghai's carbon sequestration capacity.",Not About Sufficiency
"Recent advances in the chemistry of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium as fertilizers in soil: A review","The advent of civilization has made humans dependent on plants for food and medicine, leading to the intensification of agricultural production. The intense cultivation of crops has resulted in the depletion of available nutrients from soil, thereby demanding the application of excess nutrients to soil to improve yield. Thus, mineral fertilizer discovery and application have, in many ways, contributed greatly to meeting global food demands. However, aside from the positive effects of mineral fertilizers, their excessive application to soil produces large amounts of pollutants that affect environmental sustainability. This necessitates the study of the major mineral fertilizer elements (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)), the forms in which they are applied to soil, and their chemistry/reactions in soil. Here, we reviewed the forms of different N, P, and K mineral fertilizers to provide current knowledge on their constituents, the chemistry of N, P, and K in soil to understand the reactions they undertake in soil, the efficient methods of fertilizer application for environmental sustainability, the effects of mineral fertilizer loss to the environment, and improved fertilization technologies for environmental sustainability.

Energy savings with a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)- and pH-based intermittent aeration control system using a BOD biosensor for swine wastewater treatment,"Intermittently aerated activated sludge processes save energy by minimizing the total aeration time per day without deteriorating effluent water quality. Swine wastewater contains high, often widely fluctuating concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and nitrogen. BOD-based aeration control would therefore be a useful method to reduce the energy demands of aeration, but requires a reliable BOD sensor for swine wastewater. In this study we developed a novel approach for BOD- and pH-based intermittent aeration control (BAC) using a BOD biosensor based on exoelectrogenic bacteria and tested it at four swine wastewater treatment plants. This BAC system reduced aeration energy in the plants by 15-36% compared to fixed aeration cycle operations while maintaining low concentrations of BOD and total nitrogen in the effluent. The energy saved per wastewater volume was 477-1012 kWh/m(3)/yr, equivalent to a reduction of 2.2-7.0 t-CO2/m(3)/yr in greenhouse gas emissions. The biosensor was equipped with an internet connection to allow for remote monitoring of water quality data with a smartphone, saving labour in the operational management of the plants.

"Optimal soil organic matter mapping using an ensemble model incorporating moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, portable X-ray fluorescence, and visible near-infrared data","Digital soil mapping of soil organic matter (SOM) is necessary because of its importance for carbon sequestration, soil health, and food security. However, large-scale digital soil mapping of SOM remains a challenge to improve accuracy and provide more local information. To address this knowledge gap, a strategy that incorporates remote and proximal sensing data into an ensemble model for the digital soil mapping is proposed. In this study, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, portable X-ray fluorescence, and visible near-infrared spectroscopy data from 402 soil samples were used to map the SOM at a resolution of 90 m, model the SOM with random forest, cubist, and ensemble models, and evaluate its environmental factors in the northeastern and northern Chinese plains, a typical agricultural plain (approximately 66,000,000 ha). The digital maps of the SOM were derived along with their uncertainties. The results show that the visible near-infrared and portable X-ray fluorescence data play an important role in the SOM distribution. Inclusion of these data in the model, improved the R-p(2) by 6.25-35.42 %, and reduced the root mean square error of the prediction by 0.30-1.54 g kg(-1). The ensemble model, which included remote and proximal sensing variables, outperformed the results of previous studies with a root mean square error of 6.68 g kg 1 and provided more detailed information. Thus, this study confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The SOM product obtained by this strategy was able to accurately control soil management, and the structural equation model showed that human activities exerted a direct influence on SOM comparable to the overall effect of natural factors on SOM. The contribution of straw mulching to human activities was great with path coefficient >0.50. This suggests that land management, especially straw mulching, should be improved in this area. In summary, this study proposed a novel strategy for accurately and efficiently obtaining SOM products for agricultural decision-making, terrestrial carbon cycling, and carbon stock estimation. Future advancements will focus on more accurate and detailed global SOM maps or carbon storage by integrating multiple models with remote sensing data and proximal sensing data from available soil spectral libraries.",Not About Sufficiency
What matters for carbon emissions in regional sectors? A China study of extended STIRPAT model,"The surge in energy consumption and CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions is exacerbating global warming. The Chinese government has promised to reduce CO2 emission by 60%-65% per unit of GDP over the 2005 level by around 2030. Analyzing the factors influencing CO2 emissions is one of the key aspects involved in effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we add climatic factors based on socio-economic factors, and adopt the extended STIRPAT model to investigate the mechanism driving emissions by the co-action of natural and socio-economic factors. The results show that the 1995-2014 emissions in China's Zhejiang province had an upward trend with growth rates varying between intermediate periods. The order of the factors' elasticity coefficients is urbanization rate (0.181) > GDP per capita (0.180) > population (0.177) > energy intensity (0.170) > trade openness (0.170) > cooling degree days (0.127) > mean temperature anomaly (0.116). Economic development and urbanization were the main factors promoting CO2 emissions in 1996-1999, while economic development and foreign trade were the main factors in 2000-2014. Policy makers should pay more attention to keeping a healthy pace of economic development, introducing more low energy consumption and low pollution enterprises and encouraging technological innovation. Improving the quality of urbanization, guiding a sustainable lifestyle, adjusting the structure of foreign trade and curbing energy intensity are also expected to reduce emissions.

This study examines the factors contributing to inclusive growth in the BRICS countries, concentrating on the connections between life expectancy, environmental sustainability, and economic growth. We perform wavelet-based data analysis from 1990 to 2022 to investigate the dynamic time-frequency relationships between life expectancy (LEO) and essential variables such as GDP, CO2 emissions, RNE consumption, and population growth (PGP). The results show that although economic development and industrialization often increase life expectancy, they also hurt the environment, as most BRICS countries have a positive link between CO2 emissions and life expectancy at birth. The findings also indicate that short-term economic and infrastructural disturbances prevent the immediate effects of renewable energy usage on life expectancy. Furthermore, because population increases burden healthcare systems and resources, inclusive growth faces substantial hurdles. The study provides insights into the importance of green energy and demographic management in fostering sustainable and inclusive growth, and it underscores the challenges of striking a balance between economic development, social well-being, and environmental sustainability in emerging nations.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability and carbon neutrality trends for microalgae-based wastewater treatment: A review,"As the global economy develops and the population increases, greenhouse gas emissions and wastewater discharge have become inevitable global problems. Conventional wastewater treatment processes produce direct or indirect greenhouse gas, which can intensify global warming. Microalgae-based wastewater treatment technology can not only purify wastewater and use the nutrients in wastewater to produce microalgae biomass, but it can also absorb CO2 in the atmosphere or flue gas through photosynthesis, which demonstrates great potential as a sustainable and economical wastewater treatment technology. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of microalgae in different types of wastewater treatment processes in terms of the extent of their bioremediation function and microalgae biomass production. In addition, various newly developed microalgae cultivation systems, especially biofilm cultivation systems, were further characterized systematically. The performance of different microalgae cultivation systems was studied and summarized. Current research on the technical approaches for the modification of the CO2 capture by microalgae and the maximization of CO2 transfer and conversion efficiency were also reviewed. This review serves as a useful and informative reference for the application of wastewater treatment and CO2 capture by microalgae, aiming to provide a reference for the realization of carbon neutrality in wastewater treatment systems.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Erosion Risk Assessment Using GIS-Based AHP Method: A Case Study of Doğancı Dam Watershed in Bursa (Türkiye),"Soil erosion, one of the most serious phenomena in watershed management, can be estimated based on various criteria. Land use change is one of the most important factors affecting the susceptibility of soil erosion. In this study, the effect of land use change on soil erosion risk in two plan periods (2005 and 2017) was investigated using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for the forest planning units in the Do & gbreve;anc & imath; Dam Watershed, located in Bursa, T & uuml;rkiye. Eight criteria were evaluated including erosion-related slope, bedrock type, land use/land cover, precipitation, relative relief, aspect, drainage frequency, and density. According to the results, the most effective factor in soil erosion was slope (0.29), while bedrock type and land use/land cover ranked second with 0.19. It was found that full closure forests were characterized by high erosion resistance (0.3), while bare land was characterized as the most sensitive area to erosion (0.39). In terms of spatio-temporal changes in a 12-year period, the areas in the medium and high erosion risk decreased, while low and very low-risk areas increased. The ROC method showed a satisfactory accuracy of 72.8% and 80.2% for the 2005 and 2017 erosion risk maps, respectively.",Not About Sufficiency
Ex situ growth and biomass of Populus bioenergy crops irrigated and fertilized with landfill leachate,"Merging traditional intensive forestry with waste management offers dual goals of fiber and bioenergy production, along with environmental benefits such as soil/water remediation and carbon sequestration. As part of an ongoing effort to acquire data about initial genotypic performance, we evaluated: (1) the early aboveground growth of trees belonging to currently utilized Populus genotypes subjected to irrigation with municipal solid waste landfill leachate or non-fertilized well water (control), and (2) the above- and below-ground biomass of the trees after 70 days of growth. We determined height, diameter, and number of leaves at 28, 42, 56, and 70 days after planting (DAP), along with stem, leaf, and root dry mass by testing six Populus clones (DN34, DN5, 14551, NC14104, NM2, NM6) grown in a greenhouse in a split-split plot, repeated measures design with two blocks, two treatments (whole-plots), six clones (sub-plots), and four sampling dates (sub-sub-plots, repeated measure). Treatments (leachate, water) were applied every other day beginning 42 DAP. The leachate-treated trees exhibited greater height, diameter, and number of leaves at 56 and 70 DAP (P<0.05). There was broad variation in clonal responses to leachate treatment for dry mass, with a general trend of leachate-treated trees exhibiting greater stem and leaf dry mass (P<0.05), but negligible differences for root dry mass (P>0.05). Overall, genotypic responses to the leachate treatment were clone-specific for all traits. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Implementing Marginal-Cost Vehicle Mileage Fees on the Maryland Statewide Road Network,"Properly structured vehicle mileage fee systems may help transportation professionals and officials at all levels address prominent issues such as funding gaps, traffic congestion, and emissions. In theory, vehicles should be assessed a user fee equivalent to the full marginal cost not borne by users. The full marginal cost of auto and truck travel in different time periods on all roadways in Maryland was estimated. The study evaluated the impacts of such marginal-cost vehicle miles traveled ('VMT) fees on travel behavior, revenue generation, equity, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions in Maryland and the surrounding states of Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Results showed that with consideration of all driving externalities, the marginal-cost VMT fee for travel in Maryland during peak periods ranged from 0.20 to about 12.16 cents/mi and from 3.91 to about 45.33 cents/mi for cars and trucks, respectively. Compared with existing revenue policy, the marginal-cost VMT fee could reduce overall VMT by 7.65% in the multistate region covered by the quantitafive model and by 7.81% just in Maryland. Also, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in Maryland could be reduced by 7.62% to 9.42% by pollutant type. Total revenue generation would increase by about 168% (including fuel taxes and bridge and roadway tolls). In regard to income equity, the middle-income group would be hurt most (largest consumer surplus decrease), while the highest-income group would be hurt least. Results also indicated that the proposed marginal-cost VMT fee in Maryland could affect neighboring states to varying degrees.",Not About Sufficiency
Network Analysis of Actors and Policy Keywords for Sustainable Environmental Governance: Focusing on Chinese Environmental Policy,"Environmental issues are viewed as a serious problem with a complex network structure involving various stakeholders. Environmental governance is considered the most reasonable way to promote environmental policy, and it is an important mechanism contributing to the sustainable development of society. Through the network analysis of actor and policy keywords, this study demonstrated whether environmental governance policies are being pursued through the cooperation of various participants in China, the epicenter of global environmental issues. We collected text big data from 2001 to 2018 under the theme of environmental policy on the main online portal web in China. Through text mining, key actors and policy keywords were selected according to the timing of environmental policy promotion, and network analysis and core-periphery analysis were conducted based on this actor/keywords data set. The results of this study are as follows. First, China's environmental policy is a rudimentary governance cooperation structure, and the central and local governments are still the main policy-promoting actors. Second, the fundamental solution of the environmental problem through readjustment of the environment-related system and industrial restructuring has become the keyword for China's implementation of environmental policy at present. Third, there were certain words, such as social, public, enterprise, and institution, in the aspects of environmental governance, while these words failed to be at the center of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis for the actors. This result shows that environmental governance and network are still at an early stage and that the Chinese government's strong power lies in its environmental policy.

Relationship between giant panda populations and selected ecosystem services,"The Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Targets address both biodiversity and ecosystem services. We explore the relationship between giant panda populations and three ecosystem services: carbon sequestration, water retention, and soil retention. Do pandas prefer areas with higher than average values of these services? Areas may be good for pandas but not for these ecosystem services, and vice versa. Answering these questions can focus panda conservation. We map their spatial distribution and temporal changes from 2000 to 2015, by watershed, to target future protected areas for both pandas and these ecosystem services. Pandas occupy watersheds with above-average carbon sequestration and water retention. There is no tendency for pandas to be increasing in watersheds that have higher than average values of these ecosystem services or in watersheds where they are improving. Protected areas represented watersheds with higher than average values of these ecosystem services but without pandas only poorly. Watersheds with pandas do provide higher than average ecosystem services, but watersheds above average for these ecosystem services often lack pandas. Those areas might be potentially important for pandas, but obstacles block their way. We identified conservation areas combining habitats, population, activity range, and higher than average values of these ecosystem services and then proposed new protected areas.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Impacts of Resource Endowment, and Environmental Regulations on Sustainability-Empirical Evidence Based on Data from Renewable Energy Enterprises","In today's socio-economic context where environmental protection and sustainable development are equally important, how renewable energy enterprises can achieve sustainable development has become a topic of academic interest in recent years. This paper investigates the link between sustainable growth (SG) of renewable energy firms, resource endowment (RE), and environmental regulatory (ERs) issues through a fixed-effects model and a GMM model. Through empirical analysis, it was found that economical environmental regulations have the greatest positive impact on sustainable growth, followed by legal environmental regulations and supervised environmental regulations. Resource endowment is positively related to sustainable growth for non-state-owned renewable energy enterprises, but the negative impact on sustainable growth reflects the effect the of ""resource curse"". In addition, resource endowment has a negative moderating effect on environmental regulations and sustainable growth. Thus, the most significant effect is on the relationship between economical environmental regulations and sustainable growth, followed by legal environmental regulations and supervised environmental regulations. Therefore, the flexible and concurrent application of multiple environmental policies is an important way to ensure effective regulations and promote sustainable business growth.",Not About Sufficiency
Supply chain in transition navigating economic growth and environmental sustainability through education,"The growing interest in the Management of Eco-Friendly Supply Chains warrants this study. Green supply chain management (GSCM) is an approach to supply chain management (SCM) that takes into account environmental factors. Therefore, GSCM is vital in shaping the cumulative environmental effect of businesses engaged in supply chain operations. In addition, GSCM may help improve the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives. Manufacturing companies, particularly in developing nations like India, are trying to adjust essential procedures and supply chains because of the rising need to be ecologically sustainable. However, such efforts must be deployed strategically to be ecologically sustainable and economically successful. As a result, this study focuses on the relationship between green supply chain management and education that affect environmental sustainability and economic performance. As a further step toward more sustainable development, the mediating function of education is sustainable economic growth and environmental health. The data was collected by distributing a well-crafted questionnaire to manufacturing facilities in India. We employed PLS-SEM to analyze and interpret the data test hypotheses based on data from 415 replies. The findings point to cost and profit as the primary metrics of corporate success. Disposal of trash, usage of resources, and release of greenhouse gases are alternative measures of environmental sustainability. Distributed online links and in-person interviews with employees at companies throughout India who use GSCM procedures provided the basis for the study's primary data set. The data was gathered with the use of an organized survey form. The findings of tests conducted on the hypotheses were considered. According to this research, cost, profit, waste, resource, and GHG emission impacts vary depending on which GSCM techniques are implemented. Green supply chain management strategies significantly affect price, trash disposal, resource utilization, and GHG emissions. There was no discernible trend between GSCM methods and financial success. In addition to discussing the unique elements of sustainable supply chains and the limits of current research, this article also discusses how a company's bottom line will benefit monetarily from establishing a sustainable supply chain. This should inspire more study in this area. Our investigation revealed patterns and voids, and we used that information to outline a thorough plan for future GSCM studies.

A new thermal conductivity model for sandy and peat soils,"Soil thermal conductivity (lambda) is frequently required when studying coupled heat and water transfer in soils. While lambda models are widely available for mineral soil, they are not as readily available for organic soil, which plays an increasingly significant role in climate change and carbon sequestration. This study used a heat-pulse method to measure the thermal properties of six soil peat:mineral mixes spanning wide ranges of water contents and bulk densities. Based on this, a new generalized lambda model was proposed, which was tested by fitting the model to heat-pulse measurements, and then comparing with several other widely-used empirical or physically-based models of lambda. The new model accounts for the effects of porosity, degree of saturation, organic matter content and soil texture on the thermal conductivity. It is capable of describing the measured data more effectively than other models due to its simplicity and applicability, as indicated by the lowest values of root mean square error (0.028 W m(-1) K-1) and the highest value of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (0.995). The new model has shown potential for use in studying numerical algorithms for describing coupled heat and mass transfer processes in a variety of multiphase soils. It can also be incorporated into global land surface models, particularly in terms of identifying the significance of peat soils on climate change and carbon sequestration.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Organizational Justice on Turnover Intention Among Primary Healthcare Workers: The Mediating Role of Work Motivation,"Background: Adequate staffing of primary healthcare workers (PHCWs) is essential for strengthening healthcare systems, yet high turnover intention among these workers presents a significant challenge. While existing strategies primarily target economic incentives and career progression, this study proposes that enhancing organizational justice could offer a novel and impactful approach to retention. Drawing on equity theory and self-determination theory, the study examines how organizational justice influences turnover intention and the mediating roles of both the intensity and type of work motivation. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study design. A multi-stage cluster sampling method was utilized to administer a questionnaire survey to 1,200 PHCWs from 36 primary health institutions in Shandong Province, China. Results: Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that organizational justice significantly reduces turnover intention among PHCWs ((3 = -0.435, p < 0.001). Among its three dimensions, distributive justice ((3 = -0.203, p < 0.001) and procedural justice ((3 = -0.177, p < 0.01) had significant impacts on turnover intention, whereas interactional justice did not. The study also confirmed the mediating role of work motivation, with work motivation type accounting for 18.2% of the total effect, exerting a greater influence than work motivation intensity, which accounted for 13.8% of the total effect. Conclusion: This study finds that organizational justice, especially distributive and procedural justice, reduces turnover intention among PHCWs in China. Work motivation mediates this effect, with motivation type having a stronger influence than motivation intensity. Enhancing organizational justice through transparent systems for compensation, promotion, and inclusive decision-making can foster the internalization of work motivation, providing a sustainable approach to improving retention and supporting the stability of the primary healthcare workforce.",Not About Sufficiency
TESSD Negotiation: An Ugly Duckling or A White Swan?,"The imperative for effective climate governance has recently driven numerous countries to consider incorporating sustainability criteria within the framework of global trade governance. A noteworthy effort in this direction is the Trade and Environmental Sustainability Structured Discussions (TESSD) within the World Trade Organization (WTO). Regrettably, there has been a scarcity of studies thoroughly examining the intricacies of the TESSD negotiations. This article fills this literature gap by empirically analysing the ongoing TESSD negotiations. Moreover, the TESSD's plurilateral nature adds an extra layer of significance to its examination. While some scholars have theorized about the benefits of embracing plurilateralism in reforming WTO rules, none have yet subjected this hypothesis to empirical scrutiny. This article examines whether the plurilateral approach used in TESSD negotiations delivers these benefits. It reveals whether the TESSD negotiations can be likened to the ugly duckling's transformation into a graceful white swan, essentially deviating from the multilateral approach. Overall, this article's primary contribution lies in its critical examination of the TESSD negotiations and a thoughtful reflection on using the plurilateral negotiation approach in the context of environmental sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Microwave-assisted wet co-torrefaction of food sludge and lignocellulose biowaste for biochar production and nutrient recovery,"Microwave-assisted wet co-torrefaction of food sludge (FS) and six widely produced lignocellulose biowaste samples were performed for biochar production. Factors including the torrefaction temperature, reaction time, biowaste type, and blending ratio of sludge and biowaste were evaluated. Biochar produced from FS torrefied at 150 degrees C for 20 min exhibited the greatest enhancement of carbon content and higher heating value (HHV). Blending sludge with macadamia husk at a ratio of 25/75 (db%) under the same wet torrefaction condition further improved biochar quality, enhanced the fixed carbon content, caused the highest HHV (19.6 MJ/kg), and considerably decreased the ash content. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that sludge and biowaste degradation followed first-order kinetics, and the resultant biochar exhibited improved thermal stability, combustion efficiency, and safety for biofuel applications because of the increase in the activation energy, frequency factor, and ignition and combustion temperatures. Biochar is an excellent coal substitute for power generation because of its enhanced energy efficiency (energy return on investment: 7.4) and environmental friendliness (45.2 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with using bituminous coal). Moreover, the protein and carbohydrate contents in the supernatant of FS co-torrefied with biowaste at different blending ratios increased by 1.8-9.0 and 0.8-3.4, respectively. These contents can be recycled back to the activated sludge unit as a nutrient source, rendering the process green and sustainable without any waste production.

Optimal options of ecological restoration patterns in semi-arid regions: Lessons learned from two-decade ecological restoration projects in Bashang Plateau of China,"In responding to global ecosystem conservation and sustainable social development, numerous ecological restoration projects have been performed in ecologically vulnerable areas around the world, especially in semi-arid areas. Affected by local hydrothermal conditions, whether ecological restoration projects can achieve goals of balanced water-carbon enhancement as well as sustainable development in semi-arid areas is controversial. It is uncertain that to what extent the land use change caused by ecological restoration projects will affect the water-carbon imbalance. This research takes the Bashang Plateau Protection Zone (BPZ), a typical semi-arid area in Hebei Province of China, as a porotype to discover the spatial water-carbon changes and their contributing factors under ecological projects during 2000 to 2020 through root mean square deviation and random forest analysis. Results show: (1) In the past two decades, carbon sequestration in BPZ continued to improve while water conservation decreased significantly. The water-carbon imbalance regions in BPZ increased nearly 6.80 folds, from 338.60 km2 to 2642.38 km2. (2) Precipitation and temperature exerted the most significant impact on the formation of water-carbon imbalance regions, whereas the contribution of land use change could reach 40%, demonstrating that human activities were also strongly responsible for water-carbon imbalance. (3) Ecological restoration pattern of limiting afforestation and agricultural land expansion with priority restoration of grassland is beneficial to achieving water-carbon balance and sustainable goals of ecological restoration in semi-arid regions.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil carbon response to woody plant encroachment: importance of spatial heterogeneity and deep soil storage,"1. Recent global trends of increasing woody plant abundance in grass-dominated ecosystems may substantially enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and could represent a strong carbon (C) sink in the terrestrial environment. However, few studies have quantitatively addressed the influence of spatial heterogeneity of vegetation and soil properties on SOC storage at the landscape scale. In addition, most studies assessing SOC response to woody encroachment consider only surface soils, and have not explicitly assessed the extent to which deeper portions of the soil profile may be sequestering C. 2. We quantified the direction, magnitude and pattern of spatial heterogeneity of SOC in the upper 1.2 m of the profile following woody encroachment via spatially specific intensive soil sampling across a landscape in a subtropical savanna in the Rio Grande Plains, USA, that has undergone woody proliferation during the past century. 3. Increased SOC accumulation following woody encroachment was observed to considerable depth, albeit at reduced magnitudes in deeper portions of the profile. Overall, woody clusters and groves accumulated 12.87 and 18.67 Mg Cha(-1) more SOC compared to grasslands to a depth of 1.2 m. 4. Woody encroachment significantly altered the pattern of spatial heterogeneity of SOC to a depth of 5 cm, with marginal effect at 5-15 cm, and no significant impact on soils below 15 cm. Fine root density explained greater variability of SOC in the upper 15 cm, while a combination of fine root density and soil clay content accounted for more of the variation in SOC in soils below 15 cm across this landscape. 5. Synthesis. Substantial soil organic carbon sequestration can occur in deeper portions of the soil profile following woody encroachment. Furthermore, vegetation patterns and soil properties influenced the spatial heterogeneity and uncertainty of soil organic carbon in this landscape, highlighting the need for spatially specific sampling that can characterize this variability and enable scaling and modelling. Given the geographic extent of woody encroachment on a global scale, this undocumented deep soil carbon sequestration suggests this vegetation change may play a more significant role in regional and global carbon sequestration than previously thought.",Not About Sufficiency
An autoencoder-based model for forest disturbance detection using Landsat time series data,"Monitoring and classifying disturbed forests can provide information support for not only sustainable forest management but also global carbon sequestration assessments. In this study, we propose an autoencoder-based model for forest disturbance detection, which considers disturbances as anomalous events in forest temporal trajectories. The autoencoder network is established and trained to reconstruct intact forest trajectories. Then, the disturbance detection threshold is derived by Tukey's method based on the reconstruction error of the intact forest trajectory. The assessment result shows that the model using the NBR time series performs better than the NDVI-based model, with an overall accuracy of 90.3%. The omission and commission errors of disturbed forest are 7% and 12%, respectively. Additionally, the trained NBR-based model is implemented in two test areas, with overall accuracies of 87.2% and 86.1%, indicating the robustness and scalability of the model. Moreover, comparing three common methods, the proposed model performs better, especially for intact forest detection accuracy.

Modeling and parametric analysis of low-temperature oxidative self-heating in coal stockpiles driven by natural convection,"To accurately ascertain the behavior of oxidation heating and emission of oxidation products in fully enclosed coal storage yards under the influence of natural convection, comprehensive adiabatic oxidation experiments were conducted, encompassing coal particles of multiple grain sizes. Linear regression analysis was applied to deduce the heating characteristics of coal particles within real coal stockpiles from the experimental data. Subsequently, numerical simulations were executed, leveraging the acquired oxidation parameters specific to the stored coal. These simulations unveiled that natural convection triggers the formation of spiral airflow on both sides of the stockpile, with the strength of this airflow increasing in tandem with rising temperatures. An inflection point becomes evident during the impact assessment of porosity on maximum temperature variation, whereby its augmentation improves the heating rate when below the critical threshold, but conversely diminishes it when surpassing that threshold. Furthermore, coal particles smaller than 3 mm effectively isolate oxygen. As the degree of metamorphism increases, the rate of temperature rise decreases, and the high -temperature region penetrates deeper into the coal stockpile. The genetic algorithm-optimized random forest algorithm emerges as a highly effective tool for the precise prediction of the efficient storage duration of the coal stockpile. Keeping porosity below 0.25 proves effective in oxygen isolation. Lower heights and steeper slope angles exhibit the capacity to decelerate oxidation during high-temperature phases, thereby minimizing the loss of coal calorific value and greenhouse gas emissions. This study is paramount for the achievement of secure, efficient, and environmentally friendly coal storage practices in the context of natural convection.",Not About Sufficiency
Digital Mapping and Scenario Prediction of Soil Salinity in Coastal Lands Based on Multi-Source Data Combined with Machine Learning Algorithms,"Salinization is a major soil degradation process threatening ecosystems and posing a great challenge to sustainable agriculture and food security worldwide. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in soil salinity (EC1:5) mapping. Further, we predicted the distribution patterns of soil salinity under different future scenarios in the Yellow River Delta. A geodatabase comprising 201 soil samples and 19 conditioning factors (containing data based on remote sensing images such as Landsat, SPOT/VEGETATION PROBA-V, SRTMDEMUTM, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2) was used to compare the predictive performance of empirical bayesian kriging regression, random forest, and CatBoost models. The CatBoost model exhibited the highest performance with both training and testing datasets, with an average MAE of 1.86, an average RMSE of 3.11, and an average R2 of 0.59 in the testing datasets. Among explanatory factors, soil Na was the most important for predicting EC1:5, followed by the normalized difference vegetation index and soil organic carbon. Soil EC(1:5 )predictions suggested that the Yellow River Delta region faces severe salinization, particularly in coastal zones. Among three scenarios with increases in soil organic carbon content (1, 2, and 3 g/kg), the 2 g/kg scenario resulted in the best improvement effect on saline-alkali soils with EC1:5 > 2 ds/m.

"""Living a good life"": conceptualizations of well-being in a conservation context in Cambodia","Conservation practice has sometimes been criticized for relying on simplistic assumptions about social contexts in natural resource management. Despite recent advances conceptualizing the interface between human well-being and the environment, very few studies moving from theory to practice exist. We address this gap by providing one of the first careful examinations of local conceptualizations of well-being in a conservation context, using mixed methods to examine the multidimensionality and heterogeneity of well-being conceptualizations across three sites in northern Cambodia. Each site faced different levels of conservation activities and development pressures, the latter being mainly linked to the degree of impact from economic land concessions. Our results highlight village context as a key line of variation in individual well-being, rather than differences related to age, gender, or wealth. Our results suggest that conservation incentives that mirror people's aspirations can balance out negative trade-offs linked to compliance and can contribute to well-being. We show that multifaceted values are attached to well-being components, highlighting the importance of subjective indicators and perceptions to capture fully the social changes and impacts of conservation in complex contexts. We conclude that enquiries into subjective well-being should become an integral part of participatory assessments and adaptive management of conservation interventions.",About Sufficiency
(Carbon cycling and sequestration opportunities in temperate grasslands,"Temperate grasslands account for c. 20% of the land area in Europe. Carbon accumulation in grassland ecosystems occurs mostly below ground and changes in soil organic carbon stocks may result from land use changes (e.g. conversion of arable land to grassland) and grassland management. Grasslands also contribute to the biosphere-atmosphere exchange of non-CO2 radiatively active trace gases, with fluxes intimately linked to management practices. In this article, we discuss the current knowledge on carbon cycling and carbon sequestration opportunities in temperate grasslands. First, from a simple two-parameter exponential model fitted to literature data, we assess soil organic carbon fluxes resulting from land use change (e.g. between arable and grassland) and from grassland management. Second, we discuss carbon fluxes within the context of farming systems, including crop-grass rotations and farm manure applications. Third, using a grassland ecosystem model (PaSim), we provide estimates of the greenhouse gas balance, in CO2 equivalents, of pastures for a range of stocking rates and of N fertilizer applications. Finally, we consider carbon sequestration opportunities for France resulting from the restoration of grasslands and from the deintensification of intensive livestock breeding systems. We emphasize major uncertainties concerning the magnitude and non-linearity of soil carbon stock changes in agricultural grasslands as well as the emissions of N2O from soil and of CH4 from grazing livestock.",About Sufficiency

The findings indicate that nano fertilizers, created through various synthesis techniques, can contribute to sustainable agriculture by providing adequate plant nutrients and reducing the reliance on chemical fertilizers.",About Sufficiency
A 2-year study on the effect of biochar on methane and nitrous oxide emissions in an intensive rice-wheat cropping system,"The impacts of biochar addition with nitrogen fertilizer (Urea-N) on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and grain yields are not comprehensively understood. Therefore, we designed a field experiment in an intensive rice-wheat cropping system located in the Taihu Lake region of China and measured CH4 and N2O emissions for 2 consecutive years to examine the impacts of biochar combined with N-fertilizer on rice production and GHG flux. Three field experimental treatments were designed: (1) no N-fertilizer application (N0); (2) 270 kg N ha(-1) application (N270); and (3) 270 kg N-fertilizer ha(-1) plus 25 t ha(-1) biochar application (N270 + C). We found that, compared with urea application alone, biochar applied with Urea-N fertilizer increased N use efficiency (NUE) and resulted in more stable growth of rice yield. In addition, biochar addition increased CH4 emissions by 0.5-37.5% on average during the two consecutive rice-growing seasons, and decreased N2O-N loss by similar to 16.7%. During the first growing season, biochar addition did not significantly affect the global warming potential (GWPt) or the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of rice production (p > 0.05). By contrast, during the second rice-growing season, biochar application significantly increased GWPt and GHGI by 28.9% and 18.8%, respectively, mainly because of increased CH4 emissions. Our results suggest that biochar amendment could improve grain yields and NUE, and increased soil GWPt, resulting in a higher potential environmental cost, but that biochar additions enhance exogenous carbon sequestration by the soil, which could offset the increases in GHG emissions.",About Sufficiency

Research hotspots can be divided into five clusters: (1) pyrolysis, nutrient, and microbial communities; (2) the immobilization of heavy metals; (3) crop yield and soil properties; (4) greenhouse gas, meta-analysis, and field experiment; (5) carbon fraction and sequestration. Reviews account for 60 % of the top 10 most highly cited papers, and eight of the top 10 focus on the early research period, setting the stage for the development of the BC field. Science of the Total Environment has the highest number of publications and total citations, and literature published in Soil Biology and Biochemistry is to some extent more likely to be cited. In the future, we need to carry out research in the following aspects: (1) Interaction mechanisms between BC, soil, and soil microbial communities. (2) Designing low-cost, high-yield, and high-effect optimization methods to improve the characteristics of BC. (3) Effect of BC on the environment and human health in long-term locali-zation experiments. (4) Carbon sinks of BC need to be further evaluated on a global scale.",About Sufficiency
A 'Common Food Policy' for Europe: How governance reforms can spark a shift to healthy diets and sustainable food systems,"More than half of adults in the European Union (EU) are now either overweight or obese (53%). Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), many of which are diet-related, account for 70% of mortality in Europe and a growing share of healthcare costs. While eating habits have an important role to play in NCD prevention, consumption patterns across the EU are diverging significantly from recommended diets. There is growing consensus on the solution: a series of coordinated and wide-ranging policy interventions to build healthy 'food environments'. This article argues that EU governance structures remain ill-adapted to the systemic nature of this and other challenges in food systems (e.g. climate change, biodiversity loss, food poverty): conflicting objectives and missed synergies are identified between different policy areas (agriculture, trade, health, environment, etc.) and between different levels of governance (EU, national, local). An integrated food policy framework - a 'Common Food Policy' - is therefore required to meet the EU's public health and sustainability objectives. It identifies four distinct aspects of the governance shift required to promote healthy diets and build sustainable food systems in Europe: (i) coherence across policy areas; (ii) coherence across governance levels; (iii) governance for transition; and (iv) food democracy. Blueprints for a Common Food Policy are already emerging, and are ripe for consideration, development, and implementation by the European institutions.",About Sufficiency
A Community-Based Agro-Food Hub Model for Sustainable Farming,"This conceptual paper focuses on the Agro-Food Hub paradigm as the main enabler for the sustainable development of agro-food Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the context of the currently established agro-food systems. This paper is based on a shared knowledge-driven research that presents different approaches/types of Agro-Food Hubs, providing useful insights into the strategic, operational and institutional approaches of the topic. After the illustration of the main approaches for the Agro-Food Hubs met in the literature, a holistic Agro-Food Hubs model was proposed (the Agro-Food Sustainability Knowledge Hub model), incorporating the main principles and functional guidelines within the framework of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Sustainable Supply Chain Management. This study is in line with the demographic, economic and social prospects for the 2050 and the European Economic and Social Committee decision for ""An EU Industrial Policy for the Food and Drinks Sector"" adopted on 4 May 2015. In particular, since the majority of research in the past focused on large organizations, this paper is expected to enlighten the problems emerged from current applied practices together with the opportunities for potential synergies among agricultural SMEs, through the utilization of alternative sustainable channels of distribution and value creation, such as the Agro-Food Hubs.",About Sufficiency
A conceptual framework for understanding the impacts of agriculture and food system policies on nutrition and health,"Agriculture and food systems are important determinants of nutrition and consequent public health. However, an understanding of the links among agriculture, food systems, nutrition, public health and the associated policy levers, is relatively under-developed. A framework conceptualizing these key relationships, relevant to a range of country contexts, would help inform policymakers as to how agriculture and food policy could improve nutrition and public health, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The objectives of this paper are: to present a conceptual framework, relevant to a range of country contexts and focused on the policymaker as the user, which depicts the key relationships among agriculture, the food system, nutrition and public health; and to describe how the framework can be used for understanding the impacts of agriculture and food system policies on nutrition outcomes. Existing conceptual frameworks, highlighting the relationships among agriculture, the food system, nutrition and public health (n = 37) were identified, reviewed and categorized, based on the key themes they address. Building on this analysis and synthesis a conceptual framework was developed that assists in identifying associated policy levers and their effects on elements of the framework. The end product is a conceptual framework that presents key domains linking agriculture and food systems to nutritional outcomes and public health. The framework is relevant to a range of contexts, for example low-, middle- and high-income settings; and to policymakers wishing to examine the potential direct and indirect impacts of agriculture and food system policies.",About Sufficiency
A decision-support system for analyzing tractor guidance technology,"A decision-support system was developed to assist small-scale producers, consultants, and extension agents with analyzing expected yield improvements, input cost savings, and equipment efficiency gains associated with global positioning system guidance on tractors using farm-specific details. Default parameters may be modified to perform partial budgeting and break-even analyses on a whole-farm basis. Findings suggest that this technology is profitable on as few as 49 ha, considered small-scale in the region, and under farm conditions assessed within. Further, tractor guidance is more feasible the more input-intensive the crops (e.g. cotton production vs. pasture maintenance) and the more expensive the equipment (e.g. using newer equipment). Changing input use affects greenhouse gas emissions that are reported as carbon equivalent footprint changes due to tractor guidance. For example, changing to tractors with lower horsepower to save on capital investment needs without changing the size of implement drawn, lowers fuel footprint as long as technically feasible and possible from a perspective of completing field work in a timely manner. Also, using manure instead of synthetic fertilizer, while economically advantageous, will increase the footprint of fertilizer applications given, among other factors, lesser nutrient density and thereby greater handling costs with manures. Quantifying these impacts across a whole farm is cumbersome since tractor guidance affects annual equipment use hours that are difficult to track and yet economically important. Hence, the decision support system was designed to capture farm-specific detail. The ability to perform whole-farm planning and sensitivity analyses in an automated, user-friendly, and flexible fashion is expected to increase technology adoption by small-scale producers.",About Sufficiency
A generalised marine planning framework for site selection based on ecosystem services,"A new proposed framework to assess sustainability impacts of maritime spatial plans (MSP-SA) utilises the ecosystem service (ES) concept to address the often-lacking social sustainability of the plans. This study departs in the MSP-SA framework and applies it to the (emerging) sea use of mussel farming. Informed by a literature review and two surveys, it is investigated whether the benefits and impacts of mussel farming can be related to underlying ES and relevant planning questions. The results show that most benefits and impacts of mussel farming can be connected to ES and reveal different user-environment-beneficiary interactions, ranging from conflicts to synergies. The marine planning framework is structured into different planning phases and it is shown that the ES concept can contribute to a normative vision, strategic objectives, and site-specific operational questions. Studying the different user-environment-beneficiary interactions can reveal who benefits and who loses from planning decisions. While the marine planning framework developed in this study is targeted at mussel farming, the approach can be adapted to other uses and planning areas and can contribute to social and equity aspects in MSP by considering the receivers of (dis)benefits.",About Sufficiency
A good life for all within planetary boundaries,"Humanity faces the challenge of how to achieve a high quality of life for over 7 billion people without destabilizing critical planetary processes. Using indicators designed to measure a 'safe and just' development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2-6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships. Strategies to improve physical and social provisioning systems, with a focus on sufficiency and equity, have the potential to move nations towards sustainability, but the challenge remains substantial.",About Sufficiency
A meta-analysis reveals increases in soil organic carbon following the restoration and recovery of croplands in Southwest China,"In China, the Grain for Green Program (GGP) is an ambitious project to convert croplands into natural vegetation, but exactly how changes in vegetation translate into changes in soil organic carbon remains less clear. Here we conducted a meta-analysis using 734 observations to explore the effects of land recovery on soil organic carbon and nutrients in four provinces in Southwest China. Following GGP, the soil organic carbon content (SOCc) and soil organic carbon stock (SOCs) increased by 33.73% and 22.39%, respectively, compared with the surrounding croplands. Similarly, soil nitrogen increased, while phosphorus decreased. Outcomes were heterogeneous, but depended on variations in soil and environmental characteristics. Both the regional land use and cover change indicated by the landscape type transfer matrix and net primary production from 2000 to 2020 further confirmed that the GGP promoted the forest area and regional mean net primary production. Our findings suggest that the GGP could enhance soil and vegetation carbon sequestration in Southwest China and help to develop a carbon-neutral strategy.",About Sufficiency
A method to design coupled innovations for the agroecological transition. Implementation for soil health management in Provencal sheltered vegetable systems,"CONTEXT: Transition to sustainable agriculture is in many cases hindered by a web of interconnected barriers across agricultural system levels (cropping, farming and agrifood systems), involving a diverse range of stakeholders (e.g., farmers, marketing companies, input providers, R&D). This calls for the coordinated design of innovations across levels to bring about major changes towards agroecological practices. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we devised and tested a method for the design of coupled innovations on soil health management in sheltered vegetable cropping systems, in south-eastern France. METHODS: We developed a workshop-based approach grounded on 4 principles: (1) innovation design relying on generativity, combination of independent knowledge sources, and creation of open social spaces; (2) participatory design with researchers-facilitators and stakeholder-experts; (3) progressive exploration of the problem complexity; and (4) use of intermediary objects to facilitate linkages across levels and stakeholders, and the evaluation of the innovations. Following a 3-steps approach, we explored innovations at increasing levels of complexity and diversity in participants, with each step's outcomes feeding the next one. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: With the participation of 34 stakeholders, we progressively designed three final coupled innovation prototypes targeting three key areas for innovation in our case study: (1) crop diversification; (2) application of biologically active amendments; and (3) integration of agroecological techniques and its optimization. We asked the participants to evaluate these three prototypes based on stakeholder criteria that we had previously characterized. We also produced complementary resources to move from the refined innovation concepts to their implementation: (a) 16 'simple' innovations and 37 complementary 'coupled' innovations, both original and adapted to the context of our case studyand (b) knowledge gaps to be filled. Examples of designed coupled innovations are: (i) organic mulching cropping system combined with on-farm organic mulch production (farm coupled innovation); (ii) crop diversification combined with plot exchange with neighboring farmer (farmer-farmer coupled innovation); and (iii) making soil health status explicitly transparent in field transactions combined with agroecological soil health management (agrifood system coupled innovations). SIGNIFICANCE: This workshop-based method is the last component of an original approach to support the agroecological transition of agrifood systems, initiated by a sociotechnical analysis and a tracking for coupled innovation. It enables the coordination of the innovation design across system levels and the agrifood system's stakeholders.",About Sufficiency
A mixed methods approach to exploring values that inform desirable food-systems futures,"Throughout the United States, urban food systems are in suboptimal states that are not operating efficiently or equitably and thus do not support food security for all. Creating transformation to a more sustainable and desirable state first requires acknowledging the different values of diverse groups within a city. Then these diverse values can be used to explore pluralistic pathways to futures that maximize benefits for multiple stakeholders. We demonstrate how integrating visioning and Q-methodology can achieve an inclusive understanding of values as priorities for such a food system. Applied in Flint, Michigan, a post-industrial Rust Belt city, this approach can shape the planning process for cities experiencing food insecurity. Qualitative analysis of data from a visioning workshop resulted in sixteen values as priorities for a sustainable and desirable food system. Values as priorities were then ranked in a Q-sort activity, from which three unique groups of ranking patterns emerged, each of which can be interpreted as a vision for a better future. The three visions were a food system with healthy foods that residents are willing to travel for; a food system with convenient, fresh food options for those who cannot travel; and a food system that maintains the community's food traditions. Our novel mixed methods approach empowers communities by giving them a voice in the planning process but also allows decision makers to create transformation pathways that more accurately reflect the needs of the various subsets of community members who hold diverse visions and priorities.",About Sufficiency
A model for fossil energy use in Danish agriculture used to compare organic and conventional farming,"Knowledge about fossil energy use in agricultural systems is needed, because it can improve the understanding of how to reduce the unsustainable use of limited energy resources and the following greenhouse gas emissions. This study describes and validates a model to assess fossil energy use in Danish agriculture; gives an example of how the model can be used to compare organic and conventional farming; and discusses the implications and potentials of using the model to simulate energy use in scenarios of agricultural production. The model is a development of an existing model, which was too coarse to predict measured energy use on Danish farms. The model was validated at the field operational, the crop type, and the national level, and can supplement the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change manual to quantify fossil energy use and subsequent carbon dioxide emissions from agriculture. The model can be used to model energy use as one indicator in a multi-criteria evaluation of sustainability, also including other agroecological and socio-economic indicators. As an example, energy use for eight conventional and organic crop types on loamy, sandy, and irrigated sandy soil was compared. The energy use was generally lower in the organic than in the conventional system, but yields were also lower. Consequently, conventional crop production had the highest energy production, whereas organic crop production had the highest energy efficiency. Generally, grain cereals such as wheat have a lower energy use per area than roughage crops such as beets. However, because of higher roughage crop yields per area, energy use per feed unit was higher in the roughage crops. Energy use for both conventional cattle and pig production was found to be higher than that for organic production. With respect to fossil energy use per produced livestock unit, agro-ecosystems producing pigs were in both cases less energy effective than those producing cattle. Fossil energy use for three scenarios of conversion to organic farming with increasing fodder import was compared to current conventional farming in Denmark. The scenario with the highest fodder import showed the highest energy use per livestock unit produced. In all scenarios, the energy use per unit produced was lower than in the present situation. However, the total Danish crop production was also lower. In conclusion, the model can be used to simulate scenarios, which can add new information to the discussion of future, sustainable agricultural production. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Customized assessment criteria and a tailored scoring system, specific to the region's context, are employed, resulting in a comprehensive grid with 18 indicators across nine components. Data analysis and visualization were facilitated using statistical methods and an Excel macro. The findings reveal limitations in the sustainability of the surveyed farms. Socio-territorial factors, including issues with product quality, insufficient farmer training, limited workforce mobilization and low social involvement, contribute to the overall sustainability challenges. Agroecologically, low crop diversification, inadequate space management, and excessive reliance on chemical inputs are identified as areas of concern. On the economic scale, low specialization levels hinder economic viability despite some financial autonomy. The study emphasizes the need for interventions to enhance sustainability in rainfed agrosystems. Recommendations are provided to address socio-territorial constraints, improve agricultural practices, and promote economic viability.

A non-grain production on cropland spatiotemporal change detection method based on Landsat time-series data,"Global food security is being threatened by the reduction of high-quality cropland, extreme weather events, and the uncertainty of food supply chains. The globalization of agricultural trade has elevated the diversification of non-grain production (NGP) on cultivated land to a prominent strategy for poverty alleviation in numerous developing nations. Its rapid expansion has engendered a multitude of deleterious consequences on both food security and ecological stability. NGP in China is becoming very common in the process of rapid urbanization, threatening national food security. To better understand the causal mechanisms and enable governments to balance food security and rural development, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of NGP using remote sensing. Yet knowledge gaps remain concerning how to use remote sensing to track human-dominated or -induced long-term cultivated land changes. Our study proposed a method for detecting the spatiotemporal evolution of NGP based on Landsat time-series data under the Google Earth Engine platform. This approach was proposed by (1) obtaining the union of cultivated lands from multiple landcover products to minimize the cultivated land omission, (2) constructing multi-index dynamic trend rules for 3 representative types of NGP and obtaining results at the pixel level, while adopting the continuous change detection and classification algorithm to Landsat time series (1986-2022) to determine when the most recent change occurred, (3) minimizing the noise by object-oriented land use-land cover classification and mode filter approaches, and (4) mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of NGP. The proposed methodology was tested in Jiashan, located in Zhejiang Province (eastern China), where NGP is widespread. We achieved a high overall accuracy of 95.67% for NGP type detection and an overall accuracy of 85.26% for change detection of time. The results indicated a continued increasing pattern of NGP in Jiashan from 1986 to 2022, with the cumulative percentage of NGP increasing from 0.02% to 20.69%. This study highlights the utilization of time-series data to document essential NGP information for evaluating food security in China and the method is well-suited for large-scale mapping due to its automatic manner.",About Sufficiency
A perennial living mulch system fosters a more diverse and balanced soil bacterial community,"Cover crops are known to positively impact soil health, both at a physical level (through erosion control and organic matter enhancement) and at a biological level (by fostering more diverse microbial communities). However, most research in this area has been conducted in the context of annual cover crops that are terminated when the main crop is planted. We have previously demonstrated that a continuous ""living mulch"" cover crop system can enhance the physical and chemical aspects of soil health; In this study, we reveal its effect on the soil bacterial community and compare it to two different annual cover crops and a conventional control without cover crops. We examined the effect of a living-mulch (LM) system using perennial white clover (Trifolium pratense L), annual cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) (CR), annual crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) (CC), and a no-cover (NC) control at three time points during the 2018 growing season. 16S rRNA amplicon analysis of the soil bacterial community revealed that the community composition in cover crop systems was significantly different from the NC control, and that LM and CR accommodated more heterogeneous and even bacterial communities compared to the NC control. The difference in bacterial composition between cover crop systems appears to be partly influenced by soil nitrogen concentration and lime buffer capacity. Overall community diversity was associated with nitrogen and metal ion concentrations, and these associations were both stronger and more numerous later in the season. These results elucidate how a perennial cover crop system affects the soil bacterial community and advance our understanding of the interactions between crops, management practices, and soil microbiomes in sustainable agriculture.",About Sufficiency
A Playful Approach to Household Sustainability: Results From a Pilot Study on Resource Consumption,"Background. U.S. households produce a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, indicating a potential to reduce their carbon footprints from changing food, energy, and water (FEW) consumption patterns. Behavioral change to FEW consumption is needed, but difficult to achieve. Interactive and engaging approaches like serious games could be a way to increase awareness of possible measures, leading to more sustainable behavior at a household level. This study looks into the experiences and effects of a digital game for homeowners with the potential to reduce FEW resource consumption impacts. Intervention. In this study, we developed and implemented a digital game to explore its potential to raise awareness of the consumption and conservation of FEW resources and the efficacy of conservation messages. This study aims to measure learning outcomes from game participation and to assess the suitability of the game for informing resource conservation actions. Methods. We tested a proof-of-concept of a digital four-player game, called HomeRUN, with 28 homeowners. The data collected include homeowners' values and preferences with regard to FEW resources. The patterns of game actions are analyzed with an emphasis on the effectiveness of conservation messaging in informing household consumption behavior. Results. About 65% of the respondents agree that they gained a better understanding of the greenhouse gas emission impacts of FEW resource consumption after playing the game. Over 57% of the respondents agree that the game experience would influence their future consumption behavior, while a quarter of the respondents are unsure.

A potential pesticides exposure index (PPEI) for developing countries: Applied in a transboundary basin,"The potential risk of pesticide exposure in developing countries needs further study as data are limited and simple tools to assess the risks on human health and the environment caused by pesticides are lacking. This article introduces a potential pesticides exposure index (PPEI) as a modeling tool to assess the risk of human and environmental pesticide exposure in agricultural basins. The PPEI is based on a number of factors including: human population centers and their proximity to agricultural crops, the toxicological properties of pesticides, and their application frequency. The index was applied to a region in southern Ecuador (approximately 7200 km(2)) where corn, rice, and sugarcane are the predominant crops, and where hot spots with the highest vulnerability to pesticide residues were identified. Of the total of 5326 neighborhoods for the entire study area, 1030 had high, 1124 had medium, and 1009 had low PPEI scores. Among the practical uses of PPEI are to help to assist regulatory agencies and academics evaluate the effects of land use policies on pesticide vulnerability. Also, it can be easily expanded to include other parameters, such as data from other agricultural crops, or frequency of pesticide application. The PPEI can be a valuable indicator of risk of pesticide exposure, as it is reliable and applicable to developing countries, where data and resources are limited. (C) 2021 SETAC",About Sufficiency
A review of the capacity for nutritional strategies to address environmental challenges in poultry production,"Poultry production faces increasing environmental challenges, in the United States and globally. Although the environmental impact of poultry production has been decreased, regulatory and social pressures mandate that further improvements be made to decrease the pollution potential even more. Concerns over air and water quality to date have been related primarily to nutrient issues, specifically N and P. Air emission concerns include N and sulfur emissions. More recently, states have addressed emissions of volatile organic compounds. Although no regulations have been developed that are targeted at food production, greenhouse gas emissions are receiving a great deal of attention in the United States. Nutrient-related water quality concerns have focused on N and P contributions to ground and surface waters, respectively. To address nutrient-related air and water quality concerns, nutritional strategies have focused on reducing nutrient excretions. These strategies have been very successful. However, strategies beyond just reducing nutrient excesses will be needed to meet future challenges that are not nutrient-related. Challenges such as pathogens, antimicrobials, and endocrine-disrupting compounds have received considerable attention recently. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the findings from nutrition research with respect to reducing environmental impact and to identify areas that merit attention in the near future, recognizing that many of the emerging environmental issues are not nutrient-related.",About Sufficiency
A review on nanomaterial-based SERS substrates for sustainable agriculture,"The agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in driving the economy of many developing countries. Any dent in this economical structure may have a severe impact on a country's population. With rising climate change and increasing pollution, the agricultural sector is experiencing significant damage. Over time this cumulative damage will affect the integrity of food crops and create food security issues around the world. Therefore, an early warning system is needed to detect possible stress on food crops. Here we present a review of the recent developments in nanomaterial-based Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) substrates which could be utilized to monitor agricultural crop responses to natural and anthropogenic stress. Initially, our review delves into diverse and cost-effective strategies for fabricating SERS substrates, emphasizing their intelligent utilization across various agricultural scenarios. In the second phase of our review, we spotlight the specific application of SERS in addressing critical food security issues. By detecting nutrients, hormones, and effector molecules in plants, SERS provides valuable insights into plant health. Furthermore, our exploration extends to the detection of contaminants, chemicals, and foodborne pathogens within plants, showcasing the versatility of SERS in ensuring food safety. The cumulative knowledge derived from these discussions illustrates the transformative potential of SERS in bolstering the agricultural economy. By enhancing precision in nutrient management, monitoring plant health, and enabling rapid detection of harmful substances, SERS emerges as a pivotal tool in promoting sustainable and secure agricultural practices. Its integration into agricultural processes not only augments productivity but also establishes a robust defence against potential threats to crop yield and food quality. As SERS continues to evolve, its role in shaping the future of agriculture becomes increasingly pronounced, promising a paradigm shift in how we approach and address challenges in food production and safety.",About Sufficiency
A ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT OF DANUBE DELTA - A 3D INITIATIVE,"3D - Danube Delta Decarbonising is an essential concept that promotes the maintenance of swamps and wetlands of the Danube and the adaptation of their socio-economic system to climate change. The relationship between climate change, atmospheric structure and greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other critical factors for the global environment, such as alteration of the water cycle, changes in biogeochemical cycles, erosion of soils and coastal areas, reduction of sea salinity, loss biodiversity, is a complex of specificities for the Danube Delta, given the duration of processes, diversity, and causality, both endogenous and exogenous system, and requires analysis of different variants and intensities of manifestation as an objective need for the functioning of the hydro-geo- morphological (HGM) and socio-ecological (SSE) of the Danube Delta. Wetlands such as the Danube Delta are a major source of methane (CH4) and contribute between 30 and 40% to total CH4 emissions. CH4 emissions from wetlands depend on temperature, groundwater depth, and the quantity and quality of organic matter. Global warming will affect these three factors of methanogenesis, raising questions about the feedback between natural methane production and climate change. Forecasts show that by the end of this century, natural methane (CH4) emissions from wetlands are expected to increase by up to 80% by the turn of the century if no concrete measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and especially those generated by the anthropogenic factor, a better understanding of the situation is needed for future rebalancing. The scientific community agrees that an economic system based on fossil fuels, intensive agriculture, and the unsustainable exploitation of global natural resources have irreversible effects on the environment. The effects of the current economic system have detrimental effects on the Danube Delta, such as climate change, air and ocean pollution, and ecological decline, causing material and human damage to the local population. Thus, there is a real risk of catastrophic damage to our economies and societies over the next few decades, if the prevailing forms of production and consumption are not radically changed.",About Sufficiency

Irrigation pump capacity and pumping rate calculated from daily water demand, and carbon emissions savings determined from the differences between emissions generated by fossil diesel and bioenergy powered irrigation have been used for calculating environmental benefits. The sales of excess rice provided estimates for financial gains. In the base year, generation of straws and husks of about 44117 and 6703 t and collectable portions of 40% and 65%, respectively, are estimated, providing a total bioenergy potential of 16.64 GWh. With onsite-generated bioenergy, irrigated land can increase from 2367 to 13362 ha while rice and bioenergy production increases from 34703 to 59970 t and 15.34-87.72 GWh, respectively, by the 10th cycle. Cumulative revenue of US $354.60 million from sales of excess rice and net carbon emissions saving of 285.33 kilotonnes can be achieved by using electricity generated for irrigation pumping. Investment costs in electricity generation can breakeven by 8th year if sold at US0.166/kWh. Therefore, on-site generated bioenergy targeting irrigation pumping for off-season rice production is an enabler for promoting positive and sustainable fuel/food nexus in rice farming communities through intensive farming.",About Sufficiency

A Systematic Review of Empirical Research on Payment of Ecosystem Services and Farm Household Income in China,"The payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme shows great poverty alleviation potential and recognizing this connection contributes to enhancing the development of residents in ecologically endowed areas. However, the literature has not clarified the extent of the promotion and moderating factors of PES on income yet. This study pursues the goal of identifying the effect of PES on household income in rural China from the income structure perspective. Methodologically, this research conducts a literature review of 28 papers to outline the effect of PES on agricultural production, off-farm, and total income, and it applies a meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis of 13 papers to identify the influencing degree and interference factors. The findings reveal four issues. Overall, the effect of PES on agricultural production income was negative, while the effect on off-farm and total income was positive. Second, the PES schemes boosted farm household income by 0.15 weighted average effect size. Third, farm household participation area, subsidized unit prices, and urbanization level played positive moderating effects, while farm household age was a negative moderating variable. Lastly, PES risk exacerbated income inequality among farm households. The study also integrates the PES and the SDGs, proposing that advancing climate action involves the assistance of sustainable communities, decent work, and protection from conflict with social equity. Finally, the paper provides recommendations in terms of government-led PES projects that should be inclusive of economic, social, and ecological objectives, provide job security for smallholders, and quality urbanization.",About Sufficiency
"A Unique Combination of Aerodynamic and Surface Properties Contribute to Surface Cooling in Restored Wetlands of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California","Land use change and management affect climate by altering both the biogeochemical and biophysical interactions between the land and atmosphere. Whereas climate policy often emphasizes the biogeochemical impact of land use change, biophysical impacts, including changes in reflectance, energy partitioning among sensible and latent heat exchange, and surface roughness, can attenuate or enhance biogeochemical effects at local to regional scales. This study analyzes 3 years (2015-2017) of turbulent flux and meteorological data across three contrasting wetland restoration sites and one agricultural site, colocated in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, USA, to understand if the biophysical impacts of freshwater wetland restoration can be expected to attenuate or enhance the potential biogeochemical benefits. We show that despite absorbing more net radiation, restored wetlands have the potential to cool daytime surface temperature by up to 5.1 degrees C, as compared to a dominant drained agricultural land use. Wetland canopy structure largely determines the magnitude of surface temperature cooling, with wetlands that contain areas of open water leading to enhanced nighttime latent heat flux and reduced diurnal temperate range. Daytime surface cooling could be important in ameliorating physiological stress associated with hotter and drier conditions and could also promote boundary layer feedbacks at the local to regional scale. With a renewed focus on the mitigation and adaptation potential of natural and working lands, we must better understand the role of biophysical changes, especially in novel land use transitions like wetland restoration. Plain Language Summary: Land use change and management affect climate by altering both the cycling of greenhouse gases and how energy and water are exchanged between the ecosystem and the atmosphere. These energy and water impacts can have local to regional implications on surface and air temperature. This study analyzes 3 years (2015-2017) of measured water and energy exchange at three contrasting wetland restoration sites and one agricultural site, all located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, USA. Restoring drained agricultural fields to flooded wetlands causes a rougher canopy, with more exposed water, and alters the energy partitioning. This results in growing season and daytime surface cooling, which could enhance the other benefits of wetland restoration, like soil buildup, habitat creation, and carbon sequestration. Land use policies should consider both the greenhouse gas and the energy and water implications of the promoted land use change to fully account for the climatic impact.",About Sufficiency
Modeling Land-Use Decision Behavior with Bayesian Belief Networks,"The ability to incorporate and manage the different drivers of land-use change in a modeling process is one of the key challenges because they are complex and are both quantitative and qualitative in nature. This paper uses Bayesian belief networks (BBN) to incorporate characteristics of land managers in the modeling process and to enhance our understanding of land-use change based on the limited and disparate sources of information. One of the two models based on spatial data represented land managers in the form of a quantitative variable, the area of individual holdings, whereas the other model included qualitative data from a survey of land managers. Random samples from the spatial data provided evidence of the relationship between the different variables, which I used to develop the BBN structure. The model was tested for four different posterior probability distributions, and results showed that the trained and learned models are better at predicting land use than the uniform and random models. The inference from the model demonstrated the constraints that biophysical characteristics impose on land managers; for older land managers without heirs, there is a higher probability of the land use being arable agriculture. The results show the benefits of incorporating a more complex notion of land managers in land-use models, and of using different empirical data sources in the modeling process. Future research should focus on incorporating more complex social processes into the modeling structure, as well as incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics in a BBN.",About Sufficiency
Pest management strategies in traditional agriculture: An African perspective,"African agriculture Is largely traditional-characterized Dy a large number of smallholdings of no more than one ha per household. Crop production takes place under extremely variable agro-ecological conditions, with annual rainfall ranging from 250 to 750 mm in the Sahel in the northwest and in the semi-arid east and south, to 1500 to 4000 mm in the forest zones in the central west. Farmers often select well-adapted, stable crop varieties, and cropping systems are such that two or more crops are grown in the same field at the same time. These diverse traditional systems enhance natural enemy abundance and generally keep pest numbers at low levels. Pest management practice in traditional agriculture is a built-in process in the overall crop production system rather than a separate well-defined activity. Increased population pressure and the resulting demand for increased crop production in Africa have necessitated agricultural expansion with the concomitant decline in the overall biodiversity. Increases in plant material movement in turn facilitated the accidental introduction of foreign pests. At present about two dozen arthropod pests, both introduced and native, are recognized as one of the major constraints to agricultural production and productivity in Africa. Although yield losses of 0% to 100% have been observed on-station, the economic significance of the majority of pests under farmers' production conditions is not adequately understood. Economic and social constraints have kept pesticide use in Africa the lowest among all the world regions. The bulk of pesticides are applied mostly against pests of commercial crops such as cotton, vegetables, coffee, and cocoa, and to some extent for combating outbreaks of migratory pests such as the locusts. The majority of African farmers still rely on indigenous pest management approaches to manage pest problems, although many government extension programs encourage the use of pesticides. The current pest management research activities carried out by national or international agricultural research programs in Africa focus on classical biological control and host plant resistance breeding. With the exception of classical biological control of the cassava mealybug, research results have not been widely adopted. This could be due to African farmersfacing heterogeneous conditions, not needing fixed prescriptions or one ideal variety but a number of options and genotypes to choose from. Indigenous pest management knowledge is site-specific and should be the basis for developing integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. Farmers often lack the biological and ecological information necessary to develop better pest management through experimentation. Formal research should be instrumental in providing the input necessary to facilitate participatory technology development such as that done by Farmer Field Schools, an approach now emerging in different parts of Africa.",About Sufficiency

"Aboveground carbon stock, allocation and sequestration potential during vegetation recovery in the karst region of southwestern China: A case study at a watershed scale","Karst landscape in southwestern China is one of the most typical landscapes developed on carbonate bedrock and has the largest area in the world. Carbon sequestration potentials during secondary karst vegetation recovery remain uncertain. Based on the vegetation map and 87 sampling plots at five stages of natural vegetation succession, this study estimated aboveground (AG) vegetation carbon stocks and dynamics at a watershed scale. AG carbon density of grasslands, shrublands, shrub forests, secondary forests and primary forests was 1.70,4.15, 22.3, 703, 142.2 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The ten most important species stored 71.6-96.1% of total AG carbon stock, indicating that carbon pool in karst vegetation was determined by a few dominant species. Main contributors to AG carbon stock shifted from individuals in small diameter classes in shrublands to individuals in large diameter classes in primary forests, indicating that carbon increases in the early vegetation succession resulted from high recruitment of woody plants, while carbon accumulations in the later forests were mainly due to tree growth. The long time required for secondary forests to recover carbon density to the level of primary forests could be explained by the slow speed of large evergreen trees reaching a high level of dominance during secondary succession on the harsh habitats. The total AG carbon stock of the studied watershed (7.50 x 10(3) ha) was 85.9 x 10(3) Mg, of which paddy fields, dry lands, grasslands, shrublands, shrub forests and secondary forests accounted for 22.6%, 3.49%, 0.34%, 5.97%,12.3% and 55.3%, respectively. The AG carbon stock in this watershed would increase by 92.5% in 50-100 years and by 4.40 times in 140-200 years if the degraded vegetation types could continue to develop into mature forests. Although carbon density of karst forests was significantly lower than that of the forests on non-karst habitats in the same latitudinal zone, the degraded karst vegetation showed a great carbon sequestration potential due to the large distribution area in southwestern China.

Addressing Soil Fertility Challenges in Arid Agriculture: A Two-Year Evaluation of Combined Soil Organic Amendments Under Saline Irrigation,"Background: Soil salinity poses a significant threat to agricultural lands by adversely affecting soil properties, crop productivity, and, consequently, global food security. This study evaluated the effects of date palm waste compost (C), applied alone or combined with biochar (BCC) or Ramial chipped wood (RCWC), on soil properties and barley yield under arid and saline conditions. Methods: A field experiment was performed in a completely random design with three replications. In addition to the unamended soil (control), treatments with compost (C), biochar + compost (BCC) and Ramial chipped wood + compost (RCWC) were tested. We monitored soil physico-chemical parameters, straw biomass, grain yield, and soluble sugar levels over two crop seasons. Results: All treatments enhanced soil fertility. However, the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and the cation ratio of soil structural stability (CROSS) increased in soils amended with compost alone in the second crop year. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivated in soil amended with C and BCC produced 28% and 37% more dry biomass, respectively, in the second year, while no significant effects were observed in the first year. This may be attributed to the higher availability of nutrient content (N and P) in soils during the second year. In the first year, plants amended with BCC exhibited the highest accumulation of sucrose and fructose, with increases of up to 39% and 66%, respectively. Conclusions: Compost application did not affect barley yield during the first crop year, highlighting limited effects on soil fertility. However, C and BCC improved barley yield in the second year after application. No synergistic effect was observed between biochar, Ramial chipped wood, and compost. Future Perspective: Further studies should focus on the long-term effects of organic soil management, including salinity issues, to support sustainable agriculture in arid regions.",About Sufficiency
Addressing water scarcity to support climate resilience and human health,"Water scarcity is projected to affect half of the world's population, gradually exacerbated by climate change. This article elaborates from a panel discussion at the 2023 United Nations Water Conference on ""Addressing Water Scarcity to Achieve Climate Resilience and Human Health."" Understanding and addressing water scarcity goes beyond hydrological water balances to also include societal and economic measures. We consider five categories of health impacts resulting from deteriorating water qualities and quantities: (1) water-related diseases and water for hygiene, (2) malnutrition and water for food, (3) livelihoods, income, development, and water for energy, (4) adverse air quality from drought-induced dust and wildfire smoke, and (5) mental health effects from water scarcity-related factors. A discussion on the barriers and opportunities for resilient water systems begins by reframing water scarcity as a ""pathway to water bankruptcy"" and introducing Water Partnerships to empower local water leaders with the awareness, education, and resources to devise and implement locally appropriate water management strategies. Other barriers include the (1) lack of tools to consider the socioeconomic implications of water scarcity, (2) lack of water information being in actionable formats for decision-makers, (3) lack of clarity in the application of water scarcity modeling to gain policy-relevant findings, and (4) inadequate drought adaptation planning. The article includes recommendations for local governments, national governments, international actors, researchers, nongovernmental organizations, and local constituents in addressing these barriers. The predominant theme in these recommendations is collaborative, multidisciplinary Water Partnerships, knowledge-sharing in accessible formats, and empowering participation by all.

"Dryland Organic Farming Partially Offsets Negative Effects of Highly Simplified Agricultural Landscapes on Forbs, Bees, and Bee-Flower Networks","Industrialized farming practices result in simplified agricultural landscapes, reduced biodiversity, and degraded species-interaction networks. Thus far, most research assessing the combined effects of farming systems and landscape complexity on beneficial insects has been conducted in relatively diversified and mesic systems and may not represent the large-scale, monoculture-based dryland agriculture that dominates many regions worldwide. Specifically, the effects of farming systems on forbs, bees, and their interactions are poorly understood in highly simplified dryland landscapes such as those in the Northern Great Plains, United States, an area globally important for conventional and organic small grain, pulse, forage, and oilseed production. During a 3-yr (2013-2015) study, we assessed 1) the effects of dryland no-till conventional and tilled organic farming on forbs, bees, and bee- flower networks and 2) the relationship between natural habitat and bee abundance. Flower density and richness were greater in tilled organic fields than in no-till conventional fields, and forb community composition differed between farming systems. We observed high bee diversity (109 taxa) in this highly simplified landscape, and bee abundance, richness, and community composition were similar between systems. Compared with tilled organic fields, bee-flower interactions in no-till conventional fields were poorly connected, suggesting these systems maintain relatively impoverished plant-pollinator networks. Natural habitat (11% of the landscape) did not affect small-bodied bee abundance in either farming system but positively affected large-bodied bees within 2,000 m of crop-field centers. In highly simplified agricultural landscapes, dryland organic farming and no-till conventional farming together support relatively high bee diversity, presumably because dryland organic farming enhances floral resources and bee-flower networks, and no-till management in conventional farming provides undisturbed ground-nesting habitats for wild bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea).",About Sufficiency
Adjusting Norwegian Agricultural Policy to the WTO through Multifunctionality: Utilizing the Environmental Potential?,"This article deals broadly with the receptiveness of domestic institutions to international regimes, applying an organizational theoretical approach. More specifically, the aim is to explore how international obligations emanating from multilateral agreements on environment and trade affect Norwegian agricultural policy. Multifunctionality has been portrayed as an adept way of adjusting agricultural policy to the World Trade Organization by tapping into the environmental potential. However, closer scrutiny disclosed that this potential for environmental improvements has hardly been utilized. Partly accounting for this situation is the relatively weak role of the Ministry of the Environment in policy-making compared to the highly institutionalized domestic interest groups associated with agriculture. The organizational field of agriculture has remained very strong, and hardly subject to normative persuasion from relatively weak international environmental regimes. Moreover, while Norwegian environmental non-governmental organizations do have the potential to affect policies, there is very little evidence of pressure for utilizing the environmental potential of multifunctionality. This study points out the strong alliance between rural and environmental grassroots organizations in Norway, with more harmonious relations than those at the ministerial level.",About Sufficiency
Adopting sustainable farm management practices within a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone in Scotland: The view from the farm,"Aquatic pollution associated with agriculture is a problem that has been receiving increasing attention in the European Union (EU). The EU's Nitrates Directive (91/676EC) and its associated Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) legislation were extended in Scotland in 2003, requiring more farmers to adopt more sustainable land management practices. This paper presents results from a qualitative socio-economic study of the motivations and management practices of 30 farmers located within the Strathmore and Fife NVZ. It was found that these farmers rarely consider environmental issues beyond the boundaries of their farms unless the productive capacity and economic viability of their farms are affected. Despite contrary evidence, the farmers did not believe that they were responsible for any water quality problems, nor is the intrinsic linkage between catchment and coastal zone management established in their minds. They were suspicious of agri-environmental funding opportunities, and tend to regard the bureaucracy involved in applying for funding as more of a problem than it is worth. Experience of environmental regulations has left many with concerns about rules changing in unfavourable ways. Many of the farmers are dependent on Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidy support, and the proposed de-coupling of direct payments from production is regarded with suspicion. Current NVZ regulations will impact most on milk and intensive livestock producers but our results indicate that even if the legislation is followed exactly, the desired environmental benefits are unlikely to be realised because most farmers claim already to be managing nutrients within allowable limits.

Adoption and the Role of Fertilizer Trees and Shrubs as a Climate Smart Agriculture Practice: The Case of Salima District in Malawi,"Fertilizer trees and shrubs can improve degraded soil and avert the impacts of climate change on smallholder farmers in Malawi. This paper analyses the roles of fertilizer trees and shrubs and factors that determine adoption, as well as the intensity of use of fertilizer on trees and shrubs in maize-based farming systems using the Tobit model. A household survey involving 250 smallholder farmers was conducted in Salima district, Malawi. The analysis shows that adopters of fertilizer trees and shrubs considered fertility improvement, shade, source of food and erosion control as main roles of fertilizer trees and shrubs. The Tobit model shows that households with relatively more land are more likely to adopt fertilizer trees and shrubs than those with small land sizes. Adoption is higher among farmers who had been exposed to fertilizer trees and shrubs for longer periods than others had. Land tenure, education and availability of labor also influence the adoption of fertilizer trees and shrubs. Results further show that household and farm characteristics and availability of extension services explain the current adoption rates of tree-fertilizer technologies. Our findings can guide effective targeting of farmers to ensure higher adoption and sustainability of fertilizer-tree and shrub technology for climate-smart agriculture among the smallholder farmers.",About Sufficiency

Agent-based modeling of bioenergy crop adoption and farmer decision-making,"We formulate an agent-based simulation model to analyze farmers' decision-making in bioenergy crops adoption and predict related farmers' group behavior. Agents include farmers and biofuel producers, and each is represented with their own decision-making mechanism. We quantitatively model the decision making of farmers in Iowa, USA as an optimization model based on values derived from published literature and social survey data; results were further validated with social survey data. Economic and environmental impacts of growing conventional row crops versus dedicated energy crops are considered and evaluated under a series of operational constraints including neighborhood influence. We apply the model to forecast biomass supply in the next three decades and reveal that Iowa has the potential to produce 2.27 billion gallons (8.59 billion liters) of cellulosic biofuel by 2022, which constitutes 14.2% of RFS2 cellulosic ethanol mandate. We also find improved publicity to be more efficient in promoting biomass production than raising the contract price.

Agricultural commodities and climate change,"The agricultural commodity market is sensitive to variations in weather and climate, which can disrupt supply and cause price fluctuations. Some of the key positive and negative impacts of climate change on agricultural commodities, using the examples of wheat and barley, are identified; of particular significance are temperature changes, water availability, and CO2 fertilization. Although they are not exempt from the negative impacts of climate change, higher latitude regions of production, including Canada and Russia, will benefit the most from climate change. The impacts on other important production regions, such as parts of Europe, the US, and Argentina, will be more mixed. Market stability in all regions will also be affected by changes in climate and weather extremes. To increase resilience to the effects of weather events and climate change on the agricultural commodity market, countries should diversify their sources of supply, encourage more countries to grow and export the relevant commodities, and support crop research and climate adaptation.

This study aimed to identify these optimum agricultural managements in response to current and projected climatic scenarios for the Choctawhatchee Basin in Southeastern USA, an experimentally unexplored data-scarce region lacking validation data. This scenario-based modeling study analyzed a total of 1344 scenarios consisting of four major crops, eight managements (varying tillage, manuring, and residue), and forty climatic combinations under current as wells as two representative concentration pathways with process-based Denitrification and Decomposition (DNDC) model. The results indicated that the region's GHGs and yields were most affected by higher temperatures (>=+3 degrees C) and extreme precipitation changes (>=+/- 40%), while high atmospheric CO2 concentrations exerted positive fertilization effects. The manure-related and higher residue incorporation scenarios were found to be better options in varying climates with minimal present global warming potentials (GWP) of 0.23 k to -29.1 k MT equivalent CO2.

Agricultural Information's Impact on the Adaptive Capacity of Ghana's Smallholder Cocoa Farmers,"Ghanaian smallholders grow one quarter of the world's cocoa, but climate change, individual extreme weather events, such as droughts, as well as deforestation increasingly threaten cocoa production. Pertinent information could bolster adaptive capacity. However, in Ghana's cocoa sector, relevant agricultural information is not available to all farmers, which can exacerbate power asymmetries. This paper focuses on how (i) agricultural and drought-adaptive information and (ii) socio-economic characteristics shape a cocoa farmer's adaptive capacity. We conducted our study in the aftermath of 2015-16's prolonged El Nino-induced drought that negatively impacted the livelihoods of cocoa smallholders across Ghana. In 48 semi-structured interviews and 12 focus groups, we asked smallholders how they responded to the drought to decipher how adaptive capacity compares between farmers receiving four different sources of agricultural information, and of diverse socio-economic status. Overall, agricultural information improved cocoa farmers' adaptive capacity compared to those who received no formal agricultural information. Smallholders detailed adaptive techniques that would be accessible to, and thus replicable by, other poorly-resourced cocoa farmers. Shade tree management and income diversification were identified as pertinent adaptive actions. However, we identified a divergence between exposure to agricultural information and its transformation into substantive adaptive action. Additionally, informal information sharing between smallholders represents an underutilized resource by extension programmes. We found that adaptive capacity is also determined by socio-economic characteristics: particularly gender, and to a lesser extent formal education level, proximity to asphalt roads, and land tenure. Finally, we present evidence that framing adaptive techniques in relatable terms that resonate with farmers' immediate livelihood concerns could narrow the adaptation deficit prevalent in Ghana's cocoa sector.",About Sufficiency
Agricultural intensification and childhood cancer in Brazil,"Over the last several decades, Brazil has become both the world's leading soy producer and the world's leading consumer of hazardous pesticides.

Agricultural subsidies in a political economy: Can collective action make smallholder agriculture contribute to development?,"Malawi's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, of which a majority are smallholder farmers. With smallholder farmers constituting more than 80% of the population, the government's policies have mainly focused on achieving redistribution goals of the society, minding less about the inefficiencies in smallholder farming. The current study assessed and compared the efficiency levels of large scale and small-scale farmers amidst huge government expenditures in agricultural subsidies on smallholder farmers. Through a SWOT analysis and literature review approach that dwelt much on the qualitative case study approach, the study found that it is only through attaining economies of scale that small farms can attain the efficiency levels of large-scale farms. Following this finding that large farmers are more efficient; the study proposes models that would mimic the behaviour of large farmers. In this study, we evaluated the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of various models proposed to improve efficiency of small farms. Three models were evaluated namely, contract farming, cooperative development and land consolidation models. These models were selected for review because the theory of collective action ensures that they mimic the farm behaviour of a large farmer.

Agriculture green development in China: insights and advances,"Reconciling the tasks of producing adequate amounts of nutritious food for the increasing global population while preserving the environment and natural ecosystems simultaneously is an enormous challenge. The concept of agriculture green development (AGD) and the necessary governmental policies were developed to address the aforementioned challenge in China and to help achieve the related global sustainable development goals. Agriculture green development emphasizes the synergy between green and development; current agriculture has to transform from the intensive farming with high inputs, high environmental impacts and low resource -use efficiency to a more sustainable agriculture, in order to ensure an adequate supply of nutritious food while delivering environmental integrity, improved economic profitability, and social equity.

Agroecological innovation constructing socionatural order for social transformation: two case studies in Brazil,"The Green Revolution exemplifies the capital-intensive modernization model of resource plunder and labor exploitation. This has provoked small-scale producers and civil society groups to counterpose an agroecology-based solidarity economy (EcoSol-agroecology), especially in Latin America. But their efforts encounter dominant models - of innovation, management, markets, nature, etc. - which limit alternatives. To clarify a transformative agenda, advocates have elaborated agroecological innovation through several complementary practices. Nature is framed as agri-biodiversity complementing socio-cultural diversity. Short food-supply chains (circuitos curtos) build consumer support for production methods enhancing producers' livelihoods, providing socio-economic equity and conserving natural resources. Through dialogos de saberes, i.e. knowledge exchange among farmers and with external experts, cultivation and water-management methods are designed or adapted as socio-environmental technologies. Capacities are built for collective self-management of those solidarity relationships. In such ways, agroecological innovation co-produces specific forms of nature, technoscientific knowledge and society; their practices construct a distinctive socionatural order. Such order arises through several instruments - making identities, institutions and discourses - as understood by STS co-production theory. Here this theory illuminates two Brazilian agroforestry initiatives whose cooperative practices seek to transform their own participants' lives and wider agri-food systems. By combining diverse sources, composite cultures deepen the social basis of territorial belonging.",About Sufficiency
Agronomic properties of biochars from different manure wastes,"Biochar research has focused in the last years in the use of wood or grass derived materials for carbon sequestration. However, manure derived biochar can provide other benefits after soil addition, including nutrient supply. At present, there is an incomplete understanding of pyrolysis on manures. In order to understand the benefits obtained after addition of these types of materials to the soil, an experiment involving the use of different manures and pyrolysis temperatures was performed. Five manure wastes were selected for this experiment: cattle manure (E); cattle manure mixed with straw (EP), chicken manure (G), chicken manure mixed with sawdust (GS) and pig slurry (PC). Unpyrolyzed samples were compared to biochars prepared at 300 and 500 degrees C. Relevant properties for agronomic purposes were determined, including pH, electrical conductivity, nutrient content, metal content, proximate analysis and carbon thermostability. Our results show that biochars tailored for different purposes can be prepared after a careful choice of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Field application of ACC-deaminase biotechnology for improving chickpea productivity in Bahawalpur,"The use of biofertilizer in crop production is gaining importance in modern agriculture, especially under stressful environments. In drought-hit areas of the world, improvement in drought tolerance of major food crops is one of the way forwards to ensure food security. Under water limited conditions, the use of ACC-deaminase biofertilizers can mitigate the adverse effects of drought stress on crop production. Present study was conducted for the field evaluation of ACC-deaminase based biofertilizer (Rhizobium and Pseudomonas strains) for improving chickpea productivity in Bahawalpur. Six field trials were conducted in different villages of Bahawalpur. Biofertilizer alone and in combination with enriched compost was evaluated under field conditions. Different treatments used in the experiment were control, P-Enriched compost, biofertilizer and P-Enriched compost + biofertilizer. The experiments were conducted in Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. Results showed that enriched compost and biofertilizer, individually and in combination significantly improved the number of nodules plant(-1), nodules fresh weight and nodules dry weight of chickpea. The combined application of P-enriched compost and biofertilizer resulted in maximum increase in number of nodules plant(-1) and nodules dry weight as compared to control. The integrated use also gave better results in improving plant height and shoot dry weight, yield, number of pods plant(-1), number of grains pod(-1), and 1000 grain weight as compared to separate use of biofertilizer and P-enriched compost. A significant increase in nitrogen and phosphorus contents of chickpea was also observed with combined application of biofertilizer and compost. It can be concluded that the integrated use of ACC-deaminase containing biofertilizer and P-enriched compost is an effective biotechnology to improve chickpea productivity under field conditions and should be recommended to the farmers in the region, where water shortage is the main hindrance to agricultural sustainability.",About Sufficiency
Valuation of Madhupur Sal Forest Ecosystem Services and Carbon Sequestration Potency in Bangladesh: an Avenue for Mitigating Climate Change Impact,"Forested areas provide various services, including crucial carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation. The Madhupur Sal Forest (MSF) in Bangladesh was studied extensively for its ecosystem services and carbon sequestration potential. Research conducted from February to August 2023 in Gaira and Dokhola villages assessed local community benefits and biodiversity. Interviews with 50 respondents and analysis of 20 plots were conducted to study carbon sequestration in the MSF. Twenty identified ecosystem services range from fuel and wood to cultural and economic advantages. Eight tree species, totaling 401 trees, were identified, with Ficus hispida being the most effective in annual carbon sequestration. Shorea robusta showed less efficacy in carbon sequestration, resulting in a total forest capture of 12 004 657.8 pounds per year. The study highlights the MSF's significant contribution to global climate change mitigation. Emphasis is placed on the need for enhanced carbon sequestration through forest management, reforestation, and afforestation projects in deforested areas. Despite diverse ecosystem services, the MSF faces threats, necessitating collaborative conservation efforts, sustainable management practices, and community involvement for its vitality.",About Sufficiency
Barriers to collaborative forest management and implications for building the resilience of forest-dependent communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana,"Community resilience, the capacity of a community to adapt to change in ways that result in positive impacts on its well-being, is increasingly used as a framework for understanding and enhancing the sustainability of forest-dependent communities as social ecological systems. However, studies linking community resilience to the implementation of forest management programs are limited. This study uses community resilience literature and analyzes data collected from interviews to study barriers of forest-dependent communities of collaborative forest management (CFM) in two forest-dependent communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Analysis revealed the barriers in community response to CFM programs in these two communities comprise institutional shortfalls in the design and implementation of the CFM program that have constrained the incentives, capacity and opportunities for communities to successfully adapt to the program. The paper offers recommendations on how the CFM program can contribute to building the resilience of communities in managing their forests. The first is to build institutional capacity of communities to play an active role in forest governance, and the second is the prioritization of well-being and livelihood enhancement as forest management goals.

Agriculture in the oasis of the Manga Grasslands of semi-arid north-east Nigeria - How sustainable is it?,"Peasant farmers in the Manga Grasslands of semi-arid north-east Nigeria depend largely on agriculture for their livelihood. However, recurrent drought since the early 1970s has disrupted the traditional farming systems of the region, and hence the agriculture-based rural economy of the Grasslands. There is evidence that farmers in the Grasslands are obliged to intensify crop production in areas with 'good' soils and 'adequate' water supply, that is, the oases. The rich organic soils and the shallow, semi-confined water table beneath the oases are precious natural resources for intensive agriculture. These do not come without a price, however, as the rich, organic soils have the potential to be contaminated by acid sulphate and salt. It is expected that future soil creation, particularly under dry climatic conditions, will lead to the formation of true acid sulphate soils, and consequently, the twin processes of soil acidification and salinization will present real management problems for sustainable agriculture. It is concluded however, that under the prevailing soil, hydrological and climatic conditions of the oasis, sustainable agricultural production remains elusive.",About Sufficiency

Artificial Neural Network Modeling to Predict Electrical Conductivity and Moisture Content of Milk During Non-Thermal Pasteurization: New Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Food Processing,"This study proposed applying artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the actual electrical conductivity (EC) of raw and pasteurized milk using moderate electric field (MEF) based on the electric field strength (EFS) and mass flow rate (MFR) along with modeling moisture content (MC) based on the EC. To this end, an artificial neural network (ANN) was implemented for conventionally (CP) and non-thermally (NP) pasteurized milk. The findings indicated no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the experimental and predicted data for EC and MC. The MFR and EFS affected the actual EC. The raw milk samples had an EC of 0.468812-0.46913 S/m and MC of 87.3218-87.35941%, while these values in NP pasteurized milk were 0.457441-0.638224 S/m and 87.33986-87.40851%. With correlation coefficients (R) of 0.736478106-0.951840323 and mean square errors (MSE) of 0.005539-0.0064, the ANN accurately predicted the raw and pasteurized milk MC based on the EC using the sixth-order polynomial model and the EC based on the EFS and MFR using a quadratic model. The EC of pasteurized milk by NP was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that of CP and raw milk by 15.44% and 11.30%, respectively. The results show that the EFS and MFR might be used for the online assessment of milk's physical attributes (e.g., EC), followed by using the assessed parameter to determine other properties (e.g., MC) by developing AI approaches based on optimized models. These observations showcase the innovative use of ANN-based AI to predict milk's EC and MC accurately. Integrating such AI platforms into non-thermal food processing could eventually develop more sustainable food production and enhance food security and quality through process innovation and sustainable manufacturing, contributing to the industrial revolution and sustainable development goals.",About Sufficiency
"Alternative agricultural policy scenarios, sector modelling and indicators: A sustainability assessment","In this article, we assess ecological, economic and social sustainability impacts of four alternative agricultural policy scenarios relevant to the European perspective. The analysed scenarios are: Prolonged Agenda 2000, On-going CAP reform, Integrated rural and environmental policy, and Liberalized Agricultural Trade. An economic agricultural sector model of Finnish agriculture is used in the evaluation of policy impacts up to 2020. Selected indicators representing the three dimensions of sustainability are calculated on the basis of the production variables of the model in each scenario. It is assumed that economic rationality, represented by the sector model, is a driving force directing agricultural production and land use, which, in turn, have a number of ecological, economic and social consequences. Our results show that a partial de-coupling of agricultural support from production and moderate reductions of commodity prices are likely to yield environmental benefits. In addition, there is a clear trade-off between environmental benefits and production volume and intensity. However, full de-coupling and radical price reductions are not likely to bring any additional environmental benefits but will result in a significant down-scaling and regional concentration of remaining agricultural activities. Hence the presented analysis is an interesting platform for discussion for stakeholders when implementing agricultural policy reforms.",About Sufficiency
"Altitudinal Influences on Soil Microbial Diversity and Community Assembly in Topsoil and Subsoil Layers: Insights from the Jinsha River Basin, Southwest China","Mountain regions play a crucial role in maintaining global biodiversity, with altitude exerting a significant influence on soil microbial diversity by altering plant diversity, soil nutrients, and microclimate. However, differences in microbial community composition between topsoil (0-10 cm deep) and subsoil (10-20 cm deep) remain poorly understood. Here, we aimed to assess soil microbial diversity, microbial network complexity, and microbial community assembly in the topsoil and subsoil layers of the dry-hot Jinsha River valley in southwestern China. Using high-throughput sequencing in soil samples collected along an altitudinal gradient, we found that bacterial diversity in topsoil decreased with increasing altitude, while bacterial diversity in subsoil showed no altitude-dependent changes. Fungal diversity in topsoil also varied with altitude, while subsoil fungal diversity showed no change. These findings suggest that microbial diversity in topsoil was more sensitive to changes in altitude than subsoil. Bacterial community assembly tended to be governed by stochastic processes, while fungal assembly was deterministic. Soil bacterial and fungal network complexity was enhanced with increasing altitude but reduced as diversity increased. Interestingly, the presence of woody plant species negatively affected bacterial and fungal community composition in both soil layers. Soil pH and water content also negatively affected microbial community composition, while organic carbon and total nitrogen positively influenced the microbial community composition. Simultaneously, herb and woody plant diversity mainly affected soil bacterial diversity in the topsoil and subsoil, respectively, while woody plant diversity mainly affected soil fungal diversity in subsoil and soil nutrients had more effect on soil fungal diversity. These findings suggest that altitude directly and indirectly affects microbial diversity in topsoil, subsequently influencing microbial diversity in subsoil through nutrient availability.",About Sufficiency
Towards a global-scale soil climate mitigation strategy,"Sustainable soil carbon sequestration practices need to be rapidly scaled up and implemented to contribute to climate change mitigation. We highlight that the major potential for carbon sequestration is in cropland soils, especially those with large yield gaps and/or large historic soil organic carbon losses. The implementation of soil carbon sequestration measures requires a diverse set of options, each adapted to local soil conditions and management opportunities, and accounting for site-specific trade-offs. We propose the establishment of a soil information system containing localised information on soil group, degradation status, crop yield gap, and the associated carbon-sequestration potentials, as well as the provision of incentives and policies to translate management options into region- and soil-specific practices. Reducing soil degradation and improving soil management could make an important contribute to climate change mitigation. Here the authors discuss opportunities and challenges towards implementing a global climate mitigation strategy focused on carbon sequestration in agricultural soils, and propose a framework for guiding region- and soil-specific management options.",About Sufficiency
Management of supply chains with attribute-sensitive products: a comprehensive literature review and future research agenda,"Purpose Mismanagement of supply chain operations may lead to waste of products and incur substantial monetary losses. This is particularly true for products with attributes that hasten deterioration, e.g. time, temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. Attribute-sensitive products must be carefully monitored throughout all supply chain processes to ensure acceptable quality to the end customers. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on attribute sensitive products and on attribute sensitive supply chains. The collected studies were reviewed using the content analysis method, focusing on the following aspects of attribute sensitive products: (1) industries; (2) product categories; (3) decisions involved; (4) processes; (5) current issues; (6) sustainability concerns; (7) research methods used; (8) objectives of decision makers; (9) solution approaches used; (10) incentives driving management and (11) future research issues. Based on the analysis of findings, gaps are identified, and future research directions are proposed. Design/methodology/approach Literature review and content analysis. Findings The authors discovered that, while the importance of product attributes vary from one industry to the other, overall the time attribute was critical in all of the industries considered in this literature review. Coordination, customer satisfaction, reliability and safety were key issues in attribute sensitive product supply chains (asp-SCs). Similar to the typical supply chains, asp-SCs face economic, social and environmental sustainability issues. However, the majority of the studies in our analysis emphasized importance of the social sustainability. The majority of the papers were reviewed and analyzed and adopted the modeling approach as a research method. Furthermore, it was found that asp-SCs were mostly driven with customer demands and social pressure. Research limitations/implications Based on the literature review and content analysis, there are a number of directions for the work conducted in this study to be extended in several directions. First, the literature search could be expanded by relaxing some of the restrictions (e.g. include the conference papers and articles from on-line business journals). Second, additional scientific publishers can be considered (e.g. Emerald Insight-; Inderscience-). The latter two extensions would allow a more precise assessment of published to date work on asp-SC operations. Third, our findings could be validated based on interviews with professionals and executives from companies dealing with asp-SCs. Such validation will allow identification of the differences between the state of the art and the state of practice. Practical implications Supply chains that handle attribute sensitive products (asps) must consider the complexity of products that significantly change their properties due to factors such as time, temperature, barometric pressure, humidity. Mismanagement of operations within such supply chains may lead to significant product waste, as well as substantial monetary losses. Originality/value This study presented a comprehensive literature review and content analysis of studies dealing with asps in the following industries: fashion, food, healthcare, humanitarian and pharmaceutical industries",About Sufficiency
An Advanced Model for Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction in the Agricultural Sector to Achieve Sustainability for Thailand's Future,"This research aimed to develop an advanced model for sustainably reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the future. The research employs a quantitative research approach, introducing a new model called the Structural Equation Modeling with Vector Autoregressive Latent Trajectory Model (SEM-VALTM). This model differs significantly from previous models as it identifies strategic pathways for effective national administration, ensuring high performance without spurious results, surpassing the efficiency of earlier models. The findings reveal that the environmental sector is directly affected by the economic sector, with the relationship exhibiting an inverse direction. Similarly, the environmental sector is influenced by the social sector, also in an opposing direction. The SEM-VALTM model contributes new knowledge, highlighting that the environmental sector demonstrates the slowest adjustment toward equilibrium (6%). Under a sustainability policy framework, it was found that the economic sector, particularly the industrial rate, has the highest influence on economic changes, which in turn have the most significant negative impact on the environment. The study further projects that from 2025 to 2037, greenhouse gas emissions will rise sharply, reaching 95.05 Mt CO2 Eq., exceeding the carrying capacity threshold of 60.5 Mt CO2 Eq. Based on risk management principles, continuous measures must be implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the government must establish a new scenario policy emphasizing renewable energy and clean technologies as substitutes. The findings suggest that future energy consumption will consistently decrease, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions of 50.04 Mt CO2 Eq.

An assessment of individual foodprints attributed to diets and food waste in the United States,"This paper assesses the environmental impacts of the average American's diet and food loss and waste (FLW) habits through an analysis of energy, water, land, and fertilizer requirements (inputs) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (outputs). We synthesized existing datasets to determine the ramifications of the typical American adult's food habits, as well as the environmental impact associated with shifting diets to meet the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) dietary guideline recommendations. In 2010, FLW accounted for 35% of energy use, 34% of blue water use, 34% of GHG emissions, 31% of land use, and 35% of fertilizer use related to an individual's food-related resource consumption, i.e. their foodprint. A shift in consumption towards a healthier diet, combined with meeting the USDA and Environmental Protection Agency's 2030 food loss and waste reduction goal could increase per capita food related energy use 12%, decrease blue water consumption 4%, decrease green water use 23%, decrease GHG emissions from food production 11%, decrease GHG emissions from landfills 20%, decrease land use 32%, and increase fertilizer use 12%.",About Sufficiency
An economic analysis of the potential for carbon sequestration by forests:: evidence from southern Mexico,"Forestry has been proposed as a means to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, by either reducing sources or enhancing sinks. This study assesses the potential of an incentive-based program to stimulate small farmers and communities to adopt biomass accumulating measures such as agroforestry or improved forest management. Current vegetation type, land use and stocks of carbon were assessed for an area of around 600 000 ha in southern Mexico, and the carbon (C) sequestration potential of a number of alternative techniques, based on farmers' preferences, was estimated. Cost and benefit flows in US $ per Megagram (= 10(6) g) of carbon (MgC) of each current and alternative system were developed. A model was designed to calculate the expected response to financial incentives of between US SO and $40 per MgC sequestered. The most cost-effective method for sequestering carbon appears to be the improved management of natural forest on communal lands. We estimated that 38 x 10(6) MgC could be sequestered for under US $15 MgC-1, of which 32 x 10(6) MgC through forest management. The choice of a baseline rate of biomass loss under a 'business-as-usual' scenario remains a critical issue for estimates of the cost-effectiveness of carbon sequestration by forestry.

An ecosystem approach to kelp aquaculture in the Americas and Europe,"Kelp farming is increasing along the temperate coastlines of the Americas and Europe. The economic, ecological, and social frameworks surrounding kelp farming in these new areas are in contrast with the conditions of progenitor kelp farming regions in China, Japan, and Korea. Thus, identifying and addressing the environmental and social impacts of kelp farming in these regions is vital to ensuring the industry's long-term sustainability. Here, a conceptual model of the human and natural systems supporting this nascent kelp aquaculture sector was developed using Maine, USA as a focal region. Potential negative impacts of kelp aquaculture were identified to be habitat degradation, overfishing of wild seeds, predation and competition with wild fish and genes, and transmission of diseases. Increased food security, improved restoration efforts, greater fisheries productivity, and alternative livelihoods development were determined to be potential positive impacts of kelp aquaculture. Changes in biodiversity and productivity resulting from either negative or positive impacts of kelp aquaculture were confirmed to have downstream effects on local fisheries and coastal communities. Recommendations to improve or protect the ecosystem services tangential to kelp farming include: define ecosystem and management boundaries, assess ecosystem services and environmental carrying capacity, pursue ecologically and socially considerate engineering, and protect the health and genetic diversity of wild kelp beds. Recommendations to ensure that kelp farming improves the well-being of all stakeholders include: increase horizontal expansion, expand and teach Best Management Practices, and develop climate change resiliency.

An organoclay formula for the slow release of soluble compounds,"Slow-release formulations have been developed to enhance the effective use of active ingredients. In the case of fertilizers the formulations reduce nutrient leaching and greenhouse gas emissions. While polymer-coating is the dominant technology in producing slow-release fertilizers there is a demand for alternative options for different usages. To this end, a commercially available organoclay, with a basal spacing of 3.67 nm, was used as matrix to produce pellets of CuSO4 and dicyandiamide (DCD) of different sizes by a die set and hand press. Both CuSO4 and DCD pellets showed a good slow-release performance in dissolution tests. Large pellets (1.2 cm in diameter) of CuSO4 had a better performance in slow-release than small ones (0.7 cm). For DCD pellets (0.7 cm in diameter) it took 6 days for a complete dissolution. The slow-release effect is probably due to the hydrophobic nature and high aspect ratio of the organoclay. The former makes soluble compounds between organoclay particles less susceptible to dissolution in water, whereas the latter hinders the dissolution of solutes inside a pellet by making their diffusion passage tortuous. The organoclay formulation is easy to make, and the rate of solute release can be adjusted by changing pellet size. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
An Overview of Mitigation and Adaptation Needs and Strategies for the Livestock Sector,"The livestock sector is vulnerable to climate change and related policy in two ways. First, livestock production and performance are directly impacted by climate with many projected effects being negative. Second, the sector may need to alter operations to limit the effects of climate change through adaptation and mitigation. Potential adaptation strategies involve land use decisions, animal feeding changes, genetic manipulation and alterations in species and/or breeds. In terms of mitigation, livestock is a substantial contributor to global non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. Mitigation opportunities involve altered land use for grazing and feed production, feeding practices, manure treatment and herd size reduction. In addition, strengthening institutions that promote markets and trade, as well as local support programs can help both mitigation and adaptation.

This overview extends the literature by including sector-level response as well as the relationships between adaptation and mitigation activities.",About Sufficiency
Analyzing past and future trends in Pakistan's groundwater irrigation development: implications for environmental sustainability and food security,"Since the last four decades, groundwater irrigation has played a critical role in improving crop production and rural livelihoods. However, the flawed policies have allowed farmers to install private tube wells relentlessly, resulting in a slew of water quality and environmental issues. This study aims to investigate the key trends in temporal development of groundwater irrigation and its consequences in Pakistan. The dataset, which spanned 38 years (1981 to 2018), included variables such as the number of tube wells, wheat area and production, farm size, total cultivated area, and total irrigated area in Punjab province. Our results show that, while the number of government-installed tube wells has decreased over time, the number of private tube wells has increased by 579% since 1981. About 85% of these privately owned tube wells are diesel tube wells, while the remaining 15% are electric tube wells. The ARDL regression results show that groundwater development, as a result of growth in private tube wells, has significantly aided wheat production in both the short and long run. However, the results of ARIMA model show that, in the absence of any regulatory mechanism to limit private tube well growth, the number of private tube wells in Punjab will increase by 43% over the next two decades, potentially jeopardizing the country's groundwater sustainability and food security. To ensure the sustainability of groundwater use, farmers' incomes, and the food security of the population, there is an urgent need to devise policy options to limit the growth of probate tube wells in the province.

The influence of conservation field margins in intensively managed grazing land on communities of five arthropod trophic groups,". 1.Arthropods, a major component of functional biodiversity within agro-ecosystems, contribute to sustainability through processes including nutrient cycling and pest control. Extensively managed field margins can help protect this functional biodiversity by providing habitat for beneficial species. 2.This 2year study investigated the relative benefits of grassland field margin treatments (Fenced only, Rotavated, and Reseeded (with a grass and wildflower mixture)) on the abundance and taxon richness of five arthropod trophic groups (detritivores, herbivores, predators, parasitoids and hyperparasitoids) from the orders Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Araneae. 3.The taxon richness and abundance of all trophic groups (with the exception of herbivore abundance) was greater in fenced field margin treatments than in the adjacent grazed field, particularly by the final sampling occasion. However, there were seasonal differences, with abundance and taxon richness generally greater in August than in June. Only detritivores and herbivores responded to the individual fenced field margin treatments. The botanically more species rich, rotavated and reseeded treatments, had greater detritivore and herbivore richness and abundance than the fenced only treatments. 4.Community structure analysis indicated that the grazed (within) field and fenced field margins had two distinct communities for all trophic groups, demonstrating the conservation value of the margins within intensively managed agricultural grasslands. 5.The current Irish agri-environment scheme requires fencing of field margins. Our results highlight how this relatively simple measure can benefit arthropod conservation and functional biodiversity.

Effects of leaf extracts of Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, three varieties of Cymbopogon citratus (Cymbopogon citratus-I, Cymbopogon citratus java and Cymbopogon citratus upper awash), Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa stenopetala, three varieties of Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosmarinus officinalis I, Rosmarinus officinalis II and Rosmarinus officinalis III) and Thyme schimperi, seed of three Coriandrum sativum varieties (Coriandrum sativum Batu, Coriandrum sativum Tulu and Coriandrum sativum Waltai) and root of Echinops kebericho on total gas production, digestibility and methane production of maize stover were investigated at different doses using the standard procedures. The results indicated that leaf extracts of Acacia nilotica had the highest (P < 0.001) total phenolic and total tannin contents. Compared to other evaluated plant species, all varieties of Cymbopogon citratus had the highest (P < 0.001) flavonoid content. Significantly high (P < 0.001) essential oil content was observed in Rosmarinus officinalis II than other varieties of Rosmarinus officinalis and other plant species. Significant reduction (P < 0.001) of methane production was observed with extracts of Cymbopoon citratus java (22.5 % less methane than the control) and thyme schimperi (16.7 % less methane than the control) at dose of 50 mg/kg DM. There was also significant (P < 0.001) interaction effect between plant species and dose rates at 50 mg/kg DM for both plant species. It can be concluded that the use of 50 mg/kg DM of Cymbopoon citratus java and Thyme schimperi extract to maize stover reduced methane production without negatively affecting feed digestibility. Further studies are necessary to examine the storability of the extracts in different time durations and evaluate their effects in vivo with animals.",About Sufficiency
Economic and environmental performance of dryland wheat-based farming systems in a 1.5°C world,"In 2015, the United Nations challenged the scientific community to evaluate development pathways consistent with the goal of limiting global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. This study reports analysis that was carried out as part of a project responding to that challenge. Using recently developed methods for regional integrated assessment of agricultural systems, this study evaluates the economic and environmental performance of dryland farming systems in the United States of America (U.S). Pacific Northwest, a major wheat (Triticum aestivum) production region, under greenhouse gas mitigation and policy scenarios consistent with the 1.5 degrees C goal. A novel feature of this study is to combine bio-physical and economic models with site-specific life cycle analysis to evaluate both the economic performance of current and possible alternative farming systems. The analysis shows that these farming systems could be adapted through changes in management to reduce soil emissions of greenhouse gases and incorporation of new biofuel crops, and could be affected by changes in prices and costs of production associated with greenhouse gas mitigation policies. These changes could result in a win-win outcome for those farms in the Pacific Northwest region where site-specific conditions are suited to these adaptations, providing both higher farm incomes and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. A key implication for mitigation and adaptation strategies is the need to coordinate climate policy design and development of technologies needed to achieve policy goals.",About Sufficiency
Application of Ecological Footprint Accounting as a Part of an Integrated Assessment of Environmental Carrying Capacity: A Case Study of the Footprint of Food of a Large City,"The increasing rate of urbanization along with its socio-environmental impact are major global challenges. Therefore, there is a need to assess the boundaries to growth for the future development of cities by the inclusion of the assessment of the environmental carrying capacity (ECC) into spatial management. The purpose is to assess the resource dependence of a given entity. ECC is usually assessed based on indicators such as the ecological footprint (EF) and biocapacity (BC). EF is a measure of the biologically productive areas demanded by human consumption and waste production. Such areas include the space needed for regenerating food and fibers as well as sequestering the generated pollution, particularly CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels. BC reflects the biological regeneration potential of a given area to regenerate resources as well to absorb waste. The city level EF assessment has been applied to urban zones across the world, however, there is a noticeable lack of urban EF assessments in Central Eastern Europe. Therefore, the current research is a first estimate of the EF and BC for the city of Wroclaw, Poland. This study estimates the Ecological Footprint of Food (EFF) through both a top-down assessment and a hybrid top-down/bottom-up assessment. Thus, this research verifies also if results from hybrid method could be comparable with top-down approach. The bottom-up component of the hybrid analysis calculated the carbon footprint of food using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. The top-down result of Wroclaw's EFF were 1% greater than the hybrid EFF result, 0.974 and 0.963 gha per person respectively. The result indicated that the EFF exceeded the BC of the city of Wroclaw 10-fold. Such assessment support efforts to increase resource efficiency and decrease the risk associated with resources-including food security. Therefore, there is a need to verify if a city is able to satisfy the resource needs of its inhabitants while maintaining the natural capital on which they depend intact.",About Sufficiency
Applying a GIS-based model to collect information on agricultural land-use change in Beijing,"Agricultural land use in suburban Beijing has changed dramatically in the last decade. This paper utilised unique, county-level spatial inventory datasets of land use in 1993 and 2004 to better quantify spatial configuration changes of main agricultural land-use types in the suburban counties of Beijing. A revised centroid model was applied to explicitly capture, analyse and visualise centroidal coordinates of land-use types in six typical suburban counties (samples) by geographic information system (GIS). Obvious displacements of corresponding centroids of agricultural land-use types in the samples demonstrates that configurations of agricultural land use have been destroyed in different parts of suburban Beijing. Furthermore, some typical patterns are explored according to the direction of displacement, which is driven mainly by urbanisation, topography, economic development and land-use policies. Land-use policies are shown to play more direct roles in spatial configuration changes of agricultural land use than other factors. It can be concluded that agricultural land-use configuration in suburban Beijing is affected by land resource balance among economic development, grain production and ecological protection.",About Sufficiency
"Approaching environmental sustainability of agriculture: environmental burden, eco-efficiency or eco-effectiveness","The main goal of the article is to compare three approaches to measuring environmental sustainability in agriculture: i) the environmental burden index; ii) the sustainable value of eco-efficient production; and iii) the sustainable value of the eco-effective farm, applied to the sample of 130 EUFADN (European Union Farm Accountancy Data Network) regions in 2015. The study indicates a fundamental problem: the notion of environmental sustainability in agriculture differs depending on the criterion we apply. We recognized a principle trade-off in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which consists of compensating for the strain on the natural environment with production or with public goods provision. Studies on these two effects seem to be crucial to draw a consistent development path for the CAP. Our major finding is that public goods-oriented farming is more likely to expand after improving eco-efficiency. This is still a challenge because in European regions, eco-efficient has not meant environmentally sustainable yet.",About Sufficiency
Intra-Annual Identification of Local Deforestation Hotspots in the Philippines Using Earth Observation Products,"Like many other tropical countries, the Philippines has suffered from decades of deforestation and forest degradation during and even after the logging era. Several open access Earth Observation (EO) products are increasingly being used for deforestation analysis in support of national and international initiatives and policymaking on forest conservation and management. Using a combination of annual forest loss and near-real time forest disturbance products, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the deforestation events in three forest frontiers of the Philippines. A space-time pattern mining approach was used to map quarterly deforestation hotspots at 1 km pixel size (100 hectares), where hotspots are classified according to the spatial and temporal variability of the 2000-2020 deforestation in the study area. Our results revealed that 79-81% of the hotspots overlap with primary forests and 27-29% are inside the state-declared protected areas. The intra-annual analysis of deforestation in 2020 revealed an alarming trend, where most deforestation occurred between the 1st and 2nd quarter (92-94% in hotspot forests; 87-89% in non-hotspot forests), highly overlapping within the slash-and-burn farming season. We also found ""new"" hotspots (2020) formed mostly from landslide scars and partly from selective logging, the latter is believed to be underestimated. Our study paves the way for rapid and regular assessment of the country's deforestation, useful for the respective environmental institutions who convene several times a year. Moreover, our findings assert the imperative of alternative livelihoods to upland farmers, efficient forest protection activities, and even the mitigation of landslide risks.",About Sufficiency
"Dynamics in landscape structure and composition for the Chorotega region, Costa Rica from 1960 to 2000","Studies of forest fragmentation in the tropics have systematically paid more attention to understanding processes contributing to the formation of landscapes that are the product of deforestation, while little or no attention has been paid to forested landscapes that are the product of secondary growth processes. In this paper, using information of forest cover from 1960 to 2000 derived from aerial photography and remote sensing data, we examine the dynamics associated with deforestation and secondary growth processes at the Chorotega region, Costa Rica. Our analysis is conducted using a comprehensive land capability map developed for the country. Our results indicate the occurrence of two well-defined land cover change processes over time. Extensive/intensive cattle ranching practices that contribute to significant forest degradation and forest cover loss characterize the first of these processes, occur-ring between 1960 and 1980. The second period (1980-2000) is characterized by a dynamic process of secondary forest growth resulting from a combination of internal and international market forces and conservation initiatives. Conclusions from this paper indicate that more attention needs to be paid to tropical secondary landscapes that are recuperating from years of constant degradation. This natural recovery process could be beneficial for biodiversity recovery, biological corridors and environmental services. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Food Web Responses to Artificial Mixing in a Small Boreal Lake,"In order to simulate food web responses of small boreal lakes to changes in thermal stratification due to global warming, a 4 year whole-lake manipulation experiment was performed. Within that time, period lake mixing was intensified artificially during two successive summers. Complementary data from a nearby lake of similar size and basic water chemistry were used as a reference. Phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a did not respond to the greater mixing depth but an increase was observed in the proportional abundance of diatoms, and the proportional abundance of cryptophytes also increased immediately after the onset of mixing. Obligate anoxic green sulphur bacteria vanished at the onset of mixing but gradually recovered after re-establishment of hypolimnetic anoxic conditions. No major effect on crustacean zooplankton was found, but their diversity increased in the metalimnion. During the mixing, the density of rotifers declined but protozoan density increased in the hypolimnion. Littoral benthic invertebrate density increased during the mixing due to Ephemeroptera, Asellus aquaticus and Chironomidae, whereas the density of Chaoborus larvae declined during mixing and lower densities were still recorded one year after the treatment. No structural changes in fish community were found although gillnet catches increased after the onset of the study. The early growth of perch (Perca fluviatilis) increased compared to the years before the mixing and in comparison to the reference lake, suggesting improved food availability in the experimental lake. Although several food web responses to the greater mixing depth were found, their persistence and ecological significance were strongly dependent on the extent of the disturbance. To better understand the impacts of wind stress on small lakes, long term whole-lake experiments are needed.",About Sufficiency
Mapping Crop Types of Germany by Combining Temporal Statistical Metrics of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series with LPIS Data,"Nationwide and consistent information on agricultural land use forms an important basis for sustainable land management maintaining food security, (agro)biodiversity, and soil fertility, especially as German agriculture has shown high vulnerability to climate change. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data of the Copernicus program offer time series with temporal, spatial, radiometric, and spectral characteristics that have great potential for mapping and monitoring agricultural crops. This paper presents an approach which synergistically uses these multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series for the classification of 17 crop classes at 10 m spatial resolution for Germany in the year 2018. Input data for the Random Forest (RF) classification are monthly statistics of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series. This approach reduces the amount of input data and pre-processing steps while retaining phenological information, which is crucial for crop type discrimination. For training and validation, Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) data were available covering 15 of the 16 German Federal States. An overall map accuracy of 75.5% was achieved, with class-specific F1-scores above 80% for winter wheat, maize, sugar beet, and rapeseed. By combining optical and SAR data, overall accuracies could be increased by 6% and 9%, respectively, compared to single sensor approaches. While no increase in overall accuracy could be achieved by stratifying the classification in natural landscape regions, the class-wise accuracies for all but the cereal classes could be improved, on average, by 7%. In comparison to census data, the crop areas could be approximated well with, on average, only 1% of deviation in class-specific acreages. Using this streamlined approach, similar accuracies for the most widespread crop types as well as for smaller permanent crop classes were reached as in other Germany-wide crop type studies, indicating its potential for repeated nationwide crop type mapping.",About Sufficiency
Pasture degradation in the central Amazon: linking changes in carbon and nutrient cycling with remote sensing,"The majority of deforested land in the Amazon Basin has become cattle pasture, making forest-to-pasture conversion an important contributor to the carbon (C) and climate dynamics of the region. However, our understanding of biogeochemical dynamics in pasturelands remains poor, especially when attempting to scale up predictions of C cycle changes. A wide range of pasture ages, soil types, management strategies, and climates make remote sensing the only realistic means to regionalize our understanding of pasture biogeochemistry and C cycling over such an enormous geographic area. However, the use of remote sensing has been impeded by a lack of effective links between variables that can be observed from satellites (e.g. live and senescent biomass) and variables that cannot be observed, but which may drive key changes in C storage and trace gas fluxes (e.g. soil nutrient status). We studied patterns in canopy biophysical-biochemical properties and soil biogeochemical processes along pasture age gradients on two important soil types in the central Amazon. Our goals were to (1) improve our understanding of the plot-scale biogeochemical dynamics of this land-use change, (2) evaluate the effects of pasture development on two contrasting soil types (clayey Oxisols and sandy Entisols), and (3) attempt to use remotely sensed variables to scale up the site-specific variability in biogeochemical conditions of pasturelands. The biogeochemical analyses showed that (1) aboveground and soil C stocks decreased with pasture age on both clayey and sandy soils, (2) declines in plant biomass were well correlated with declines in soil C and with available phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca), and (3) despite low initial values for total and available soil P, ecosystem P stocks declined further with pasture age, as did a number of other nutrients. Spectral mixture analysis of Landsat imagery provided estimates of photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) that were highly correlated with field measurements of these variables and plant biomass. In turn, the remotely sensed sum PV+NPV was well correlated with the changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen, and available P and Ca. These results suggest that remote sensing can be an excellent indicator of not only pasture area, but of pasture condition and C storage, thereby greatly improving regional estimates of the environmental consequences of such land-use change.",About Sufficiency

Assessing Forest Carbon Sequestration in China Under Multiple Climate Change Mitigation Scenarios,"Understanding how climate policies impact forest carbon sequestration is crucial for optimizing mitigation strategies. This study evaluated forest carbon sequestration in China from 2020 to 2060 under three climate scenarios: SSP1-2.6 (high mitigation), SSP3-7.0 (limited mitigation), and SSP5-8.5 (no mitigation). We integrated the land-use harmonization (LUH2) and patch-generating land-use simulation (PLUS) models to project forest cover change, and the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed land (LPJmL) model to simulate carbon dynamics. The results showed stronger mitigation efforts led to higher sequestration, with annual rates of 0.49, 0.48, and 0.20 Pg yr-1 across the scenarios. SSP1-2.6 achieved the highest carbon density (17.75 kg m-2) and sequestration (56.95 Pg), driven by the greatest increases in the carbon density of existing forests (+41.56%) and soil carbon (+39.94%). SSP3-7.0, despite the highest forest cover (34.74%), had a lower carbon density (17.19 kg m-2) and sequestration (56.84 Pg). SSP5-8.5 recorded the lowest forest cover (27.12%) and sequestration (45.62 Pg). Increasing carbon density, rather than expanding forest area, could be more effective for carbon sequestration in China. The carbon density and annual sequestration in existing forests were 2.36 and 2.89 times higher than in new forests. We recommend prioritizing SSP1-2.6 to maximize sequestration, focusing on protecting southwest forests and soil carbon.",About Sufficiency
Assessing groundwater quality and suitability in Qatar: Strategic insights for sustainable water management and environmental protection,"Groundwater resources in arid regions are crucial for water and food security and the maintenance of ecosystem services but face significant challenges from overexploitation and contamination, exacerbated by climate change. In Qatar, understanding the spatial variability of groundwater quality and its suitability for use remains limited. This study examines groundwater quality across the peninsula and evaluates its suitability for drinking and irrigation employing comprehensive Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques and water quality assessments. Twelve physicochemical parameters were analyzed to evaluate groundwater quality and determine the hydrogeochemical facies. Geospatial analysis was employed to visualize and quantify spatial correlations between groundwater salinity and geology, rainfall, distance to sea, land use, and abstraction and recharge activities. Suitability for use was assessed using the drinking water quality index (DWQI) and a novel integrated irrigation water quality index (IWQI), constructed upon seven standard indices. Results revealed predominantly high salinity in coastal and southern parts, suggesting extensive saltwater intrusion. Spatial correlations showed combined environmental and anthropogenic influences on groundwater salinity. Recharge efforts positively influenced groundwater quality, highlighting their effectiveness. The DWQI showed excellent to good drinking suitability over 1053.3 km2 (9.1%) of the study area. The IWQI indicated high to very high irrigation suitability over 3611 km2 (31.1%), concentrated in the north-central region. These findings highlight the critical importance of groundwater quality indicators for effective monitoring and underscore the need for integrated groundwater management strategies. This study offers practical guidance for local water resource managers, policymakers, and communities while also contributing to global climate adaptation strategies.",About Sufficiency
Assessing Livelihood Adaptation Indices and the Sustainability of Rice Farmers in Bangladesh's Northwestern Region,"Climate change alters the impact of the environment on economies, and sustainable adaptation which may improve food security is embedded in the actualization of the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2, 13, and 14. Hence, this study contributes to the debate by measuring how farmers in the Northwestern region of Bangladesh adapt to climate change. A cross-sectional multistage random sampling is used to collect 500 data points by the face-to-face interview method. For robustness, the study demonstrates climate change adaptations, adaptation indices, and the sustainability indicators in social, economic, and environmental concepts using the composite indicator method. Also, Rasch analysis and marginal contribution were used to explain the adaptation indices. Finally, a trivariate Tobit regression is used to examine sustainability analyses of climate change adaptation strategies and explain how the climate change adaptations affect different dimensions of sustainability. The results showed that dominant male households, extended family, skilled farmers and food security influenced adaptation index as well as adaptation strategies like organic manure, changing planting dates, diseases tolerant varieties and irrigation. Though, most dominant strategies like irrigation and applying fertilizer are not sustainable. The study also found that farm size, credit access, and extension contact significantly affects sustainability.

Assessing the aggregated environmental benefits from by-product and utility synergies in the Swedish biofuel industry,"The production of biofuels in Sweden has increased significantly in the past years in order to reduce fossil fuel dependence and mitigate climate impacts. Nonetheless, current methodological guidelines for assessing the GHG savings from the use of biofuels do not fully account for benefits from by-products and other utilities (e.g. waste heat and electricity) from biofuel production. This study therefore reviews the aggregated environmental performance of these multi-functional biofuel systems by assessing impacts and benefits from relevant production processes in Sweden in order to improve the decision base for biofuel producers and policymakers in the transition to a bio-based and circular economy. This was done by (1) conducting a mapping of the Swedish biofuel production portfolio, (2) developing future production scenarios, and (3) application of life cycle assessment methodology to assess the environmental performance of the production processes. Special focus was provided to review the potential benefits from replacing conventional products and services with by-products and utilities. The results provide evidence that failure to account for non-fuel-related benefits from biofuel production leads to an underestimation of the contribution of biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts when replacing fossil fuels, showing the importance of their multi-functionality.",About Sufficiency
Assessing the economic profitability of Paulownia as a biomass crop in Southern Mediterranean area,"The increase of renewable energy production worldwide, occurred in the last years, is also attributable to some agroforestry species cultivated according to the short rotation coppice technique. Although these species are able of enhancing abandoned or marginal land leading to numerous environmental benefits, an increasing number of farmers are introducing them in place of agricultural crops. Therefore, since for a farmer economic sustainability is one of the main factors to introduce a biomass crop, the study aimed at evaluating the profitability of Paulownia, a species that has been spreading in recent years. In particular, an economic analysis has been carried out in a Southern Italian farm in which Paulownia has recently replaced a vineyard, by adopting a discounted cash flow approach. The results show that the Paulownia for both timber and woodchip production, with an annual gross margin equal to 357.91 euro ha(-1), can represent a valid alternative compared to wine grape (237.41 euro ha(-1)), while Paulownia for exclusively biomass production has almost zero profitability (4.22 euro ha(-1)).

Assessing the rural food environment for advancing sustainable healthy diets: Insights from India,"World agricultural production has seen significant growth in the past four decades, yet malnutrition remains a persistent problem, particularly in the global south and more so in the rural areas. Need for a holistic approach to food systems is becoming crucial in designing policies that support the transition to sustainable and healthy diets. The present study is aimed to understand the rural food environment in the Telangana state in southern India by analyzing the combination of external and personal factors affecting food choices, attitudes, and consumption behavior. We developed a scoring-based methodology to assess the external and personal domains and di-mensions to understand the food environment. The results showed that rural households favored carbohydrate-rich food groups obtained mostly from their own production or subsidized sources. On the other hand, protein and micronutrient-rich food groups were neglected due to affordability and preference for taste, cultural factors, and the limitations of external food environment. The findings of this study provide a deeper understanding of the food environment in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) conext. By highlighting the interplay between agriculture, food environments, and nutrition outcomes, this study contributes to the ongoing effort to address the global malnutrition crisis and support the development of healthier and more sustainable food systems.

"Assessing the Sustainable Development of Bioenergy from Cassava within ""Water-Energy-Food"" Nexus Framework in China","Bioenergy from cassava is a promising alternative energy source for both energy supply and the mitigation of greenhouse gases. However, major global trends, such as climate change and competing landuse patterns, pose substantial risks to the sustainable development of bioenergy. The main purpose of this study was to assess the sustainable development of bioenergy from cassava, considering landuse change and climate change with a biogeochemical process model within the ""water-energy-food"" nexus framework. The results showed that the land resources that were suitable for the development of cassava bioenergy have continuously decreased in China since 1990. At the same time, the climate has also undergone significant changes, with temperature showing an increasing trend, and precipitation showing a decreasing trend. With the influences of both landuse change and climate change, the total bioenergy of cassava showed a downward trend. In China, the potential bioenergy production for the year 1990, 2000, and 2010 was 6075 PJ, 5974 PJ, and 4399 PJ, respectively. Compared to 1990, the bioenergy production in 2010 decreased by 1676.40 million GJ, which equals 57 million tons of standard coal.

Assessment and management of soil erosion in the hilltop mining dominated catchment using GIS integrated RUSLE model,"The Saranda forest region, which is well known for its biodiversity in India, is now confronted by rapid socioeconomic development, particularly the hilltop mining activities. Hilltop mining areas of this region have always been responsible for producing excessive soil erosion in the associated river basin. This erosion phenomenon becomes hazardous during the rainy season, thereby contributing to various environmental problems, and consequently, necessitating soil erosion control planning in the Saranda forest. Hence, this study aimed to estimate average annual soil erosion in the Saranda region in terms of the spatial distribution using the Geographic Information System (GIS) integrated Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The erosion was quantified at a spatial resolution of 10 m (pixel by pixel) using the GIS-based RUSLE inputs. This study also applies GIS integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model to identify the favorable zones for sediment deposition in the study area. On the basis of erosion severity, the entire study area is classified into six categories (very low to extreme). The study reveals that the Saranda forest's average annual soil erosion is 76 tons per hectare per year (t/ha/yr). Approximately 63% of the total area is categorized under very low to low erosion category, and the relevant area is mainly covered by forest land, whereas the mining region comprises less than 1% of the total study area with extremely high soil erosion (156 t/ha/yr) potential. As envisaged from the present study, the erosion-prone mining areas are located within a 1-5 km range of the adjacent Karo and Koina rivers, thereby, necessitating the erosion control strategy to avoid the possible threats. From this perspective, the study also investigates the favorable zones for sediment deposition using the GIS integrated AHP model to suggest the appropriate erosion control measures. Finally, the RUSLE and AHP models are combined on the GIS platform to identify the distressed catchment area. Moreover, 42% (41,060 ha) of the total area is disturbed due to the present mining activities, which involves 11 sub-watersheds, and their associated 50 micro-watersheds. From the context of watershed conservation, erosion control measures are also recommended. The methodology adopted in this study can be easily extended to any global mining-dominated catchment for sustainable conservation planning.",About Sufficiency
Assessment of energy use in arable farming systems by means of an agro-ecological indicator:: the energy indicator,"Efficient energy use by the agriculture sector is one of the conditions for sustainable agriculture because it allows financial savings, fossil resources preservation and air pollution decrease. We propose an Energy indicator (I-En) to evaluate environmental impacts due to energy consumption of arable farming systems to help farmers to manage their energy inputs at the field level according to the guidelines of integrated agriculture. I-En is based on the energetic analysis of four types of energy: two for indirect energy (pesticides and fertilisers) and two for direct energy (machinery and irrigation systems). In a second step, the assessed values of energy consumption are converted by means of an abacus into a mark between 0 and 10. I-En needs only data that are available on farms or easily assessed, and will be implemented with a set of seven other agro-ecological indicators to assess environmental sustainability of farms.

"Assessment of land use change in the Thuma forest reserve region of Malawi, Africa","A study was conducted in Thuma area in central Malawi to quantify contemporary land cover and to explore the degree of land use change in the Thuma forest reserve area of Malawi by analysing and comparing satellite-derived land cover maps from 1997, 2007 and 2017. The study was carried out using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS), focusing on analysis of Landsat 5 ETM and Landsat 8 ORI/TIRS satellite images. The classification was conducted for the following distinct classes; closed forest, open forest, shrubland, savanna grassland, agriculture fields, and water. The analysis revealed that closed forest diminished from 19% in 1997 to 10% in 2007 to 6% in 2017. Open forest reduced from 30% to 21% from 1997 to 2007 but increased to 22% in 2017. Agriculture area almost doubled from 37% in 1997 to 64% in 2017. The actual area from 1997 to 2017, shows that closed forest has reduced from 7,000 ha to 3,000 ha while open forest from 12,900 ha to 7800 ha. Savanna grassland has doubled from 5,900 ha to 13,000 ha. However, future studies should use modern satellites such as Sentinel and Landsat 9 for improved quantification of changes. The findings show that even the protected forest reserve (previously dominated by closed forest) is not fully protected from deforestation by local communities. Government and other stakeholders should devise measures to meet the needs of the surrounding communities and the ecological/biophysical needs of the reserves. Based on this study, issues of re-demarcation of the forest reserve and the accessed area should also be explored. This study serves as a reference for the management of Thuma Forest Reserve as a refuge for natural tree species, rivers that harbour endemic fish species (Opsaridium microlepis and Opsaridium microcephalis) and the sustainable management of endangered elephants in the reserve.",About Sufficiency
Assessment of remote sensing-based indices for drought monitoring in the north-western region of Bangladesh,"Drought is a widespread hazard that can tremendously affect the biodiversity, habitat of wild species, and ecosystem functioning and stability, especially in the dry region. Due to its geographic location, the north-western region of Bangladesh has a comparatively arid climate which is very much susceptible to drought occurrence and is marked as a red zone. Despite the growing evidence of the impact of drought on food security and ecosystem functioning, little effort has been paid to mitigate the drought in this region. The present study aimed to assess the drought condition of the north-western region of Bangladesh using earth observation techniques. For this purpose, Landsat data from 1990 to 2020 was used to determine various vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Water Index (NDWI), Moisture Index (NDMI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), along with Land Surface Temperature (LST). Results show that the depletion of forests (2832 km2) and water bodies (6773 km2) resulted from the expansion of settlement (6563 km2) and agricultural land (1802 km2) for the period 1990-2020. Examination of the temporal changes of vegetation indices and LST showed that the values of all indices decreased while the LST increased. The negative correlation between NDVI value and LST indicates that the vegetation in our study was subject to drought-induced shocks. This study reveals the current situation of the vegetation health in the north-western region of Bangladesh in relation to the drought conditions.

Based on GHG inventories and technical literature, agricultural production appears to be the hotspot in the life cycle of food products. Several life cycle assessment procedures, such as the Carbon Footprint (CF), Bilan Carbone (R), Environmental Product Declaration (R), are currently available and can help to identify more sustainable options. The available CF data were used to show how the so called Mediterranean-type diet might promote sustainable lifestyles in the developed countries with a more favourable impact on the environment and health. A progressive approach to food sustainability was also outlined.",About Sufficiency
Association Between the EAT-Lancet Reference Diet and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Mini-Review,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a prevalent pregnancy complication that seriously endangers maternal and infant health, posing a medical and economic burden worldwide. Several dietary patterns have been recommended for women of childbearing age, demonstrating a positive role in preventing and managing GDM. However, these dietary patterns may not fully take environmental factors into account when addressing global food sustainability and planetary health. In this context, the EAT-Lancet Commission proposed a diet in 2019 aimed at both health improvement and environmental sustainability, which can potentially reduce the prevalence of diet-related diseases. Nevertheless, the role of the EAT-Lancet reference diet in preventing and managing GDM has not been fully evaluated. Therefore, we conducted a literature search to assess the existing evidence for the association between the EAT-Lancet reference diet components and GDM. Based on the current evidence available in the PubMed database from inception to 31 October 2024, women of childbearing age are recommended to consume whole grains, fish, soy products, olive oil, full-fat dairy products, nuts, and moderate amounts of fruits while reducing red meat and sugar-sweetened beverage intake to lower the risk of GDM. There remains inconsistency regarding the association between tubers or starchy vegetables, vegetables, eggs, and poultry and the risk of GDM. In conclusion, current research on the association between diet and GDM is limited and offers suggestions for methodologies to obtain robust evidence regarding the association between the EAT-Lancet reference diet and GDM.",About Sufficiency
Associations of Food Insecurity with Dietary Inflammatory Potential and Risk of Low Muscle Strength,"Food insecurity refers to the uncertain availability of or limited access to nutritious food. Poor diets prevalent among food insecure populations may incite an inflammatory state and subsequently negatively affect skeletal muscle metabolism. To examine the inflammatory mechanistic potential of the association between food insecurity and the risk of low muscle strength, we analyzed cross-sectional data from 8624 adults aged >= 20 years from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2014-2015. Household food security status was assessed using an 18-item food security survey module. The inflammatory potential of diets was estimated by the dietary inflammation index (DII). Low muscle strength was ascertained using hand grip strength. In the multivariable-adjusted model, greater food insecurity was significantly associated with a higher DII score and risk of low muscle strength. The multivariable-adjusted mean difference (95% confidence interval) on the DII, comparing the ""moderate-to-severe"" food insecurity group with the ""food secure"" group, was 0.43 (0.06-0.80) (P-trend: <0.001) and the odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) of low muscle strength for the same comparison groups was 2.06 (1.07-3.96) (P-trend: 0.005). Our results suggest that individuals with greater food insecurity may be susceptible to diets with greater inflammatory potential, which may contribute to a loss of muscle strength.",About Sufficiency
Asymmetric response of soil methane uptake rate to land degradation and restoration: Data synthesis,"Land degradation and restoration profoundly affect soil CH(4)uptake capacity in terrestrial ecosystems. However, a comprehensive assessment of the response of soil CH(4)uptake to land degradation and restoration at global scale is not available. Here, we present a global meta-analysis with a database of 228 observations from 83 studies to investigate the effects of land degradation and restoration on the capacity of soil CH(4)uptake. We found that land degradation significantly decreased the capacity of soil CH(4)uptake, except the conversion of pasture to cropland where the soil CH(4)uptake rate showed no response. In contrast, all types of land restoration significantly increased the capacity of soil CH(4)uptake. Interestingly, the response of soil CH(4)uptake rate to land degradation and restoration was asymmetric: the increased soil CH(4)uptake rate in response to the land restoration was smaller compared to the decrease in CH(4)uptake rate induced by the land degradation. The effect of land degradation on soil CH(4)uptake rate was not dependent on the time since land use change, but the CH(4)sink strength increased with the time since land restoration. The response of soil CH(4)uptake rate to both land degradation and restoration was predominantly regulated by changes in the soil water-filled pore space, soil bulk density, and pH, whereas alterations in the substrate quantity and quality had negligible effect. Additionally, the effects of land degradation and restoration on soil CH(4)uptake were strongly related to the mean annual precipitation and soil texture. Overall, our results provide novel insights for understanding of how land degradation and restoration can affect the CH(4)sink strength of upland soils, and more importantly, our findings are beneficial to take measures to enhance the potential of soil CH(4)uptake in response to global land use change.",About Sufficiency
Attention Mechanism-Combined LSTM for Grain Yield Prediction in China Using Multi-Source Satellite Imagery,"Grain yield prediction affects policy making in various aspects such as agricultural production planning, food security assurance, and adjustment of foreign trade. Accurately predicting grain yield is of great significance in ensuring global food security. This paper is based on the MODIS remote sensing image data products from 2010 to 2020, and adds band information such as vegetation index and temperature to form composite remote sensing data as a dataset. Aiming at the lack of models for large-scale forecasting and the need for human intervention in traditional models, this paper proposes a grain production estimation model based on deep learning. First, image cropping and yield mapping techniques are used to process the data to generate training samples. Then the channel and spatial attention mechanism (convolutional block attention module, CBAM) is added to extract spatial information in different remote sensing bands to improve the efficiency of the model. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are added to obtain feature information in the time dimension. Finally, a national-scale grain yield prediction model is constructed. After the study, it was found that the LSTM model using a combination of multi-source satellite images and an attention mechanism can effectively predict grain yield in China. Furthermore, the proposed model was tested on data from 2018 to 2020 showing an average R-2 of 0.940 and an average RMSE of 80,020 tons, indicating that it can predict Chinese grain yield better. The model proposed in this paper extracts grain yield information directly from the composite remote sensing data, and solves the problem of small-scale research and imprecise yield prediction in an end-to-end manner.",About Sufficiency
Automatic Detection of Cage-Free Dead Hens with Deep Learning Methods,"Poultry farming plays a significant role in ensuring food security and economic growth in many countries. However, various factors such as feeding management practices, environmental conditions, and diseases lead to poultry mortality (dead birds). Therefore, regular monitoring of flocks and timely veterinary assistance is crucial for maintaining poultry health, well-being, and the success of poultry farming operations. However, the current monitoring method relies on manual inspection by farm workers, which is time-consuming. Therefore, developing an automatic early mortality detection (MD) model with higher accuracy is necessary to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in poultry. This study aimed to develop, evaluate, and test the performance of YOLOv5-MD and YOLOv6-MD models in detecting poultry mortality under various cage-free (CF) housing settings, including camera height, litter condition, and feather coverage. The results demonstrated that the YOLOv5s-MD model performed exceptionally well, achieving a high mAP@0.50 score of 99.5%, a high FPS of 55.6, low GPU usage of 1.04 GB, and a fast-processing time of 0.4 h. Furthermore, this study also evaluated the models' performances under different CF housing settings, including different levels of feather coverage, litter coverage, and camera height. The YOLOv5s-MD model with 0% feathered covering achieved the best overall performance in object detection, with the highest mAP@0.50 score of 99.4% and a high precision rate of 98.4%. However, 80% litter covering resulted in higher MD. Additionally, the model achieved 100% precision and recall in detecting hens' mortality at the camera height of 0.5 m but faced challenges at greater heights such as 2 m. These findings suggest that YOLOv5s-MD can detect poultry mortality more accurately than other models, and its performance can be optimized by adjusting various CF housing settings. Therefore, the developed model can assist farmers in promptly responding to mortality events by isolating affected birds, implementing disease prevention measures, and seeking veterinary assistance, thereby helping to reduce the impact of poultry mortality on the industry, ensuring the well-being of poultry and the overall success of poultry farming operations.",About Sufficiency
Avoidable food losses and associated production-phase greenhouse gas emissions arising from application of cosmetic standards to fresh fruit and vegetables in Europe and the UK,"The use of aesthetics for classifying and accepting fresh food for sale and consumption is built into food quality standards and regulations of the European Union. The food distribution sector in Europe and the UK is oligopolistic in nature; a small number of supermarket chains control a large market share. The influence of these 'multiples' enables them to impose additional proprietary 'quality' criteria. Produce that doesn't meet these standards may be lost from the food supply chain, never seeing a supermarket shelf - it may not get past the supplier, or even leave the farm. Here, for the first time, we estimate the quantity of food loss and waste of fresh fruit and vegetables arising from cosmetic standards in Europe and UK, and its associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We find few direct measurements of such losses, resulting in large uncertainties for key commodities. In the context of these uncertainties, we estimate avoidable FLW from on-farm cosmetic grade-outs of up to 4500 kt yr(-1) in the UK and 51,500 kt yr(-1) in the European Economic Area (EEA). Our estimates suggest over a third of total farm production is lost for aesthetic reasons, which equates to as much as 970 kt CO(2)e (UK) and 22,500 kt CO(2)e (EEA) of embedded production-phase GHG emissions annually. Examining the issue from the perspective of markets, suppliers, and consumers we establish there is an over-emphasis on superficial qualities (i.e. cosmetic appearance) of fresh produce, which leads to its unnecessary loss and waste. Using an illustrative case study, we provide potential avenues to mitigate these losses and the associated GHG emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Avoided Deforestation Linked to Environmental Registration of Properties in the Brazilian Amazon,"We quantified the avoided deforestation impacts of environmental land registration in Brazil's Amazonian states of Mato Grosso and Para between 2005 and 2014. We find that the program reduced deforestation on registered lands. The magnitude of the effect implies that deforestation in the two states would have been 10% higher in the absence of the program. The impacts of registration varied over time, likely due to changing suites of policies linking environmental registration to land use incentives. Our results also reveal that agriculturally suitable lands and those located in regions undergoing the most land-use change were more likely to be registered than those in less suitable, less dynamic regions. We conclude that environmental registration is an important first step in implementing avoided deforestation policies targeting private landholders.",About Sufficiency

Root system growth and development responses to elevated CO2: underlying signalling mechanisms and role in improving plant CO2 capture and soil C storage,"Carbon storage in soils is one of the most promising strategies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and the associated climate change. In this context, how plant root systems respond to the elevation of the atmospheric CO2 concentration is of crucial importance because these organs are the main source of C input into the soils. It is expected that root growth will be stimulated by elevated CO2 as a consequence of enhanced photosynthesis, and that this will favour belowground C sequestration. In add-ition, larger root systems with optimized architecture are also expected to improve water and nutrient acquisition by plants, and to indirectly stimulate photosynthetic CO2 capture. This review critically examines the evidence supporting these expectations from a molecular physiology perspective. We illustrate the strong but highly variable effects of elevated CO2 on root system size and architecture, and provide an update on the signal-ling mechanisms that may trigger these effects. This highlights the lack of knowledge on the physiological and genetic bases of the root growth and development response to ele-vated CO2, but shows that candidate genes and genetic resources are largely available to fill this gap.",About Sufficiency
"Bacteria, Fungi and Archaea Domains in Rhizospheric Soil and Their Effects in Enhancing Agricultural Productivity","The persistent and undiscriminating application of chemicals as means to improve crop growth, development and yields for several years has become problematic to agricultural sustainability because of the adverse effects these chemicals have on the produce, consumers and beneficial microbes in the ecosystem. Therefore, for agricultural productivity to be sustained there are needs for better and suitable preferences which would be friendly to the ecosystem. The use of microbial metabolites has become an attractive and more feasible preference because they are versatile, degradable and ecofriendly, unlike chemicals. In order to achieve this aim, it is then imperative to explore microbes that are very close to the root of a plant, especially where they are more concentrated and have efficient activities called the rhizosphere. Extensive varieties of bacteria, archaea, fungi and other microbes are found inhabiting the rhizosphere with various interactions with the plant host. Therefore, this review explores various beneficial microbes such as bacteria, fungi and archaea and their roles in the environment in terms of acquisition of nutrients for plants for the purposes of plant growth and health. It also discusses the effect of root exudate on the rhizosphere microbiome and compares the three domains at molecular levels.",About Sufficiency
Changes in soil C and N stocks and C:N stoichiometry 21 years after land use change on an arable mineral topsoil,"The sequestration of excess atmospheric C into resilient and long-lasting belowground pools is of increasing global importance to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. One land use that is particularly amenable to this type of manipulation is agricultural land, which often has high sequestration potential. However, this capacity can depend on local factors such as cropping history, soil type and climate. Critically, it may also be limited by N availability. In this study we used the retrospective (repeated measures) methodology to assess the impact on previously arable land of land use change by either afforestation with two species of broadleaf trees planted at 800 or 1600 stems ha(-1) (T800 and T1600), or reversion to rough grassland (NT) for 21 years. We quantified the concentration, distribution and total stocks of organic C and N in the upper 0-30 cm of a common soil type found in NE Scotland and investigated the robustness of C:N to land use change. Finally we estimated ecosystem stocks of C and N, and how these were partitioned between plant and soil components. We found increases in the overall concentrations of soil C from 4.6% to 5.8%, and N from 0.32% to 0.43%. The increase in soil C stocks over the experiment was in the order NT > T800 > T1600 and each treatment differed significantly. The same pattern was seen for increases in N stocks but here the increases in NT and T800 were significantly greater than for T1600. Overall, stocks were higher in the rough grassland plots than under trees by 35 Mg ha(-1) for C and 2.2 Mg ha(-1) for N. These increases in stocks were accompanied by a highly significant narrowing in C:N with time across all treatments from 14.6 to 13.6 and differences seen between upper and lower soil layers in 1991 had disappeared by 2012. From an average of 151 Mg ha(-1) in 1991, the system C stock (soil + plants) had increased to between 202 Mg ha(-1) (NT) and 221 Mg ha(-1) (T1600) by 2012, with between 96% (NT) and 73% (T1600) of the C in the soil. Concurrently the system stock of N had increased to between 14.1 Mg ha(-1) (NT) and 11.3 Mg ha(-1) (T1600), from an average of 9.4 Mg ha(-1) in 1991, with between 99% (NT) and 81% (T1600) of the system N in the soil. Although in 2012 there were significantly greater soil C stocks in NT, this was offset by C accumulation in the treatments containing trees, such that overall there were no treatment differences. However, this was not seen with system N stocks in 2012, which were significantly larger in the NT treatment than in those with trees. Mean annual rates of C and N accumulation in the systems were greatest in NT (2.7 and 0.22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and least in T1600 (0.7 and 0.08 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). These results are important in the context of land use strategies aimed at pollution mitigation, such as C sequestration and nitrate leaching. They are also relevant to the possible effects of land use change, especially reversion to agricultural use, of land previously taken out of production.",About Sufficiency
Comprehensive Assessment of the Effect of Multi-Cropping on Agroecosystems,"Multi-cropping is becoming an increasingly popular technique in agriculture to tackle major and complex agroecosystem problems such as biodiversity and soil fertility loss, erosion and degradation, increased greenhouse gas emissions, etc. Comprehensively assessing the impact of multi-cropping intensity on agroecosystems is a new and still under-researched approach that can provide a better understanding of the impact of individual indicators on the overall functioning of biodiverse agroecosystems. Data from a stationary field experiment using multi-cropping at the Vytautas Magnus University Experimental Station between 2020 and 2022 were used to carry out this study. The study included maize, hemp, and faba bean as single, binary, and ternary crops. A complex assessment approach (CEI value) was used to determine the impact of these crops on the agroecosystem, the interrelationships between the main indicators, and the strength of their effects.

Bamboo as an Alternative Bioenergy Crop and Powerful Ally for Land Restoration in Indonesia,"The energy demand in Indonesia has increased significantly with its population growth, urbanization, and economic development. The growing concern of meeting energy demand while reducing dependency on fossil fuels has resulted in an increasing demand for renewable energy. As a country with a rich biomass base, bioenergy is now an important component of Indonesia's energy agenda. However, a crucial problem in bioenergy production is the selection of species that can provide a sustainable supply of feedstock without having an impact on food security and the environment. In this context, we discuss the characteristics and benefits of using bamboo, a perennial grass, as a potential species for bioenergy feedstock in Indonesia. We describe the fuel characteristics of bamboo along with the possibility to align its cultivation, production, and usage with environmental and developmental agendas which makes it a suitable bioenergy crop in the country. In addition, its ability to grow on degraded lands, fast growth, long root system, and easy maintenance prove it as a powerful ally for the restoration of degraded land. We recommend in-depth research on the social, ecological, and economic feasibility of using this species for bioenergy production.",About Sufficiency

"Impact of forest governance and enforcement on deforestation and forest degradation at the district level: A study in West Bengal State, India","According to the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), the world loses 1.0 x 106 hm2 forest land through deforestation annually. About 1.6 x 106 people who depend on forests for livelihood are negatively affected by deforestation and forest degradation. The paper attempts to study the impact of forest governance, enforcement and socio-economic factors on deforestation and forest degradation at the local level in West Bengal State, India. The study was based on questionnaire survey data during 2020-2021 collected from three western districts (Purulia, Bankura, and Paschim Medinipur) where deforestation and poverty rates are higher than other districts in West Bengal State. The total number of selected villages was 29, and the total sample households were 693. A stratified random sampling technique was used to collect data, and a questionnaire was followed. Forest governance and enforcement indices were constructed using United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) methodology and a step-wise logistic regression model was used to identify the factors affecting deforestation and forest degradation. The result of this study showed that four factors (illegal logging, weak forest administration, encroachment, and poverty) are identified for the causes of deforestation and forest degradation. It is observed that six indices of forest governance (rule of law, transparency, accountability, participation, inclusiveness and equitability, and efficiency and effectiveness) is relatively high in Purulia District. Moreover, this study shows that Purulia and Bankura districts follow medium forest governance, while Paschim Medinipur District has poor forest governance. The enforcement index is found to be highest in Purulia District (0.717) and lowest for Paschim Medinipur District (0.257). Finally, weak forest governance, poor socio-economic conditions of the households, and weak enforcement lead to the deforestation and forest degradationin the study area. Therefore, governments should strengthen law enforcement and encourage sustainable forest certification schemes to combat illegal logging.",About Sufficiency
"Estimated dietary exposure to pesticide residues based on organic and conventional data in omnivores, pesco-vegetarians, vegetarians and vegans","Purpose: To examine dietary exposure to 25 pesticide residues in several diet groups including omnivores, pesco-vegetarians, vegetarians and vegans while accounting for the farming system (organic or conventional) of plant-based foods consumed. Methods: Organic and conventional consumption data in combination with data on pesticide residues in plant-based foods were used to derive estimated dietary exposure to pesticide residues. Pesticide residue exposure was estimated based on observed data, and using two scenarios simulated for 100%-conventional and 100%-organic diets in 33,018 omnivores, 555 pesco-vegetarians, 501 vegetarians and 368 vegans from the NutriNet-Sante study. Pesticide residue exposure across groups was compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Exposure levels varied across diet groups depending on the pesticide studied. The highest exposure was observed for imazalil in all groups. Vegetarians appeared to be less exposed to the studied pesticides overall. Compared to omnivores - apart from pesticides authorised in organic farming - vegetarians had lowest exposure. The 100%-conventional scenario led to a sharp increase in exposure to pesticide residues, except for pesticides allowed in organic farming and conversely for the 100%-organic scenario. Conclusions: Despite their high plant-based product consumption, vegetarians were less exposed to synthetic pesticides than omnivores, due to their greater propensity to consume organic.",About Sufficiency
Bee and non-bee pollinator importance for local food security,"Pollinators are critical for food security; however, their contribution to the pollina-tion of locally important crops is still unclear, especially for non-bee pollinators.

Beef or grasshopper hamburgers: The ecological implications of choosing one over the other,"Both the means by which we produce our food and our eating habits influence some of the most important environmental problems of our planet. The most exploited livestock for the past 50 years has been cattle, which are fed primarily on maize to increase production. However, this combination of maize and cattle is inefficient in ecological terms. Producing and consuming proteins from animals with more efficient biomass and energy conversions could help to solve certain environmental problems. For instance, insects that are considered pests in agricultural systems - including, specifically, the Orthoptera species - may be excellent candidates as protein sources. This work analyses the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the three types of livestock that are most widely bred worldwide: cattle, pigs, and poultry. It then compares these results with those of potential minilivestock from the Orthoptera species that are more abundant in agroecosystems. Based on the calculated FCRs (cow:pork:poultry:grasshopper pests and insects grown on farms; 10:6:2:4:1.7), we project that reducing beef production by half could significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions and the maize sowing hectares destined for feed (2.1-2.9 X 10(7) ha), while simultaneously releasing maize for human consumption. Additionally, consuming insect-based protein could reduce pollution problems by decreasing insecticide use (by at least 7 X 10(7) l). Though a comprehensive solution to current environmental problems (e.g. global warming), will require coordinated global effort (e.g. to replace fossil fuels), there is one way that everyone can contribute: eating grasshopper burgers instead of beef burgers.

Belowground carbon sequestration in a mature planted mangroves (Northern Viet Nam),"Mangroves play a key role in carbon sequestration along tropical and subtropical coastlines, mainly as a result of their high primary productivity and the anoxic character of their soils, in which organic matter decay processes are slow. Unfortunately, these forests are disappearing worldwide, notably due to aqua culture and the need for space on the shoreline. The mangrove area in Viet Nam decreased substantially until late 90's, which was a concern for the Vietnamese government. Then, replantation programs were developed in order to protect the shoreline against the erosion; like in northern Viet Nam, where monospecific stands were planted from the mid 90's. Within this context, our objectives were to determine carbon stocks and carbon burial rates in the soil of a 18 years old Kandelia obovata (Sheue, Lui & Yong) mangrove forest. Three plots were set up in the planted mangroves and three in adjacent bare land (without any mangrove) at the mouth of Red River. Three geo-slicers up to 100 cm depth were taken in each plot; and in each core, ten soil samples were collected with a 10 cm depth interval. Later on, dead and live roots were sorted. Carbon contents in soils and in roots were determined using the Walkley-Black method and loss on ignition (LOI) method, respectively. Then, the total belowground carbon sequestration was estimated. There was a depth related distribution of organic carbon in soil with the highest concentrations measured between 20 and 60 cm depth. Accumulated carbon up to depth of 100 cm in soil and roots of the planted K. obovata were 146.78 +/- 3.87 Mg OC ha(-1) and 12.67 +/- 0.14 Mg OC ha(-1), respectively. The value was 87.59 +/- 1.08 Mg OC ha(-1) for the adjacent bare land. Consequently, the mean carbon burial rate for this system was approximately 6.94 Mg OC ha(-1) yr(-1), which is higher than most of the mangroves and may be related to a low export of the net primary productivity or most likely to a high sedimentation rate. These results were compared with previously published results on carbon stocks in younger planted forests of the same species in the same region, a positive and linear relationship was determined between the age of the planted stand and the below ground carbon stocks.

Global assessment of the impacts of COVID-19 on food security,"In this paper we present the first global assessments of COVID-19's impacts on food systems and their actors, focusing specifically on the food security and nutritional status of those affected in low and middle-income countries. The assessment covers 62 countries and is based on the analysis of 337 documents published in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. The review confirms the magnitude and the severity of an unprecedented crisis that has spread worldwide and has spared only a few. The analysis shows that the dimension of food security that has been most affected is accessibility, with reasonably solid evidence suggesting that both financial and physical access to food have been disrupted. In contrast, there is no clear evidence that the availability of food has been affected. Overall, data suggests that food systems resisted and adapted to the disruption of the pandemic. This resilience came, however, at great costs, with the majority of the systems' actors having to cope with severe disruptions in their activities. In contrast, grocery stores and supermarkets made billions of dollars in profits in 2020.",About Sufficiency
Benefits and costs of deforestation by smallholders: Implications for forest conservation and climate policy,"Deforestation is a leading cause of biodiversity loss and an important source of global carbon emissions. This means that there are important synergies between climate policy and conservation policy. The highest rates of deforestation occur in tropical countries, where much of the land at the forest frontier is managed informally by smallholders and where governance systems tend to be weak. These features must be considered when designing policies to reduce emissions from deforestation such as REDD+. Deforestation is often accompanied by fires that release large amounts of carbon dioxide. These emissions are especially high in the case of peatlands which contain thick layers of carbon-rich matter. In this paper we derive marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves using data from a farmer survey in Sumatra, where rates of peatland deforestation are high. Comparing these results with farmers' stated willingness to accept payment not to clear forest to establish oil palm suggests that REDD+ policies may be more expensive than MAC estimates suggest The extent to which this is true depends on the types of soils being deforested.

Mapping smallholder and large-scale cropland dynamics with a flexible classification system and pixel-based composites in an emerging frontier of Mozambique,"Remote sensing assessments of land use and land cover change (LULCC) are critical to improve understanding of socio-economic, institutional and ecological processes that lead to and stem from land use change. This is particularly crucial in the emerging frontiers of Southern Africa, where there is a paucity of LULCC studies relative to the humid tropics. This study focuses on Gurue District (5606 km2) of Zambezia province of Mozambique, one of many countries in the region that has experienced a recent growth in foreign investments in agriculture through large-scale land acquisitions, often resulting in land use conversions and modifications. Previous LULCC assessments covering Mozambique have focused on dynamics between natural and anthropogenic land categories, with limited efforts to distinguish the different land use agents associated with these changes, and relating this with social, economic and technological processes. In this study we built a new LULC assessment methodology that leverages the power of open remote sensing data and tools to integrate categorical and continuous training and validation data obtained from field surveys and Collect Earth software within Google Earth Engine. We then examined the suitability of five pixel-based compositing techniques for generating cloud-free Landsat images that can support analysis of land use dynamics in persistently cloudy, mosaic landscapes with more limited Landsat archives. Drawing upon the spectral and textural features of Landsat data in pixel-based composites, we classified land use over three time periods, 2006, 2012 and 2016, and characterized land use change, focusing on changes between small-scale cropland, large-scale mechanized cropland, and other land uses. This method can be upscaled and applied in many parts of Africa with similar historic image availability challenges, and similar economic contexts with great disparities between small-scale unmechanized cropland and very large-scale mechanized cropland, to explore land consolidation dynamics and agent-specific pathways of land use change.",About Sufficiency
Rangeland Grazing Strategies to Lower the Dependency on Imported Concentrates in Norwegian Sheep Meat Production,"Norway has vast rangeland resources (292,361 km(2)) with an estimated carrying capacity of nearly four million sheep and lambs, twice the current number. However, the intensive production system currently applied has led to more concentrate dependency, resulting in heavier animals in addition to poorer utilization of rangelands and homegrown feed. Intensive feeding systems indirectly influence the sustainability of ecosystems by promoting intensive cropping that can deplete soil fertility and threaten landscape preservation and biodiversity. By contrast, extensive grazing systems can produce environmentally and animal-friendly food products and contribute to regulating soil health, water and nutrient cycling, soil carbon sequestration, and recreational environments. In this paper, the economics of current sheep feeding practices in Norway, using a linear programming model, were compared with more extensive systems which allow for higher usage of on-farm feed resources. Changes in current sheep farming practices have the potential to increase lamb meat production relative to mutton production, in addition to improving the year-round supply of fresh meat. The investigated alternatives, using the Norwegian White Sheep (NWS) breed, suggest that delayed lambing is useful only on farms with abundant pastures available for autumn feeding. Lambs achieve a better market price than hoggets and mature sheep. Therefore, based on the current Norwegian meat market and price offered per kilogram of meat for lamb, an increase in NWS lamb production improves farm profits. On the other hand, when the aim is on greater use of homegrown feed and rangelands, this can be achieved through hogget production, and the quantity of concentrates required can be reduced substantially.",About Sufficiency
Big Data Applications in Food Supply Chain Management: A Conceptual Framework,"The paper provides a systematic review and analysis of the current literature on big data (BD) applications in the context of food supply chain management (FSCM) in order to categorize the state-of-the-art research trends exploring the adoption and implementation of big data analytics (BDA) across different segments of food supply chain (FSC). The use of BDA brings the digital transformation of FSCs closer providing sustainable implications and added value to their operation. Harnessing BD's potential is becoming more and more relevant in addressing the constantly evolving complexities in food systems. However, the field of BD applications in the FSCM domain is severely fragmented and relatively ""primitive"". The present research is one of the earliest attempts to recognize and present a comprehensive analysis for the BD applications across different segments of FSC proposing a conceptual framework that illustrates the role of BD in a data-driven FSCM environment. For the purposes of our research, we adopted the systematic literature review (SLR) method aiming at the identification of the dominant categories and themes within the research area. Based on the SLR findings, we propose a conceptual framework that captures the interconnection between FSC performance and BD applications by using the input-process-output (IPO) model within a data-driven FSCM context. The main research contribution lies on the thematic classification of relevant research, the conceptualization of this fragmented field, the development of a conceptual framework, and the presentation of a future research agenda pertaining to BD applications in a data-driven FSCM context.",About Sufficiency
Biochar co-compost improves nitrogen retention and reduces carbon emissions in a winter wheat cropping system,"Organic amendments, such as compost and biochar, mitigate the environmental burdens associated with wasting organic resources and close nutrient loops by capturing, transforming, and resupplying nutrients to soils. While compost or biochar application to soil can enhance an agroecosystem's capacity to store carbon and produce food, there have been few field studies investigating the agroecological impacts of amending soil with biochar co-compost, produced through the composting of nitrogen-rich organic material, such as manure, with carbon-rich biochar. Here, we examine the impact of biochar co-compost on soil properties and processes by conducting a field study in which we compare the environmental and agronomic impacts associated with the amendment of either dairy manure co-composted with biochar, dairy manure compost, or biochar to soils in a winter wheat cropping system. Organic amendments were applied at equivalent C rates (8 Mg C ha(-1)). We found that all three treatments significantly increased soil water holding capacity and total plant biomass relative to the no-amendment control. Soils amended with biochar or biochar co-compost resulted in significantly less greenhouse gas emissions than the compost or control soils. Biochar co-compost also resulted in a significant reduction in nutrient leaching relative to the application of biochar alone or compost alone. Our results suggest that biochar co-composting could optimize organic resource recycling for climate change mitigation and agricultural productivity while minimizing nutrient losses from agroecosystems.",About Sufficiency
Biochar: A Synthesis of Its Agronomic Impact beyond Carbon Sequestration,"Biochar has been heralded as an amendment to revitalize degraded soils, improve soil carbon sequestration, increase agronomic productivity, and enter into future carbon trading markets. However, scientific and economic technicalities may limit the ability of biochar to consistently deliver on these expectations. Past research has demonstrated that biochar is part of the black carbon continuum with variable properties due to the net result of production (e.g., feedstock and pyrolysis conditions) and postproduction factors (storage or activation). Therefore, biochar is not a single entity but rather spans a wide range of black carbon forms. Biochar is black carbon, but not all black carbon is biochar. Agronomic benefits arising from biochar additions to degraded soils have been emphasized, but negligible and negative agronomic effects have also been reported. Fifty percent of the reviewed studies reported yield increases after black carbon or biochar additions, with the remainder of the studies reporting alarming decreases to no significant differences. Hardwood biochar (black carbon) produced by traditional methods (kilns or soil pits) possessed the most consistent yield increases when added to soils. The universality of this conclusion requires further evaluation due to the highly skewed feedstock preferences within existing studies. With global population expanding while the amount of arable land remains limited, restoring soil quality to nonproductive soils could be key to meeting future global food production, food security, and energy supplies; biochar may play a role in this endeavor. Biochar economics are often marginally viable and are tightly tied to the assumed duration of agronomic benefits. Further research is needed to determine the conditions under which biochar can provide economic and agronomic benefits and to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for these benefits.",About Sufficiency
Biocomplexity and conservation of biodiversity hotspots: three case studies from the Americas,"The perspective of 'biocomplexity' in the form of 'coupled natural and human systems' represents a resource for the future conservation of biodiversity hotspots in three direct ways: ( i) modelling the impact on biodiversity of private land-use decisions and public land- use policies, ( ii) indicating how the biocultural history of a biodiversity hotspot may be a resource for its future conservation, and ( iii) identifying and deploying the nodes of both the material and psycho-spiritual connectivity between human and natural systems in service to conservation goals. Three biocomplexity case studies of areas notable for their biodiversity, selected for their variability along a latitudinal climate gradient and a human-impact gradient, are developed: the Big Thicket in southeast Texas, the Upper Botanamo River Basin in eastern Venezuela, and the Cape Horn Archipelago at the austral tip of Chile. More deeply, the biocomplexity perspective reveals alternative ways of understanding biodiversity itself, because it directs attention to the human concepts through which biodiversity is perceived and understood.

Biocultural approaches to pollinator conservation,"Pollinators underpin sustainable livelihoods that link ecosystems, spiritual and cultural values, and customary governance systems with indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) across the world. Biocultural diversity is a shorthand term for this great variety of people-nature interlinkages that have developed over time in specific ecosystems. Biocultural approaches to conservation explicitly build on the conservation practices inherent in sustaining these livelihoods. We used the Conceptual Framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services to analyse the biocultural approaches to pollinator conservation by IPLCs globally. The analysis identified biocultural approaches to pollinators across all six elements of the Conceptual Framework, with conservation-related practices occurring in 60 countries, in all continents except Antarctica. Practices of IPLCs that are important for biocultural approaches to pollinator conservation can be grouped into three categories: the practice of valuing diversity and fostering biocultural diversity; landscape management practices; and diversified farming systems. Particular IPLCs may use some or all of these practices. Policies that recognize customary tenure over traditional lands, strengthen indigenous and community-conserved areas, promote heritage listing and support diversified farming systems within a food sovereignty approach are among several identified that strengthen biocultural approaches to pollinator conservation, and thereby deliver mutual benefits for pollinators and people.",About Sufficiency
Biodegradable mulch as microclimate modification effort for improving the growth of horenso; Spinacia oleracea L.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Increasing global temperature imposes large risks to food security globally and regionally. Besides, adaptation effort on cultivation practices, such as mulching, is urgent to overcome environmental problem due to certain material used, commonly plastic that is not biodegradable. Biodegradable mulch is a mulch that could be degraded by microorganism and made from renewable organic materials. It plays a role in carbon sequestration and will contribute carbon and nutrients to the soil after being degraded. This current research aimed at investigating soil microclimate under various biodegradable mulch compositions and optimizing the compositions of biodegradable mulch that can be used to support the growth of short-cycle crops i.e. horenso (Spinacia olearecea L.). METHODS: This study was carried out using a simple randomized complete block design with one control (without mulch) and five treatments (biodegradable mulch compositions), namely the percentage of water hyacinth (40-80%) and coconut coir (20-60%). FINDINGS: All tested biodegradable mulch compositions could modify microclimate by decreasing 1-2 degrees C of soil temperature and maintaining the soil moisture within the range of 63-84%. Although there was no significant difference in the growth and yield of horenso among the differing biodegradable mulch compositions, the biodegradable mulch composition treatments resulted in signficantly higher value than the control (without mulch). The biodegradable mulch composition treatments could increase fresh shoot weight around 38-55%, fresh root weight for about 55-94%, and dry shoot weight approximately by 1.6-2.8 times compared to the control (without mulch). CONCLUSION: This finding has emphasized that all tested biodegradable mulch compositions are potentially used as mulch for horenso (Spinacia oleracea L.) cultivation. This study provide information in the formulation of biodegradable mulch to adapt the compositions on other short-cycle crops and other horticulture crops. (C) 2021 GJESM.

Bioenergy as a means to social and economic development in Guinea-Bissau: a proposal for a biodiesel production and use program,"Given that agro-industrial activity is widely seen as a means of promoting development and the production of bioenergy has come to be considered a means of both fostering socioeconomic development and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the production of biodiesel would appear to be a means of promoting development in developing countries. The situation of Guinea-Bissau suggests the country may benefit from a biodiesel production program. Thus, this paper uses Brazil's experience with biodiesel as a basis for proposing a framework for a Biodiesel Program in Guinea-Bissau. The proposed framework includes the following elements related to public policy, regulations, organizations and mechanisms: (i) introduction of biodiesel through the creation and implementation of laws and regulations; (ii) an Inter-ministerial Executive Committee to plan, coordinate and manage the program; (iii) promotion, incentives and support for agricultural and agro-industrial production by providing tax benefits for specific links of the chain, creating incentive programs for different oilseeds and establishing programs that support family farming; and (iv) the creation and installation of representative bodies for the stakeholders involved in the chain, such as small farmers cooperatives, national association of biodiesel producers, R&D and rural extension programs.",About Sufficiency
Bioengineered microbial strains for detoxification of toxic environmental pollutants,"Industrialization and other anthropogenic human activities pose significant environmental risks. As a result of the hazardous pollution, numerous living organisms may suffer from undesirable diseases in their separate habitats. Bioremediation, which removes hazardous compounds from the environment using microbes or their biologically active metabolites, is one of the most successful remediation approaches. According to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), deteriorating soil health negatively impacts food security and human health over time. Soil health restoration is critical right now. Microbes are widely known for their importance in cleaning up toxins present in the soil, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and hydrocarbons. However, the capacity of local bacteria to digest these pollutants is limited, and the process takes an extended time. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs), whose altered metabolic pathways promote the over-secretion of a variety of proteins favorable to the bioremediation process, can speed up the breakdown process. The need for remediation procedures, degrees of soil contamination, site circumstances, broad adoptions, and numerous possibilities occurring at various cleaning stages are all studied in detail. Massive efforts to restore contaminated soils have also resulted in severe issues. This review focuses on the enzymatic removal of hazardous pollutants from the environment, such as pesticides, heavy metals, dyes, and plastics. There are also in-depth assessments of present discoveries and future plans for efficient enzymatic degradation of hazardous pollutants.",About Sufficiency
Biogas energy generated from livestock manure in China: Current situation and future trends,"This article investigates the current status of the livestock industry (cattle, pigs, sheep, and poultry) in China and assesses the potential for biogas production from anaerobically digested livestock manure. According to calculation results based on the latest data of livestock released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2018, China produced 2 x 10(12) kg of manure pollution in 2017, with pig waste representing the largest single manure source. Biogas that can be converted from high organic containing manure is a kind of clean bioenergy with low carbon footprint. In 2017, the energy potential from manure-produced biogas was about 5.74 x 10(12)-6.73 x 10(12) MJ, which corresponds to 4-5% of China's total energy demand. Correlation analysis between biogas production and the livestock industry showed that crop production had significant effects on manure-generated biogas production. However, it is necessary to address the challenges when applying AD technology. Bioenergy potential from manure will be lost during material collection and transportation. Although large-scale livestock farming remains controversial, this type of farming can improve the energy recovery rate of livestock manure. How to gain benefits and maintain sustainable development is also a bottleneck for AD promotion. Reducing energy input in AD projects as well as enhancing the efficiency of methanogenesis of livestock manure are key factors for achieving a high net output of biogas projects. More inclusive strategies and a broader vision should be adopted to allow stakeholders to benefit from manure-generated biogas projects.",About Sufficiency

Assessing the Impact of Crop Diversification on Farm Poverty in India,"Crop diversification into high-value crops (HVCs) can be a strategy to improve livelihood outcomes for farmers. Using data from a nationally representative survey, we establish that households diversifying toward HVCs are less likely to be poor, the biggest impact being for smallholders. Furthermore, using continuous treatment matching, we establish the relationship between degree of diversification (share of area dedicated to HVC) and poverty. Growers of HVCs need to allocate at least 50% area to HVCs to escape poverty. Effect of diversification on poverty is in general positive but it withers after a threshold probably because of constraints i.e., capital on smaller farms and labor on larger ones.

Breeding crops for enhanced roots to mitigate against climate change without compromising yield,"Boosting soil carbon by adding it to the soil, is among climate mitigation strategies. In a viewpoint more than a decade ago, Kell (2011) proposed plant breeding as a tool to develop varieties with larger underground biomass as a method to store carbon in the soil and reverse the trends of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. To this date, the only evidence showing breeding for root traits is in rice. Wheat is well suited to serve this purpose because it is an important crop for food security and is the crop with highest cultivated area in the world. In this study, we developed breeding populations by crossing 'Penny' (a donor parent with large root) and 'Yecora' (a small root cultivar). Aboveground and belowground biomass partitioning, carbon content, and grain weight were studied in soil under controlled environment. Selection candidates differed significantly for all traits except carbon content. Broad-sense heritability for shoot biomass was 0.75 and for all other traits were equal or above 0.94. The root biomass ranged 0.43-7.72 g, averaging 2.13 g. A considerable range of root/shoot ratio was observed the selection candidates from 0.029 to 0.341, averaging 0.10. Based on LSD test, 13 out of 23 progenies tested in the replicated experiment, had significantly greater root biomass than 'Yecora'. Among those, there were lines that produced equal or greater grain weight than ""Yecora"". BC2 129, for example, showed 8.6-folds greater root biomass compared with 'Yecora' yet produced grain weight with no significant difference with that of 'Yecora'. Similarly, BC2 147, BC2 165, BC2 137, showed 3.1-folds, 2.4-folds, 2.3-folds, respectively, greater root biomass but similar grain weights compared with 'Yecora'. These lines showed significantly greater root/ shoot ratios. Roots collected at physiological maturity showed 40.2%, on average, carbon content per dry biomass. This study showed that given one cycle of breeding involving a donor germplasm from genebank wheat root system can be manipulated to develop germplasm for grain production and simultaneously mitigating climate change by allocating more carbon in soil.",About Sufficiency
Breeding for plant heat tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages,"Thermotolerant crop research. Global warming has become a serious worldwide threat. High temperature is a major environmental factor limiting crop productivity. Current adaptations to high temperature via alterations to technical and management systems are insufficient to sustain yield. For this reason, breeding for heat-tolerant crops is in high demand. This review provides an overview of the effects of high temperature on plant physiology, fertility and crop yield and discusses the strategies for breeding heat-tolerant cultivars. Generating thermotolerant crops seems to be a challenging task as heat sensitivity is highly variable across developmental stages and processes. In response to heat, plants trigger a cascade of events, switching on numerous genes. Although breeding has made substantial advances in developing heat-tolerant lines, the genetic basis and diversity of heat tolerance in plants remain largely unknown. The development of new varieties is expensive and time-consuming, and knowledge of heat tolerance mechanisms would aid the design of strategies to screen germplasm for heat tolerance traits. However, gains in heat tolerance are limited by the often narrow genetic diversity. Exploration and use of wild relatives and landraces in breeding can increase useful genetic diversity in current crops. Due to the complex nature of plant heat tolerance and its immediate global concern, it is essential to face this breeding challenge in a multidisciplinary holistic approach involving governmental agencies, private companies and academic institutions.",About Sufficiency
"The dynamics of tenure security, agricultural production and environmental degradation in Africa: Evidence from stakeholders in north-east Ghana","Many authors have blamed African land tenure systems for the poor agricultural production and environmental degradation in Africa, and therefore the resulting hunger, environmental refugees and the lack of socio-economic progress. The aim of this paper was to investigate the role of tenure security in north-east Ghana and the implications for agricultural production and environmental sustainability. The research used a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods including interviews, focus group discussions and questionnaires to collect and analyse data from stakeholders in two selected districts in north-east Ghana The study revealed that contrary to the mainstream view that lack of security of customary land tenure is the main cause of the poor agricultural production and environmental degradation, stakeholders' perceptions of their security of tenure was generally high. Yet poor agricultural production and environmental degradation characterised the study area. Interviewees perceived the main causes to be due to non-tenurial factors including lack of finance, poor soil fertility, inadequate and unreliable rainfall, pests and diseases, inadequate farmlands, bush burning and excessive tree cutting. It was also shown in the study that women and strangers (i.e. non-community members) generally had little or no power and control over land use decision-making and management under customary land tenure. These findings have negative implications for tenure security and environmental sustainability in north-east Ghana, since most women are involved in food production. The paper concludes that current policy focus on enhancing tenure security may fail to lead to increased agricultural production and environmental sustainability if similar focus is denied the above non-tenurial factors. Tenure security is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for improvement in agricultural production and environmental management in north-east Ghana. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Building an effective coalition to improve forest policy: Lessons from the coastal Tripa peat swamp rainforest, Sumatra, Indonesia","In recent history, Indonesian forest policies have been dominated by deforestation in the name of economic progress. Many actors have expressed concerns about this trend and have tried to reverse it in favour of a more sustainable pathway. From 2004-2017, non-governmental environmental organisations fought for the case of the coastal Tripa peat swamp rainforest in the province of Aceh, Sumatra. Unique in Indonesian history, they managed halting and reversing the deforestation of an area. Their sustained action led the Indonesia state to cancel an oil palm plantation permit, with the plantation managers and owners facing heavy fines and prison terms. Our research seeks to understand the enabling factors making this success story possible. We used the Advocacy Coalition Framework for its capacity to deal with a complicated policymaking ecosystem whose decisions takes years for implementation. Our analysis found four enabling conditions of success, which were the NGOs capacity to: 1) sustain action for over a decade and grasp four changing events (post-tsunami reconstruction, emerging connection between forests and climate change, governors' change, and use of digital technologies); 2) learn from own past failures marked by the evolution of their policy core beliefs, from 'conserving forest for biodiversity' to 'conserving forest for local livelihoods', and then to 'conserving forest to prevent climate change'. As a result, they could broaden their advocacy coalition, which grew to include diverse social actors from local to international levels, including the central state's REDD + Task Force; 3) take an advantage over economic power by acting strategically and timely when changes occurred; and 4) closely monitor and disseminate knowledge (fire events, deforestation trends and peat depth), supporting a simple causal deforestation model which allowed a high degree of policy oriented learning, helping the coalition to change its behaviour and act strategically. To sum up, the overall trend of rainforest destruction for agricultural extension in Southeast Asia, particularly in Sumatra, Indonesia, can be reversed, at least at the local level. Cautious not to overgeneralise, the Tripa case indicates that NGOs could improve forest governance by engaging in the long term, acting strategically, and building a broad socio-ecological and rights-based coalition.",About Sufficiency
Building climate-resilient food systems in sri lanka through site-specific agricultural management,"Agriculture has both witnessed and caused climate change. Therefore, building climate resilience in the food production system is mandatory. Currently in Sri Lanka, recommended climate-smart agricultural practices recommend a common package to the entire country. However, considering the diversity that occurs across the country in every social, and ecological aspect it is essential to understand the cultural, ecological, and socioeconomic conditions of the country to determine more efficient agricultural practices to improve the resilience of the agricultural systems in a particular region. To achieve this objective, numerous traditional methods can be employed in modern farming strategies in order to make it more nature-friendly. Therefore, this literature review was developed to provide insights for the development of an evidence-based framework to enhance the climate resilience of Sri Lanka's agricultural systems. In that aspect, 36 scientific communications were considered over 13 years, using articles from the Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases (2010-2023). In addition, 4 country papers, and publications from the UN, ADB, FAO, and IPCC were cited. In this literature review article, the relationship between agriculture and climate change was identified. Then, the climate-resilient ability of traditional agriculture and its location specificity were reviewed. The status of climate resilience in the existing food system was analyzed considering the Batticaloa farming system as a case study. Finally, an appropriate location-specific framework was suggested to build climate resilience by integrating traditional farming techniques into modern agriculture. As per the results, rainwater harvesting strategies as cascade village tank system, management of limited water through practices as shared cultivation (Bethma govithena), shared responsibility (Pangukariya) for the maintenance of village tanks, dry seed paddy farming (Kekulam govithena), maintaining agro-biodiversity via, mixed cropping, agro-forestry, use of resistant crop varieties are the key Sri Lankan traditional agricultural practices which can be adapted to build the system resilience. These practices are developed based on the specific cultural, ecological, and socio-economic conditions of each region of the country. However, the establishment of micro-irrigation systems, utilizing early warning systems, development of high-yielding resistant crop varieties, crop-livestock integration, and cultivation of location-specific crop varieties are the main modern agricultural practices recommended to build up the climate resilience of the food systems. However, many of these recommended practices were exercised during the traditional agricultural systems as well. There are many other specific practices available that can be applied with modification even for present-day agriculture to enhance its climate resilience. Integrating the knowledge from traditional agriculture into modern agricultural practices will directly facilitate the achievement of three sustainable development goals of climate action, zero hunger, and no poverty through the development of regional-specific sustainable agricultural practices that restore the resilience of agriculture. Therefore, this literature review article proposes a framework for managing location-specific climate-resilient food systems on par with the regional agroecological and socioeconomic conditions of Sri Lanka.",About Sufficiency

"Cost-effectiveness of reducing emissions from tropical deforestation, 2016-2050","Reducing tropical deforestation is potentially a large-scale and low-cost strategy for mitigating climate change. Yet previous efforts to project the cost-effectiveness of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from future deforestation across the tropics were hampered by crude available data on historical forest loss. Here we use recently available satellite-based maps of annual forest loss between 2001-2012, along with information on topography, accessibility, protected status, potential agricultural revenue, and an observed inverted-U-shaped relationship between forest cover loss and forest cover, to project tropical deforestation from 2016-2050 under alternative policy scenarios and to construct new marginal abatement cost curves for reducing emissions from tropical deforestation. We project that without new forest conservation policies 289 million hectares of tropical forest will be cleared from 2016-2050, releasing 169 GtCO(2). A carbon price of US$20/tCO(2) ($50/tCO(2)) across tropical countries would avoid 41 GtCO(2) (77 GtCO(2)) from 2016-2050. By comparison, we estimate that Brazil's restrictive policies in the Amazon between 2004-2012 successfully decoupled potential agricultural revenue from deforestation and reduced deforestation by 47% below what would have otherwise occurred, preventing the emission of 5.2 GtCO(2). All tropical countries enacting restrictive anti-deforestation policies as effective as those in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004-2012 would avoid 58 GtCO(2) from 2016-2050.",About Sufficiency
"Using InVEST to assess ecosystem services on conserved properties in Sonoma County, CAYY","Purchases of private land for conservation are common in California and represent an alternative to regulatory land-use policies for constraining land use. The retention or enhancement of ecosystem services may be a benefit of land conservation, but that has been difficult to document. The InVEST toolset provides a practical, low-cost approach to quantifying ecosystem services. Using the toolset, we investigated the provision of ecosystem services in Sonoma County, California, and addressed three related questions. First, do lands protected by the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District (a publicly funded land conservation program) have higher values for four ecosystem services - carbon storage, sediment retention, nutrient retention and water yield - than other properties? Second, how do the correlations among these services differ across protected versus non-protected properties? Third, what are the strengths and weaknesses of using the InVEST toolset to quantify ecosystem services at the county scale? We found that District lands have higher service values for carbon storage, sediment retention and water yield than adjacent properties and properties that have been developed to more intensive uses in the last 10 years. Correlations among the ecosystem services differed greatly across land-use categories, and these differences were driven by a combination of soil, slope and land use. While InVEST provided a low-cost, clearly documented way to evaluate ecosystem services at the county scale, there is no ready way to validate the results.",About Sufficiency
Food Insecurity and Experiences of Discrimination Among Caregivers of Hospitalized Children,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Pediatric hospitals are adopting strategies to address food insecurity (FI), a stigmatizing condition, among families with children. We hypothesized that parents and other caregivers (""caregivers"") from households with FI or marginal food security (MFS) are more likely to experience discrimination during their child's hospitalization.METHODS We analyzed data from 319 caregivers of children admitted to an urban, academic children's hospital and randomly assigned to the control arm of the double-blind randomized controlled CommunityRx-Hunger trial (November 2020 to June 2022, NCT R01MD012630). Household food security in the 30 days before admission and discrimination during hospitalization were measured with the US Household Food Security Survey and the Discrimination in Medical Settings Scale, respectively. We used logistic regression to model the relationship between food security status and discrimination, adjusting for gender, race, ethnicity, income, and partner status.RESULTS Most participants were African American or Black (81.5%), female (94.7%), and the parent of the hospitalized child (93.7%). FI and MFS were prevalent (25.1% and 15.1%, respectively). Experiences of discrimination during a child's hospitalization were prevalent (51.9%). Caregivers with FI had higher odds than caregivers with food security of experiencing discrimination (adjusted odds ratio = 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.1-3.6, P = .03); MFS was not significantly associated with discrimination (P = .25). Compared with food secure caregivers, those with FI had higher odds of 5 of 7 experiences of discrimination assessed.CONCLUSIONS Among parents and other caregivers, household FI is associated with experiences of discrimination during a child's hospitalization.",About Sufficiency
Carbon sequestration of Chinese forests from 2010 to 2060 spatiotemporal dynamics and its regulatory strategies,"Forestation is important for sequestering atmospheric carbon, and it is a cost-effective and nature-based solution (NBS) for mitigating global climate change.

After 2035, effective tending management is required to maintain the high CSR level, such as selective cutting, thinning, and approximate disturbance. However, new forestation from 2015 in the potential plantable lands would play a minimal role in additional CSR increases. In China, the CSR is generally higher in the Northeast, Southwest, and Central-South, and lower in the Northwest. Considering the potential losses through deforestation and logging, it is realistically estimated that CSR in Chinese forests would remain in the range of 0.161-0.358 Pg C a-1 from 2010 to 2060. Overall, forests have the potential to offset 14.1% of the national anthropogenic carbon emissions in China over the period of 2010-2060, significantly contributing to the carbon neutrality target of 2060 with the implementation of effective management strategies for existing forests and expansion of forestation.

Calculation of Ecological Compensation Standards for Arable Land Based on the Value Flow of Support Services,"Food production is the basis for ensuring human survival. Ecological compensation for arable land is important to ensure the sustainable use of arable land and food production. However, how is it possible to set the standard of ecological compensation and how to achieve it scientifically? In this paper, we take China as the study area and link the ecological compensation of arable land with the production, circulation and consumption of three staple foods. The amount of food is converted into the area of arable land needed to produce that food. After calculating the value of ecosystem services that support food production on arable land, the ecological compensation standard is obtained, and the realization mode between regions is constructed. The results show that: (1) the flow of staple foods in China is mainly from north to south and the value of arable land support services provided by northern provinces is greater than that of southern provinces; (2) the province that needs to pay the most ecological compensation for cultivated land is Guangdong Province, with an amount of yen 16.082 billion RMB, and the province that receives the most compensation is Heilongjiang Province, with an amount of yen 21.547 billion RMB; (3) in order to coordinate the collection and distribution of ecological compensation in each province, it is necessary to establish an ecological compensation fund for arable land in the central government. Protecting the ecological status of arable land and ensuring sustainable food production is in the overall interest of the country.",About Sufficiency
Can digital solutions transform agri-food systems in Africa?,"Digital agriculture solutions hold a promise to build agri-food food systems that are more efficient, environmentally sustainable, and inclusive, thereby contributing to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. In most African countries, the rapid adoption of mobile phones and other digital tools have accelerated the deployment of agricultural services for farmers and other value chain actors resulting in enhanced access to information, knowledge, financial services, markets, and farm tools. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity to fast-track the deployment of contact-free digital solutions along the agri-food value chains. Despite the numerous opportunities presented by the digital agricultural revolution, its potential to transform agri-food systems in Africa remains uncertain. With a broad perspective on Africa, this paper explores the emerging evidence on digital agricultural services including key drivers, evidence on impact, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper concludes with some implications for policy makers and professionals in agricultural economics.",About Sufficiency
Can supply chain laws prevent deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Indonesia?,"There is a new trend toward public supply chain-related laws which demand information from companies on imported products. The European Union's (EU) Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and Timber Regulation (EUTR) exemplify this new type of law. In both cases, companies have to prevent deforestation in their supply chains. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Indonesia, both among those countries with the world's highest deforestation rates, support supply chain laws on paper, but there are serious implementation deficits in practice. Using a tripartite framework developed by Cashore and Stone, our study addresses this alleged contradiction and explains deficits inherent in the laws based on the analysis of policy documents, expert in-terviews and field research. We find that companies take advantage of opportunities to shift exports to less regulating countries. EU member states exercise their purchasing power too cautiously over intermediary (manufacturing) countries in the supply chain, especially China. Finally, despite possibilities of public action, sanctioning is largely left to the private sector.",About Sufficiency
Can water rights trading pilot policy ensure food security in China? Based on the difference-in-differences method,"Ensuring food security in China is the primary task in solving the problems of 'agriculture, countryside, and farmers'. Based on Chinese provincial panel data from 2009 to 2018, this paper evaluates the impact of a water rights trading pilot policy (WRTPP) on food security and examines its underlying mechanism. To overcome the estimation bias existing in previous studies, we use the difference-in-differences method, which can separate time effects from policy treatment effects and is an effective tool to compare the effect before and after policy implementation. We, therefore, use this method to evaluate the net effect of the WRTPP on food security. It is found that the WRTPP can help ensure food security. This effect reaches its maximum in the fourth year after the policy's implementation. It is further found that the WRTPP can improve the adoption of agricultural water-saving irrigation technology to increase the grain yield. Our conclusions complement existing evidence on the factors influencing food security. From the perspective of improving farmers' water-saving irrigation technology, we confirm that the mechanism of the water right trading pilot policy helps ensure food security.",About Sufficiency
Exploring ecosystem carbon storage change and scenario simulation in the Qiantang River source region of China,"To explore the impact of land-use change on carbon storage, this study coupled the InVEST model and the FLUS model to analyse the spatial and temporal characteristics of carbon storage in the Qiantang River source region from 2000 to 2030. The carbon storage in the study area is evaluated which declined rapidly from 166.22 x 10(6) t in 2000 to 164.41 x 10(6) t in 2020, and the spatial distribution of carbon storage could be characterized by ""the northwest and the southwest of region with higher, the east and the centre of the region with lower"". The carbon storage was simulated based on the historical trend development scenario, the food security scenario, and the ecological protection scenario. The carbon storage with the food security scenario could achieve 162.74 x 10(6) t in 2030. The carbon storage with the ecological protection scenario had an increase of 62.60 t/km(2) compared to the historical natural tendency development. Interestingly, the food security scenario had the smallest carbon loss value which is about $1.39 x 10(9), and its net carbon storage value was the largest which is about $3.71 x 10(9). The results of this study could provide a scientific reference for the conservation of carbon storage and land use management for climate change and sustainable development.

Improving the Yield and Nutritional Quality of Forage Crops,"Despite being some of the most important crops globally, there has been limited research on forages when compared with cereals, fruits, and vegetables. This review summarizes the literature highlighting the significance of forage crops, the current improvements and some of future directions for improving yield and nutritional quality. We make the point that the knowledge obtained from model plant and grain crops can be applied to forage crops. The timely development of genomics and bioinformatics together with genome editing techniques offer great scope to improve forage crops. Given the social, environmental and economic importance of forage across the globe and especially in poorer countries, this opportunity has enormous potential to improve food security and political stability.",About Sufficiency
Carbon emissions reductions from Indonesia's moratorium on forest concessions are cost-effective yet contribute little to Paris pledges,"International initiatives for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) could make critical, cost-effective contributions to tropical countries' nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Norway, a key donor of such initiatives, had a REDD+ partnership with Indonesia, offering results-based payments in exchange for emissions reductions calculated against a historical baseline. Central to this partnership was an area-based moratorium on new oil palm, timber, and logging concessions in primary and peatland forests. We evaluate the effectiveness of the moratorium between 2011 and 2018 by applying a matched triple difference strategy to a unique panel dataset. Treated dryland forest inside moratorium areas retained, at most, an average of 0.65% higher forest cover compared to untreated dryland forest outside the moratorium. By contrast, carbon-rich peatland forest was unaffected by the moratorium. Cumulative avoided dryland deforestation from 2011 until 2018 translates into 67.8 million to 86.9 million tons of emissions reductions, implying an effective carbon price below Norway's US$5 per ton price. Based on Norway's price, our estimated cumulative emissions reductions are equivalent to a payment of US$339 million to US$434.5 million. Annually, our estimates suggest a 3 to 4% contribution to Indonesia's NDC commitment of a 29% emissions reduction by 2030. Despite the Indonesia-Norway partnership ending in 2021, reducing emissions from deforestation remains critical for meeting this commitment. Future area-based REDD+ initiatives could build on the moratorium's outcomes by reforming its incentives and institutional arrangements, particularly in peatland forest areas.",About Sufficiency
Carbon implications of forest restitution in post-socialist Romania,"The collapse of socialism in 1989 triggered a phase of institutional restructuring in Central and Eastern Europe. Several countries chose to privatize forests or to return them to pre-socialist owners. Here, we assess the implications of forest restitution on the terrestrial carbon balance. New forest owners have strong incentives to immediately clearcut their forests, resulting in increased terrestrial emissions. On the other hand, logging generally decreased after 1989 and forests are expanding on unused or abandoned farmland, both of which may offset increased logging on restituted forests. We mapped changes in forest cover for the entire country of Romania using Landsat satellite images from 1990 to 2010. We use our satellite estimates, together with historic data on logging rates and changes in forest cover, to parameterize a carbon book-keeping model for estimating the terrestrial carbon flux (above and below ground) as a consequence of land use change and forest harvest. High logging rates during socialism resulted in substantial terrestrial carbon emissions and Romania was a net carbon source until the 1980s. After the collapse of the Soviet Union forest harvest rates decreased dramatically, but since restitution laws were implemented they have increased by 60% (from 15 122 +/- 5397 ha y(-1) in 2000 to 23 884 +/- 11 510 ha y(-1) in 2010), but still remain lower than prior to 1989. Romania currently remains a terrestrial carbon sink, offsetting 7.6% +/- 2.5% of anthropogenic carbon emissions. A further increase in logging could result in net emissions from terrestrial ecosystems during the coming decades. However, forest expansion on degraded land and abandoned farmland offers great potential for carbon sequestration.",About Sufficiency
Carbon nanotubes impact on date palm in vitro cultures,"Among the recent line of technological innovations, nanotechnology takes a promising position in agriculture and food production. Nanotechnology permits definite advances in agricultural research, such as reproductive science and technology. This investigation is interested in studying the in vitro effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on callus, embryogenesis, embryo germination and elongation as well as rooting stage of date palm. Carbon nanotubes concentrations were investigated as 0.0, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/l. Results showed that CNTs affect all stages of micropropagation of date palm. Callus fresh weight showed the optimum value at 0.05 mg/l. In embryogenesis stage, CNTs decreased the number of embryos compared with the control while, increased number of germinated embryos and root number. Carbon nanotubes gave a significant enhancement for shoot length and leaf number in elongation stage. Similarly, it enhanced root number, root length, plantlet length and hairy roots.

Carbon sequestration potential in perennial bioenergy crops: the importance of organic matter inputs and its physical protection,"To date, only few studies have compared the soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential between perennial woody and herbaceous crops. The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of perennial woody (poplar, black locust, willow) and herbaceous (giant reed, miscanthus, switchgrass) crops on SOC stock and its stabilization level after 6years from plantation on an arable field. Seven SOC fractions related to different soil stabilization mechanisms were isolated by a combination of physical and chemical fractionation methods: unprotected (cPOM and fPOM), physically protected (iPOM), physically and chemically protected (HC-mu s+c), chemically protected (HC-ds+c), and biochemically protected (NHC-ds+c and NHC-mu s+c). The continuous C input to the soil and the minimal soil disturbance increased SOC stocks in the top 10cm of soil, but not in deeper soil layers (10-30; 30-60; and 60-100cm). In the top soil layer, greater SOC accumulation rates were observed under woody species (105 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than under herbaceous ones (71 g m(-2) yr(-1)) presumably due to a higher C input from leaf-litter. The conversion from an arable maize monoculture to perennial bioenergy crops increased the organic C associated to the most labile organic matter (POM) fractions, which accounted for 38% of the total SOC stock across bioenergy crops, while no significant increments were observed in more recalcitrant (silt- and clay-sized) fractions, highlighting that the POM fractions were the most prone to land-use change. The iPOM fraction increased under all perennial bioenergy species compared to the arable field. In addition, the iPOM was higher under woody crops than under herbaceous ones because of the additional C inputs from leaf-litter that occurred in the former. Conversion from arable cropping systems to perennial bioenergy crops can effectively increase the SOC stock and enlarge the SOC fraction that is physically protected within soil microaggregates.",About Sufficiency
Carbon sequestration effects of agricultural high-quality development: evidence from China's high-standard farmland construction,"Based on the perspective of carbon sequestration, this paper selects county-level panel data from China from 2000 to 2017 and uses a Difference-in-Differences (DID) Model to examine the impact of the high-standard basic farmland construction (HSFC) on the enhancement of regional carbon sequestration capacity. The results indicate that the HSFC policy enhances the carbon sequestration capacity in the respective areas. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that counties with more significant promotion and implementation of HSFC exhibit substantially better local carbon sequestration capacity compared to those that were early pilot areas. Non-grain-producing counties with smaller agricultural production scales exhibit better carbon sequestration effects when implementing the HSFC policy compared to grain-producing counties. HSFC also shows varying carbon sequestration effects in different regions of cropping systems. Further analysis reveals that the improvement in agricultural mechanization and the reduction in fertilizer application can effectively enhance the carbon sequestration effects of the HSFC policy. Moreover, HSFC has significant policy spillover effects that can enhance agricultural carbon sequestration levels in neighboring regions.",About Sufficiency

Soil health: looking for suitable indicators. What should be considered to assess the effects of use and management on soil health?,"Soil Health refers to the ecological equilibrium and the functionality of a soil and its capacity to maintain a well balanced ecosystem with high biodiversity above and below surface, and productivity. To understand and use soil health as a tool for sustainability, physical, chemical, and biological properties must be employed to verify which respond to the soil use and management within a desired timescale. Attributes with a rapid response to natural or anthropogenic actions are considered good indicators of soil health. Among the physical indicators, soil texture, aggregation, moisture, porosity, and bulk density have been used, while among chemical indicators total C and N, mineral nutrients, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, among others are well established. However, most of them generally have a slow response, when compared to the biological ones, such as microbial biomass C and N, biodiversity, soil enzymes, soil respiration, etc., in addition to macro and mesofauna. Thus, a systemic approach based on different kinds of indicators (physical,. chemical and biological) in assessing soil health would be safer than using only one kind of attribute. Many human activities have caused desertification, loss of biodiversity, disruption of aggregates, loss of organic matter and nutrients, among others. Today, it is imperious to maintain soil health and productivity with increasing emphasis on reforestation and recuperation of degraded areas through the use of organic amendments, reintroduction of plants, soil fauna and microorganisms. This review focused on an integrative view on indicators of soil health to be used as tools for prediction of sustainability in production systems.",About Sufficiency
Cascading social-ecological benefits of biodiversity for agriculture,"Cultivated species diversity can provide numerous benefits to agricultural systems. Many ecological theories have been proposed to understand the relationships between plant species diversity and trophic interactions. However, extending such theories to socioeconomic systems has been rare for agriculture. Here, we establish ten hypotheses (e.g., the natural enemy hypothesis, resource concentration hypothesis, insurance hypothesis, and aggregation hypothesis) about the relationships between cultivated species diversity (i.e., crop diversification, co-cultures of crops and domestic animals, and co-cultures of crops and edible fungi) and trophic cascades of crops, invertebrate herbivores and natural enemies in cropping systems. We then explore the socioeconomic advantages (e.g., yield, economic and environmental performance) of these trophic cascades. Finally, we propose a multi-perspective framework to promote the cascading social-ecological benefits of species diversity for agricultural sustainability. Integrating the benefits of trophic cascades into agricultural socioeconomic systems requires policies and legislation that support multi-species co-culture practices and the willingness of consumers to pay for these practices through higher prices for agricultural products.",About Sufficiency

Model-based evaluation in terms of weed management and overall sustainability of cropping systems designed with three different approaches,"CONTEXT: For arable crops, weeds are the most harmful pests among those targeted by pesticides. They are also crucial sources of plant biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, and host and feed wild fauna. As there is, to date, no curative weed control method as effective as herbicides, reducing herbicide use while limiting the damage to crop production requires combining many partially-efficient cultural practices at the cropping-system scale.OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to (1) compare the performances and applicability of cropping systems obtained with three contrasting design approaches, aiming at reducing weed harmfulness for crop production and her-bicide use, (2) identify the technical determinants of a more sustainable weed management. The design ap-proaches were: (1) de novo design by diverse experts working in five regions, (2) step-by-step improvement of a series of farmers' cropping systems from a single production context over several years; (3) farmer-centred design of one current cropping system by one group of farmers with weed issues, helped with a board game (Mission Ecophyt'eau (R)) and a decision-support system to evaluate weed impacts (DECIFLORSYS).METHODS: We assessed (1) weed impacts on crop production and biodiversity by simulating current and innovative cropping systems with the FLORSYS model over 30 years and with 10 weather scenarios, (2) sustain -ability by scoring the economic, social and environmental performances of all systems with the multicriteria evaluation tool DEXiPM. To account for production context, we assessed the differences in indicator values between innovative and current cropping systems (""trajectories""). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The trajectories showed no trade-off between weed harmfulness for crop pro-duction and herbicide use intensity. Reduced herbicide use (-1.0 Treatment Frequency Index) was compensated by combining alternative levers targeting weed prevention, particularly crop diversification (+ 3 to 5 new crops on average) and tillage. Changes in weed impacts were greater with expert design than with the two farmer -design approaches. However, social sustainability from farmers' perspective mostly decreased with expert design (6 trajectories out of 9). Moreover, the best trajectories for reconciling low weed harmfulness and low herbicide use with higher sustainability were obtained by farmers after 10 years of step-by-step design (2 tra-jectories out of 30). SIGNIFICANCE: The use of models, board games and decision-support systems in the two farmers' groups showed that bringing new knowledge in different ways is essential to actually change cropping systems. Implicating farmers early in the design process also improved the likelihood to adopt the designed cropping system.",About Sufficiency

Challenges and opportunities for wheat alternative grains in breadmaking: Ex-situ- versus in-situ-produced dextran,"Background: The use of grains as an alternative to wheat in breadmaking has rapidly grown in the last few years, driven by the Sustainable Development Goals toward improving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture. Flours from legumes, pseudo-cereals, minor cereals and milling by-products, such as bran, are of particular interest. The production of partially substituted or wheat-free bread is, however, a challenging task in terms of texture and flavour attributes. Scope and approach: The present review covers recent advances in the application of dextrans in improving dough rheology, baking performance and bread flavour characteristics. Emphasis has been given to in situ application of dextran via sourdough technology as a 'clean label' alternative to commercial hydrocolloid additives. Key findings and conclusions: In-situ dextran production leads to bread with higher specific volume, softer crumbs and increased moisture content. Dextran also provides an anti-staling effect attributable to its ability to reduce water mobility and retard starch retrogradation. A structure-function relationship has suggested that dextran with high molecular weight and less branching is superior in enhancing bread quality. Furthermore, mild acidification favours the functionality of dextran in dough and bread systems, while intensive acidification results in adverse effects. Lactic acid bacterial strains belonging to the genus Weissella exhibiting mild acidification are therefore appreciated in regard to the utilisation of in-situ produced dextran. This review highlights the novel application of dextran as a flavour masking agent to minimise off-flavours (e.g. beany flavour, bitter taste, and aftertaste) originating from non-wheat grains, consequently improving the acceptability of the final products.",About Sufficiency
Changes in Income Structure in Frontier Villages and Implications for REDD plus Benefit Sharing,"A methodological characteristic of the REDD+ scheme is that it attempts to reduce deforestation by rewarding communities that change problematic land use practices. This has led to discussions on benefit sharing. This article focuses on incentives for alternative land use practices among village members living in frontier areas, especially in relation to support for sustainable land use and people's livelihoods, and clarifies the issues that REDD+ projects are likely to face in this context. Although some documents regarding REDD+ projects have mentioned support to encourage such incentives, insufficient consideration has been given to the realities of the changes in frontier communities. REDD+ projects are unlikely to motivate members to embrace alternative land use practices if support or benefit sharing does not match members' expectations. Here, we examine the changes in household (HH) income and structure, as well as in livelihood activities, experienced by Cambodian frontier villagers living at the site of a planned REDD+ project. During the nine years compared in this study, the frontier villages experienced broad and imbalanced changes in HH income owing to the rapid expansion of the cultivation of cash crops. Our results indicate that benefit sharing or support inevitably becomes more difficult and challenging in frontier areas than in areas where subsistence production systems still predominate, although such frontiers could, in theory, yield maximum returns with regard to forest carbon balance if the REDD+ projects addressed benefit sharing and support and came to fruition.",About Sufficiency
Characterizing Forest Change Using Community-Based Monitoring Data and Landsat Time Series,"Increasing awareness of the issue of deforestation and degradation in the tropics has resulted in efforts to monitor forest resources in tropical countries. Advances in satellite-based remote sensing and ground-based technologies have allowed for monitoring of forests with high spatial, temporal and thematic detail. Despite these advances, there is a need to engage communities in monitoring activities and include these stakeholders in national forest monitoring systems. In this study, we analyzed activity data (deforestation and forest degradation) collected by local forest experts over a 3-year period in an Afromontane forest area in southwestern Ethiopia and corresponding Landsat Time Series (LTS). Local expert data included forest change attributes, geo-location and photo evidence recorded using mobile phones with integrated GPS and photo capabilities. We also assembled LTS using all available data from all spectral bands and a suite of additional indices and temporal metrics based on time series trajectory analysis. We predicted deforestation, degradation or stable forests using random forest models trained with data from local experts and LTS spectral-temporal metrics as model covariates. Resulting models predicted deforestation and degradation with an out of bag (OOB) error estimate of 29% overall, and 26% and 31% for the deforestation and degradation classes, respectively. By dividing the local expert data into training and operational phases corresponding to local monitoring activities, we found that forest change models improved as more local expert data were used. Finally, we produced maps of deforestation and degradation using the most important spectral bands. The results in this study represent some of the first to combine local expert based forest change data and dense LTS, demonstrating the complementary value of both continuous data streams. Our results underpin the utility of both datasets and provide a useful foundation for integrated forest monitoring systems relying on data streams from diverse sources.",About Sufficiency

Systemic Signaling: A Role in Propelling Crop Yield,"Food security has become a topic of great concern in many countries. Global food security depends heavily on agriculture that has access to proper resources and best practices to generate higher crop yields. Crops, as with other plants, have a variety of strategies to adapt their growth to external environments and internal needs. In plants, the distal organs are interconnected through the vascular system and intricate hierarchical signaling networks, to communicate and enhance survival within fluctuating environments. Photosynthesis and carbon allocation are fundamental to crop production and agricultural outputs. Despite tremendous progress achieved by analyzing local responses to environmental cues, and bioengineering of critical enzymatic processes, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms underlying carbon assimilation, allocation, and utilization. This review provides insights into vascular-based systemic regulation of photosynthesis and resource allocation, thereby opening the way for the engineering of source and sink activities to optimize the yield performance of major crops.",About Sufficiency
"The effects of feeding cut plantain and perennial ryegrass-white clover pasture on dairy heifer feed and water intake, apparent nutrient digestibility and nitrogen excretion in urine","Urinary nitrogen concentration (UNcc) and urinary N excretion (UN) are directly associated with the nitrogen (N) leaching potential of soil and greenhouse gas emissions from grazing ruminants' urine patches. This study was carried out to examine the effects of feeding cut plantain (PL) and perennial ryegrass-white clover pasture (PW) on dairy heifer feed and water intake, apparent nutrient digestibility and N excretion in urine. Twelve Jersey-Friesian heifers aged 9-10 months with an average body weight of 200 +/- 18.8 kg (mean +/- standard deviation (SD)) and breeding worth of NZ$162 +/- 16.9 (mean +/- SD) were randomly allocated to one of two treatments (six heifers per treatment): PW and PL. No difference was observed in dry matter intake (P = 0.117) and N intake (P = 0.370) between PW- and PL-fed heifers. The dry matter digestibility and digestible organic matter in the dry matter were similar between PL- and PW-fed heifers (P > 0.05). Heifers consuming PL had lower UNcc and UN than those consuming PW (P < 0.01). Estimated urine volume and total water intake were higher for PL-fed heifers than those fed PW (P < 0.01). Further, in comparison with PW-fed heifers, PL-fed heifers had lower plasma urea N (P < 0.001) and tended to have lower plasma delta N-15 feed delta N-15 (P = 0.086). The findings suggest that feeding FL to dairy heifers may reduce UNcc and UN in comparison with those on conventional pastures; therefore it provides an opportunity to mitigate on-farm N pollution.",About Sufficiency
Diagnosing cropland's allowable range and spatial allocation in China's typical mountainous plateau area: An evaluation framework based on ecological carrying capacity,"Natural capital serves as a major constraint that affects the sustainable development of mountainous plateau areas. Determining ecological carrying capacity (ECC), as the key to measuring the critical natural capital of cropland, is needed for sustainable development. This study aims to provide new insights into ECC by diagnosing whether human activities are within the allowable range of natural capital and whether the spatial allocation of natural capital is reasonable in such specific areas. Taking Yunnan Province, China as the study area, we proposed an improved Ecological Footprint (EF) model to evaluate cropland's ecological capacity (CEC), and then, a framework of balance evaluation and spatial optimal allocation was constructed to examine the cropland's allowable range and optimize its spatial allocation if found unreasonable. Results show the following. (1) The per capita CEC of Yunnan Province between 2009 and 2016 decreased from 0.103 ha/capita to 0.095 ha/capita, and the cropland ecological balance index (EBI) presented a ""critical overload"" state ranging from 0.433 to 0.463, at which the supply exceeded the demand. Hence, the cropland was not within the allowable range in terms of supply-demand balance. (2) The comprehensive Gini coefficient of CEC was 0.462-0.515, and the gravity center of ca . deviated from the geometric center and shifted toward the westward, thereby, at is neither balanced in terms of spatial allocation nor coordinated with the population, economy, and resource environment. (3) The spatial allocation pattern of the study area was grouped into five zones on the basis of the optimization model. These zones are key optimization zone, adjustment optimization zone, maintenance zone, reasonable reduction zone, and key reduction zone. Accordingly, the targeted and differentiated strategies were accordingly put forward. Our study can contribute to identifying the practical approach to sustainable ecosystem management in mountainous plateau areas from the perspective of ECC and are beneficial for decision-making as regards new policies on cropland protection and Chinese ecological civilization construction.

Strip-Till Farming: Combining Controlled-Release Blended Fertilizer to Enhance Rainfed Maize Yield While Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"The two major concerns of sustainable agriculture are safeguarding food security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Studies on the performance of strip-till with controlled-release blended fertilizer on rainfed maize grain yield, greenhouse gas emissions, and net ecosystem economic budget are scarce in the hilly region of northeast China. In this study, the differences between strip-till (RST) and conventional ridge cropping (CP), straw off-field no-tillage (NT), and no-tillage with straw mulching (RNT) were comparatively investigated in the conventional fertilizer (Sd) mode. And meanwhile, four fertilization modes were also set up under strip-till (RST): conventional fertilization (Sd), controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer blended with normal urea 3:7 (30%Cr), controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer blended with normal urea 5:5 (50%Cr), and no-nitrogen fertilization. We analyzed maize yield, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), net income and net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) for different treatments. The results showed that, under conventional fertilizer (Sd) mode, the maize yield of RST increased by 4.2%, 6.0% and 7.2% compared with NT, CP and RNT and the net income increased by 7.0%, 9.7% and 10.0%, respectively. Compared with CP and NT, although RST increased CO2 and N2O emissions, the GHGI of RST was not significantly different from CP and NT, and was 8.0% lower than that of RNT. The NEEB of RST increased by 6.8%, 9.7% and 11.0%, respectively, compared with NT, CP and RNT. Under strip-till, compared with 30%Cr and Sd, the yield of 50%Cr increased by 4.0% and 9.2% and the net income increased by 3.5% and 6.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference in GHGI between 50%Cr and 30%Cr, and 50%Cr decreased by 10.4% compared with Sd. The NEEB of 50%Cr increased by 3.8% and 7.4% compared to 30%Cr and Sd. Strip-till combines controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer blended with normal urea 5:5 (50%Cr) and can be applied as a sustainable strategy to improve the economic efficiency of maize and reduce environmental costs in the hilly region of northeast China.",About Sufficiency
THE MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES IMPACTS ON DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF FOOD SECURITY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,"Food security is one of the main conditions for the realization of national security and one of the pillars of economic development. This is especially important in developing countries that do not have adequate food security. Thus, the aim of this study is the mathematical analysis of the impact of macroeconomic variables on food security and its sub-indicators (access to food, economic ability to buy food, and food health) in 64 developing countries. For this purpose, the panel data approach and data of developing countries during the period 1996-2016 have been used. The results showed that GDPs of countries have a positive effect on food security so that all the three dimensions of food security improve with increasing income. Rising prices will reduce food security by reducing access to food and reducing purchasing power. Increase in the value-added agricultural sector by improving access to food improves food security and increase in urbanization in different dimensions has different effects on food security which ultimately reduces food security.",About Sufficiency
"A meta-analysis of yields and environmental performance of controlled-environment production systems for tomatoes, lettuce and strawberries","This study compares four selected environmental performance indicators for controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) and conventional production systems for tomatoes, strawberries, and lettuce. Data were obtained from 91 publications on life cycle inventory (LCI) and life cycle analysis (LCA) of open field, plasticulture, greenhouse, and vertical farm systems. We analyzed articles published from January 2000 to January 2023 that reported yields per land area, cumulative energy per functional unit (FU), global warming potential (GWP) per FU, and water use per FU for production systems of interest. We employed log-linear regressions for these four performance indicators and controlled for production system, organic production, and inclusion of post-farm gate impacts. The statistical analyses indicate that CEA production (greenhouse and vertical farms) have significantly higher yields, energy use and GWP than other production systems, although water use is significantly less. Our study suggests the need for greater homogeneity in performing LCA and reporting results. Research on the relative costs and scalability of CEA systems is less frequent yet are important to assess the contribution of these systems to food availability and access dimensions of food security.",About Sufficiency
Choice of Modern Food Distribution Channels and Its Welfare Effects: Empirical Evidence from Taiwan,"The determinants and/or economic effects of modern food distribution channels have attracted much attention in previous research. Studies on the welfare consequences of modern channel options, however, have been sparse. Based on a broader definition of modern food distribution channels including midstream processors and downstream retailers (supermarkets, hypermarkets, brand-named retailers), this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by exploring the distributional implications of farm households' choice of modern food distribution channels using a large and unique farm household dataset in Taiwan. Making use of the two-step control function approach, we identify the effect of modern food distribution options on farm households' profitability. The results reveal selling farm produce to modern food distributors does not produce a positive differential compared to the traditional outlets. Another dimension of farm household welfare affected by the choice of modern food distribution channel is income inequality. We apply the Lerman and Yitzhaki decomposition approach to gain a better understanding of the effect of the marketing channel option on the overall distribution of farm household income. The Gini decomposition of different income sources indicates that the choice of modern food distribution channels results in an inequality-equalizing effect among the farm households in Taiwan, suggesting the inclusion of smallholder farmers in the modern food distribution channels improves the overall welfare of the rural society.",About Sufficiency
Circular Innovation in the Poultry Value Chain: A Comprehensive Approach to Reducing Environmental Impacts and Fostering Corporate Social Responsibility,"In the field of CSR, the importance of transparency and ethics in poultry operations is underlined.

"Citrus Specialization or Crop Diversification: The Role of Smallholder's Subjective Risk Aversion and Case Evidence from Guangxi, China","Specialization may lead to higher income for small-scale farmers but comes with increased risks, while diversification can mitigate risks and foster agricultural sustainability. Considering the influences of complex risks and farmers' subjective risk aversion, the decision for small-scale farmers to specialize in citrus cultivation or diversify with multiple crops remains uncertain. There is currently limited understanding of this issue among citrus smallholders in rural China. This study aims to fill this empirical gap by examining the impact of smallholder farmers' subjective risk aversion on their choice between citrus monoculture and crop diversification. It utilizes a subjective risk assessment approach that incorporates farmers' risk perceptions and risk attitudes towards citrus farming. Farm crop diversification is assessed through the utilization of both the count index and Shannon index. The empirical analysis employs survey data obtained from citrus growers in Guangxi, China, and applies an instrumental variable regression method with endogeneity consideration using the IV-Probit model and 2SLS model estimation. The results reveal that both risk perceptions and risk attitudes play important roles in citrus smallholders' land allocation decisions. Specifically, citrus farmers who perceive higher risks and adopt risk-averse attitudes are statistically more inclined to engage in land use diversification practices, including the practice of growing citrus as well as other crops, which contributes to reducing the risks of citrus farming and promoting local environmental conservation. These results contribute to a better scholarly comprehension of the relationship between risk perceptions, risk attitudes, and crop diversification among small-scale citrus farmers. They provide valuable insights for enhancing the sustainability of land use systems with citrus farming while also emphasizing the importance of maintaining essential diversification in small-scale farming throughout the process of agricultural modernization.",About Sufficiency
Classical horizontal inequities in the provision of agricultural income support,"This article explores the redistributive effects of classical horizontal inequities induced by agricultural policy. Within-farm type horizontal inequity is associated with differences in the level of support received by farms of a given type and level of pre-support income. Between-farm type horizontal inequity arises from systematic differences in support levels between commodity regimes. The overall redistributive effect of such inequities in Scottish agriculture is shown to be substantial, though systematic discrimination between farm types is not the major cause. The imperfect targeting of support revealed by the empirical findings has implications for the design of policy.",About Sufficiency
Classifying and explaining Walloon dairy farms in terms of sustainable food security using a multiple criteria decision making method,"Land intensive grass-based dairy systems have the highest contribution to food security but may have a higher impact on the environment. The aim of this study was to classify dairy farms in terms of sustainable contribution to food security and analyze the farm characteristics related to these performances. To this end, we performed a sustainability assessment by calculating 17 indicators using FADN data of 209 Walloon (Belgium) dairy farms. Using the Analytical Hierarchy Process, 25 stakeholders of the Walloon milk upstream sector defined preference weights for the indicators. Farms were ranked using ELECTRE III using the mean weights for the dairy sector and grouped in four sustainability groups. A canonical discriminant analysis was performed on farm characteristics. Farm characteristics that negatively impact sustainability are the use of maize silage, the use of concentrates and the CP-content of these concentrates, the farm size, and the number of female followers per cow. The farm characteristic that positively impacts sustainability is the grassland yield. Milk production per cow, age at first calving, and calving interval have a negligible effect on sustainability. These results suggest that feed conversion efficiency is not a main driver of sustainability but rather that specific production means and practices play a more significant role in determining sustainability. Consequently, we argue that the search for efficiency that has been promoted to increase the sustainability of food systems should be placed in a systemic perspective in order to avoid trade-offs with other aspects and that, in general, an increase in efficiency is positively linked with sustainability when achieved through knowledge and technicity rather than by the addition of external inputs.",About Sufficiency
Cleaner tillage and irrigation options for food-water-energy-carbon synergism in wheat-maize cropping systems,"The conventional wheat-maize systems in the North China Plain are energy and water intensive with high carbon emissions. It is imperative to find cleaner production technologies for sustainable food-water-energycarbon synergism. Here, a three-year field experiment was performed to explore the effects of two tillage modes and four irrigation regimes during wheat season on crop yield, economic profile, water use efficiency, energy utilization, and carbon footprint in typical wheat-maize cropping systems in the North China Plain. Presowing irrigation resulted in the lowest crop yield and benefit profile. Pre-sowing + anthesis irrigation decreased economic benefit and water use efficiency with higher carbon footprint. Pre-sowing + jointing + anthesis irrigation led to the greatest energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. However, pre-sowing + jointing irrigation increased yield by 2.3-8.7%, economic benefit by 4.0-11.1%, water use efficiency by 7.4-10.9%, and net energy by 6.5-12.0% but reduced carbon footprint by 9.8-14.3% compared to pre-sowing + anthesis irrigation and pre-sowing + jointing + anthesis irrigation. The corresponding metrics in rotary tillage improved by 9.6%, 13.9%, 7.0%, and 14.2%, respectively, relative to subsoiling, whereas carbon footprint decreased by 12.4-17.2%. Besides, rotary tillage coupled with additional jointing irrigation obtained the highest value based on a Z-score method, which was recommended as a cleaner management practice to improve benefit return and water use efficiency with lower energy consumption and carbon footprint. This work provides valuable insights into food-water-energy-carbon nexus for ensuring food security and achieving environmental sustainability in the wheat-maize cropping systems.",About Sufficiency
Climate Change and Soil Degradation Mitigation by Sustainable Management of Soils and Other Natural Resources,"Soil, an important component of land, has numerous functions and ecosystem services essential to all terrestrial life. Soil degradation, decline in its capacity to support functions and provide ecosystem services, is caused by accelerated erosion, salinization, elemental imbalance, acidification, depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC), reduction in soil biodiversity, and decline in soil structure and tilth. Desertification, a sub-set of degradation, specifically refers to decline in soil quality and functions in arid climates. Climate change affects and is affected by soil degradation through a positive feed back due to increase in mineralization of SOC pool and the radiative forcing. Desertification may lead to a net increase in temperature despite change in albedo of the denuded surface. Feedbacks and threshold amplify the risks of degradation, and the projected climate change may exacerbate all four types of drought (i.e., meteorological, hydrological, pedagogical, and ecological). The mutually reinforcing positive feedbacks between soil degradation and climate change are strongly influenced by social, economic, political, and cultural factors. There exists a strong link between poverty, desperateness, and societal collapse on soil degradation and climate change. Restoration of degraded and desertified soils, converting marginal agricultural areas to rangeland and forest land, and adoption of recommended management practices have a large technical potential to sequester carbon and off-set anthropogenic emissions, improve the environment, and enhance and sustain agronomic productivity. Important among recommended management practices are using conservation agriculture and mulch farming, establishing cover crops, adopting strategies of integrated nutrient management, and those which create positive C and nutrient budgets and soil/water conservation within a watershed. Long-term research is needed which is hypothesis-driven, uses modern innovative research and modeling tools, is based on community involvement, and provides decision support systems to policy makers and land managers.",About Sufficiency
Climate-resilient crops: Lessons from xerophytes,"Developing climate-resilient crops is critical for future food security and sustainable agriculture under current climate scenarios. Of specific importance are drought and soil salinity. Tolerance traits to these stresses are highly complex, and the progress in improving crop tolerance is too slow to cope with the growing demand in food production unless a major paradigm shift in crop breeding occurs. In this work, we combined bioinformatics and physiological approaches to compare some of the key traits that may differentiate between xerophytes (naturally drought-tolerant plants) and mesophytes (to which the majority of the crops belong). We show that both xerophytes and salt-tolerant mesophytes have a much larger number of copies in key gene families conferring some of the key traits related to plant osmotic adjustment, abscisic acid (ABA) sensing and signalling, and stomata development. We show that drought and salt-tolerant species have (i) higher reliance on Na for osmotic adjustment via more diversified and efficient operation of Na+/H+ tonoplast exchangers (NHXs) and vacuolar H+- pyrophosphatase (VPPases); (ii) fewer and faster stomata; (iii) intrinsically lower ABA content; (iv) altered structure of pyrabactin resistance/pyrabactin resistance-like (PYR/PYL) ABA receptors; and (v) higher number of gene copies for protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) and sucrose non-fermenting 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 2/open stomata 1 (SnRK2/OST1) ABA signalling components. We also show that the past trends in crop breeding for Na+ exclusion to improve salinity stress tolerance are counterproductive and compromise their drought tolerance. Incorporating these genetic insights into breeding practices could pave the way for more drought-tolerant and salt-resistant crops, securing agricultural yields in an era of climate unpredictability.",About Sufficiency
"Climate-smart agricultural practices: a case of dairy cooperative farmers in Agula and Maychew, Northern Ethiopia","This study examined the climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices of dairy farmers in Agula and Maychew, Northern Ethiopia. Data was collected through focus group discussions (FGDs) and questionnaires. The study explored farmers', implementation of three CSA practices - improved fodder, manure management, and replacement of unproductive cows. The determinants of CSA adoption were analyzed using a binary logistics model at significance levels of 1%, 5%, and 10%. Results showed that improved fodder was adopted by 60.1% in Agula and 18.2% in Maychew. The adoption of manure management (p = .229) and replacement of unproductive cows (p = .935) did not vary significantly. The replacement of unproductive cows had the highest adoption rate (45.9%). Improved fodder adoption was significantly higher among male-headed farms (p = .017). Manure management adoption was positively associated with gender (p = .034), number of cows (p = .081), and access to climate information (p = .063). Replacement of unproductive cows was associated with number of cows (p < .001), farm income (p = .049), and access to extension services (p = .006). FGDs revealed that farmers were able to perceive climate change and its effects on their dairy business.

Climate-Smart Cocoa in Ghana: How Ecological Modernisation Discourse Risks Side-Lining Cocoa Smallholders,"Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) aims to transform and reorient farming systems to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, boost adaptive capacity, and improve productivity while supporting incomes and, ostensibly, food security. In Ghana-the world's second biggest cocoa producer-the cocoa sector is challenged by increasing global cocoa demand, climate change impacts, as well as mounting consumer pressure over cocoa's deforestation. Climate-smart cocoa (CSC) has emerged to address these challenges as well as to improve smallholder incomes. As with CSA more widely, there are concerns that CSC discourses will override the interests of cocoa smallholders, and lead to inequitable outcomes. To better understand if and how the implementation of CSC in Ghana can meet its lofty ambitions, we examine (1) the dominant CSC discourses as perceived by stakeholders, and their reflection in policy and practice, and (2) subsequent implications for cocoa smallholders through an equity lens. Through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders in Ghana's cocoa sector, we find overwhelming consensus for an ecological modernisation discourse with the promise of a ""triple win"" narrative that simultaneously stops deforestation, supports climate mitigation and adaptation, and increases smallholder livelihoods. Moreover, we find that implementing CSC on the ground has generally converged around ""sustainable intensification"" and private-sector-led partnerships that aspire to generate a ""win-win"" for environment and productivity objectives, but potentially at the expense of delivering equitable outcomes that serve smallholders' interests. We find that the success of CSC and the overly-simplistic sustainable intensification narrative is constrained by the lack of clear tree tenure rights, complexities around optimal shade trees levels, potential rebound effects regarding deforestation, and the risks of agrochemical-dependence. More positively, local governance mechanisms such as Ghana's Community Resource Management Area Mechanisms (CREMAs) may give cocoa smallholders a stronger voice to shape policy. However, we caution that the discursive power of dominant private sector actors may risk side-lining equity which could prove detrimental to the long-term wellbeing of Ghana's similar to 800,000 cocoa smallholders.",About Sufficiency
"Climate-smart land use requires local solutions, transdisciplinary research, policy coherence and transparency","Successfully meeting the mitigation and adaptation targets of the Paris Climate Agreement (PA) will depend on strengthening the ties between forests and agriculture. Climate-smart land use can be achieved by integrating climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and REDD+. The focus on agriculture for food security within a changing climate, and on forests for climate change mitigation and adaptation, can be achieved simultaneously with a transformational change in the land-use sector. Striving for both independently will lead to competition for land, inefficiencies in monitoring and conflicting agendas. Practical solutions exist for specific contexts that can lead to increased agricultural output and forest protection. Landscape-level emissions accounting can be used to identify these practices. Transdisciplinary research agendas can identify and prioritize solutions and targets for integrated mitigation and adaptation interventions. Policy coherence must be achieved at a number of levels, from international to local, to avoid conflicting incentives. Transparency must lastly be integrated, through collaborative design of projects, and open data and methods. Climate-smart land use requires all these elements, and will increase the likelihood of successful REDD+ and CSA interventions.

Climatic Benefits From the 2006-2017 Avoided Deforestation in Amazonian Brazil,"Over three-fourths of Brazil's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originate from land-use/cover change (LUCC). Alarming rates of forest loss in the Amazon region gained international attention in the past, but deforestation declined substantially since 2004 (although the rate has trended upwards since 2012). This result conforms to the GHG emission reduction targets set by the National Climate Change Plan, originally divided into three phases: 2006-2009; 2010-2013; and 2014-2017. According to the plan, emission reductions are measured against a deforestation baseline, initially corresponding to the average forest loss observed from 1996 to 2005 (reference period). We used an artificial neural network (ANN) model to spatialize the plan's original three-phase baseline and compare (i) the simulated carbon emissions from the baseline scenario to (ii) the emissions from observed deforestation during 2006-2017. Baseline spatialization was performed at the state level and informed by the 2000-2004 deforestation patterns in each state, resulting in nine state-specific calibrated ANNs. Simulated (baseline) and observed deforestation were compared to five biomass-density maps in order to estimate Brazil's GHG emission reductions. Our results indicate that forest loss during the study period was 62,321 km(2) lower than the baseline and associated with 1.5 +/- 0.4 Pg of avoided CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Virtually all emission reductions (93%) occurred in the states of Mato Grosso (74%) and Rondonia (19%). In contrast, Roraima, Amazonas, and Amapa states increased GHG emissions by 44.8, 36.7, and 14.7 Tg CO2, respectively. Lastly, we discuss the issue of attribution of deforestation reductions for results-based payments (REDD+) and the emission reduction certificates issued by the Amazon Fund.",About Sufficiency
"Objectives, ownership and engagement in Lao PDR's REDD plus policy landscape","Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) is envisioned as a performance-based incentive to influence forest use behavior and governance towards the preservation and management of forests. In relatively forest-rich Lao PDR, the policy space that REDD+ planners are attempting to navigate is populated by enduring political and economic interests that affect the country's forest estate. A further layer to the problem of REDD+ planning is the tension between often expert-driven, externally proposed solutions; national ownership over interventions; and the extent of political will to take action to reform currently unsustainable patterns of forest and forest land exploitation. This paper draws from a series of semi-structured interviews conducted in 2013-2014, to develop a political and institutional analysis of the limitations to the effectiveness of REDD+ in steering towards a lower forest-derived emissions trajectory in Lao PDR. While internationally-driven projects follow long-standing national objectives to varying degrees, it remains unclear how REDD+ can target main drivers of deforestation in the absence of a more politically engaged and nationally-owned planning process, that also challenges the prevailing logic of avoiding these drivers. Despite the importance of improving domestic ownership over REDD+, this would arguably be of limited impact unless oriented towards transformational change that would seek to overcome political and economic barriers to avoided deforestation. Stronger ownership could be developed via more mutually driven REDD+ planning, while tackling main drivers of deforestation necessitates as a starting point the engagement of powerful actors that have so far been absent from REDD+ debate.",About Sufficiency
Combined Bioenergy and Food Potential of Opuntia ficus-indica Grown on Marginal Land in Rural Mexico,"Opuntia ficus-indica (cactus pear) emerged as a promising crop for sustainable bioenergy production on marginal agricultural land, mitigating competition with food crops and lowering the risk of other indirect land use changes. In this study, the bioenergy potential is investigated of cactus pear residues within a smallholder farming context of Nopaltepec, a rural municipality in Central Mexico. Nopaltepec is a native environment of cactus pear and shows an annual production volume of 30 Gg of fresh matter. A bottom-up approach employing semi-structured interviews (n = 16) was utilized to assess the feasibility of transforming the pruning residues of cactus pear into a viable bioenergy source. The results indicate a substantial bioenergy potential, with 27 Mg of fresh matter biomass (equivalent to 9720 m3 biogas) per hectare obtainable annually without compromising fruit yields. Moreover, the digestate produced through anaerobic digestion can be recycled as biofertilizer, offering economic and ecological advantages to smallholders. Notably, farmers expressed keen interest in integrating this technology into their agricultural systems. This research underscores the potential of cactus pear residues for developing a decentralized bioenergy sector and provides valuable ideas for future bottom-up assessments in rural communities like Nopaltepec.",About Sufficiency
Combining ability analysis of yield and biomass allocation related traits in newly developed wheat populations,"Increasing biomass allocation to the root system may increase soil-organic carbon stocks and confer drought adaptation in water-limited environments. Understanding the genetic bases and inheritance of biomass allocation is fundamental for drought tolerance breeding and soil health. The objective of this study was to determine the general and specific combining ability, maternal effects and the mode of gene action controlling the major yield and biomass allocation related traits in wheat to identify good combiners for breeding and enhanced carbon sequestration. Ten selected wheat genotypes were crossed in a full diallel mating design, and 90 F-2 families were generated and evaluated in the field and greenhouse under drought-stressed and non-stressed conditions. Significant differences were recorded among the tested families revealing substantial variation for plant height (PH), kernels per spike (KPS), root biomass (RB), shoot biomass (SB), total plant biomass (PB) and grain yield (GY). Additive gene effects conditioned PH, SB, PB and GY under drought, suggesting the polygenic inheritance for drought tolerance. Strong maternal and reciprocal genetic effects were recorded for RB across the testing sites under drought-stressed conditions. Line BW162 had high yield and biomass production and can be used to transfer favourable genes to its progeny. The parental line LM75 maintained the general combining ability (GCA) effects in a positive and desirable direction for SB, PB and GY. Early generation selection using PH, SB, PB and GY will improve drought tolerance by exploiting additive gene action under drought conditions. Higher RB production may be maintained by a positive selection of male and female parents to capture the significant maternal and reciprocal effects found in this study.",About Sufficiency
Implementing a sustainable integrated agroforestry system for the cultivation of Ilex paraguariensis,"In this work, we advocate agroforestry as a sustainable agricultural method that leverages biodiversity and ecosystem services, simultaneously tackling the problems of adaptation and mitigation to climate change, and of land restoration for sustainable agriculture across scales. While the rise of industrial agriculture has been instrumental in addressing the food demands of an expanding global population, enhancing food quality, yield, productivity, and efficiency, we must now reckon with the consequences. This advancement, which prioritizes simplification, specialization, and external inputs, has escalated detrimental externalities including deforestation, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, pollution, and an increase in greenhouse gases, contributing significantly to global warming and to exacerbated environmental crises. These demand urgent attention. In response, various agricultural methodologies such as organic, biodynamic, ecological, and biological farming have emerged, attempting to propose alternatives. However, these methods have yet to significantly alter the trajectory of mainstream agriculture. For over two decades, we have devoted our efforts to developing and refining a multispecies integrated agroforestry system for the sustainable cultivation of Ilex paraguariensis, ""yerba mate,"" in the subtropical north-east of Argentina.

Comparative Analysis of Energy Efficiency in Organic and Conventional Farming Systems: A Case Study of Black Carrot (Daucus carota L.) Production in Turkey,"This study compared the energy efficiency and cost/benefit ratio of conventional and organic farming systems for black carrot (Daucus carota L.) in Konya province, Turkey. In the research, energy consumption for different farm operations from land preparation to transportation was considered. The farms were selected through stratified random sampling. Data were collected through field survey of 56 respondents in carrot farms during production periods in 2007-2008. Black carrot production was considered for the study as it is a very good source of colored food. Therefore, black carrot production must take into consideration the requirements for eco-design requirements and energy labeling. Based on the results, increasing amount of inputs was more effectively used in the organic farming system compared with the conventional system. Total energy requirement under conventional farming was 75,335.72 MJ ha(-1) and 37,758.82 MJ ha(-1) for organic farming. There was higher demand for energy in conventional farming (49.88%) than organic farming. On the other hand, the need for labor per hectare was higher for organic farming than for the conventional farming system. The energy output-input ratios for conventional and organic farming systems were 1.30 and 1.90, respectively. Moreover, the benefit-cost ratios were 1.83 and 2.05, respectively.

Comparative Analysis of the Cultured and Total Bacterial Community in the Wheat Rhizosphere Microbiome Using Culture-Dependent and Culture-Independent Approaches,"Rhizosphere and root-associated bacteria are key components of crop production and sustainable agriculture. However, utilization of these beneficial bacteria is often limited by conventional culture techniques because a majority of soil microorganisms cannot be cultured using standard laboratory media. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to improve culturability and investigate the diversity of the bacterial communities from the wheat rhizosphere microbiome collected from three locations in Egypt with contrasting soil characteristics by using metagenomic analysis and improved culture-based methods. The improved strategies of the culture-dependent approach included replacing the agar in the medium with gellan gums and modifying its preparation by autoclaving the phosphate and gelling agents separately. Compared to the total operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed from the metagenomic data sets derived from the three analyzed soils, 1.86 to 2.52% of the bacteria were recovered using the modified cultivation strategies, whereas less than 1% were obtained employing the standard cultivation protocols. Twenty-one percent of the cultivable isolates exhibited multiple plant growth-promoting (PGP) properties, including P solubilization activity and siderophore production. From the metagenomic analysis, the most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Moreover, the relative abundance of the specific bacterial taxa was correlated with the soil characteristics, demonstrating the effect of the soil in modulating the plant rhizosphere microbiome. IMPORTANCE Bacteria colonizing the rhizosphere, a narrow zone of soil surrounding the root system, are known to have beneficial effects in improving the growth and stress tolerance of plants. However, most bacteria in natural environments, especially those in rhizosphere soils, are recalcitrant to cultivation using traditional techniques, and thus their roles in soil health and plant growth remain unexplored. Hence, investigating new culture media and culture conditions to bring ""not-yet-cultured"" species into cultivation and to identify new functions is still an important task for all microbiologists. To this end, we describe improved cultivation protocols that increase the number and diversity of cultured bacteria from the rhizosphere of wheat plants. Using such approaches will lead to new insights into culturing more beneficial bacteria that live in the plant rhizosphere, in so doing creating greater opportunities not only for field application but also for promoting sustainability.",About Sufficiency
Compressive and tensile strength enhancement of soft soils using nanocarbons,"Technological innovations in sustainable materials for soil improvement have attracted considerable interest due to energy crisis and environmental concerns in recent years. This study presents results of a comprehensive investigation on utilization of nanocarbons in reinforcement of a residual soil mixed with 0, 10 and 20% bentonite. Effects of adding proportionate quantities (0, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1 and 0.2%) of carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers to soil samples of different plasticities were evaluated. The investigation revealed that the inclusion of nanocarbons into the soil samples significantly improved unconfined compressive strength, Young's modulus and indirect tensile strength. It was observed that carbon nanofibers showed better performance as compared to carbon nanotubes. The nanosized diameter and high aspect ratio of nanocarbons make it possible to distribute the reinforcing materials on a much smaller scale and bridge the inter-particles voids.

Conceptualizing food systems for global environmental change research,"This paper outlines a framework for studying the multiple interactions of broadly defined food systems with global environmental change and evaluating the major societal outcomes affected by these interactions: food security, ecosystem services and social welfare. In building the framework the paper explores and synthesizes disparate literature on food systems food security and global environmental change, bridging social science and natural science perspectives. This collected evidence justifies a representation of food systems, which can be used to identify key processes and determinants of food security in a given place or time, particularly the impacts of environmental change. It also enables analysis of the feedbacks from food system outcomes to drivers of environmental and social change, as well as tradeoffs among the food system outcomes themselves. In food systems these tradeoffs are often between different scales or levels of decision-making or management, so solutions to manage them must be context-specific. With sufficient empirical evidence, the framework could be used to build a database of typologies of food system interactions useful for different management or analytical purposes.

Connecting Public Policies for Family Farmers and Women's Empowerment: The Case of the Brazilian Semi-Arid,"The role played by women in worldwide food production and food security has reinvigorated debates about the recognition of women's rights in the rural sector regarding better working conditions and the reduction of gender inequalities. In the 1980s, the social movement in Brazil restructured the politics in the agrarian sector by integrating farmers' rights and women's demands. Against this background, the objective of this study is to analyze, through the actors' perspectives, whether and how the combination of public policies for family farmers affected the socio-economic and political empowerment of women. Our case study covers family farmers from traditional communities located in the Brazilian semi-arid. The results show that women achieved economic stability by participating in public food procurement programmes. In addition, access to cisterns released women from the daily work of collecting water. Women became more involved with political issues, increasing participation in institutions such as NGOs, associations and cooperatives. Among the negative aspects, the study found that the sexual division of labor increased within the household context, and, despite being fundamental for ensuring household food security, women still struggle to have access to the means of production.",About Sufficiency
Conserve or convert? Pan-tropical modeling of REDD-bioenergy competition,"The land competition between tropical bioenergy plantations and payments for forest carbon conservation (e.g., through an international scheme for Reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+) is modeled using spatially explicit data on biofuel feedstock (oil palm and sugar cane) suitability and forest biomass carbon stocks. The results show that a price on the (avoided) carbon emissions from deforestation at the same level as those from fossil fuel use makes clearing for high yielding bioenergy crops unprofitable on about 60% of the tropical evergreen forest area. For the remaining 40% deforestation remains the most profitable option. Continued profitability of forest clearing is most pronounced for oil palm bioenergy systems in Latin America and Africa, with REDD+ making deforestation for sugar cane plantations unprofitable on 97% of evergreen forest land. Results are shown to be relatively robust to assumptions regarding potential yields and to the addition of a 'biodiversity premium' on land use change emissions. While REDD+ may play an important role in stemming biodiversity loss and reducing carbon emissions from tropical deforestation in the near future, in the longer run reliance on a system that values forests solely for their carbon retention capacities poses a serious risk. It is imperative that the institutions and policies currently being established as part of REDD+ readiness activities are resilient to future changes in the incentive structures facing tropical forest countries due to, e.g., climate policy induced demand for biofuels.

Constraints and capacities for novel livelihood adaptation: lessons from agricultural adoption in an African dryland pastoralist system,"Climate change, land use change, and sociopolitical and institutional transitions in African drylands have resulted in the loss, fragmentation, and degradation of environmental resources that pastoralists rely upon to sustain their livestock-based livelihoods. Diversification into irrigated agriculture is a potential strategy to increase food security. However, successful livelihood adaptation depends on access to key forms of natural, human, social, financial, and physical capitals, which may be lacking or unequally distributed in pastoralist communities. In two dryland pastoralist communities in Kenya, an international relief organization introduced irrigated farming in 2010. Nearly 200 individuals began farming, but within 4 years, all had quit. This study investigated the role of household access to different forms of capital in decisions to adopt agriculture, and how adaptive capacities, environmental conditions, and farming as a new livelihood practice interacted to shape household vulnerability. We found that decisions to farm were largely decoupled from access to assets that would afford greater adaptive capacity. The analysis also identified critical constraints that households encountered once they adopted farming. This study highlights the importance of more nuanced understandings of local capacities in the dynamics of adapting to environmental change. We recommend that prior to introducing interventions that promote new livelihood activities, development organizations should assess local capacities and pursue targeted strategies to increase household-level access to the forms of assets that will facilitate successful adaptation.",About Sufficiency
Constraints in the fertilizer supply chain: evidence for fertilizer policy development from three African countries,"Increased use of inorganic fertilizer in smallholder farming systems can significantly raise crop productivity, enabling farming households to improve their food security both directly, through greater food supply, and indirectly, though higher agricultural incomes, and to set themselves economically on a pathway out of poverty. Low fertilizer use by African smallholder farming households is evidence of the difficulties they face in accessing the commercial input at a price that will allow them to obtain sufficient and reliable returns from their investment. This paper presents the results of a broad study of fertilizer supply to smallholder farmers in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda to assess whether costs faced at various points along the import and marketing chain, or the absence of key public goods and services, reduce the access that smallholder farmers have to fertilizer. The study involved a mixed methods approach that included for each country a review of the literature on fertilizer supply, demand, and use; interviews with key participants in fertilizer import and marketing; and two surveys - one with farmers and one with input suppliers. We found that the governments of the three countries have used distinct approaches in developing or regulating the fertilizer sub-sector. Based on use levels, Tanzania has been the most successful in ensuring access to fertilizer for its farmers. Mozambique lags the most. Several areas were identified where government inaction or misdirected efforts are having an adverse effect on efforts to increase agricultural productivity through the increased use of inorganic fertilizer. The most important constraints to increased fertilizer uptake stem from missing public goods that are not specific to inorganic fertilizer but are implicated in broad efforts to increase rural economic growth, particularly in continuing to expand and deepen crop output markets to ensure reliable returns to the use of fertilizer and in improving rural transportation networks. In addition, the three governments can do more to foster competitive agricultural input markets. All propose more state regulation on trade in inorganic fertilizer than is warranted. Moreover, particularly in Tanzania, by not consistently acting in line with policies for agricultural commercialization in place, government increases the commercial risks faced by both input suppliers and farmers and undermines the development of vibrant agricultural markets, both for inputs and outputs, including food.",About Sufficiency
Continuing Issues in the Limitations of Pesticide Use in Developing Countries,"The rationale for pesticide use in agriculture is that costs associated with pesticide pollution are to be justified by its benefits, but this is not so obvious. Valuing the benefits by simple economic analysis has increased pesticide use in agriculture and consequently produced pesticide-induced ""public ills."" This paper attempts to explore the research gaps of the economic and social consequences of pesticide use in developing countries, particularly with an example of Nepal. We argue that although the negative sides of agricultural development, for example- soil, water, and air pollution; pest resistance and resurgence; bioaccumulation, bio-magnification; and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience caused by the use of pesticides in agriculture, are ""developmental problems"" and are ""unintentional,"" the magnitude may be increased by undervaluing the problems in the analysis of its economic returns. Despite continuous effort for holistic system analyses for studying complex phenomena like pesticides impacts, the development within the academic science has proceeded in the opposite direction that might have accelerated marginalization of the third world subsistence agricultural communities. We hypothesize that, if these adversities are realized and accounted for, the benefits from the current use of pesticides could be outweighed by the costs of pollution and ill human health. This paper also illustrates different pathways and mechanisms for marginalization. In view of potential and overall negative impacts of pesticide use, we recommend alternative ways of controlling pests such as community integrated pest management (IPM) along with education and training activities. Such measures are likely to reduce the health and environmental costs of pesticide pollution, and also enhance the capabilities of third world agricultural communities in terms of knowledge, decision making, innovation, and policy change.",About Sufficiency
"Contradictory distributive principles and land tenure govern benefit-sharing of payments for ecosystem services (PES) in Chiapas, Mexico","Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are incentive-based instruments that provide conditional economic incentives for natural resources management. Research has shown that when economic incentives are parachuted into rural communities, participation and benefits are collectively negotiated and shared. However, we know little about how benefit-sharing evolves over time in community-based PES. To address this gap, we examine distributional justice in four communities of the state of Chiapas, Mexico, which participate in a PES programme, and we assess how local justice principles compare with the programme's goals. Our analysis reveals patterns of both continuity and change in how communities share PES benefits, which reflect a suite of contradictory justice principles, including entitlement, merit, need, and equality. The studied communities distribute PES benefits by providing differentiated compensation to diverse groups of landholders via private cash payments, whilst also attending non-landed community members through public infrastructure investments. We show that benefit-sharing is strongly influenced by pre-existing land tenure features and associated norms, which in the study area include three different types of individual and common-property. Yet, we also show that communities continuously adjust benefit-sharing arrangements to navigate distributional challenges emerging from programme engagement. Overall, we provide novel insights on the evolution, diversity, and complexity of distributive justice in community-based PES and we advocate for a context-sensitive, nuanced, and dynamic account of justice in incentive-based conservation.",About Sufficiency
Contrasting soil management systems had limited effects on soil health and crop yields in a North Central US Mollisol,"Management practices such as relay cropping, cover crops, and no-tillage may promote soil health in the North Central United States. However, soil health indicators in corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] systems involving multiple management practices are not well documented. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of soil health metrics and the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) to contrasting management systems with different tillage, crops, and fertilization in a North Central US Mollisol. Different management systems, including conservation tillage and nitrogen fertilization strategies, cover cropping, and camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] relay intercropping, were compared to a conventional corn-soybean system. Different systems did not affect most soil health indicators compared to the conventional system. Aggregate stability was the only indicator to change due to management, where no-till with cover crops increased aggregate stability by 38% compared with camelina relay cropping. The SMAF scores for all the soil quality indices were unaffected by treatments but displayed high values of over 90%. Overall, crop yields were more closely related to weather conditions and management systems than to soil health indicators. Soybean yields were decreased (between 1 and 2 Mg ha-1) in the camelina relay cropping system, while corn yields were lower (up to 70%) in the treatment that received no N fertilization. Ultimately, these findings suggest that soil health indicators are resilient to change due to management in these highly productive Mollisols and may not be closely associated with crop yields. The sensitivity of soil health metrics and Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) to management systems was studied in North Central United States. Management systems did not affect most soil health indicators compared to the conventional corn-soybean rotation. No-tillage with cover crops increased aggregate stability by 38% compared with camelina relay crop. SMAF scores were similar for all treatments and indicated soils were functioning at over 90% of their potential.

Contrasting Soil Organic Carbon Concentrations and Mass Storage Between Conventional Farming and Organic Farming: A Meta-Analysis,"This meta-analysis studied the impact of conventional versus organic farming practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations and mass storage. We aimed to understand the carbon dynamics associated with adopting organic agricultural practices by reviewing and synthesizing data from 1950 to 2023. We analyzed data from 64 experimental field comparisons that involved SOC concentration and mass storage measurements, covering a wide range of studies selected for soil depth analyses, carbon concentration measurements, and comparative methods between conventional and organic systems. Our results indicated a significant increase in SOC under organic agriculture. An analysis of the response ratios (LnRR) for SOC concentration showed variability, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.089-0.149. Similarly, the analysis of carbon storage data indicated a 95% confidence interval of LnRR of 0.053-0.205. These increases in SOC concentration and mass storage reflect the variable but statistically positive impact of organic farming on SOC. Fine soil textures demonstrated the highest mean LnRR for both SOC concentration (0.163) and mass storage (0.173), suggesting the role of soil texture in mediating the effects of organic agriculture on SOC dynamics. Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between soil pH and SOC mass storage, with a regression coefficient of -0.174 (p < 0.039). Although a slight positive correlation was observed between temperature and SOC mass storage as LnRR, other environmental factors likely play a critical role in SOC dynamics. These findings emphasize the complexity of SOC dynamics and the significant impact of organic agriculture on increasing SOC concentrations and mass storage. This study broadly contributes to the debate in sustainable agriculture by providing quantitative evidence of the role and benefits of organic agriculture on climate change mitigation. The results also emphasize the importance of adopting organic farming practices for broadly enhancing ecosystems' resilience and long-term food security.",About Sufficiency
"Contribution of sorghum to productivity of small-holder irrigation schemes: On-farm research in the Senegal River Valley, Mauritania","In Mauritania, most irrigated land was designed for, and remains devoted to, rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation. Decades after introduction, however, yield remains below expectations, irrigated land is gradually being abandoned, and now crop diversification is promoted to improve sustainability of irrigated agriculture. This paper presents evidence of the potential, and limitations, of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) cropping in small-holder irrigation schemes along the Mauritanian side of the Senegal River Valley. Results are based on 3-years of on-farm participatory research (2007-2009) carried out at five irrigation schemes in collaboration with farmers and national research and extension services. Grain yield, water productivity and gross margin of sorghum and rice were compared at plot level. Global average grain yield over years and schemes was 2.5 t ha(-1) for sorghum, ranging from 1.7 t ha(-1) to 3.2 t ha(-1), compared to 5.6 t ha(-1) for rice, ranging from 4.0 t ha(-1) to 7.3 t ha(-1), even though both crops had similar total above-ground biomass at maturity. Sorghum required less irrigation water than rice (435 vs. 601 mm) but the smaller yield resulted in similar irrigation water productivity (0.87 vs. 0.96 kg m(-3)) and fuel (pumping) productivity (1.71 vs. 1.93 kg MJ(-1)). Despite smaller yields, however, sorghum profitability was significantly greater than rice (1172 vs. 788 epsilon ha(-1)), due to higher market price and, in the case of one scheme, lower irrigation costs. Main constraints identified in sorghum cropping were (i) poor crop establishment because of late sowing and water logging; (ii) neglected weed management; and (iii) mismatch between irrigation delivery schedules and water requirements. The causes of these constraints are particularities of rice production systems (design and heavy soil) and farmers' habits acquired with traditional rainfed sorghum cropping during the wet season. The analyses presented here reveal that sorghum cropping is a profitable option to rice for small-holder farmers, particularly on light-textured soils within the irrigation schemes. Furthermore, large variability of results among sorghum farmers and the high above-ground biomass at maturity suggests scope for improving grain yield and water productivity. Challenges remain, however, for adoption of sorghum in irrigated agriculture in Mauritania. National agricultural policies must ensure access to credit and agricultural inputs (seeds and fertilizers) and consider specific requirements for crop diversification (type of soil, irrigation distribution) in both rehabilitation of existing schemes and in design and construction of new ones.

Energy and economic impacts of rainwater tanks on the operation of regional water systems,"This study has analysed the reductions in operational costs (pumping, water treatment and maintenance) and greenhouse gas emissions from regional water supplies that include installation of rainwater tanks used to supply domestic laundry, toilet and outdoor water uses across New South Wales. The household cost of rainwater supply ranged from $7.95/kL at Broken Hill to $ 0.88/kL in the Central Coast region. However, installation of rainwater tanks produced considerable reductions in operating costs of a city's water system ranging from $ 57 to $ 6371 per household installing a rainwater tank. Significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 75% from including rainwater tanks in regional water systems were also observed. In addition, significant improvement in the security of regional water supplies with subsequent deferral of the requirement for augmentation of supply (new dams or desalination plants) was observed for coastal cities. These benefits were seen to be dependent on the average annual rainfall depth, distance from the coast, and availability of reliable operational and augmentation data of a regional water system. This study reveals the importance of including rainwater tanks or, indeed, any other decentralised water management option in analysis of the operation of regional water systems to provide a realistic understanding of combinations of centralised and decentralised water management strategies.",About Sufficiency
Corporate Social Responsibility certifications influence consumer preferences and seafood market price,"This study analyzes consumer preferences toward Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) aspects of canned tuna fish in relation to environmental and social responsibility. The analysis investigates the different existing labeled standards on canned tuna fish, evaluating the effects of such CSR-labeled information on market price and consumer choice. Data collection was carried out at a retail store and respondents were interviewed only after they had put a tin of canned tuna fish, chosen from among those available in the real choice set, in their shopping basket. Data were analyzed using two different, but complementary, methods: hedonic pricing and random utility models. Results show that consumers are in search of environmental and social sustainability attributes for canned tuna fish. Indeed, especially concerning the environmental dimension, consumers prefer green products more than their ordinary counterparts. The findings indicate that products with environmental certifications are priced higher than regular non certified products, while those with social certifications are priced similarly to regular products. With regards to consumer choice, canned tuna with environmental or social certifications is preferred as opposed to the non-certified product, with both types of certifications showing a similar willingness to pay. The willingness to pay for such products seems to increase, ceteris paribus, with income and decrease with age. By combining the experimental findings of the two models adopted, managerial and policy implications are drawn. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Costs of Overly Broad Recalls,"Overly broad recalls following an FDA advisory occur when the source of an outbreak is originally misidentified or cannot be promptly identified. In this situation, an entire product category might be recalled (e.g., romaine lettuce), such that the recall extends to uncontaminated product lots, imposing spillover costs on entities that would otherwise be unaffected. There are, however, very few published studies that estimate the potential magnitude of these spillover costs. Using a formal structured elicitation methodology, this study develops expert estimates of the spillover costs firms typically incur in responding to an overly broad recall following an FDA product advisory. We find that the range of costs varies widely by type and size of firm, with producers incurring median costs per recall ranging from $3.0 million to $72.7 million per firm, shippers/distributors from $0.1 million to $2.3 million per firm, restaurants from $0.04 million to $1.1 million per firm, and nonrestaurant retailers from $0.1 million to $3.1 million per firm. The results of this study can help inform food policy discussions geared toward assessing the benefits of traceability in terms of avoided costs of overly broad food recalls. Industry is often reluctant to provide estimates on the costs of recalls. This study fills that void by estimating the per-firm costs incurred by food supply chain entities due to overly broad recalls.",About Sufficiency
Cover crop effects on soil carbon and nitrogen under bioenergy sorghum crops,"Cover crops can increase soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage and reduce the potential for N leaching under agronomic crops, but little is known about their effect under bioenergy crops whose aboveground biomass is removed either for biofuel production or for livestock feed. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of cover crops on soil organic C (SOC), total N (STN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and nitrate-N (NO3-N) contents at the 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in) depth under bioenergy sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) crops from 2010 to 2013 in the southeastern United States. Treatments were two sorghum species (forage sorghum [Sorghum vulgare Pers.] and sweet sorghum) as the main plot and four cover crops as the split-plot treatments arranged in a randomized complete block with three replications. Cover crop treatments were legume (hairy vetch [Vicia villosa Roth]), nonlegume (rye [Secale cereal L.]), biculture of legume and nonlegume (hairy vetch/rye), and no cover crop (control). At 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in), SOC was greater with hairy vetch/rye than the control under forage sorghum. At 0 to 5 and 5 to 15 cm (0 to 2 and 2 to 6 in), STN was greater with hairy vetch and hairy vetch/rye than rye under forage sorghum and greater with hairy vetch/rye than the control under sweet sorghum. At 5 to 15 cm, NO3-N was greater with hairy vetch/rye than rye in 2011, but was greater with rye and hairy vetch than hairy vetch/rye in 2012. At all depths, NH4-N was greater under forage than sweet sorghum in 2012. Regardless of treatments, SOC and STN increased, but NH4-N and NO3-N varied from 2010 to 2013. Although soil available N varied with cover crops, sorghum types, and climatic conditions from year to year, hairy vetch/rye can conserve and/or increase soil C and N storage compared with vetch or rye alone, or the control under bioenergy sorghum in the southeastern United States. The results can be used to claim C credit, increase N cycling, and improve soil and environmental quality under bioenergy sorghum in the regions with similar soil and climatic conditions.",About Sufficiency

COVID-19 implications on household income and food security in Kenya and Uganda: Findings from a rapid assessment,"This study assessed implications of the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic on household income and food security in two East African countries - Kenya and Uganda, using online survey data from 442 respondents. Results show that more than two-thirds of the respondents experienced income shocks due to the COVID-19 crisis. Food security and dietary quality worsened, as measured by the food insecurity experience scale and the frequency of consumption of nutritionally-rich foods. The proportion of food insecure respondents increased by 38% and 44% in Kenya and Uganda respectively, and in both countries, the regular consumption of fruits decreased by about 30% during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to a normal period (before the pandemic). Results from probit regressions show that the income-poor households and those dependent on labour income were more vulnerable to income shock, and had poorer food consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other respondent cate-gories. As such, they were more likely to employ food-based coping strategies compared to those pursuing alternative livelihoods, who generally relied on savings. Farmers were less likely to experience worsened food security compared to other respondent categories who depended to a great extent on market sources for food. In both countries, participation in national social security schemes was less likely to mitigate respondents' income shock during the COVID-19 period. Conversely, membership savings and loan groups was correlated with less likelihood of suffering income shocks and reduction in food consumption. The results suggest that ongoing and future government responses should focus on structural changes in social security by developing responsive packages to cushion members pushed into poverty by such pandemics while building strong financial institutions to support the recovery of businesses in the medium term, and ensuring the resilience of food supply chains particularly those making available nutrient-dense foods.

COVID-19: From health crises to food security anxiety and policy implications,"Like the rest of the world, African countries are reeling from the health, economic and social effects of COVID-19. The continent's governments have responded by imposing rigorous lockdowns to limit the spread of the virus. The various lockdown measures are undermining food security, because stay at home orders have among others, threatened food production for a continent that relies heavily on agriculture as the bedrock of the economy. This article draws on quantitative data collected by the GeoPoll, and, from these data, assesses the effect of concern about the local spread and economic impact of COVID-19 on food worries. Qualitative data comprising 12 countries south of the Sahara reveal that lockdowns have created anxiety over food security as a health, economic and human rights/well-being issue. By applying a probit model, we find that concern about the local spread of COVID-19 and economic impact of the virus increases the probability of food worries. Governments have responded with various efforts to support the neediest. By evaluating the various policies rolled out we advocate for a feminist economics approach that necessitates greater use of data analytics to predict the likely impacts of intended regulatory relief responses during the recovery process and post-COVID-19.",About Sufficiency
Creating positive synergies between risk management and transfer to accelerate food system climate resilience,"Climate change will significantly impact the future viability and security of food production systems, with increased frequency and intensity of droughts, floods, storms and other extreme climatic events predicted in many regions. In order for food production systems to remain viable and resilient under a changing climate, novel approaches, which integrate risk management (i.e. adaptation) and risk transfer strategies, such as insurance, are required. We argue that the coordinated integration of risk management and risk transfer approaches will support greater resilience of food production systems under climate change. Conversely, if risk management and risk transfer strategies are not carefully integrated, there is potential to undermine adaptive capacity (e.g. insurance subsidies may dissuade farmers from investing in climate adaptation) and ultimately reduce the capacity of food production systems to cope with and recover from the adverse impacts of climate change. Here we propose a resilience-based conceptual framework for integrating risk management and risk transfer strategies along with four key principles, which we believe could underlie their successful integration and thus enhance food production system resilience under climate change. These are as follows: (1) pro-active investments in farmer climate adaptation rather than re-active disaster relief, (2) structuring of government subsidies around insurance and climate disaster relief to incentivise farmer climate adaptation, (3) rewarding farmer efforts towards climate adaptation with cheaper insurance premiums for those farmers that invest resources into climate adaptation and (4) recognising investments in the integration of farm climate adaptation and risk transfer schemes within the broader context of future climate disaster risk management and global food security. Such an integrated investment approach could substantially reduce future economic losses for farmers while also enhancing food security under climate change.",About Sufficiency
"Creativity, innovation and future - the key points regarding the ""architecture"" for the production of agro-textiles","The twenty-first century represents the period of the most remarkable discoveries and transformations of the human civilization, but also the period of the most important changes regarding the evolution of the environment. At the present stage of the evolution of the society, the knowledge of the behaviour of the world economy cannot be conceived outside the environmental approach, as a system, structure and dynamics, its connections and implications on life on earth. Agriculture is an important source of emission of two greenhouse gases with a significant share in the influence of the global warming process. The key to protecting the environment from the harmful effects of widespread and unsafe farming practices is through implementing sustainable practices. Sustainable agriculture incorporates both the conservation of available resources and the use of agricultural practices aimed at protecting the environment. Given the increasing awareness of the environment and the specific knowledge of the various interdisciplinary technologies, special attention has been paid to unconventional technical applications, such as the use of textile structures in the agriculture and horticulture sectors to increase the quality and efficiency of agro-food products in terms of ensuring a healthy environment, social economic equity and a profitable economy.

Critical impact assessment of organic agriculture,"Based on its production guideline, organic agriculture has set for itself the goals of minimizing all forms of pollution and maintaining sustainability of the farming system. By striving for these goals, organic farming meets the demands of an increasing number of consumers who are critical of conventional production methods.

Possibilities of and limitations in performing the self-aimed goals under the basic standards of organic agriculture are discussed. Concerning environmental protection, in general, the risk of adverse environmental effects is lower with organic than with conventional farming methods, though not necessarily so; with reference to soil fertility and nutrient management, organic farming is suited to improve soil fertility and nutrient management markedly on the farm level; regarding biodiversity, comparison studies show that organic farming has more positive effects on biodiversity conservation; in relation to product quality, under the basic standards of organic farming, there is no sufficient evidence for a system-related effect on product quality due to the production method.",About Sufficiency
Crop Diversity at the Landscape Level Affects the Composition and Structure of the Vegetation-Dwelling Arthropod Communities in Naked Oat (Avena Chinensis) Fields,"The expansion of agriculture and intensive mechanized production have resulted in the loss of habitats and biodiversity, which has led to the loss of ecological services such as the biological control of pests and diseases, and insect-borne pollination. Current studies mainly focus on the impact of small-scale crop diversity (such as intercropping) on ecological service but lack research on the effects of crop diversity at the landscape scale. In this study, vegetation-dwelling arthropods in naked oat (Avena chinensis) fields under different planting patterns were collected at different growth stages by standardized sweep netting sampling, and the differences in arthropod communities and temporal dynamics were analyzed. Taking this information as an example, the effects of crop diversity at the landscape scale caused by different planting patterns on arthropod communities were studied. It was found that herbivores were the most abundant functional group in the arthropod community in naked oat fields, accounting for 70.13% of the total abundance, followed by natural enemies, accounting for 23.45%, and, finally, other insects. The abundance and species richness of natural enemies in naked oat fields under diversified planting pattern were significantly higher than those under intensive planting pattern, while the abundance and species richness of herbivorous pests showed no significant difference between the two planting patterns. Planting patterns significantly affected the composition and structure of arthropod communities in naked oat fields. Significantly higher ratio of natural enemy to pest and more diverse natural enemies under the diversified planting pattern have shown better biological control potential and the significance of biodiversity protection.",About Sufficiency
"Crop irrigation (soybean, bean, and corn) with enrofloxacin-contaminated water leads to yield reductions and antibiotic accumulation","The increasing use of antibiotics in animal production has become an emergent environmental problem. The large percentages of applied antibiotic doses eliminated in animal excrement often end up contaminating water resources, which are then used for irrigation ? compromising agricultural production and/or food security. Here, we evaluated the effects of crop irrigation with water artificially contaminated by enrofloxacin (10 ?g l- 1) and its accumulation in soybean, bean, and corn tissues. Grain production was evaluated on the basis of grain dry weight plant-1, while enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin (its breakdown metabolite) concentrations in plant tissues were evaluated by HPLC after harvesting. Diminished production was observed only in soybean plants irrigated with antibiotic-contaminated water. Enrofloxacin [1.68 ng g fresh weight (FW)-1 to 26.17 ?g g FW-1] and ciprofloxacin (8.23 ng g FW-1 to 51.05 ng g FW-1), were found in all of the plant tissues (roots, leaves, and seeds) of the three species. Regardless of the species, the highest enrofloxacin concentrations were observed in their roots, followed by the leaves and seeds, while ciprofloxacin concentrations varied among the different plant tissues of the different species. The presence of enrofloxacin in the water used for irrigating soybeans can result in productivity losses and, as that antibiotic was encountered in plant tissues (leaves and seeds) of all of the three species analyzed that are consumed in the diets of both humans and animals, it can interfere with food security.",About Sufficiency
Crop straw incorporation interacts with N fertilizer on N2O emissions in an intensively cropped farmland,"Nitrogen (N) fertilization and straw incorporation strongly influence nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural fields. An in-situ micro-plot experiment on intensively farmed winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was conducted to investigate the source and rate of N2O emissions from soils following labeled N-15 fertilization with and without straw incorporation. Four treatments, i.e., no N fertilizer and no straw incorporation (N0S0), straw incorporation only (N0S1), N fertilizer only (N1S0), and N fertilization plus straw incorporation (N1S1), were established in the experiment. The N2O emissions mainly occurred after N fertilization and lasted for approximately 1-2 weeks, accounting for 60%-67% of the wheat seasonal N2O emissions. Within the 6 days after basal fertilization and 2-4 days after top-dressing, most of the N2O fluxes (> 50%) were derived from fertilizer. Thereafter, soil-derived N2O dominated the total N2O emissions and within 10-20 days after N fertilization, fertilizer-derived N2O became negligible. Fertilizer N and soil N both accounted for 40%-60% of the seasonal N2O emissions, which may be explained by the high soil N stock due to long-term high N fertilization in the region. This implies the similar roles of soil N pool and fertilizer N in N2O generation under intensively farmed soils. The N fertilization had a significant priming effect on the turnover of soil N, which contributed 21.02%-50.47% of the total N2O emissions. During the basal fertilization/first irrigation event, straw incorporation significantly (P < 0.05) stimulated CO2 fluxes both in N-fertilized and non-N-fertilized plots; however, after the top-dressing/second irrigation event, the significant increase of CO2 fluxes induced by straw incorporation was only observed in the N-fertilized treatment. Straw incorporation interacted with N fertilization, and tended to enhance N2O emissions in the basal fertilization and lower N2O emissions in the top-dressing period. In N-fertilized plots, the seasonal N2O emissions from straw-incorporated and straw-removed treatments were similar, indicating that straw incorporation enhanced the N supply without increasing the N2O emissions. Our study highlights that there are significant benefits of straw incorporation to soil fertility improvement; however, the long-term impacts of straw incorporation on greenhouse gas emissions should be further examined.",About Sufficiency
Cropping and Transformation Features of Non-Grain Cropland in Mainland China and Policy Implications,"The decrease in grain plantation areas poses a growing concern for global food security. China, with its large population, increasingly diversified food demands, and relatively small cultivated lands, has suffered deeply from this phenomenon (non-grain production, NGP) in recent years. Since 2020, the central government of China has claimed to deal with this problem by attracting agriculturalists and organizations involved in grain plantation. In this context, understanding the global NGP of the national situation is vital for policy making. Remote sensing is regarded as the most effective and accurate method for this purpose, but existing studies have mainly focused on algorithms operating at the local scale or exploring grain-producing capability from the perspective of agricultural space. As such, the characterization of NGP on a national scale remains deficient. In this study, we tried to bridge the gap through spatio-analysis with a newly published nationwide crop pattern and land use geo-datasets; the quantitative, spatial, and structural features, as well as the utilization of NGP cropland in the year 2019, were observed. The results showed that about 60% of the cropland was used for non-grain plantation. About 15% of the NGP parcels were cultivated with grains at least three times in the past 4 years, and of these 60% and 40% were parcels with double- or single-season plantation, respectively, which could result in a 16-22% increase in the grain-sown area compared with 2019. Forest and grassland were the dominant non-cropping categories which NGP cropland transferred into, indicating more time and economic cost for regaining grains. NGP parcels also presented spatio-heterogeneity regarding cropping intensity and transformation. Parcels with double-season plantation mostly emerged in northern, central, and southern provinces, while those with single-season plantation were always located in northeastern and western provinces. The parcels that were transferred into forest or grassland mainly appeared in southern and Inner Mongolia, respectively, while the parcels in northern and central areas mostly continued cropping. According to these results, we propose remediation policies focusing on raising the cropping intensity of cultivated land in central and northern provinces due to their advantages of water, heat, terrain, and land use change features. Future work is warranted based on this study's deficiencies and uncertainties. As a forerunner, this study provides a holistic observation of the NGP phenomenon in mainland China on a national scale, and the findings can inform improvements in land use policies concerning grain production and food security in China.",About Sufficiency
Cultivation arrangements for taioba under a banana orchard,"Research on biodiversity management in production systems involves various aspects, including selecting optimal population arrangements for cultivated plants. The utilization of unconventional vegetables, such as taioba (Xanthosoma sagittifolium (L.) Schott), in the diversification of production systems offers a promising alternative to enhance food security and income generation for producers. However, limited information exists in the literature regarding its management and production. Thus, the present study aimed to assess different planting densities of taioba cultivated in intercropping under banana orchards by evaluating its development and yield. The experiment was conducted at the Federal University of Espirito Santo (UFES), located in Alegre, ES, Brazil. The experimental design employed randomized blocks with six replications, following a split-plot arrangement. The plots consisted of single and double rows of planting systems, while the subplots were comprised of between-plant spacings of 30, 40, and 50 cm. Various parameters were evaluated, namely, leaf area, number of leaves, leaf fresh and dry matter, chlorophyll indices, flavonoids, and nitrogen balance. Additionally, gross income was determined by estimating the production capacity of leaves and converting it into the production capacity of commercial leaf bundles, considering a 1.0 ha taioba cultivation area based on the intercropping arrangements with banana trees. The highest fresh and dry matter yields of taioba were achieved with the largest spacing between plants (50 cm) in both single and double rows. The number of leaves produced by the plants remained unaffected by the studied arrangements. Consequently, the highest gross yield was obtained with the highest plant density, achieved through a planting spacing of 30 cm between plants in double rows. These findings underscore the viability of diversifying production within banana orchards by incorporating taioba planting in alternating rows, providing a genuine opportunity for additional income for farmers.",About Sufficiency
Culturomics- and metagenomics-based insights into the soil microbiome preservation and application for sustainable agriculture,"Soil health is crucial for global food production in the context of an ever-growing global population. Microbiomes, a combination of microorganisms and their activities, play a pivotal role by biodegrading contaminants, maintaining soil structure, controlling nutrients' cycles, and regulating the plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Microbiome-based solutions along the soil-plant continuum, and their scaling up from laboratory experiments to field applications, hold promise for enhancing agricultural sustainability by harnessing the power of microbial consortia. Synthetic microbial communities, i.e., selected microbial consortia, are designed to perform specific functions. In contrast, natural communities leverage indigenous microbial populations that are adapted to local soil conditions, promoting ecosystem resilience, and reducing reliance on external inputs. The identification of microbial indicators requires a holistic approach. It is fundamental for current understanding the soil health status and for providing a comprehensive assessment of sustainable land management practices and conservation efforts. Recent advancements in molecular technologies, such as high-throughput sequencing, revealed the incredible diversity of soil microbiomes. On one hand, metagenomic sequencing allows the characterization of the entire genetic composition of soil microbiomes, and the examination of their functional potential and ecological roles; on the other hand, culturomics-based approaches and metabolic fingerprinting offer complementary information by providing snapshots of microbial diversity and metabolic activities both in and ex-situ. Long-term storage and cryopreservation of mixed culture and whole microbiome are crucial to maintain the originality of the sample in microbiome biobanking and for the development and application of microbiome-based innovation. This review aims to elucidate the available approaches to characterize diversity, function, and resilience of soil microbial communities and to develop microbiome-based solutions that can pave the way for harnessing nature's untapped resources to cultivate crops in healthy soils, to enhance plant resilience to abiotic and biotic stresses, and to shape thriving ecosystems unlocking the potential of soil microbiomes is key to sustainable agriculture. Improving management practices by incorporating beneficial microbial consortia, and promoting resilience to climate change by facilitating adaptive strategies with respect to environmental conditions are the global challenges of the future to address the issues of climate change, land degradation and food security.",About Sufficiency

Association of moderate and severe food insecurity with suicidal ideation in adults: national survey data from three Canadian provinces,"Although the important public health issues of food insecurity and suicide may be interconnected, they are rarely studied. Using data from a national survey, we examined whether household food insecurity was associated with suicidal ideation after adjusting for relevant covariates. We examined cross-sectional data from three Canadian provinces (n = 5,270) that were derived from the 2007 Canadian Community Health Survey and included adults (18+ years). Suicidal ideation was based on affirmative response to the question of whether or not the participant had seriously considered committing suicide in the previous 12 months. The Household Food Security Survey Module provided measures of moderate (indication of compromise in quality and/or quantity of food consumed) and severe (indication of reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns) food insecurity status. Logistic regression determined associations between food insecurity and suicidal ideation with adjustment for demographics, body mass index, and presence of a mood disorder. There were differences in the proportion experiencing suicide ideation according to moderate (14.7 vs 10.0 % without suicide ideation) and severe (16.4 vs 7.1 % without suicide ideation) food security (p < 0.001). With covariate adjustment, suicidal ideation was significantly associated with moderate (adjusted OR = 1.32, 95 % CI 1.06-1.64) and severe (adjusted OR = 1.77, 95 % CI 1.42-2.23) food insecurity. The findings of a robust association between food insecurity and suicidal ideation suggest that interventions targeted at food security may reduce suicide-related morbidity and mortality. Longitudinal investigations that examine various dimensions of food insecurity will advance understanding of etiological pathways involved in food insecurity and suicide.",About Sufficiency
Exploring the acceptability of amaranth-enriched bread to support household food security,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the acceptability of an identified staple product enriched with amaranth grain, a traditionally used wild plant familiar to most of the population, after households' food security status revealed that the majority of them were either at risk or food insecure. Design/methodology/approach - A two-phase non-experimental, quantitative survey design with purposive sampling was used to explore the variety of foods consumed and the food security status of lower skilled (n = 63) and higher skilled (n = 81) income-earning households. During the second phase, recipe development and sensory acceptance of bread enriched with grain amaranth (n = 91) were determined. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. Findings - Food insecurity was evident among the majority of the lower skilled income households while nearly one in four households in both groups were at risk to become insecure. Daily consumption of chicken and maize meal was evident in lower income households while the frequency in higher income households were significantly less. Bread was found to be the most consumed food product among all households (p = 0.001; r = 0.455). Supplementation of wheat flour with amaranth flour, a nutritious traditionally familiar wild plant, to support households' food consumption was investigated. Results from sensory evaluation panels revealed that both bread samples with different percentage of amaranth flour (15 and 25 per cent) were acceptable. Originality/value - The most important contribution of this study is the re-introduction and incorporation of a traditional food, amaranth, into a modern frequently consumed food to support households' nutritional and monetary demands to ultimately contribute to general well-being and household food security.",About Sufficiency
Decoupling of subsoil carbon and nitrogen dynamics after long-term crop rotation and fertilization,"Enhancing global soil organic carbon storage by 4 per mille (parts per thousand) per annum would be enough to halt current net greenhouse gas emissions, but this goal seems lofty for conventional agriculture, which frequently results in soil organic carbon and nitrogen losses. Replacing mineral nitrogen with organic nitrogen sources may benefit soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in agricultural soils, but long-term effects are yet to be clearly demonstrated, especially in soils of high natural fertility. Here we report the effects of 34 years of legumes (crimson clover, fava beans) and non-legumes (maize) in rotation combined with different fertilization regimes (no fertilization, PK fertilization, NPK fertilization) on soil carbon and nitrogen storage throughout the uppermost meter of the soil profile. Fava beans did not enhance profile carbon storage. However, fava beans induced positive effects on subsoil nitrogen cycling, with lower subsoil nitrogen densities indicating lower nitrogen leaching potential. Incorporating a clover green mulch every 4 years enhanced organic carbon storage by an average of 4.1 parts per thousand per annum down the full meter of soil compared with a conventional maize rotation, but only combined with phosphorus and potassium fertilization. The enhancement was detected below the plough-horizon, indicating that merely sampling topsoil is insufficient to assess soil carbon dynamics in these arable soils. In contrast, maize contributed only a small portion to SOC, with subsoil C contributions negligible. These results indicate that a careful combination of long-term, site-adapted crop and fertilization management strategies can help enhance SOC storage in naturally fertile soils without apparent C deficit.",About Sufficiency
DEFORESTATION AND DIVERSITY OF LIFE ZONES IN THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON - A MAP ANALYSIS,"The diversity of Holdridge Life Zone types in the Brazilian Amazon region is studied to gain perspective on the consequences of deforestation. The study is based on a life zone map of Brazil by J.A. Tosi, Jr. at a scale of 1:10,000,000. The Amazon area of the map was digitized with a cell size of 50 km by 50 km. The resulting data base consists of 1789 cells from 17 life zones. Tropical moist forest covers 60% of the area followed by tropical premontane wet forest transition and tropical premontane moist forest transition at about 10% each. Each of the remaining 14 life zone types covers 3% or less of the total area. Loss of forest area in life zone types due to deforestation is simulated by removing cells from the data base. Differential spatial patterns of deforestation are tested to assess their impact on life zone diversity. Deforestation along the Trans-Amazon Highway generated the least impact while deforestation along a frontier advancing from the south generated the most impact, in terms of loss of life zone diversity. These results show that the relative loss rate of life zone forest types is dependent on where deforestation begins.",About Sufficiency
Deforestation and Forest Fires in Roraima and Their Relationship with Phytoclimatic Regions in the Northern Brazilian Amazon,"Deforestation and forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon are a regional-scale anthropogenic process related to biomass burning, which has a direct impact on global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. Containment of this process requires characterizing its spatial distribution and that of the environmental factors related to its occurrence. The aim of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of deforested areas and forest fires in the State of Roraima from 2000 to 2010. We mapped deforested areas and forest fires using Landsat images and associated their occurrence with two phytoclimatic zones: zone with savanna influence (ZIS), and zone without savanna influence (ZOS). Total deforested area during the interval was estimated at 3.06 x 10(3) km(2) (ZIS = 55 %; ZOS = 45 %) while total area affected by forest fires was estimated at 3.02 x 10(3) km(2) (ZIS = 97.7 %; ZOS = 2.3 %). Magnitude of deforestation in Roraima was not related to the phytoclimatic zones, but small deforested areas (a parts per thousand currency sign17.9 ha) predominated in ZOS while larger deforestation classes (> 17.9 ha) predominated in ZIS, which is an area with a longer history of human activities. The largest occurrence of forest fires was observed in the ZIS in years with El Nio events. Our analysis indicates that the areas most affected by forest fires in Roraima during 2000-2010 were associated with strong climatic events and the occurrence these fires was amplified in ZIS, a sensitive phytoclimatic zone with a higher risk of anthropogenic fires given its drier climate and open forest structure.",About Sufficiency
Deforestation as a Cause of Increased Surface Runoff in the Catchment: Remote Sensing and SWAT Approach-A Case Study of Southern Serbia,"In the past two decades, the South part of Serbia has been affected by exploitive and illegal logging. As this trend is not decreasing to this day, there is a need to determine the area where this logging occurred precisely. The consequences of these actions are tremendous, causing the forest owners' financial loss (regardless of whether it is private or state property) and a negative impact on the environment. Significant environmental and forest management problems deriving from these actions are erosion increase and more frequent torrential floods occurrence in the catchment. Since it is difficult to update the national forest inventories in remote areas, remote sensing techniques using different satellite imagery types can provide up-to-date data. The initial analysis that employed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (created using Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery) indicates massive deforestation in the research area between 1999 and 2021. Headwaters of the Stavska river catchment is selected as the research area to determine the amount of erosion in two periods-before and after deforestation occurred. Change in land cover (LC) is presented with two LC maps created applying supervised classification to Landsat 7 imagery from 1999 as a pre-deforestation LC state and Landsat 8 imagery acquired in 2021 as the current LC state. The erosion in the catchment for both periods is determined using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The analysis results show the erosion change incurred as a deforestation effect in the river catchment. With the data obtained by remote sensing and SWAT analysis, it is possible to track changes in the area and acquire essential data, making the right and fast decisions to protect the natural resources economy and make sustainable development possible in this impoverished region.",About Sufficiency
"Deforestation modifying terrestrial organic transport in the Rio Tapajos, Brazilian Amazon","The concentration and biomarker compositions of sedimentary organic matter (OM) as well as fine and coarse suspended particles were analysed to identify the impact of deforestation on the transport of terrigenous organic matter (OM) in the Rio Tapajos, a major tributary to the Amazon. Substantial shifts in the concentration and composition of recently deposited sedimentary OM suggest that intensive deforestation over the last few decades has considerably modified the natural inputs of sedimentary materials to the aquatic ecosystems by disrupting the terrigenous fluxes of humus and soil materials from the drainage basin. The observed compositional changes of bulk OM and land derived biomarkers (e.g. lignin) in recent sediments illustrate a sedimentary enrichment in OM from soil horizons that, under normal forest cover, tend to be retained in the drainage basin. On average, the recently accumulated OM is nitrogen-rich ((C/N)a = 12-15) and more highly degraded ((Ac/Al)v = 0.4-0.6 and DHBA/V = 0.15-0.20) than deep materials ((C/N)a = 20-30, (Ac/Al)v = 0.25-0.4, and DHBA/V = 0.05-0.10), showing that this recently accumulated material is more humified than original inputs to the aquatic system, and consistent with increased exportation of fine eroded mineral and organic particles from surface soils along river banks. The present study illustrates the relevance of using OM oxidation products in sediment profiles to evaluate deforestation impacts on aquatic ecosystems and to characterize the nature of eroded soil materials, complementing studies on mineral/metal cycling.

"Selecting the best environmental friendly oilseed crop by using Life Cycle Assessment, water footprint and analytic hierarchy process methods","The rising concern about agro-environmental problems has made the selection of green crops a critical task for agriculture sector. The choosing of alternative eco-friendly crops is a main task in developing countries, especially in Iran. As a complete framework, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) evaluates agricultural activities on the environment. However, this framework, by itself, is not able to directly assess water use impacts. Accordingly, it is necessary to integrate certain methods capable of being developed to evaluate water effects into this framework so as to achieve a more comprehensive assessment. Water footprint (WF) is one of the best indicators developed with the aim of evaluating the virtual water contents of corps. Practitioners can take the benefit of LCA + WF in association with management methods and optimization techniques, including Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to obtain better results in their studies and provide their target populations with more practical solutions. In the current study, we recommend a general way to compare the agro-environmental efficiency of oil seed crops. The goal of this research was to evaluate the environmental effects and WF of the production of soybean (Glycine max), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and canola (Brassica napus) oilseed crops in Ardabil-Iran. The environmental impacts categories are eutrophication, acidification, global warming potential, and photochemical oxidation. The total amount of WF of soybean, sunflower and canola in Ardabil Province are 839.57, 1209.04 and 2329.64 m(3)/tonne, respectively. It was found that the environmental effects from the three crops comes generally from manufactured fertilizer, manure, diesel combustion, agricultural practices, and electricity for irrigation. The results showed that sunflower demonstrated a higher environmental load because of its lower seed yield and higher WF and energy demands. It can be concluded that soybean is most appropriate for cultivation in Ardabil situations. Results indicated that integrates WF and LCA methods to compare the agro-environmental efficiency of oil seed crops could be applied as the starting point for assessment of crop production systems aimed at cost management, WF and environmental burdens reduction, and optimization in the oilseed crop production sector. The assessment framework would be adaptable and applicable to any other agricultural systems, including different crop rotation and production systems. It can be finally improved to overshadow the entire agriculture sector. The proposed systemic approach can be also modified according to any research goals and scopes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Australian policies on water management and climate change: are they supporting the sustainable development goals and improved health and well-being?,"Background: Sustainable management of the natural environment is essential. Continued environmental degradation will lead to worsened health outcomes in countries and across generations. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a framework for viewing the preservation of natural environments and the promotion of health, wellbeing and health equity as interconnected pursuits. Within the SDG framework the goals of promoting environmental sustainability and human health are unified through attention to the social determinants of health and health equity (SDH/HE). This paper presents findings from a document analysis of all Australian environment sector policies and selected legislation to examine whether and how current approaches support progress toward achieving SDG goals on water, climate change, and marine ecosystems (Goals 6, 13 and 14), and to consider implications for health and health equity. Results: Consideration of a broad range of SDH/HE was evident in the analysed documents. Related collaborations between environment and health sectors were identified, but the bulk of proposed actions on SDH/HE were initiated by the environment sector as part of its core business. Strengths of Australian policy in regard to SDGs 6, 13 and 14 are reflected in recognition of the effects of climate change, a strong cohesive approach to marine park protection, and recognition of the need to protect existing water and sanitation systems from future threats. However, climate change strategies focus predominately on resilience, adaptation and heat related health effects, rather than on more comprehensive mitigation policies. The findings emphasise the importance of strengthened cross-sectoral action to address both the drivers and effects of environmental degradation. A lack of policy coherence between jurisdictions was also evident in several areas, compounded by inadequate national guidance, where vague strategies and nonspecific devolution of responsibilities are likely to compromise coordination and accountability. Conclusions: Evidence on planetary health recognises the interconnectedness of environmental and human health and, as such, suggests that ineffective management of climate change and water pose serious risks to both the natural environment and human well-being. To address these risks more effectively, and to achieve the SDGs, our findings indicate that cross-jurisdiction policy coherence and national coordination must be improved. In addition, more action to address global inequities is required, along with more comprehensive approaches to climate change mitigation.",About Sufficiency
Delineating Smallholder Maize Farms from Sentinel-1 Coupled with Sentinel-2 Data Using Machine Learning,"Rural communities rely on smallholder maize farms for subsistence agriculture, the main driver of local economic activity and food security. However, their planted area estimates are unknown in most developing countries. This study explores the use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map smallholder maize farms. The random forest (RF), support vector (SVM) machine learning algorithms and model stacking (ST) were applied. Results show that the classification of combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data improved the RF, SVM and ST algorithms by 24.2%, 8.7%, and 9.1%, respectively, compared to the classification of Sentinel-1 data individually. Similarities in the estimated areas (7001.35 +/- 1.2 ha for RF, 7926.03 +/- 0.7 ha for SVM and 7099.59 +/- 0.8 ha for ST) show that machine learning can estimate smallholder maize areas with high accuracies. The study concludes that the single-date Sentinel-1 data were insufficient to map smallholder maize farms. However, single-date Sentinel-1 combined with Sentinel-2 data were sufficient in mapping smallholder farms. These results can be used to support the generation and validation of national crop statistics, thus contributing to food security.",About Sufficiency
"Designing a Pest and Disease Outbreak Warning System for Farmers, Agronomists and Agricultural Input Distributors in East Africa","Simple Summary Designing early warning systems for threats to food crops in Africa must respond to the needs of potential users of the system. This paper provides evidence from professional distributors, retailers, researchers, and agronomists in East Africa who may be able to use and communicate the results of the predictive modeling of pest outbreaks. Understanding the timing and spatial extent of required warnings will help guide research and engagement in these rapidly commercializing countries. Early warnings of the risks of pest and disease outbreaks are becoming more urgent, with substantial increases in threats to agriculture from invasive pests. With geospatial data improvements in quality and timeliness, models and analytical systems can be used to estimate potential areas at high risk of yield impacts. The development of decision support systems requires an understanding of what information is needed, when it is needed, and at what resolution and accuracy. Here, we report on a professional review conducted with 53 professional agronomists, retailers, distributors, and growers in East Africa working with the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture. The results showed that respondents reported fall armyworm, stemborers and aphids as being among the most common pests, and that crop diversification was a key strategy to reduce their impact. Chemical and cultural controls were the most common strategies for fall armyworm (FAW) control, and biological control was the least known and least used method. Of the cultural control methods, monitoring and scouting, early planting, and crop rotation with non-host crops were most used. Although pests reduced production, only 55% of respondents were familiar with early warning tools, showing the need for predictive systems that can improve farmer response.",About Sufficiency
Designing protected area networks that translate international conservation commitments into national action,"Most countries have committed to protect 17% of their terrestrial area by 2020 through Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, with a focus on protecting areas of particular importance for biodiversity. This means national-scale spatial conservation prioritisations are needed to help meet this target and guide broader conservation and land-use policy development. However, to ensure these assessments are adopted by policy makers, they mist also consider national priorities. This situation is exemplified by Guyana, a corner of Amazonia that couples high biodiversity with low economic development. In recent years activities that threaten biodiversity conservation have increased, and consequently, protected areas are evermore critical to achieving the Aichi targets. Here we undertake a cost-effective approach to protected area planning in Guyana that accounts for in-country conditions. To do this we conducted a stakeholder-led spatial conservation prioritisation based on meeting targets for 17 vegetation types and 329 vertebrate species, while minimising opportunity costs for forestry, mining, agriculture and urbanisation. Our analysis identifies 3 million ha of priority areas for conservation, helping inform government plans to double the current protected area network from 8.5 to 17%. As part of this, we also develop a new technique to prioritise engagement with local communities whose lands are identified as important to conservation. Our study both provides a scientifically robust, politically acceptable protected area expansion strategy for Guyana, and illustrates the importance of conservation planning at the country-scale to translate international commitments into national action.",About Sufficiency

"Determinants of adoption of urban agriculture (UA) as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and its impact on food security: evidence from Wolaita Sodo city, South Ethiopia","BackgroundClimate change is one of humanity's biggest problems. CSA offers a once-in-a-lifetime chance to adapt to global climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. UA can improve food security by providing affordable, nutritious alternatives to commercially produced food, especially for economically disadvantaged people. This study examined the factors influencing the adoption of UA as CSA practices, as well as their effects on food security in Wolaita Sodo City, South Ethiopia.MethodsData was collected from primary and secondary sources, both qualitative and quantitative form. A structured and semi-structured questionnaire was used to gather data from 384 randomly chosen urban households through surveys/interviews, focus group conversations, and observation. The percentage and mean differences between UA adopters and non-adopters were calculated using the chi-square test and t-test. A propensity score matching (PSM) model assessed UA's impact on food security. A binary logistic regression model was used to determine factors influencing adoption of UA as CSA practice in the study area.ResultsThe descriptive analysis showed that 53.53% of respondents used UA. Statistics showed the existence of a significant mean differences between adopters and non-adopters in employment level, UA attitudes, and household size. Logit model computations showed that family size, home ownership, the household head's occupation, perceptions of UA, market demand, and access to training and support influenced UA adoption as a climate-smart farming practice.ConclusionsAs per the study's findings, there could be a correlation between specific factors and the adoption of UA as CSA in the studied area. The PSM study confirmed that UA deployment significantly improves food security. UA adoption increased food security by 0.685-fold.

Determinants of Agricultural Intensification in Southwest Nigeria,"Declining agricultural production in many developing countries has prompted increased use of some inputs while continuous cropping prevails. This study analysed the factors promoting different forms of agricultural intensification in southwestern Nigeria. Data collected from randomly selected farmers in selected states in southwestern Nigeria were used. Results show that farmers from Osun State have the highest indices of intensification with respect to land use intensity, fertilizer use intensity and crop diversification. The censored regression showed that lost working days, use of fertilizers, crop rotation, and having more inherited land increased land use intensity while use of organic manure, minimum tillage and poverty reduced crop diversification index. Fertilizer use intensity increased with the use of minimum tillage and household size while hired and family labour use intensity increased with household size. It was recommended that in the face of increasing land degradation, farmers' access to fertilizer must be increased and efforts to reduce their poverty level must be promoted, among others. [A. S.

Determination of soil C:N suitability zones for organic farming using an unsupervised classification in eastern Croatia,"Soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) represents an indicator of soil quality and fertility, having a major impact on agricultural land management for organic farming. Determination of soil C:N suitability zones is a necessary procedure in the process, enabling effective land management. A total of 72 soil samples at two soil layers at 0-10 cm and 20-30 cm were used in the study, evenly distributed in the Osijek-Baranja County in eastern Croatia. Ordinary kriging (OK) and Lognormal kriging (LK) using linear, Gaussian and spherical mathematical models, alongside Inverse distance weighted (IDW) were evaluated for the spatial prediction of soil C:N. Inner accuracy representing retention of input sample values in the interpolation results and outer accuracy representing a prediction accuracy at unknown locations were used to determine optimal interpolation parameters. K-means unsupervised classification algorithm was used for the objective determination of soil C:N suitability zones in five classes specified by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). IDW resulted in the highest inner accuracy, while OK with the Gaussian model produced the highest outer accuracy with the average R-2 = 0.7908 and NRMSE = 0.0544. Contrary to the previous research, higher mean soil C:N results in a lower soil layer of 20-30 cm with 13.41, compared to 12.03 at 0-10 cm soil layer. The highest soil C:N suitability was determined in only 4.8% of the study area, with the suitability index of 18.44. Meanwhile, the two largest classes were marginally suitable and currently unsuitable class, covering 35.5% and 27.7% of the study area, respectively.

This study revealed the motivating factors as the main determinants in producing biomass energy: (1) digitalization, (2) technical and logistics, (3) social capital, (4) prices, and (5) government supports. This study also confirms that Vietnam has diverse biomass waste sources and a high potential for biomass energy production. To motivate biomass energy development, the government should support credit and loans for stakeholders in producing biomass energy. Moreover, the government should encourage and support energy producers to implement digital transformation to expand production scale and improve business operations. Insights from this study can help farmers, traders, and bioenergy producers by adapting their strategies within their local contexts.",About Sufficiency
Developing proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) core collection using geographic and morpho-agronomic data,"Proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is a rich source of protein, minerals, and vitamins, and is an important cereal crop of Asia and Africa. Due to its lowest water and nutrient requirement, it has the potential for agriculture diversification. The development of a core collection would assist in efficient management and enhanced utilisation of proso millet genetic resources. The present investigation was conducted to develop a core collection of proso millet based on geographic information and 20 qualitative and quantitative traits recorded on 833 accessions conserved in the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics genebank. The entire germplasm collection was stratified into five groups based on races and data on 20 morpho-agronomic traits were used for clustering following Ward's method. About 10% (or at least one accession) was randomly selected from each of 101 clusters to constitute a core collection of 106 accessions. Comparisons of means, variances, frequency distribution, diversity indices, and correlation studies indicated that the variation in the entire collection has been preserved in the core collection. This core collection provides a gateway to identify diverse trait-specific germplasm accessions for important agronomic traits and for abiotic and biotic stresses for use in crop improvement research and in crop diversification programs.",About Sufficiency
"Development of Bacillus safensis-based liquid bioformulation to augment growth, stevioside content, and nutrient uptake in Stevia rebaudiana","The application of chemical fertilizers to enhance crop production is a major concern due to associated environmental pollution and health hazards. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop an eco-friendly solution to improve crop production and promote sustainable agriculture simultaneously. Stevia rebaudiana is an important medicinal crop being substitute for sugar, superior flavor outline, extensive medicinal properties, and also of agronomic interest. In the present study, bacterium STJP isolated from the rhizospheric soil of S. rebaudiana and identified as Bacillus safensis on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, showed good amount of zinc (4.4 mg/L) and potassium (5.4 mg/L) solubilization. Paneer-whey (a dairy waste) based bioformulation (P-WBF) was developed utilizing isolate B. safensis STJP (accession number NAIMCC TB-2833) and inspected for the quality and ability to enhance the growth, nutrients uptake, and stevioside content in S. rebaudiana. The application of P-WBF displayed a significantly higher concentration (153.12%) of stevioside in S. rebaudiana as compared to control. P-WBF treated Stevia plants showed significantly higher fresh and dry weight as well (as compared to control). Further, enhancement of phosphorous, nitrogen, potassium, and zinc uptake in plant tissue was also recorded by application of P-WBF. This study suggests the use of P-WBF based biofertilizer using B. safensis STJP to increase stevioside content in Stevia plant by a nutrient(s) linked mechanism. This novel approach can also be beneficial for utilization of a dairy waste in preparation of bioformulation and, for enhancement of crop yield by an ecofriendly manner leading to sustainable agriculture.

Development of Bioelectrochemical Systems to Promote Sustainable Agriculture,"Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) are a newly emerged technology for energy-efficient water and wastewater treatment. Much effort as well as significant progress has been made in advancing this technology towards practical applications treating various types of waste. However, BES application for agriculture has not been well explored. Herein, studies of BES related to agriculture are reviewed and the potential applications of BES for promoting sustainable agriculture are discussed. BES may be applied to treat the waste/wastewater from agricultural production, minimizing contaminants, producing bioenergy, and recovering useful nutrients. BES can also be used to supply irrigation water via desalinating brackish water or producing reclaimed water from wastewater. The energy generated in BES can be used as a power source for wireless sensors monitoring the key parameters for agricultural activities. The importance of BES to sustainable agriculture should be recognized, and future development of this technology should identify proper application niches with technological advancement.",About Sufficiency
Development of organic farming in Norway: A statistical analysis of neighbourhood effects,"The organic boom in agriculture at the turn of the new millennium culminated in ambitious political goals for further growth in organic agricultural production and consumption. In Norway, the present goal is to reach a level of 15% organic production and consumption by 2020. So far, the requested shift toward organic farming has not occurred at the anticipated level. Organic farming began in Norway with a few pioneers who questioned the conditions in conventional agriculture. Since the late 1980s, there has been a rise in the number of organic farms from the core 20 or so original farms to approximately 2800 certified organic farms in 2010. While several studies have explored the diffusion of organic farming as an innovation, little research has been carried out to specifically understand the spatial diffusion of organic agriculture. This paper explores spatial diffusion of organic farming in Norway by asking if the level of organic farming in one municipality is influenced by organic farming in its neighbouring municipalities. Spatial analyses are carried out on population, agricultural production and producer data. The dependent variable is the proportion of organic production in Norwegian municipalities (N = 430). Analyses in the paper show a connection between the level of organic production, the population level in the municipalities, and access to consumers. This research also shows a connection between the farm processing of organic products and the level of organic farming. The patterns are of a geographical nature, showing neighbourhood effects in the development of organic farming that are especially strong in particular regions of Norway. The results are discussed in light of previous research on organic farming and Hagerstrands ([1953] 1967) theory of spatial diffusion of innovations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Growing 'good food': urban gardens, culturally acceptable produce and food security","With food security increasingly seen as an urban concern, urban agriculture (UA) has emerged as one strategy for improving access to healthy, affordable food within cities in the Global North. This research evaluates the contributions of three types of urban gardens in Santa Clara County, California, to food security. Survey, interview and harvest data were collected from home gardeners, community gardeners and gardeners participating in community food security (CFS) programs, which provide low-income families with the materials and training to grow their own vegetables. To assess food security we use a multi-dimensional framework that encompasses food availability, accessibility, nutritional adequacy and cultural acceptability as well as agency within the food system. Over the summer of 2015, median garden production ranged from 26 kg for participants in CFS programs to 56 kg for home gardeners. All garden types produced enough produce for at least one adult to consume the number of cups of vegetables recommended by federal nutritional guidelines. Gardening also increased some low-income gardeners' access to healthy food, allowing them to have the diet they wanted-one high in organically grown vegetables-but could not otherwise afford to purchase. Interviews showed that gardeners do not think of cultural acceptability strictly in terms of the presence of certain types of cultural crops; they also articulated a broader set of values concerning the environmental and social conditions of food production. At all income levels, gardeners frequently described a set of food values related to knowledge, control, trust, freshness, flavor, organic production methods and sharing, which they were able to enact through gardening. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the nutritional contributions that urban gardens make but also highlight the importance that low-income gardeners place on having food that aligns with their cultural and ethical values and being able to exercise greater autonomy in making food choices. In conclusion, we suggest that more robust, holistic assessments of UA's contributions to food security will include the subjective aspects of food as well as quantitative measures related to food production.",About Sufficiency
Dietary intakes of adolescents from food insecure households: analysis of data from the 6th (2013-2015) Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at evaluating the dietary intakes of Korean adolescents affected by food insecurity, in comparison with those who were food secure. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study used one day 24-hour dietary recall data from the 6th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The study subjects consisted of 1,453 adolescents of whom 695 were middle school-aged and 758 were high school-aged. Food security status was assessed using the 18-item questionnaire. Nutrient intake was evaluated in terms of nutrient density, insufficient intake, and excessive intake for selected nutrients, in addition to meeting the appropriate range for total energy intake and energy intakes from carbohydrate, sugar, protein, fat, and saturated fatty acids. Food intake was evaluated in terms of food group servings and dietary diversity score (DDS). RESULTS: The percentages of food insecurity were 11.1% for middle school-aged adolescents and 16.8% for high school-aged adolescents. Food insecure middle school-aged adolescents had higher intake of carbohydrate (P = 0.006) but lower intake of fat (P = 0.010) and saturated fatty acids (P = 0.005) than their food secure counterparts although the intake of both groups was in the recommended ranges. Nutrient intake among high school-aged adolescents was generally similar regardless of food security status. Both food secure and insecure adolescents showed insufficient intake of vitamin A, vitamin C, and calcium, and excessive sodium intake. They additionally had low prevalence of meeting appropriate intake ranges for energy, carbohydrate, and sugar. Food intake in terms of food group servings and DDS was also similar regardless of food security status among both age groups, with low intakes of foods from fruit and dairy groups. CONCLUSIONS: Except for a few nutrients among the middle school-aged adolescents, dietary intakes among Korean adolescents did not differ by food security status in this study.",About Sufficiency
Dietary Power and Self-Determination among Female Farmers in Burkina Faso: A Proposal for a Food Consumption Agency Metric,"Although food security is traditionally defined with four dimensions, there are increasing calls for an additional two: agency and sustainability. However, it is especially challenging to measure agency, a person's control over their food production and consumption. Measuring women's agency is especially critical in African regions south of the Sahara, where women play prominent roles in farming and food preparation. This paper explores the feasibility of creating a metric to measure agency within food systems using data related to food security and dietary diversity among female rice farmers in southwestern Burkina Faso. Informed by the literature on agency, autonomy, and food sovereignty, we developed an agency index based upon a subset of questions in the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). We call this metric the Food Consumption Agency Metric (FCAM). By applying the FCAM, we then sought to understand how agency complements our understanding and measurement of food security. In exploring the relationship between agency and food security more broadly, we found that agency can be quantified in a way that increases its accessibility to policymakers to create more just food systems and expand how we approach food justice.",About Sufficiency
Digital Transformation for Sustainable Future - Agriculture 4.0: A review,"In the last few years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects food supply chains around the world, the agriculture sector also has faced many global problems, such as global warming, environmental pollution, climate change, and weather disasters. It has known that technological opportunities are available for human beings to get out of these predicaments, solving the interconnections between food-water-energy-climate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation from traditional to digital. The aim of this review is to gain holistic solutions in a systematic view, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural digital transformation that will play role in sustainable development. The transition from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering agricultural and industrial revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital agriculture combined under precision agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are handled based on domains covering monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. Digital technologies are explained with application examples such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, decision support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, real-time monitoring systems tracking whole conditions of animals in livestock, the IoT-based irrigation and fertilization systems that help enhance the efficiency of irrigation processes and minimize water and fertilizer losses in agricultural fields and greenhouses, blockchain-based electronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones and robotics that reduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically. Moreover, renewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between technologies such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and energy production in rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and drip irrigation systems and environmental monitoring systems. As a result, for a sustainable future, technological innovations that increase crop productivity and improve crop quality, protect the environment, provide efficient resource use and decrease input costs can help us facing in agriculture of today overwhelm many the economic, social, and environmental challenges.",About Sufficiency
"Identification of driving factors of land degradation and deforestation in the Wildlife Reserve of Bontioli (Burkina Faso, West Africa)","In Africa, protected areas can play an important role in mitigating the effects of climate change through carbon sequestration but they are threatened due to increasing land degradation and deforestation (LDD). The Total Wildlife Reserve of Bontioli (TWRB) in Burkina Faso is one of the country's refuges with high biodiversity. This reserve is seriously threatened by human activities, and little information is available about the on-site causes of degradation extent. This study was carried out to investigate drivers and extent of LDD in the TWRB. Household surveys, focus group discussions and field observations were used to identify socio-economic factors that influence land use and land cover (LULC) changes. The socio-economic data were analyzed using rankings and binary logistic regression techniques. Logistic regression model was used to establish the relationship between socio-economic drivers and land cover change. Remote sensing and GIS techniques were used to analyze land use and LULC changes over 29 years, employing Landsat images of 1984, 2001 and 2013. We performed a supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood algorithm to derive vegetation maps. The results revealed significant (p < 0.05) LULC change from one class of LULC to another. From 1984 to 2001, tree savannas, bare soils and agricultural lands increased by 17.55%, 18.79% and 21778.79%, respectively, while woodland, gallery forest, shrub savannas and water bodies decreased by 22.02%, 5.03%, 40.08% and 31.2%, respectively. From 2001 to 2013, gallery forests decreased by 14.33%, tree savannas by 22.30% and shrub savannas by 5.14%, while agricultural lands increased by 167.87% and woodlands by 3.21%. LDD occurred at a higher rate in areas bordering the reserve compared to the core-protected area and the inaccessible areas. Agricultural expansion and wood cutting activities were the main direct causes of LDD. Extensive land utilization for agriculture is a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in this reserve. The research highlighted the soundness of GIS and remote sensing practical application to assess vegetation change extent in Burkina Faso. Understanding the signal extent of vegetation change is particularly important to support efforts by policy makers to halt or at least to slow down the deforestation in the country. There is a need to control the immediate causes of LULC dynamics by limiting agricultural land expansion and wood cutting in the study area. (C) 2015 The Authors.

"Direct and indirect crisis of food security due to COVID-19 emergence in Addis Ababa and Amhara regions, Ethiopia: a lesson for the inevitable pandemics","Background COVID-19 caused a significant impact on food security; particularly among low- and middle-income countries. The objective of the current study was to assess both the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on individuals' food security in the metropolitan and regional context of Ethiopia. Methods This project utilized a retrospective study design with a mixed methods approach. It assessed the food insecurity experience of individuals both before and after the emergence of COVID-19 through the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). Food sellers were interviewed to identify the factors that increased post-COVID-19 emergence food insecurity. Inferential analysis using ordinal logistic regression was undertaken based on the Polytomous Universal Model (PLUM) procedure. Results The size of the family and the type of work for income generation were statistically associated (p < 0.05) with the food security of individuals, both before and after COVID-19 emergence. Location (p = 0.002, odds = 0.37), age (p = 0.002, odds = 2.57) and educational status (p = 0.001, odds = 0.24/) of individuals had a statistically significant effect on the food security of individuals before COVID-19 emergence only. The ordinal value of all FIES indicators increased after COVID-19 emergence compared with pre-pandemic food insecurity. Overall food security of individuals was reduced by 21.5%, with the moderate and severe food insecurity of individuals increasing by 13.1% and 15.9%, respectively. The COVID-19 preventive measures that affected the individuals' food security, in the order of their priority, were: transport bans; food price increment; lockdown measures; job loss; market bans; social distance restrictions; fear of the pandemic; movement restrictions; over-buying; food inaccessibility; and, lack of cash due to bank closure. In addition, pre-existing non-pandemic related natural and man-made disasters played a role in the food security crisis, including drought, war, and desert locust emergence. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly affected individuals' food security. Learning from the experiences of COVID-19 may assist governments in preparing for future pandemics. Suggested improvements include forming impact reduction task forces and establishing disease prevention strategies that will not compromise food security.",About Sufficiency
Dissolved: Lessons learned from the Portland Multnomah Food Policy Council,"The city of Portland, Oregon, is often hailed in news and popular media as the capital of the U.S. alternative food movement. In 2002, the Portland Multnomah Food Policy Council (PMFPC) was established to address the region's growing interest in cultivating a sustainable local food system. Council members contributed to many notable achievements, including a healthy corner store initiative, a beginning farmer training program, and changes to zoning codes to expand urban agriculture. However, the PMFPC was dissolved in the summer of 2012 after local government agencies expressed that the council was losing relevancy. After a decade of conducting food policy and advocacy work in a region praised for fostering both citizen engagement and sustainable food systems, what can we learn from the story of the PMFPC? In this reflective case study, we explore the challenges associated with citizen engagement in local food policy. Through semistructured interviews and analysis of PMFPC documents, we provide insight into how particular obstacles might have been avoided or overcome. Our research speaks to the broad arena of public participation and highlights the importance of negotiating and clearly articulating the roles and responsibilities of council members, government staff liaisons, and elected officials; regularly evaluating the usefulness of established roles, structures, and processes; and making the changes necessary to maintain the relevance of the council throughout its life. We conclude with lessons learned and recommendations for both citizens and government agencies hoping to foster productive public engagement and to advance local food systems policy.",About Sufficiency
Divergent effects of moderate grazing duration on carbon sequestration between temperate and alpine grasslands in China,"Moderate grazing has been widely proven to improve ecosystem functioning and have profound effects on the carbon cycling and storage in grassland ecosystems, which highly depend on grazing duration and grassland type. However, the effects of moderate grazing durations on carbon sequestration with different grassland types over broad geographic scales across China remain underexplored in the context of striving for carbon neutrality. Here, we explored the prob-ably different responses of carbon sequestration to moderate grazing duration for temperate and alpine grasslands based on 129 published literatures regarding the China's grasslands. The results showed the soil organic carbon stocks were significantly increased during short-term (<5 years) grazing duration, while significantly decreased during medium-(5-10 years) and long-term (>= 10 years) grazing durations in temperate grasslands. However, the soil or-ganic carbon stocks were significantly decreased during short-term grazing duration, while showed no significant changes during medium-and long-term grazing durations in alpine grasslands. The changes in soil organic stock were significantly positively correlated with the changes in belowground biomass, root:shoot, and microbial biomass carbon (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that the temperate grasslands change from carbon sink to carbon source with moderate grazing duration increasing, while the alpine grasslands present an opposite change pattern from carbon source to carbon sink, regulated by grazing-altered carbon input and microbial activities. Our study might have signif-icant implications for future sustainable management practices for carbon sequestration of China's grasslands.",About Sufficiency
Diversity and structure of prokaryotic communities within organic and conventional farming systems in central highlands of Kenya,"Management practices such as tillage, crop rotation, irrigation, organic and inorganic inputs application are known to influence diversity and function of soil microbial populations. In this study, we investigated the effect of conventional versus organic farming systems at low and high input levels on structure and diversity of prokaryotic microbial communities. Soil samples were collected from the ongoing long-term farming system comparison trials established in 2007 at Chuka and Thika in Kenya. Physicochemical parameters for each sample were analyzed. Total DNA and RNA amplicons of variable region (V4-V7) of the 16S rRNA gene were generated on an Illumina platform using the manufacturer's instructions. Diversity indices and statistical analysis were done using QIIME2 and R packages, respectively. A total of 29,778,886 high quality reads were obtained and assigned to 16,176 OTUs at 97% genetic distance across both 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA cDNA datasets. The results pointed out a histrionic difference in OTUs based on 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA cDNA. Precisely, while 16S rDNA clustered by site, 16S rRNA cDNA clustered by farming systems. In both sites and systems, dominant phylotypes were affiliated to phylumActinobacteria,ProteobacteriaandAcidobacteria. Conventional farming systems showed a higher species richness and diversity compared to organic farming systems, whilst 16S rRNA cDNA datasets were similar. Physiochemical factors were associated differently depending on rRNA and rDNA. Soil pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, nitrogen, potassium, aluminium, zinc, iron, boron and micro-aggregates showed a significant influence on the observed microbial diversity. The observed higher species diversity in the conventional farming systems can be attributed to the integration of synthetic and organic agricultural inputs. These results show that the type of inputs used in a farming system not only affect the soil chemistry but also the microbial population dynamics and eventually the functional roles of these microbes.",About Sufficiency

"Impact of feedstock, land use change, and soil organic carbon on energy and greenhouse gas performance of biomass cogeneration technologies","Bioenergy (i.e., bioheat and bioelectricity) could simultaneously address energy insecurity and climate change. However, bioenergy's impact on climate change remains incomplete when land use changes (LUC), soil organic carbon (SOC) changes, and the auxiliary energy consumption are not accounted for in the life cycle. Using data collected from Belgian farmers, combined heat and power (CHP) operators, and a life cycle approach, we compared 40 bioenergy pathways to a fossil-fuel CHP system. Bioenergy required between 0.024 and 0.204 MJ (0.86 MJ(th) + 0.14 MJ(el))(-1), and the estimated energy ratio (energy output-to-input ratio) ranged from 5 to 42. SOC loss increased the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of residue based bioenergy. On average, the iLUC represented similar to 67% of the total GHG emissions of bioenergy from perennial energy crops. However, the net LUC (i.e., dLUC + iLUC) effects substantially reduced the GHG emissions incurred during all phases of bioenergy production from perennial crops, turning most pathways based on energy crops to GHG sinks. Relative to fossil-fuel based CHP all bioenergy pathways reduced GHG emissions by 8-114%. Fluidized bed technologies maximize the energy and the GHG benefits of all pathways. The size and the power-to-heat ratio for a given CHP influenced the energy and GHG performance of these bioenergy pathways. Even with the inclusion of LUC, perennial crops had better GHG performance than agricultural and forest residues. Perennial crops have a high potential in the multidimensional approach to increase energy security and to mitigate climate change. The full impacts of bioenergy from these perennial energy crops must, however, be assessed before they can be deployed on a large scale. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Do land use change and check-dam construction affect a real estimate of soil carbon and nitrogen stocks on the Loess Plateau of China?,"Land use change and check-dam construction have been widely considered as the major measures to reduce soil and water loss. However, whether catchments behave as sources or sinks of soil carbon and nitrogen based on the combined performance of land use change and check-dam construction in sub catchment systems are still poorly known. To quantitatively assess the effect of land use change and check-dam construction on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TSN) stocks, and to explore the dominate factor influencing SOC and TSN sequestration potential, three sub-catchments controlled by check-dams were selected in the small catchment on the loess plateau of China. The SOC and TSN content and soil physic-chemical properties were analyzed under different land use types (farmland, grassland, shrubland, forestland, and check-dam land). Results clearly showed that the conversion from farmland to grassland and forestland induced an increase of SOC and TSN (1.32-fold C and 1.36-fold N increase in grassland and 1.24-fold C and 1.20-fold N increase in forestland, respectively). Comparing sediments to the corresponding source soil, the average enrichment ratios (ER) for SOC and TSN in sediments trapped behind check-dams were lower than 1 (0.56 +/- 0.10 and 0.65 +/- 0.12, respectively), and check-dam construction induced a net C and N loss (19.38% and 10.61%, respectively). The amount of SOC and TSN in three sub-catchments showed a significant positive correlation with the controlled watershed area (P<0.05). High proportion of forestland and years after construction contributed positively to SOC and TSN stocks per unit area in check-dam (P<0.05), indicating that the controlled watershed area, forestland fraction, and years after construction other than soil erosion were also the dominate influencing factors to affect carbon and nitrogen sequestration potential. The results indicated that, although erosion-induced soils and associated SOC and TSN were redistributed at the landscape scale, land use change and check dam construction might still cause the catchment to behave as soil C and N sinks within the soil erosion subsystem since the 1999s.

"DO SOCIO ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF FARMING COMMUNITY REALLY MATTER FOR THE ADOPTION OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES? A CASE STUDY OF CENTRAL PUNJAB, PAKISTAN","Agriculture sector is vital to ensure global food security and eradicate poverty in rural areas but climate change poses a great threat to this sector especially in developing countries due to lower adaptive capacity of farming community in these countries. Farming community can minimize the impact of climate change on agriculture by adopting climate change strategies at their farms. Therefore, this study analyzed how farmers perceive climate change, which strategies they adopt to minimize the impact of climate change at their farms, and the influential factors affecting the adoption of these strategies. For this purpose, cross sectional data of 195 farmers selected through multi stage purposive and random sampling techniques were collected in a face to face survey and multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the factors affecting adoption of climate change strategies. Climate change is no more a mystery for the farmers and farming community perceive this variability very well. Majority of the farmers perceived an increase in both summer as well as winter temperatures. Farming community in the area was adopting conventional climate change strategies such as changing in crop cultivation dates, new crop varieties, crop diversification, mix farming, and intensified use of chemicals at their farms in order to minimize the climate changes. Adoption of climate change strategies at farm level was influenced by schooling years, age, machinery ownership, market distance, agricultural labor force, extension services and total land of the farmers. Therefore, extension services, and improving road infrastructure to enhance market access are essential to increase adoption of climate change strategies among farmers.",About Sufficiency

Does shade tree diversity increase soil fertility in cocoa plantations?,"Complex agroforests have been promoted as a potential solutions to address trade-offs between environmental conservation efforts and the need for increased agricultural productivity for smallholder farmers in the tropics. However, the effects of tree diversification on soil fertility in tropical agroforests remain unclear. In this study, we examine whether tree diversification in cocoa plantations is associated with soil fertility benefits and can contribute to soil restoration after deforestation. We tested for positive associations between increasing tree species diversity and increased soil aggregation, soil nutrients and microbial communities across a diversity gradient ranging from cocoa monocultures to complex cocoa agroforests. Secondary forests and primary forests were used as reference ecosystems. Increase in tree diversity within cocoa plantations did not increase soil fertility parameters in topsoil layers or cocoa yields. Mean soil C contents were 8% lower, mean weight diameter of aggregates 48% lower and total bacterial biomass 35% lower in cocoa plantations than in primary and secondary forest systems, whereas soil P content was 22% higher. Across all land-use systems, microbial biomass was greater in sites with higher soil carbon contents and soil aggregation. This suggests soil function restoration in terms of microbial communities, soil C and aggregate stabilization in secondary forests. However, in cocoa plantations tree diversification alone may not be an effective solution to mitigate soil degradation after deforestation. Rather, preserving remaining forests or promoting farming approaches that allow for secondary forest regeneration (e.g. implementing forest strips and regular fallow rotations) might have a more substantial impact on soil health.",About Sufficiency
Does the Value of Water-Related Ecosystem Services Capture Water Scarcity? Application to Rice Farming in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam?,"This study utilized the contingent valuation method to estimate the value of water-related ecosystem services (ES) in Vietnam, focusing on provisioning and regulating services for addressing water scarcity (WS) in rice farming. By incorporating gender and climate change perceptions, it expanded the existing literature on valuing river ecosystem services. The findings showed a significant number of households experiencing severe water scarcity in the past five years, with over 70% facing occasional or regular WS in the last 12 months. Rice farmers were willing to adopt coping measures and preventive practices to preserve water-related ES, recognizing their importance for sustaining rice cultivation. Farmers demonstrated willingness to contribute financially to restore and maintain water-related ES in rivers and canals. The median willingness to pay for restoration was VND188,300/ha, with estimated values of US$2,898,133 for a 10% affected area and US$23,185,068 for an 80% affected area over five years. Perception of WS severity and associated risk positively influenced households' decisions to contribute financially.

Simulation study of the production efficiency of family-type agricultural management entities under regulation measures on farmland: Three-stage super-SBM model considering greenhouse gas emissions,"Context: Black soil farmland protection is a necessary measure in China to achieve sustainable, high-quality farmland development. Biochar, as a new type of soil amendment, has been shown to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase crop yields. However, few studies have addressed the widespread application of biochar from a productivity perspective. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the productivity of farmland regulation measures to provide information that can be used for monitoring and comparison. The strengths and weaknesses of different tillage practices in soils with different gradients of biochar application and further targets for improvement were determined. Methods: In this work, a three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach combined with a superefficiency measurement (Super-SBM) model with slack was used to study the production efficiency of 40 experimental plots at the Acheng Experimental Site, using soil greenhouse gas emissions as an undesired output. The dynamics of productivity in the experimental plots were explored after the influences of the external environment and statistical noise were removed. Results and conclusions: The results showed that biochar could significantly inhibit soil greenhouse gas emissions, and deep tillage and the application of 500 kg mu- 1 biochar resulted in the greatest emission reductions. Tillage and the market price of crops increase on-farm productivity by influencing the input redundancy of biochar and seeds. Family-type agricultural management entities can optimise environmental protection and economic efficiency by selecting different farmland regulation measures, which include the following: 1) Deep ploughing and the application of 500-558.74 kg mu-1 biochar for hard-grain corn are suitable for family farms. 2) Deep ploughing and the application of 500-504.72 kg mu-1 biochar for sticky corn are suitable for large-scale growers. 3) Deep ploughing and the application of 0-40.43 kg mu-1 biochar for sticky corn are suitable for traditional farmers. Significance: This study provides feasible options for the sustainable and green application of biochar under different agricultural management conditions. It can be used as a general pattern and extended to other agricultural management entities that show inefficient agricultural production.",About Sufficiency
"Drivers, constraints and trade-offs associated with recultivating abandoned cropland in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan","Further cropland expansion might be unavoidable to satisfy the growing demand for land-based products and ecosystem services. A crucial issue is thus to assess the trade-offs between social and ecological impacts and the benefits of converting additional land to cropland. In the former Soviet Union countries, where the transition from state-command to market-driven economies resulted in widespread agricultural land abandonment, cropland expansion may incur relatively low costs, especially compared with tropical regions. Our objectives were to quantify the drivers, constraints and trade-offs associated with recultivating abandoned cropland to assess the potentially available cropland in European Russia, western Siberia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan the region where the vast majority of post-Soviet cropland abandonment took place. Using spatial panel regressions, we characterized the socio-economic determinants of cropland abandonment and recultivation. We then used recent maps of changes in cropland to (i) spatially characterize the socio-economic, accessibility and soil constraints associated with the recultivation of abandoned croplands and (ii) investigate the environmental trade-offs regarding carbon stocks and habitat for biodiversity. Less cropland abandonment and more recultivation after 2000 occurred in areas with an increasing rural population and a younger labor force, but also improved yields. Synergies were observed between cropland recultivation and intensification over the 2000s. From 47.3 million hectares (Mha) of cropland abandoned in 2009, we identified only 8.5 (7.1-17.4) Mha of potentially available cropland with low environmental trade-offs and low to moderate socio-economic or accessibility constraints that were located on high-quality soils (Chernozems). These areas represented an annual wheat production potential of similar to 14.3 (9.6-19.5) million tons (Mt). Conversely, 8.5 (4.2-12.4) Mha had high carbon or biodiversity trade-offs, of which similar to 10% might be attractive for cropland expansion and thus would require protection from recultivation. Agro-environmental, accessibility, and socio-economic constraints suggested that the remaining 30.6 (25.7-30.6) Mha of abandoned croplands were unlikely to provide important contributions to future crop production at current wheat prices but could provide various ecosystem services, and some could support extensive livestock production. Political and institutional support could foster recultivation by supporting investments in agriculture and rural demographic revitalization. Reclaiming potentially available cropland in the study region could provide a notable contribution to global grain production, with relatively low environmental trade-offs compared with tropical frontiers, but is not a panacea to address global issues of food security or reduce land-use pressure on tropical ecosystems.

Uncertainties in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from US beef cattle,"Beef cattle feedlots are estimated to contribute 26% of U.S. agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and future climate change policy could target reducing these emissions. Life cycle assessment (LCA) of GHG emissions from U.S. grain-fed beef cattle was conducted based on industry statistics and previous studies to identify the main sources of uncertainty in these estimations. Uncertainty associated with GHG emissions from indirect land use change, pasture soil emissions (e.g. soil carbon sequestration), enteric fermentation from cattle on pasture, and methane emissions from feedlot manure, respectively, contributed the most variability to life cycle GHG emissions from beef production. Feeding of coproducts from ethanol production was estimated to reduce life cycle emissions by 1.7%, but could increase emissions by 0.6-2.0% with higher feeding rates. Monte Carlo simulation found a range of life cycle emissions from 2.52 to 9.58 kg CO2 per kg live weight (5th and 95th percentiles), with a calculated average of 8.14, which is between recent estimates. Current methods used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) associated with beef production in feedlots were found to account for only 3-20% of life cycle GHG emissions.

Understanding biosecurity threat perceptions across Vietnamese smallholder farmers in Australia,"The ongoing expansion of global trade and human mobility are causing increased occurrences of biosecurity outbreaks, particularly of invasive pests which threaten biodiversity and agricultural production. Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable, as they are generally not well-prepared for such incursions. In Australia, farmers with non-English speaking backgrounds are more likely to be influenced by these increasing risks and may need long-term adaptive support. Understanding farmers' perceptions of biosecurity threats, and what drives these perceptions, is a prerequisite for designing effective biosecurity management policies to support livelihoods and food security. In this study, we aim to understand the perceptions of smallholder farmers' on biosecurity threats and the factors influencing their perceptions. Data was obtained from a survey of 101 Vietnamese farmers across three geographically dispersed locations in Australia (Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia). Using the Protection Motivation Theory, we found that 43% of farmers perceived biosecurity threats to be one of the key agricultural risks, preceded by weather-related risk (48%) and produce price fluctuations (45%). Belief in the existence of biosecurity threats and the sources of information on biosecurity matters had a significant positive influence on farmers' overall perceptions of biosecurity threats on four dimensions of their life. English levels had a significant influence on their perceptions of biosecurity threats on crop output whereas farm size, gender, and farmers' age did not significantly affect farmers' overall perceptions of biosecurity threats. The findings of this study could be used by government agencies and industry associations to better target support for farmers to minimise the threats of pest and disease incursions. Support could be delivered through the introduction of relevant extension services and education programs with more transparent and direct communications of risk and compliances, improving farmers' knowledge and belief in biosecurity and fostering trust between farmers and the government.",About Sufficiency
Blockchain technology and consumers' organic food consumption: a moderated mediation model of blockchain-based trust and perceived blockchain-related information transparency,"PurposeWhile the application of blockchain technology in the organic food supply chain has been increasingly recognized, the extant knowledge of how blockchain-driven traceability influences consumer perceptions and purchase intentions remains underexplored. Grounded in the stimulus-organism-response theory, this study aims to construct a moderated mediation model to examine blockchain-enabled traceability's direct and indirect impacts on organic food purchase intention through perceived blockchain-related information transparency, considering the moderating role of blockchain-based trust.Design/methodology/approachA purposive sample of 5,326 Vietnamese consumers was surveyed using the PROCESS macro to test the proposed hypotheses.FindingsThe findings indicate that blockchain-enabled traceability significantly enhances perceived blockchain-related information transparency, which positively influences organic food purchase intention.

Dynamic adjustment and the specification of empirical economic models of deforestation,"Tropical deforestation has been one of the most significant global environmental changes of recent decades and has spurred a substantial academic literature. Despite this, the empirical literature provides inconsistent evidence on the role of basic economic determinants of deforestation such as income and population. The authors suggest that one explanation for this inconsistency is a tendency to use incomplete or incorrect dynamic regression specifications. They derive three plausible dynamic empirical model specifications and compare their performance both with each other and with an ad hoc model typical of those used in the literature. Statistical tests support the use of more completely specified models which allow for dynamic adjustment of forest cover.",About Sufficiency
Eco-compensation for organic farms integrating internalities and externalities based on temporal and spatial heterogeneity,"There is an urgent demand to update eco-compensation standards for organic farming since unfair distribution that might hamper smallholders' incentives to green practices. However, the current payment method is inadequate because it fails to fully consider internalities (i.e., economic costs, labor opportunity costs) and externalities (i.e., environmental costs, ecosystem services), especially for organic farming households in ecologically sensitive regions. Hence, in this study, we presented a framework for reaching fair distribution of eco-compensation in organic farming under dynamic variations of internalities and externalities together with spatial heterogeneity. The core objective of this framework was maximizing the fairness of eco-compensation by allowing for spatial heterogeneity of the eco-compensation benchmark obtained by the net value of ecosystem services (NVES). Furthermore, the proposed framework was tested using a case study of tea production in Simao District, Puer City, Yunnan Province, China, involving conventional tea farms (CTFs), organic tea farms (OTFs), and organic rain tea farms (ORTFs). The results show that the NVES (OTFs = 17,446.06 USD center dot ha(-1)center dot a, ORTFs = 18,723.29 USD center dot ha(-1)center dot a, and CTFs = 15,274.67 USD center dot ha(-1)center dot a) accurately reflected the impact of organic farming on both nature and society. The benchmark dynamics analysis based on the bonding of the NVES and organic farming development stages indicate that the government only needs to provide eco-compensation during the initial and growth stages of organic farming. Moreover, the economic-ecological synergy scenario (OTFs = 2000.97 USD center dot ha(-1)center dot a, ORTFs = 3176.23 USD center dot ha(-1)center dot a) represented the most reasonable way of determining appropriate eco-compensation for organic farming. In summary, this framework offered policymakers a tool of determining the eco-compensation standards and distributing eco-compensation fairly to organic farmers based on temporal and spatial heterogeneity.",About Sufficiency
Eco-Innovations Transition of Agri-food Enterprises Into a Circular Economy,"Eco-innovations that reduce the environmental effect of manufacturing and consumption are seen as critical components of sustainable development and a critical component of the transition to a circular economy. Food systems address the issue of food waste, which is generally acknowledged as a cost to the economy, the environment, and society. Eco-innovations seem to be critical for the food system's transformation to a more circular model centered on sustainable food production and processing. The goal of this paper was to determine the variables that influenced the introduction of product, process, organizational, and marketing innovations in European Union agri-food enterprises between 2012 and 2014. According to a preliminary analysis of the data, 57.40% of agribusinesses did not implement any form of innovation, which prompted the authors to study the difficulties surrounding innovation development over the 3-year reference period. Several key factors emerge as significant influences on the introduction of product innovations (0.055*); contractual requirements as significant influences on the introduction of process innovations (-0.081*); and environmental incentives as significant influences on the introduction of marketing innovations (0.062*). Additionally, product (0.704*) and process (1.051*) innovations tend to have a greater influence on enterprises' views of circular benefits. The investigation also demonstrates how enterprises and end users interpret the effect of various forms of innovation differently. Indeed, end users, in contrast to how enterprises understand it, believe that organizational (0.611*) and marketing (0.916*) innovations are critical in pursuing circular benefits.",About Sufficiency
"Ecological impact of tobacco farming in miombo woodlands of Urambo District, Tanzania","This paper examines the ecological threat of tobacco farming in Urambo District, the leading producer of flue-cured tobacco in Tanzania with other major producers being Tabora, Iringa and Chunya Districts. Structured interviews were conducted in four villages while 39 Modified-Whittacker plots were laid in tobacco fallow lands for inventory of woody species to ascertain ecological performance and the impact of tobacco on species diversity, richness and standing stock functions. There was higher than expected species richness with a total of 115 tree and shrub species identified. Tobacco farming showed no significant negative effect on the floristic composition and stem density. However, the significantly reduced biomass and change in vegetation structure illustrate the potential loss in ecological function of the woodlands. Land clearing for tobacco planting account to an annual deforestation of 3.5% while on average a farmer requires 23 m(3) of stacked wood only for curing per season which adds another 3% of deforestation. Shifting cultivation is no longer sustainable given the shortened fallow periods of 4 years. Improved barn structures, alternative sources of fuel like coal, tree planting, mixed cropping and cash crops that are environment friendly are recommended for ecological restoration.",About Sufficiency

However, the lack of precise information and the presence of multiple interconnected factors makes it difficult to assess the potential socioeconomic benefits and therefore the decision-making process of food loss reduction strategies. MethodsA case study approach has been used to assess the economic loss and nutrional impact of food loss in the horticulture primary production. The selection of the main vegetable products was based on an historical series while economic and nutritional impact were estimated starting from national and European indicator. ResultsThe food loss correspond to 26% of the total production and 14% of the total agricultural production economic value. The social analysis confirm the possibility of redistributing food loss among the population even in the most critical months and areas. DiscussionThe combination of social and economic indicator resulted essential to provide key information at the decision-making level to pave the way for the elaboration of short- and long-term food loss reduction strategies. Indeed, no single-bullet strategy can be applied to overcome the problem of food loss as many actor with different needs are involved.",About Sufficiency
Effect of Biochar on Soil Greenhouse Gas Emissions at the Laboratory and Field Scales,"Biochar application to soil has been proposed as a means for reducing soil greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. The effects, however, of interactions between biochar, moisture and temperature on soil CO2 and N2O emissions, remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the applicability of lab-scale observations to field conditions in diverse agroecosystems remains uncertain. Here we investigate the impact of a mixed wood gasification biochar on CO2 and N2O emissions from loess-derived soils using: (1) controlled laboratory incubations at three moisture (27, 31 and 35%) and three temperature (10, 20 and 30 degrees C) levels and (2) a field study with four cropping systems (continuous corn, switchgrass, low diversity grass mix and high diversity grass-forb mix). Biochar reduced N2O emissions under specific temperatures and moistures in the laboratory and in the continuous corn cropping system in the field. However, the effect of biochar on N2O emissions was only significant in the field and no effect on cumulative CO2 emissions was observed. Cropping system also had a significant effect in the field study, with soils in grass and grass-forb cropping systems emitting more CO2 and less N2O than corn cropping systems. Observed biochar effects were consistent with previous studies showing that biochar amendments can reduce soil N2O emissions under specific but not all, conditions. The disparity in N2O emission responses at the lab and field scales suggests that laboratory incubation experiments may not reliably predict the impact of biochar at the field scale.",About Sufficiency
"Effect of Compost Derived from Urban Waste on Chard (Beta vulgaris L., var cycla) Yield and Soil GHG Fluxes in a Mediterranean Agricultural System","The use of recycled materials as soil amendments and fertilizers is an important priority in the agronomic sector to valorize waste from a circular economic perspective and reduce waste disposal, reduce dependence on external inputs, and provide better climate change mitigation options. In this study, we evaluated the agroecological performance of compost derived from recycled organic matrices of urban waste (mixed composted amendment, MCA) of the metropolitan area of Rome. MCA is available in big quantities and might represent an interesting option to substitute conventional mineral nitrogen fertilizer (CF). The effect of MCA, CF, and a combination of both (MIX 1:1) was tested on crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions in a field trial on a common Mediterranean crop (Swiss chart, one season, two crop cycles). The MCA effect on crop yield was positive and comparable to CF and MIX treatments, while MCA treatment showed the lower soil mineral nitrogen (N) content. GHG emissions in the MCA treatment were comparable to those observed in CF and MIX, being overall quite low. The soil acted as a weak net CH4 sink in all treatments (-12.6 +/- 6.1 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1)); no differences in CO2 emissions between MCA and CF or MIX treatments were observed (range 0.1-0.2 g m(-2) h(-1)). The N2O emission intensity of MCA was slightly lower than MIX and CF treatments (0.09, 0.011, and 0.011 g N2O kg(-1) crop dry weight, respectively).

Effect of mechanical separation on emissions during storage of two anaerobically codigested animal slurries,"Emissions of ammonia and greenhouse gases from animal manure are an environmental concern and new techniques should be carefully examined to establish their effect on emissions across the whole management continuum, including storage operations. Biogas plants are becoming more common at farm facilities and the management of digestate raises some concerns regarding potential emissions to the air when mechanical separation is adopted. The aim of this study was to evaluate how mechanical separation affects ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions from the storage of different fractions obtained from separation of codigested pig and cattle slurries. A laboratory scale experiment was carried out in a temperature controlled room where 25 L of unseparated digestate and the relative solid and liquid fractions were stored in duplicates for 32 days at 17 degrees C. Each manure was sampled weekly for chemical analysis (total nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen, total solids, volatile solids and pH). Potential emissions from agitated samples were estimated twice a week using a dynamic chamber technique and acid traps for ammonia and a trace gas analyser for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Results from chemical analyses indicated that mechanical separation of digested manure increased nitrogen losses during storage when both separated fractions are taken into account, by 35 and 86% for the pig and cattle slurries, respectively. However, the flux measurements from the agitated samples showed that there was a lower potential for ammonia emissions during storage for the separated fractions than the digested unseparated slurry (9 and 23% reductions for the pig and cattle slurries, respectively), probably due to the lower TAN concentration of the liquid fraction. The treatment resulted in a significant reduction (40%) of GHG emissions for cattle slurries but had no consistent effect for pig effluents. The results of this study suggest that adoption of mitigation techniques should be considered for the management of the liquid and solid fractions of digestates in order to reduce the increased environmental impact during storage.

Effect of ramial chipped wood and poultry manure amendments on soil chemical properties and fungal communities in Benin,"This study investigated effects of soil amendments with ramial chipped wood (RCW) derived from Gmelina arborea and Sarcocephalus latifolius, together with poultry manure, on soil chemical properties and fungal communities in northern and southern Benin. The trial was a split-plot experiment, where treatments included volume of irrigation water (V1 and V2 = 0.5 *V1) as the whole-plot factor, with organic amendment (45 t/ha RCW; 15 t/ha poultry manure, PM; 45 t/ha RCW + 15 t/ha of PM, RCW_PM; and control) as the sub-plot factor. Topsoil was sampled before and after 24 months of in situ organic amendment application. Humic acid (HA) was extracted from soil and purified prior to FTIR spectroscopy, NMR, and Py-GC-MS analyses. RCW treatments (RCW and RCW_PM) contributed substantially to organic carbon storage and soil nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) increases (the latter by up to 1.5 times) compared to the control. Accordingly, soils that were amended with the RCW produced significant amounts of HA. High concentrations of lignin-related compounds were determined in pyrolysis products from humic acids in the RCW-amended soils. Using ITS2 region sequencing on the Illumina Miseq platform, RCW amendments markedly altered fungal compositions, with increased relative abundance of Ascomycota (up to 92% of total fungal community), Mucoromycota (2.7%), Basidiomycota (2.5%) and Rozel-lomycota (0.3%). These fungal phyla contain species that participate in organic matter decomposition and compound transformations but did not selectively degrade lignin in RCW. Our results suggest that RCW amendments significantly increased fungal activity and improved soil nutrient availability.

The aim of our study was investigation of infecting of purple coneflower with viruses under conditions of organic farming. An effective use of organic farming element in medicinal plants cultivation on the example of infection of purple coneflower of 1st and 2d year of vegetation with viruses is revealed. The research results showed that the economically important purple coneflower viruses in Bulgaria are AMV, CMV, TSWV, TMV and PVY. In Ukraine, it was found that the purple coneflower plants are infected with TSWV - in 2012, PVY - in 2013, and TRV - in 2014.

Seed coats of winter wheat were treated by synthetical compounds (benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, and glycine betaine) or by the extracts from plants (oak, giant knotweed, curcuma, and ginger). Then the seeds were planted using small-field experiments with powdery mildew infection (repetitions over a two-year period; experimental field in Ruzyne, Prague).

"Effects of Agriculture upon the Air Quality and Climate: Research, Policy, and Regulations","Scientific assessments of agricultural air quality, including estimates of emissions and potential sequestration of greenhouse gases, are an important emerging. area of environmental science that offers significant challenges to policy and regulatory authorities. Improvements are needed in measurements, modeling, emission controls, and farm operation management. Controlling emissions of gases and particulate matter from agriculture is notoriously difficult as this sector affects the most basic need of humans, i.e., food. Current policies combine an inadequate science covering a very disparate range of activities in a complex industry with social and political overlays. Moreover, agricultural emissions derive from both area and point sources. In the United States, agricultural emissions play an important role in several atmospherically mediated processes of environmental and public health concerns. These atmospheric processes affect local and regional environmental quality, including odor, particulate matter (PM) exposure, eutrophication, acidification, exposure to toxics, climate, and pathogens. Agricultural emissions also contribute to the global problems caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural emissions are variable in space and time and in how they interact within the various processes and media affected. Most important in the U.S. are ammonia (where agriculture accounts for similar to 90% of total emissions), reduced sulfur (unquantified), PM2.5 (similar to 16%), PM10 (similar to 18%), methane (similar to 29%), nitrous oxide (similar to 72%), and odor and emissions of pathogens (both unquantified). Agriculture also consumes fossil fuels for fertilizer production and farm operations, thus emitting carbon dioxide (CO2) oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulates. Current research priorities include the quantification of point and nonpoint sources, the biosphere-atmosphere exchange of ammonia, reduced sulfur compounds, volatile organic compounds, greenhouse gases, odor and pathogens, the quantification of landscape processes, and the primary and secondary emissions of PM. Given the serious concerns raised regarding the amount and the impacts of agricultural air emissions, policies must be pursued and regulations must be enacted in order to make real progress in reducing these emissions and their associated environmental impacts.",About Sufficiency
Effects of anthropogenic land cover change on the carbon cycle of the last millennium,"Transient simulations are performed over the entire last millennium with a general circulation model that couples the atmosphere, ocean, and the land surface with a closed carbon cycle. This setup applies a high-detail reconstruction of anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) as the only forcing to the climate system with two goals: (1) to isolate the effects of ALCC on the carbon cycle and the climate independently of any other natural and anthropogenic disturbance and (2) to assess the importance of preindustrial human activities. With ALCC as only forcing, the terrestrial biosphere experiences a net loss of 96 Gt C over the last millennium, leading to an increase of atmospheric CO2 by 20 ppm. The biosphere-atmosphere coupling thereby leads to a restoration of 37% and 48% of the primary emissions over the industrial (A. D. 1850-2000) and the preindustrial period (A.D. 800-1850), respectively. Because of the stronger coupling flux over the preindustrial period, only 21% of the 53 Gt C preindustrial emissions remain airborne. Despite the low airborne fraction, atmospheric CO2 rises above natural variability by late medieval times. This suggests that human influence on CO2 began prior to industrialization. Global mean temperatures, however, are not significantly altered until the strong population growth in the industrial period. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of historic events such as epidemics and warfare on the carbon budget. We find that only long-lasting events such as the Mongol invasion lead to carbon sequestration. The reason for this limited carbon sequestration is indirect emissions from past ALCC that compensate carbon uptake in regrowing vegetation for several decades. Drops in ice core CO2 are thus unlikely to be attributable to human action. Our results indicate that climate-carbon cycle studies for present and future centuries, which usually start from an equilibrium state around 1850, start from a significantly disturbed state of the carbon cycle.",About Sufficiency
Effects of bagasse biochar application on soil organic carbon fixation in manganese-contaminated sugarcane fields,"Background In recent years, there have been several studies on the remediation of heavy metal pollution in soil by the application of biochar. However, little attention has been paid to understanding the effects and underlying mechanisms of biochar on soil carbon sequestration in manganese- contaminated farmlands. Therefore, in this study, bagasse biochar was applied to the soil in different proportions (0%, 0.5%, 2%, and 5%) and the test was conducted indoors for 100 days at a constant temperature. Soil physical and chemical properties, organic carbon mineralization, organic carbon components, and enzyme activities were analyzed in this study. Results In this study, when compared with the control, the application of 0.5%, 2%, and 5% bagasse biochar to the manganese-contaminated sugarcane field soil effectively reduced the cumulative CO2 emissions, i.e., decreased by 123.18 mg.kg(-1), 208.28 mg.kg(-1), and 287.79 mg.kg(-1), respectively. Among the different treatment groups, the highest decrease in cumulative CO2 emissions was observed in the 5% bagasse biochar-treated soil when compared with the control. The application of bagasse biochar increased the soil microbial biomass carbon content by 12.72 mg.kg(-1), 13.71 mg.kg(-1), and 15.10 mg.kg(-1), respectively when compared with the control. The soil nutrients and enzyme activities significantly increased with the increase in biochar application amount. Conclusions The application of bagasse biochar to manganese- contaminated sugarcane soil field effectively inhibited the mineralization of soil organic carbon, improved the carbon sequestration potential of manganese-contaminated sugarcane field soil, and provided a theoretical basis for the carbon sequestration mechanism in manganesecontaminated farmland soil.",About Sufficiency
"Effects of nitrification and urease inhibitors on ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms, denitrifying bacteria, and greenhouse gas emissions in greenhouse vegetable fields","Soil microorganisms and N cycling are important components of biogeochemical cycling processes. In addition, the study of the effects of nitrification and urease inhibitors on N and microorganisms in greenhouse vegetable fields is essential to reducing N loss and greenhouse gas emissions. The effects of nitrification inhibitors [2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl) pyridine (CP), dicyandiamide (DCD)], and urease inhibitor [N-(n-butyl) thiophos-phoric triamide (NBPT)] on soil inorganic N (NH4+-N, NO2-N and NO3-N) concentrations and the production rates of greenhouse gases (N2O, CH4, and CO2) in greenhouse vegetable fields were investigated via indoor incubation experiments. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and high-throughput sequencing technology (Illumina Miseq) were used to explore the community structure and abundance changes of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and denitrifying bacteria (nirK and nirS). The results showed that CP and DCD obviously inhibited NH4+-N conversion, and NO2-N, and NO3-N accumulation, NBPT slowed down urea hydrolysis and NH4+-N production, and the apparent nitrification rates of soil were in the following order: NBPT > DCD > DCD + NBPT > CP + NBPT > CP. Compared with urea treatment, the peak N2O production rate of inhibitor treatment decreased by 73.30-99.30%, and the production rate of CH4 and CO2 decreased by more than 66.16%. DCD and CP reduced the abundance of AOA and AOB, respectively. Further-more, NBPT hindered the growth of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms and nirS-type denitrifying bacteria, and urea and nitrification inhibitors were detrimental to the growth of Ensifer and Sinorhizobium in the nirK com-munity. Nitrification and urease inhibitors can effectively slow down nitrification and greenhouse gas emissions, reduce N loss and improve soil quality by inhibiting the growth of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms and denitrifying bacteria.",About Sufficiency

How these 3 forms of rarity interact in determining global responses to land use is yet to be assessed. Using global data representing 912 vertebrate species, we tested for differences in responses to land use of species characterized by different types of rarity. Land-use responses were fitted using generalized linear mixed-effects models, allowing responses to vary among groups of species with different forms of rarity. Species considered rare with respect to all 3 forms of rarity showed particularly strong declines in disturbed land uses (>40% of species and 30% of individuals in the most disturbed land uses). In contrast, species common both geographically and numerically and with broad habitat requirements showed strong increases (up to 90% increase in species and 40% in abundance in some land uses). Our results suggest that efforts to understand the vulnerability of species to environmental changes should account for different types of rarity where possible. Our results also have potentially important implications for ecosystem functioning, given that rare species may play unique roles within ecosystems.",About Sufficiency
Effects of row spacing and liquid manure on directly drilled winter wheat in organic farming,"In the optimisation of grain yield and quality of wheat, plant distribution is a key factor. In contrast to high yield levels, at moderate levels. widening the row space did not decrease grain yield. To gain information about changes in the quality and yield with changing in row spacings in organic farming systems, experiments were conducted at two locations in the Swiss midlands in 2001/2002. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Titlis) was directly drilled in rows 0.1875 and 0.3750 in apart at the same seeding rate per area. An unfertilised treatment and the usual application of 60 m(3) ha(-1) liquid farmyard manure were compared. While the grain yield was not decreased by the wider row spacing, the thousand kernel weight (TKW), and grain protein content were increased from 42.6 to 43.5 a and from 11.7 to 12.7 %, respectively, compared to the narrow row spacing. Liquid manure, on average of both experimental sites, increased the yield (from 3.725 to 4.765 Mg ha(-1)) and the grain protein content (from 12.0 to 12.5 %). Doubling the space between the rows from 0.1875 to 0.3750 in seemed to be a suitable strategy for managing directly drilled winter wheat in organic farming systems. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of simulated acid rain on soil fauna community composition and their ecological niches,"Acid rain is one of the severest environmental issues globally. Relative to other global changes (e.g., warming, elevated atmospheric [CO2], and nitrogen deposition), however, acid rain has received less attention than its due. Soil fauna play important roles in multiple ecological processes, but how soil fauna community responds to acid rain remains less studied. This microcosm experiment was conducted using latosol with simulated acid rain (SAR) manipulations to observe potential changes in soil fauna community under acid rain stress. Four pH levels, i.e., pH 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5, and a neutral control of pH 7.0 were set according to the current pH condition and acidification trend of precipitation in southern China. As expected, we observed that the SAR treatments induced changes in soil fauna community composition and their ecological niches in the tested soil; the treatment effects tended to increase as acidity increased. This could be attributable to the environmental stresses (such as acidity, porosity and oxygen supply) induced by the SAR treatments. In addition to direct acidity effect, we propose that potential changes in permeability and movability of water and oxygen in soils induced by acid rain could also give rise to the observed shifts in soil fauna community composition. These are most likely indirect pathways of acid rain to affect belowground community. Moreover, we found that nematodes, the dominating soil fauna group in this study, moved downwards to mitigate the stress of acid rain. This is probably detrimental to soil fauna in the long term, due to the relatively severer soil conditions in the deep than surface soil layer. Our results suggest that acid rain could change soil fauna community and the vertical distribution of soil fauna groups, consequently changing the underground ecosystem functions such as organic matter decomposition and greenhouse gas emissions.

Effects of Winter Cover Crops Straws Incorporation on CH4 and N2O Emission from Double-Cropping Paddy Fields in Southern China,"Residue management in cropping systems is believed to improve soil quality. However, the effects of residue management on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from paddy field in Southern China have not been well researched. The emissions of CH4 and N2O were investigated in double cropping rice (Oryza sativa L.) systems with straw returning of different winter cover crops by using the static chamber-gas chromatography technique. A randomized block experiment with three replications was established in 2004 in Hunan Province, China, including rice-rice-ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) (Ry-R-R), rice-rice-Chinese milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus L.) (Mv-R-R) and rice-rice with winter fallow (Fa-R-R). The results showed that straw returning of winter crops significantly increased the CH4 emission during both rice growing seasons when compared with Fa-R-R. Ry-R-R plots had the largest CH4 emissions during the early rice growing season with 14.235 and 15.906 g m(-2) in 2012 and 2013, respectively, when Ry-R-R plots had the largest CH4 emission during the later rice growing season with 35.673 and 38.606 g m(-2) in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The Ry-R-R and Mv-R-R also had larger N2O emissions than Fa-R-R in both rice seasons. When compared to Fa-R-R, total N2O emissions in the early rice growing season were increased by 0.05 g m(-2) in Ry-R-R and 0.063 g m(-2) in Mv-R-R in 2012, and by 0.058 g m(-2) in Ry-R-R and 0.068 g m(-2) in Mv-R-R in 2013, respectively. Similar result were obtained in the late rice growing season, and the total N2O emissions were increased by 0.104 g m(-2) in Ry-R-R and 0.073 g m(-2) in Mv-R-R in 2012, and by 0.108 g m(-2) in Ry-R-R and 0.076 g m(-2) in Mv-R-R in 2013, respectively. The global warming potentials (GWPs) from paddy fields were ranked as Ry-R-R>Mv-R-R> Fa-R-R. As a result, straw returning of winter cover crops has significant effects on increase of CH4 and N2O emission from paddy field in double cropping rice system.",About Sufficiency

STARTUP STAGES OF A LOW-TECH AQUAPONIC SYSTEM,"The goal of the project was to establish a low-tech cheap sustainable food production system that combines traditional fish farming with hydroponics (cultivating plants using mineral nutrient solutions, in water, without soil), in a symbiotic environment. We used local fish and plants species only. The project was conducted in two different stages: ""construction"" stage and ""fish"" stage. The goal of the start-up stage was to build the grow bed for the plants, to establish the water circuit, to set the lights and to prepare the fish tank for the fishes. For the ""fish"" stage we used local fish species (carp and caras). The goal of the stage was to build the nitrogen-fixing bacteria colonies in order to provide a constant NO3- rich water (around 50 mg/l), with as low as possible traces of NH3/NH4+ and NO2 (below 0,5 mg/l). This was established by testing the NH3/NH4+, NO2- and NO3- values under several environmental changes (pH, temperature, lighting, quantity of fish in the tank etc.) in order to identify the best combinations to achieve the goal. Upon completion of the second stage we'll test different local species of plants with the already established system. The goal of the project is to find the best combinations of fish, plants and environmental conditions in order to have a cheap, sustainable symbiotic food production system, easy to be replicated by anyone.",About Sufficiency
Emerging nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria for sustainable cotton cultivation,"Amid growing environmental concerns and the imperative for sustainable agricultural practices, this study examines the potential of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria as biofertilizers, particularly in cotton cultivation. The reliance on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers (SNFs), prevalent in modern agriculture, poses significant environmental challenges, including greenhouse gas emissions and water system contamination. This research aims to shift this paradigm by exploring the capacity of cyanobacteria as a natural and sustainable alternative. Utilizing advanced metabarcoding methods to analyze the 16S rRNA gene, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of soil bacterial communities within cotton fields. This study focused on evaluating the diversity, structure, taxonomic composition, and potential functional characteristics of these communities. Emphasis was placed on the isolation of native N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria strains rom cotton soils, and their subsequent effects on cotton growth. Results from our study demonstrate significant plant growth-promoting (PGP) activities, measured as N 2 fixation, production of Phytohormones, Fe solubilization and biofertilization potential of five isolated cyanobacterial strains, underscoring their efficacy in cotton. These findings suggest a viable pathway for replacing chemical-synthetic nitrogen fertilizers with natural, organic alternatives. The reintegration of these beneficial species into agricultural ecosystems can enhance crop growth while fostering a balanced microbial environment, thus contributing to the broader goals of global sustainable agriculture.",About Sufficiency
Emission and Sink of Greenhouse Gases in Soils of Moscow,"The first inventory and zoning of the emission and sink of methane and carbon dioxide in the urban structure of greenhouse gases from soils and surface technogenic formations (STFs) (Technosols) on technogenic, recrementogenic, and natural sediments have been performed with consideration for the global warming potential under conditions of different formation rate of these gases, underflooding, and sealing. From gas geochemical criteria and anthropogenic pedogenesis features, the main sources of greenhouse gases, their intensity, and mass emission were revealed. The mass fractions of emissions from the sectors of waste and land use in the inventories of greenhouse gas emissions have been determined. New sources of gas emission have been revealed in the first sector, the emissions from which add tens of percent to the literature and state reports. In the second sector, emissions exceed the available data in 70 times. Estimation criteria based on the degree of manifestation and chemical composition of soil-geochemical anomalies and barrier capacities have been proposed. The sink of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and the internal (latent) sink of methane in soils and STFs have been determined. Ecological functions of soils and STFs have been shown, and the share of latent methane sink has been calculated. The bacterial oxidation of methane in soils and STFs exceeds its emission to the atmosphere in almost hundred times.",About Sufficiency

Energetic and Economic Analyses for Agricultural Management Models: The Calabria PGI Clementine Case Study,"Farming systems need to be planned to provide suitable levels of economic profitability and, at the same time, ensure an effective energy use, in order to perform environmentally friendly production strategies. The herein present work aims to assess the efficiency of energy use and economic impacts of the main farming methods (conventional, organic and integrated) of Clementine's crops in Calabria (South Italy), through a combined use of Life Cycle Energy Assessment (LCEA) approach and economic analysis. For this purpose, data were collected from clementine producers by using face-to-face interviews. The results revealed that average energy consumption in the organic farming systems was 72,739 MJ, lower than conventional and integrated systems equal to 95,848 MJ and 94,060 MJ, respectively. This is mainly due to the ban of chemicals. Economic analysis showed that organic farms were more profitable compared with the other farming methods, because of the greater selling price and the EU economic support, reaching an average net profit of 4255 Euro ha(-1) against 3134 Euro ha(-1) of integrated farms and 2788 Euro ha(-1) of conventional ones.

Energy crops: Prospects in the context of sustainable agriculture,"The objectives of this review are to analyse the potential of bioenergy crops development in European agriculture and to identify research objectives based on transformation technologies. Bioenergy is the chemical energy stored in organic material, which can be directly converted into useful energy sources by biological, mechanical or thermochemical processes. The substitution of food crops with energy crops and the demand for agricultural raw materials for liquid biofuel production will affect agriculture over the next decade and possibly beyond. It is expected that both second-generation biofuel production technology and energy crops used will be more efficient than first-generation. Nonetheless, there are still technical limitations for crop growth and fuel production from second-generation technology. In general, many of the crops that could supply the raw materials for second-generation biofuels are largely undomesticated and are in the first stages of development and management. The development of specific crops dedicated to energy has been proposed as a strategy to produce energy without affecting food security and the environment. The research seeks to develop enzymatic systems for the cost-efficient decomposition of cellulose into its molecular sugar components, which can then be fermented to produce ethanol. This biorefinery of crops into multiple products, including energy, chemical products and materials, will augment the overall value of the biomass. Clearly, multidisciplinary research is necessary to address sustainable biofuel production. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in selected tea factories in Kenya,"Tea sector is a major contributor to Kenya's economy through foreign exchange via export. However, extensive amount of energy is required to produce one kilogram of tea, making tea processing energy-intensive. Comparing greenhouse gas emissions from different types of energy consumed in tea factories is imperative to enable policymakers make informed intervention in emission reduction. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in tea factories is one of the pathways to meeting Kenya's nationally determined 32% reduction of carbon emissions by 2030 and commitment to the Paris Agreement. This paper assesses greenhouse gas emissions from different sources of energy used in four tea factories in Kenya. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission factor is used to calculate the total emissions of each type of energy used for 5 years. Life cycle assessment using SimaPro 8 software, Eco-indicator 99 method and Eco invent database was used to assess the specific compound causing the emission. The findings reveal that the 5-year greenhouse gas emissions by biogas, solar, wood, briquettes, and electricity are 336.111, 7.108, 3057.729, and 1,338.28 kg CO2/MWh, respectively. Firewood has the highest concentration of carbon dioxide, while solar energy has the least. Analysis of variance confirms significant difference (0.05>p = 0.0272) in greenhouse gas emissions from the different energy sources. Post-hoc analyses shows a significant difference in emissions between solar and firewood (p<0.0125) and no significant difference between other sources of energy. The key environmental hotspot is the energy intensive processes such as drying involved in tea production and processing, which leads to consumption of fossil fuel in the factories. To reduce such key hotspot, switching to renewable energy sources is key. Sustainability in the tea sector can therefore be achieved through switching to macadamia briquettes as a source of thermal energy and a combination of electricity and solar for electrical energy.",About Sufficiency
"Energy, economic and environmental impact analysis of phase change materials for cold chain transportation in Malaysia","The tropical climate of Malaysia presents higher environmental temperatures ranging from 27 to 31 degrees C and refrigerated semi-trailer trucks are utilized in cold chain transportation which is subjected to high thermal stresses and leads to elevated refrigeration load requirements. This subsequently causes a surge in diesel fuel consumption by the auxiliary refrigeration unit and greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. To address the issue, this research evaluates the integration of phase change material (PCM) in refrigerated vehicle walls for latent heat storage purposes, which consequently reduces refrigeration load. Reference cases without PCM and 10 different PCM cases of commercially available organic-based paraffin PCM are investigated, whereby the conventional insulation method of a refrigerated semi-trailer is modified by adding a layer of PCM within its envelope, to simulate refrigeration loads during an 8-hour vehicle operational period. The PCMs are assessed based on their physicochemical properties, and performance in energy savings, economic, and environmental benefits. Results show that daily refrigeration loads can be reduced up to 34.4 % upon PCM integration in refrigerated vehicle walls, and besides, economically, the solution is highly profitable with a benefit-cost ratio above 1. The highest performing PCMs in terms of energy savings yield short payback periods of < 3 years, which are at least 2.6 times lesser than the vehicle's lifetime, whilst providing greenhouse gas emission savings of above 2700 kgCO(2)/year. This research indeed serves as a starting point to explore the large-scale usage of PCMs in cold chain transportation in Malaysia.",About Sufficiency
Enhanced Ecosystem Services in China's Xilingol Steppe during 2000-2015: Towards Sustainable Agropastoralism Management,"Ecosystem services (ESs) provided by dryland regions are very vulnerable to environmental dynamics and management transformation, and it is still unclear how these services will be affected by the combined effects of accelerated climate variability and land-use changes at a regional macro level. In this study, the status, patterns and trends of ESs provided by the Xilingol steppe were quantitatively evaluated, and the impact of climate and land-use change on ESs were discussed. The results showed that favorable climatic conditions and the implementation of ecological policies had a substantial positive impact on regional vegetation restoration during 2000-2015. As a result of the vegetation greening, water retention and carbon sequestration increased significantly at rates of 16.01 m(3) ha(-1) and 1.75 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Soil loss caused by wind erosion, an ecosystem disservice, decreased significantly at a rate of -0.57 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Although several environmental factors had differing impacts on the ESs changes in the subregions, including the meadow, typical and desert steppes, the main factors that contributed to the enhancement of overall ESs benefits were the climatic humidification and the reduced grazing pressure in the entire study area. The above conclusion shows that, in the era of climate change, the implementation of sustainable farming-pastoral strategies can realize a ""win-win"" situation between ecological restoration and socioeconomic development in arid and semi-arid steppes.",About Sufficiency

The aim of this paper is to record the region-specific current practices of entomophagy and their implications in food security. The study involved field investigation to find out the pattern of entomophagy among the scheduled tribes of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR), Assam. Following this, we made an effort to estimate the diversity of edible insects at different sampling sites in the studied area. Nutritional profiling of some of the edible insects was carried out to know their potential as a measure of food security. A total of 25 edible insects belonging to 9 orders and 18 families were recorded during the study period. Species diversity was recorded highest in forest/backyard forest habitat followed by agricultural field habitat, open field habitat and swampy area habitat in all the four districts in BTR, Assam. During the consumer survey, a total of 4,051 people belonging to four different scheduled tribes, Bodo, Rabha, Garo and Sarania were interviewed and out of them, 3,840 (94.79%) people were found to consume insects as food. The insects are mostly consumed in fried form, followed by smoked, raw, paste, roasted and curry form. The biochemical analysis of nutrient contents of 11 commonly consumed edible insects showed that they are a rich source of protein, vitamins and micronutrients with a reasonable amount of carbohydrates and lipids with higher radical scavenging activity.

Environmental efficiency of alternative dairy systems: A productive efficiency approach,"Agriculture across the globe needs to produce ""more with less."" Productivity should be increased in a sustainable manner so that the environment is not further degraded, management practices are both socially acceptable and economically favorable, and future generations are not disadvantaged. The objective of this paper was to compare the environmental efficiency of 2 divergent strains of Holstein-Friesian cows across 2 contrasting dairy management systems (grazing and non-grazing) over multiple years and so expose any genetic x environment (G x E) interaction. The models were an extension of the traditional efficiency analysis to account for undesirable outputs (pollutants), and estimate efficiency measures that allow for the asymmetric treatment of desirable outputs (i.e., milk production) and undesirable outputs. Two types of models were estimated, one considering production inputs (land, nitrogen fertilizers, feed, and cows) and the other not, thus allowing the assessment of the effect of inputs by comparing efficiency values and rankings between models. Each model type had 2 versions, one including 2 types of pollutants (greenhouse gas emissions, nitrogen surplus) and the other 3 (greenhouse gas emissions, nitrogen surplus, and phosphorus surplus). Significant differences were found between efficiency scores among the systems. Results indicated no G x E interaction; however, even though the select genetic merit herd consuming a diet with a higher proportion of concentrated feeds was most efficient in the majority of models, cows of the same genetic merit on higher forage diets could be just as efficient. Efficiency scores for the low forage groups were less variable from year to year, which reflected the uniformity of purchased concentrate feeds. The results also indicate that inputs play an important role in the measurement of environmental efficiency of dairy systems and that animal health variables (incidence of udder health disorders and body condition score) have a significant effect on the environmental efficiency of each dairy system. We conclude that traditional narrow measures of performance may not always distinguish dairy farming systems best fitted to future requirements.",About Sufficiency

European environmental policies face with the challenge of increasing farmers economic gain not conflicting with environmental aim at the same time, to meet targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The paper aims to contribute to the discussion on CO2 emission mitigation by providing efficiency performance measures in the presence of joint production of milk and GHG emissions. A Slacks-Based Measure-Data Envelopment Analysis (SBM-DEA) with undesirable output was adopted and integrated with Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) results from 10 dairy cattle farms in Umbria (Italy) to estimate their environmental efficiency and emission reduction potential. In addition, the dual model of the SBM-DEA was used to quantify the marginal CO2 reduction costs. Four farms resulted in no CO2-eq emission efficient, with a reduction potential ranging from 45.7% to 26.3% of CO2-eq. An average abatement cost of (sic) 243.08 in terms of lower milk production per ton of CO2-eq reduced, was estimated for the whole sample. A positive relationship between marginal abatement costs and CO2-eq efficiency scores was estimated. Marginal abatement costs knowledge could allow assessing the economic impacts of different farms strategies aimed at reducing polluting emissions, as well as the introduction of incentive mechanisms by public decision makers.

Environmental filtering controls soil biodiversity in wet tropical ecosystems,"The environmental factors controlling soil biodiversity along resource gradients remain poorly understood in wet tropical ecosystems. Aboveground biodiversity is expected to be driven by changes in nutrient availability in these ecosystems, however, much less is known about the importance of nutrient availability in driving soil biodiversity. Here, we combined a cross-continental soil survey across tropical regions with a three decades' field experiment adding nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) (100 kg N ha(-1)y(-1) and 100 kg P ha(-1)y(-1)) to Hawai'ian tropical forests with contrasting substrate ages (300 and 4,100,000 years) to investigate the influence of nutrient availability to explain the biodiversity of soil bacteria, fungi, protists, invertebrates and key functional genes. We found that soil biodiversity was driven by soil acidification during long-term pedogenesis and across environmental gradients, rather than by nutrient limitations. In fact, our results showed that experimental N additions caused substantial acidification in soils from Hawai'i. These declines in pH were related to large decreases in soil biodiversity from tropical ecosystems in four continents. Moreover, the microbial activity did not change in response to long-term N and P additions. We concluded that environmental filtering drives the biodiversity of multiple soil organisms, and that the acidification effects associated with N additions can further create substantial undesired net negative effects on overall soil biodiversity in naturally tropical acid soils.

Environmentally sustainable hospital foodservices: Drawing on staff perspectives to guide change,"Foodservice is a key contributor to environmental impacts of the healthcare sector, in particular hospitals. Driving towards sustainable solutions in foodservices can bring financial and social benefits, whilst allowing hospitals to position themselves as leaders towards a sustainable food system and healthcare sector. Such a change depends on those working directly or indirectly with foodservices. Staff possess valuable knowledge, ideas, motivation and responsibility for improving the environmental sustainability of the foodservice system. The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of staff working across the hospital food supply chain towards: (1) sustainable practices in hospital food provision; (2) existing barriers and enablers; and (3) recommendations for implementing sustainable foodservice practices in the future. Through qualitative inquiry, semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals at operational and management levels responsible for policy, purchasing, production, onsite plating and delivery and waste disposal at three hospitals in Australia. Framework analysis was used to synthesise transcribed data into practices, barriers and enablers, and recommendations. Interviews (n=46 participants) identified current sustainable practices including those related to recyclable packaging, effective equipment and technology and efficient processes. Unsustainable practices included restrictions on sourcing food, packaging that cannot be separated or recycled, rigid foodservice models and menu, waste production and processes. Enablers to improve sustainability included the power of individuals to influence change, education on recycling, knowledge generation, audits and grants for innovative research, rebates and quality improvement processes. Barriers included competing priorities, poor communication, lack of training opportunities and knowledge, infection control restrictions, lack of policy, funding, and time between meal ordering and delivery. Participants proposed practice changes across the food supply chain and recommended generation and sharing of knowledge, leadership and policy support. Perspectives of individuals within foodservice reveal shared motivation and desire for sustainable foodservices, with support needed from leaders and policy. Future research should use a co-design approach involving staff to create and implement sustainable strategies within hospitals. To see widespread and timely change, action is needed towards effective and meaningful policy. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"European biorefineries: Implications for land, trade and employment","Biorefineries are expected to play a major role in a future low carbon economy and substantial investments are being made to support this vision. However, it is important to consider the wider socio-economic impacts of such a transition. This paper quantifies the potential trade, employment and land impacts of economically viable European biorefinery options based on indigenous straw and wood feedstocks. It illustrates how there could be potential for 70-80 European biorefineries, but not hundreds. A single facility could generate tens of thousands of man-years of employment and employment creation per unit of feedstock is higher than for biomass power plants. However, contribution to national GDP is unlikely to exceed 1% in European member states, although contributions to national agricultural productivity may be more significant, particularly with straw feedstocks. There is also a risk that biorefinery development could result in reduced rates of straw incorporation into soil, raising concerns that economically rational decisions to sell rather than reincorporate straw could result in increased agricultural land-use or greenhouse gas emissions.

Evolution of farm-level crop diversification and response to rainfall shocks in smallholder farming: Evidence from Malawi and Tanzania,"This study investigates how exposure to short and long-term measures of rainfall shocks and past crop diversification decisions influence subsequent diversification in Malawi and Tanzania. We use balanced household panel data combined with corresponding historical monthly weather data to achieve our aim. Crop diversification is studied as a state-contingent risky investment decision that households make before the state of nature is revealed. We model crop diversification decisions using correlated and dynamic random effects panel Poisson and Tobit models that control for unobserved heterogeneity in household crop diversification decisions plus initial conditions that may influence crop diversification across space and time. We establish that smallholder farmers in Malawi and Tanzania respond to rainfall shocks by diversifying their crop portfolios and that crop diversification decisions are state-dependent. Thus, farmers with knowledge and experience gained from past crop diversification have elevated chances to intensify subsequent crop diversification and adapt to recurrent rainfall shocks. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the relatively better-off farmers with sufficient land and non land household assets to a greater extent diversify the crop portfolio post-drought shock exposure. Pro-poor policies addressing seed access constraints are needed to support diversification and adaptation to shocks.",About Sufficiency
Evolution of soil salinity and the critical ratio of drainage to irrigation (CRDI) in the Weigan Oasis in the Tarim Basin,"Soil salt accumulation and salt leaching are very important issues for a long-term irrigation-dominated oasis with shallow groundwater in arid land. The critical ratio of drainage to irrigation (CRDI) was defined and determined to help the guide drainage and irrigation practices and maintain sustainable oasis agricultural development. This study aimed to identify the soil salinity evolution under long-term irrigation and to determine the threshold of irrigation to drainage with land-use change and groundwater depth by regression, water and salt balance, and geostatistical analysis. The results showed that the soil salinity in 0-20 cm soil depth has decreased greatly in the Weigan Oasis over the past 60 years, with an annual average decrease of 0.68 g.kg(-1) in the Weigan Oasis. The soil salt content generally increases from inside to outside of the region and varies from the upperstream to downstream. In the past 30 years, land-use change has caused a sharp reduction in the salinity in the region, and the process of irrigation and drainage has made a decrease in the total salt of the irrigated district of 207.38 x 10(5) t. Meanwhile, shallow groundwater depth and salinity are the main factors influencing soil salinization in this fluvial oasis. A CRDI is determined to be 8.20% in the Weigan Oasis. In conclusion, our study provides scientific support for the prevention and control of regional soil salinization, as well as a managerial basis for the rational allocation of water resources in long-term irrigation-dominated oasis.",About Sufficiency
Examining the Economic Impacts of Climate Change on Net Crop Income in the Ethiopian Nile Basin: A Ricardian Fixed Effect Approach,"Climate change affects crop production by distorting the indestructible productive power of the land. The objective of this study is to examine the economic impacts of climate change on net crop income in Nile Basin Ethiopia using a Ricardian fixed effect approach employing the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) household survey data for Ethiopia in 2015 and 2016. The survey samples were obtained through a three-stage stratified sampling technique from the five regions (Amhara, Tigray, Benishangul Gumuz, Oromia, and Southern Nation Nationality and People (SNNP) along the Nile basin Ethiopia. There are only 12-14% female household heads while there are 80-86% male households in the regions under study. In the regions, more than half of (64%) the household heads are illiterate and almost only one-tenth of them (12%) had received remittance from abroad from their relatives or children. Crop variety adoption rate is minimal, adopted by the 31% of farmers. Only 30% of the surveyed farmers mentioned that they planted their crop seeds in row whereas the rest 70% had not applied this method. The regression results from the fixed effect least square dummy variable model showed that literacy, household size, remittance, asset value, and total land holdings have significant and positive impacts on the net crop income per hectare. The regional dummy variables estimate indicated that all the regions are negatively affected by climate change at varying levels. Strategies to climate change adaptation have significant and positive contributions in leveraging the damaging effects of climate change. The results also showed that increased winter and summer temperature and rainfall increase net crop income per hectare. The estimated coefficient of the interaction term of spring temperature and rainfall is significant and negative. On the other hand, while the mean annual temperature is damaging to crops, annual rainfall is beneficial. It can be deduced that, while increased temperature and rainfall in summer and winter increase the net crop income, the converse is true for winter and spring seasons. The study also proposes a specific, context-dependent, farm-level adaptation analysis of how farmers cope with the different climatic impacts of the Nile Basin and maintain the income levels that they have previously enjoyed.",About Sufficiency
Experimental and survey-based data on willingness to pay for seafood safety and environmental sustainability certification in Nigeria,"Aquatic foods, including fish, are a substantial component of animal source foods globally, and make a critical nutritional contribution to diets in many contexts. In the global North, concern among consumers and regulators over the safety and environmental sustainability of seafood, particularly in developed nations, has led to the development of increasingly stringent seafood safety standards. While such standards may constitute regularity, logistical, and economic barriers to participation in export markets by small-scale producers, they have in other contexts catalysed upgrades to production and post-harvest handling practices within value chains associated with both capture fisheries and aquaculture. The health burden of foodborne illnesses is a major concern in developing countries. As incomes rise, consumers in developing countries are increasingly willing to pay a premium for safer and environmentally sustainable foods. However, there is little empirical evidence on consumers' willingness to pay for seafood safety in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Data on demand for seafood safety and environmental sustainability certification in African countries are largely unavailable in the public domain. In this paper, we describe data collected in Lagos State, Nigeria in October and November 2019. Experiments in the form of Becker-DeGroote-Marschak (BDM) auction mechanism, and post experiment surveys were conducted with 200 fish consumers in fish markets. These data can be used to assess whether consumers' demand for safe and healthy seafood from local markets can be harnessed to generate positive economic returns to producers. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Exploring farmer choices in Southern Togo: Utilizing a strategy game to understand decision-making in agricultural practices,"CONTEXT: Agriculture plays a vital role in African countries, driving economic growth, employment, and nonagricultural sector improvements. However, persistent food insecurity and poverty among smallholder families raise concerns. Land fragmentation compounds these issues, limiting agricultural productivity and pushing farmers towards off -farm activities, despite Africa's potential agricultural markets. OBJECTIVE: The study's focus is Donomade<acute accent>, a remote village in southern Togo. This study pursues a dual objective. Firstly, it investigates how household characteristics, including family size and resource availability, influence farmers' resource management decisions. Secondly, the research employs serious games to comprehend farmers' livelihood strategy choices within constrained real -world -like conditions. METHODS: The iterative and participatory Companion Modelling (ComMod) approach was utilized for the codesign and co -development of a serious game. This involved close collaboration with a local research team from the University of Lome<acute accent>, a local NGO, and Donomade<acute accent> village farmers. Various farming systems were characterized, and collective insights into Donomade<acute accent>'s agricultural dynamics were gathered through surveys, interviews, and workshops. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of their in -game roles, farmers prioritize fulfilling basic family needs, such as food security and education instead of investing in agriculture. The study underscores the significance of household composition and resource availability when designing technology interventions or support mechanisms for farmers. Aligning interventions with farmers' overarching goals and challenges can enhance technology adoption. Furthermore, addressing food security remains crucial for sustainable development, as it not only improves human welfare and alleviates hunger but also forms the foundation for comprehensive solutions in the face of climate change, resource constraints, and population growth. SIGNIFICANCE: This research highlights that heavy investment in agriculture is not the priority for many farmers in southern Togo, despite it being their main source of sustenance and income. Addressing immediate family needs, especially food security, education, and housing, takes precedence over long-term agricultural investments. Given the persistent challenge of food security amidst global uncertainties, addressing these priorities is paramount to stimulate more significant interest in agricultural investment.",About Sufficiency
"Exploring the Catrina, an autochthonous cattle breed of the Azores, for a comparative analysis of methane emissions with Holstein-Friesian dairy cows","Introduction The struggle against climate change in agriculture requires an increased understanding of greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from cattle farming. Through precise and accessible methods to monitor the methane (CH4) emissions of these animals, it is possible to assess the influence of several factors.Therefore, this study evaluates CH4 emissions from Catrina cattle, an autochthonous breed from the Azores, and Holstein-Friesian cattle, aiming to assess the potential environmental impact and sustainability of this native breed. Materials and methods The present study was performed on a total of 15 dry cows, seven Catrina and eight Holstein-Friesian, housed by breed, in groups of five animals. The laser methane detector was used to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of CH4 values, including peaks and respiration. Descriptive statistics for raw data, CH4 breath and peaks, and the amount of CH4 emitted per day and year were calculated. Results From the Catrina breed, the average of CH4 emissions were 37.04 +/- 40.09 ppm x m for raw data, 33.15 +/- 28.59 ppm x m for CH4 breath, and 218.65 +/- 67.13 ppm x m for CH4 peaks. From the Holstein-Friesian, the values obtained were 65.62 +/- 87.11 ppm x m, 57.57 +/- 52.59 ppm x m, and 514.19 +/- 266.02 ppm x m, respectively. Linear mixed models, the Chisquare method and ANOVA, which showed a significant breed effect (p < 0.001) across all datasets, with trends favoring higher emissions in Holstein-Friesian were also applied. Similarly, Pearson correlation analyses yielded consistent trends, however, with no statistical significance (p > 0.05). Discussion and conclusion The findings underscore the importance of preserving cultural and genetic heritage while addressing climate change and environmental challenges. Furthermore, the study highlights the adaptive capacity of autochthonous breeds to their local environments, suggesting their role in sustainable systems. However, methane emissions will be influenced by several factors, besides breed variable, so this study emphasizes the need to integrate the assessment of the microbiome, which depends on the composition of the diet, genetic characteristics, and other aspects, for the development of methane mitigation strategies, with the inclusion of native breeds in sustainable resource management and climate adaptation efforts.",About Sufficiency
Exploring the inclusiveness of producer cooperatives,"Given the relevance of producer cooperatives in policy debates around rural development, agricultural sustainability and inclusive business, there is surprisingly little information on whether these cooperatives are inclusive of smallholders. This paper reviews conceptual discussions and empirical evidence on the notion of a producer cooperative as an inclusive business. Three organisational characteristics may affect the inclusiveness of producer cooperatives: community-orientation versus market-orientation; open versus closed membership; who is represented in the governance of the cooperative. When cooperatives evolve from community-orientation towards market-orientation, they are likely to become less inclusive.",About Sufficiency
Exploring the Potential of Mapping Cropping Patterns on Smallholder Scale Croplands Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data,"It is of paramount importance to have sustainable agriculture since agriculture is the backbone of many nations' economic development. Majority of agricultural professionals rarely capture the cropping patterns necessary to promote Good Agricultural Practises. Objective of this research is to explore the potential of mapping cropping patterns occurring on different field parcels on small-scale farmlands in Zimbabwe. The first study location under investigation are the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) research station and a few neighboring fields, the second is Middle Sabi Estate. Fourier time series modeling was implemented to determine the trends befalling on the two study sites. Results reveal that Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series allow detection of subtle changes that occur to the crops and fields respectively, hence can be utilized to detect cropping patterns on small-scale farmlands. Discrimination of the main crops (maize and soybean) grown at CIMMYT was possible, and crop rotation was synthesized where sowing starts in November. A single cropping of early and late crops was observed, there were no winter crops planted during the investigation period. At Middle Sabi Estate, single cropping on perennial sugarcane fields and triple cropping of fields growing leafy vegetables, tomatoes and onions were observed. Classification of stacked images was used to derive the crop rotation maps representing what is practised at the farming lands. Random forest classification of the multi-temporal image stacks achieved overall accuracies of 99% and 95% on the respective study sites. In conclusion, Sentinel-1 time series can be implemented effectively to map the cropping patterns and crop rotations occurring on small-scale farming land. We recommend the use of Sentinel-1 SAR multi-temporal data to spatially explicitly map cropping patterns of single-, double- and triple-cropping systems on both small-scale and large-scale farming areas to ensure food security.",About Sufficiency
Facilitating North-South Partnerships for Sustainable Agriculture,"The increased number of development cooperation and sustainable agriculture partnerships brings with it new challenges for professionals who are asked to facilitate these partnering processes. In this article we shed more light on the world of development cooperation and we explore questions that facilitators working with North - South partnerships face. The main research questions are: What are the distinguishing characteristics of North - South partnership dynamics; what insights and lessons can we draw from the management of these partnerships, and what recommendations or advice can we offer to those facilitating such partnerships? On the basis of a deductive research process we reveal a number of characteristics that mark the process of building partnerships within the context of development cooperation. Through two cases of sustainable agriculture partnerships-biological cotton and responsible soy-we discuss how professionals confront these specific characteristics and how they address these. The material from the two cases was made more complete by drawing on other experiences and relevant literature. The revealed characteristics creating challenges for professionals facilitating partnerships are the following: ideology and values; politically loaded relationships; unilateral financial dependence; cultural and physical distance; and fragile social trust. We end with some essential operational guidelines for professionals managing or advising partnerships. As partnerships in development cooperation are becoming ever more important, there is a need for more professionalization. However, few studies have paid attention to the challenges professionals face and the way they can deal with them.",About Sufficiency
Factors affecting persistence of terrestrial orchids in wet meadows and implications for their conservation in a changing agricultural landscape,"We examined the occurrence of Dactylorhiza majalis, the most abundant terrestrial orchid species growing in rapidly disappearing wet meadows, at 50 historical sites for 3 years. We aimed to find the most frequent reasons for its recent extinction at many sites. We found that the main reasons for its extinction were absence of mowing, intensive fertilisation and washouts of fertilisers from fields nearby. At extant sites, we studied its biometric characteristics and composition of surrounding vegetation, to determine factors affecting its persistence. Bad performance of persisting populations of this species was associated with prevalence of grasses, low May temperatures and absence of mowing. This confirms, at metapopulation level, what has previously been observed at the level of individual populations. We suggest that the system of agricultural subsidies in the country should change towards more sensitive allocation of funds to those farmers, who will adopt the appropriate management of wet meadows and their surroundings.

Factors influencing the adoption of precision agricultural technologies: a review for policy implications,"Increasing pressure for food security and sustainability as well as a need to halt environmental degradation has focused attention on increasing the efficient use of farm resources. One answer to aspects of that problem is the use of precision agricultural technologies (PATs). To facilitate their adoption, initiatives have been fostered in developed countries since the 1980s. Despite a low rate of adoption elsewhere, similar efforts in recent years have been initiated in developing countries. Given this, understanding those underlying factors that influence the adoption of PATs is vital. It is timely to review these factors and to draw policy implications from that review for future actions. This review, based on studies investigating the limited adoption of PATs in 'experienced' countries, extrapolates their findings to explain why farmers have or have not adopted PATs. At the same time, this review summarizes the key insights for more effectively targeting 'new' followers: e.g. it provides some answers to the question of who is more likely to adopt PATs. Additionally, the review points to the limitations of current research in the area and suggests a robust economic model or multidisciplinary approach be adopted for future investigation.",About Sufficiency
"Factors influencing small holder farmers adoption of climate SMART agriculture practices in Welmera Woreda, Central Ethiopia","Adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices are believed to have significantly lessened the devastating impact of climate change on agriculture. However, in countries like Ethiopia, the adoption and use level of climate-smart agriculture practices remains low. The understanding of farmers' levels of CSA practice adoption and influencing factors is therefore crucial. The goal of the study is to evaluate the degree to which various CSA practices were being used in the study area, as well as adoption determinants. The study was conducted in Welmera district, Oromia, Ethiopia. Three kebeles were chosen from the district, and a random sample of 306 farmers was picked. We used a cross-sectional household survey, a focus group discussion, and interviews with key informants. A multivariate probit model was employed to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of multiple climate-smart agriculture practices. According to the result, conservation agriculture, integrated soil fertility management, and crop diversification are the most often used CSA practices. The results also revealed that male farmers outperformed female farmers in terms of crop diversity and improved animal feed and feeding practice adoption. The age of farmers has a considerable and unfavorable impact on their likelihood of adopting improved soil fertility management and crop diversification practices. However, it has a positive and considerable impact on the adoption of agroforestry practices. With regards to economic factors, having a relatively big farmland area considerably enhances the adoption of conservation agriculture, enhances soil fertility management and crop diversity, and improves livestock feed and feeding methods and post-harvest technology practice. Improved livestock feed and feeding are more likely to be used with higher farm income. Having a significant number of animals strongly promotes the adoption of conservation agriculture, and access to financial services positively impacts agroforestry, diversification of crops, and postharvest technology practice adoption. Furthermore, institutional factors including access to agricultural extension services and training were discovered to be important and beneficial for crop diversification; similarly, access to field day participation was discovered to have a significant and positive impact on the adoption of conservation agriculture and improved soil fertility management practices. It is critical to raise awareness about climate change among farmers and experts, as well as to incorporate location-specific CSA practices into agricultural programs.",About Sufficiency
Farmers' adoption behavior of conservation tillage technology: a multidimensional heterogeneity perspective,"Adopting conservation tillage technology can promote sustainable agriculture development. There have been many studies on all farmers' conservation tillage behaviors, but few studies are based on a farmer's multidimensional heterogeneity perspective. Given the background, we conduct an empirical evaluation using micro survey data from 819 households in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River Basin. This paper uses the entropy method to classify farm households into three types: economically dominant, resource dominant, and socially dominant. Furthermore, we use the Heckman sample selection model to discuss the factors that affect the adoption of conservation tillage technology by different types of farmers. The results show that land fragmentation degree can inhibit economically dominant farmers conservation tillage technology adoption behavior. Social relations can positively influence resource dominant farmers. The share of non-farm income will positively impact socially dominant farmers. This paper further proposes policy implications, based on the findings that different types of farmers have various factors influencing conservation tillage technology adoption behavior.",About Sufficiency
Farmers' Perceptions of the Efficacy of Current Climate Risk Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies on Agriculture in The Gambia,"Agricultural systems face increasing challenges due to climate change, necessitating effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. This study investigates smallholder farmers' perceptions of the efficacy of these strategies in The Gambia, employing a mixed-method approach that includes a perception index (PI), effectiveness score (ES), importance-performance analysis (IPA), and statistical analysis. A structured survey was conducted among 420 smallholder farmers across three agricultural regions. Farmers rated adaptation and mitigation strategies using a Likert scale, and a PI was developed to quantify their responses. The index was 0.66, indicating a moderate level of perceived effectiveness. Additionally, ES was calculated to assess the performance of various strategies, while IPA categorized strategies based on their adoption and perceived impact. Chi-square tests and factor analysis were applied to explore differences in perceptions. The findings reveal that strategies such as crop diversification, pesticide application, irrigation, and the use of inorganic fertilizers are widely adopted and perceived as effective. The IPA matrix identified key strategies needing improvement, particularly those with high importance but low performance. Barriers to adoption include limited financial resources (77%), lack of government support (64%), and insufficient knowledge (52%), with no significant gender-based differences in perceptions. This study underscores the need for policy interventions that integrate farmers' perceptions to enhance climate resilience. Targeted investments in adaptive technologies, financial support, and knowledge-sharing platforms can improve adoption and effectiveness. This research provides valuable insights into the interplay between farmer perceptions, adaptation strategies, and agricultural sustainability in The Gambia.",About Sufficiency
The association between food insecurity and academic achievement in Canadian school-aged children,"Objective: Education is a crucial social determinant of health. Food insecurity can be detrimental to children's academic achievement, potentially perpetuating a cycle of poverty and food insecurity. We aimed to assess the relationship between food insecurity and academic achievement in Canadian school-aged children. Design: Cross-sectional study of children and parents. Parents completed the short-form Household Food Security Survey Module and questions about income and education level (socio-economic status). Children completed FFQ. Data were prospectively linked to children's performance on standardized exams written one year later. Mixed-effect logistic regression was employed to assess the relationship between food insecurity and likelihood of meeting academic expectations adjusting for socio-economic status, diet quality and potential confounders. Setting: Nova Scotia, Canada in 2011-2012. Subjects: Students (n 4105) in grade 5 (10-11 years; 2167 girls) and their parents. Results: Low food security was reported by 9.8 % of households; very low food security by 7.1 % of households. Students from low-income households and reporting poor diet quality were less likely to do well in school. Children who lived in households reporting very low food security had 0.65 times the odds (OR=0.65; 95 % CI 0.44, 0.96) of meeting expectations for reading and 0.62 times the odds (OR=0.62; 95 % CI 0.45, 0.86) of meeting expectations for mathematics.

Nutrient availability as the key regulator of global forest carbon balance,"Forests strongly affect climate through the exchange of large amounts of atmospheric CO2 (ref. 1). The main drivers of spatial variability in net ecosystem production (NEP) on a global scale are, however, poorly known. As increasing nutrient availability increases the production of biomass per unit of photosynthesis(2) and reduces heterotrophic(3) respiration in forests, we expected nutrients to determine carbon sequestration in forests. Our synthesis study of 92 forests in different climate zones revealed that nutrient availability indeed plays a crucial role in determining NEP and ecosystem carbon-use efficiency (CUEe; that is, the ratio of NEP to gross primary production (GPP)). Forests with high GPP exhibited high NEP only in nutrient-rich forests (CUEe = 33 +/- 4%; mean +/- s.e.m.). In nutrient-poor forests, a much larger proportion of GPP was released through ecosystem respiration, resulting in lower CUEe (6 +/- 4%). Our finding that nutrient availability exerts a stronger control on NEP than on carbon input (GPP) conflicts with assumptions of nearly all global coupled carbon cycle-climate models, which assume that carbon inputs through photosynthesis drive biomass production and carbon sequestration. An improved global understanding of nutrient availability would therefore greatly improve carbon cycle modelling and should become a critical focus for future research.",About Sufficiency

Trust and communication in European agri-food chains,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess and explain the trust situation in EU agri-food supply chains in the context of the assumption that the existence of well-functioning trust-based supplier-buyer relationships enables a secure and safe food supply. Design/methodology/approach - Using structural equation modelling (SEM) and survey data (n = 1,430) on supplier-buyer relationships from six different countries, two commodity supply chains (meat and cereals) and two supply chain stages (farmer-processor and processor-retailer), main trust determinants are identified and discussed. By simultaneously covering two supply chain stages the analysis adopts a perspective beyond the dyad. Findings - The SEM results indicate that trust in supply chain partners can be significantly improved by effective communication and by positive past collaboration. The existence of personal bonds (ties) between partners does not seem to play a direct role in the retailer-processor relationship but is important when dealing with farmers. In both supply chain stages positive past collaboration as well as the existence of personal bonds also indirectly enhance trust by promoting effective communication which in turn positively impacts on trust levels, thus proofing communication to be a powerful mediator variable. Practical implications - This study's findings can be used by practitioners to learn how to improve trust in their supply chain relationships and how to communicate effectively. Originality/value - The results provide large-scale empirical evidence on trust drivers in European agri-food supply chains thus confirming earlier studies on the topic from other industries.",About Sufficiency
Greenhouse gas abatement policies and the value of carbon sinks: Do grazing and cropping systems have different destinies?,"This paper presents a case study in which the effects of agri-envirorimental policy on two Mediterranean-type farming systems, grazing dominant and cropping dominant, are contrasted. Two greenhouse gas abatement policies are examined; an emissions taxation policy and an emissions restrictions policy. The study seeks to determine firstly, how the policy impacts on the farming systems, and from that, how the nature of the farming systems impact on the effectiveness of the policy. It is shown that relative costs of abatement are higher for the grazing-dominant farming system. However, in the absence of technological change to aid abatement, the cost of substitution from high emitting enterprises, such as livestock, to low emitting enterprises, such as crop production, will determine the cost of abatement. For both farming systems the restriction policy is found to be more effective and economically efficient than the taxation policy. The analysis found that crediting trees as carbon sinks can significantly reduce the costs of abatement. At predicted emissions permit prices, trees would be adopted by both farming systems to offset farm greenhouse gas emissions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Food as a weapon? The geopolitics of food and the Qatar-Gulf rift,"On 4 June 2017, Qatar was suddenly put under an embargo by its regional neighbors - an effort spearheaded by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who cut off most of its existing land, sea, and air traffic routes. With no domestic agriculture to speak of, Qatar's external logistics networks are essential for maintaining its food supply. The country's 2.6 million residents, many of whom flooded the grocery stores, were understandably concerned about their ability to secure food when news about the embargo broke. Eventually, new food supply chains were established, primarily with the assistance of partners in Iran and Turkey. The ongoing rift between Qatar and its neighbors in the Arabian Peninsula, manifested only in part by this effort to undermine the country's material supply networks raises a number of questions about an old idea: that of food as a 'weapon'. This article puts this concept in historical and regional perspective in the Arabian Peninsula through the lens of critical geopolitics, tracing the securitizing discourses about food security and their intertwining with narratives about territorial sovereignty, nationalism, and essentialist understandings of geography to explain the causes and effects of the food embargo in the ongoing Qatar-Gulf rift.",About Sufficiency
Food attitudes and consumer behavior towards food in conflict-affected zones during the COVID-19 pandemic: case of the Palestinian territories,"Purpose Global lockdowns and restrictions linked to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have affected food environments and consumption patterns. Conflict-affected countries are disproportionately affected from economic and food security perspectives. In this regard, the Palestinian territories (namely West Bank and Gaza Strip), which face a number of issues such as Israeli military and economic control, overcrowded cities and refugee camps (especially in Gaza Strip), rising poverty and food insecurity, are an especially interesting case study. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the selection and intake of foods and drinks, as well as consumer behavior and attitude toward food in the Palestinian territories. Design/methodology/approach The paper draws upon an online survey in the Palestinian territories administered in Arabic through the Survey Monkey platform from September 15 to October 10, 2020, with 322 adults. The survey findings were analyzed using descriptive statistics and several nonparametric tests. Particularly, the U-Mann Whitney test was used in dichotomous, categorical independent variables (e.g. gender), while the Kruskal-Wallis test was run to analyze multi-choice responses (e.g. occupation). Findings The results reveal that food attitudes and consumer behavior towards food have been widely affected. First, they reveal that Palestinians try to have healthier diets but ate more between meals (e.g. snacks). Second, the pandemic transformed respondents' shopping behavior and induced panic buying, negatively affecting food affordability due to increased prices of some foods (e.g. fruits and vegetables). Some food behaviors were shaped by negative psychological determinants (e.g. depression and anxiety). The pandemic effects are moderated by different sociodemographics (age, education and income). COVID-19 negatively affected food security but also opened a ""window of opportunity"" to trigger the transition towards more sustainable diets. Originality/value The paper results show that the eventual effects of COVID-19 will most likely vary from country to country, based not only on the epidemiological circumstances but also, among other factors, on the baseline socioeconomic situation and shock resilience. The findings contribute to the clarification and critical analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 on food behaviors in the Palestinian territories, which would have several policy implications.",About Sufficiency
Food Environments and Diet Quality Among Vendors and Consumers in Five Traditional Urban Markets in Kenya,"Background/Objectives: Traditional food markets are essential in urban food environments in Kenya and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). They provide affordable fresh food, particularly for low-income urban communities, and are vital places of livelihoods and local economic activities. Despite their importance, associations between market-related factors and diet quality for vendors and consumers are underexplored. This study explores these relationships to inform policies aimed at improving diets and nutrition in LMICs. Methods: Survey data were collected from 1042 vendors and 876 consumers in five urban markets in Kenya. The survey assessed market-related factors, consumer purchasing behavior, socioeconomic factors, and dietary outcomes using the Kenya Diet Quality Questionnaire. Linear regression models were employed to evaluate associations between the availability of foods, consumers' purchase of foods, proximity to the market, reported sickness from food, and diet quality indicators, including the Dietary Diversity Score (DDS), Global Dietary Recommendations (GDRs), NCD-Protect, and NCD-Risk scores. Results: Vendors' own dietary outcomes were characterized by lower DDS, NCD-Protect, and NCD-Risk scores but higher GDR scores compared to consumers. Significant associations were identified between the purchase of specific food groups (e.g., vegetables, legumes, and nuts) and improved diet quality for consumers. Longer travel times were linked to lower diet quality for both vendors and consumers. Socioeconomic factors, such as gender, age, and education, significantly influenced diet quality. Conclusions: Traditional markets play a pivotal role in urban food environments. Policies that enhance market access and support vendors and consumers, particularly women, young adults, and low-income groups, are essential to improving diets and nutrition outcomes in LMICs.",About Sufficiency

The secondary aim was to evaluate differences in dietary quality and the level of food insecurity between the participants at Temple University Hospital (TUH) vs. Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC). A single-arm, cross-sectional study was conducted, in which 40 AA patients with GI malignancies were recruited at FCCC and TUH between February 2021 and July 2021. Participants completed the US Adult Food Security Survey Module to assess the level of food security (food secure vs. food insecure). An electronic food frequency questionnaire (VioScreen (TM)) was administered to obtain usual dietary intake. Diet quality was calculated using the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015). Dietary quality and food insecurity were summarized using standard statistical measures. Overall, 6 of the 40 participants (15%) reported food insecurity, and the mean HEI-2015 score was 64.2. No association was observed between dietary quality and food insecurity (p = 0.29). However, we noted that dietary quality was significantly lower among patients presenting at TUH (mean HEI-2015 = 57.8) compared to patients at FCCC (mean HEI-2015 = 73.5) (p < 0.01). Food insecurity scores were also significantly higher in the TUH population vs. the FCCC population (p < 0.01).",About Sufficiency
"Food insecurity, food skills, health literacy and food preparation activities among young Canadian adults: a cross-sectional analysis","Objective: To assess associations between household food security status and indicators of food skills, health literacy and home meal preparation, among young Canadian adults. Design: Cross-sectional data were analysed using logistic regression and general linear models to assess associations between food security status and food skills, health literacy and the proportion of meals prepared at home, by gender. Setting: Participants recruited from five Canadian cities (Vancouver (BC), Edmonton (AB), Toronto (ON), Montreal (QB) and Halifax (NS)) completed an online survey. Participants: 1389 men and 1340 women aged 16-30 years. Results: Self-reported food skills were not associated with food security status (P > 0 center dot 05) among men or women. Compared to those with high health literacy (based on interpretation of a nutrition label), higher odds of food insecurity were observed among men (adjusted OR (AOR): 2 center dot 58, 95 % CI 1 center dot 74, 3 center dot 82 and 1 center dot 56, 95 % CI 1 center dot 07, 2 center dot 28) and women (AOR: 2 center dot 34, 95 % CI 1 center dot 48, 3 center dot 70 and 1 center dot 92, 95 % CI 1 center dot 34, 2 center dot 74) with lower health literacy. Women in food-insecure households reported preparing a lower proportion of breakfasts (beta = -0 center dot 051, 95 % CI -0 center dot 085, -0 center dot 017), lunches (beta = -0 center dot 062, 95 % CI -0 center dot 098, -0 center dot 026) and total meals at home (beta = -0 center dot 041, 95 % CI -0 center dot 065, -0 center dot 016). Men and women identifying as Black or Indigenous, reporting financial difficulty and with lower levels of education had heightened odds of experiencing food insecurity. Conclusions: Findings are consistent with other studies underscoring the financial precarity, rather than lack of food skills, associated with food insecurity. This precarity may reduce opportunities to apply health literacy and undertake meal preparation.",About Sufficiency
Food safety in developing countries: Moving beyond exports,"Food safety is linked to food security through health and livelihoods, and improving food safety is necessary to address food security. An international consensus has emerged that the best way to address food safety is through a risk-based, farm-to-table approach that focuses on cost-effective prevention. In developing countries, this approach has been implemented in supply chains for high-value markets, particularly exports. Evidence shows that improvements are possible where market incentives exist, and where market institutions can ensure that risk reduction practices are followed. To address food safety for food insecure consumers in developing countries, public efforts should focus on the most important risks and cost-effective controls, provide support for capacity building and supply chain coordination, and improve incentives for food safety management.

"Food Security and Diet Quality in Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Filipino Infants 3 to 12 Months of Age","Food insecurity and other nutritional risks in infancy pose a lifelong risk to wellbeing; however, their effect on diet quality in Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Filipino (NHPIF) infants in Hawai'i is unknown. In this cross-sectional analysis, the association between various indicators of food security and NHPIF infant diet quality were investigated in 70 NHPIF infants aged 3-12 months residing on O'ahu, Hawai'i. The dietary assessments of the infants were collected using a mobile food record(TM). Foods consumed across four days were categorized into seven food groups. Indicators for food security were examined through an adapted infant food security index and other indicators. Data were analyzed using chi-square tests, independent sample t-tests, multinomial logistic regression, and linear regression models. In models adjusting for age and sex, infants defined as food insecure by the adapted index were found to consume foods from more food groups and consume flesh foods on a greater proportion of days. Of the indicators examined, the adapted index was shown to be the best indicator for food group consumption. Further work is needed on a more representative sample of NHPIF infants to determine the impact that food security has on nutritional status and other indicators of health.",About Sufficiency
Food Security and Perceived Well-being among Household Heads in Ghana,"Access to food as a critical factor in determining individuals' well-being in low income countries is of grave importance both in theory and public policy. Therefore this study, designed to enhance our understanding of food (in)security's impact on quality of life, presents a micro-level analysis of factors associated with food provision, food satisfaction, and happiness in Ghana. Our empirical analysis first investigates the patterns and variations of food provision among Ghanaian households, and then evaluates how the provision factors, along with other socio-economic status and reciprocal behaviors, affect avowed well-being as measured by (1) the household heads' subjective sense of being nonpoor and (2) reported feelings of happiness. The data are drawn from the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey conducted in 2003, with a sample of 40,481 households. Regression outcomes reveal that the usage of land, owning of livestock and amount of food spending particularly favor male-headed households' food security, which in turn leads men not to endorse ""feeling poor"" and, instead, to report greater happiness than is the case, in most instances, for women. Familial reciprocity also strengthens subjective well-being by way of increasing food security among Ghanaians. Family values as such, rather than decline in significance, appear to play a critical role in food security in Ghana.",About Sufficiency
"Food Security and Productivity among Urban Farmers in Kaduna State, Nigeria","This study to investigated food security and productivity among urban farmers' in Kaduna State Two-stage sampling procedure was used to select 213 respondents for the study. Interview schedule was used to collect data.

Food system shocks and food insecurity vulnerabilities: introduction to the symposium,"The global food system has been subject to a multitude of shocks in recent years, drawing renewed attention to food insecurity vulnerabilities. Extreme weather events, economic crises, a global pandemic and wars have caused significant disruptions, compromising food security for significant portions of the population. Shocks impacting upon food systems bear additional adverse outcomes where populations are already vulnerable to poverty and other social inequalities, and increasingly, shocks are affecting populations not previously considered food insecure. This paper, and the Symposium it introduces, articulates an emerging field of study that explores the dynamic interplay of food system shocks and food security through multiple disciplinary perspectives. The articles in this Symposium address the impacts of and responses to shocks such as weather events and the COVID-19 pandemic and consider these through the theoretical lenses of actor perspectives, governance, and transitions. This Symposium looks beyond the short-term acute event and contributes to a systemic understanding of 'food shocks' by reflecting on how enduring and persistent disruptions reverberate through multiple layers of food systems, how they are experienced and addressed across global and local scales, and how they may deeply transform food systems and impact people over time.",About Sufficiency
Food systems determinants of nutritional health and wellbeing in urban informal settlements: A scoping review in LMICs,"Introduction: Increasing food and nutritional inequities are apparent in urban settings across Low-and Middle -Income Countries (LMICs), along with nutrition transition towards ultra-processed diets high in fat, sugar, and salt. In urban informal settlements, characterized by insecurity and inadequate housing and infrastructure, food systems dynamics and their nutritional implications are poorly understood. Objectives: This paper explores the food system determinants of food and nutrition security in urban informal settlements in LMICs with the goal of identifying effective approaches and entry points for policy and program. Methods: Scoping review. Five databases were screened spanning the period 1995 to 2019. A total of 3748 re-cords were assessed for inclusion based on title and abstract followed by 42 full text reviews. At least two re-viewers assessed each record. Twenty-four final publications were included, coded, and synthesized. Results: Factors influencing food security and nutrition in urban informal settlements can be organized into three interconnected levels. Macro-level factors include globalization, climate change, transnational food corporations, international treaties and regulations, global and national policies such as SDGs, insufficient social aid programs, and formalization or privatization. Meso-level factors include gender norms, inadequate infrastructure and services, insufficient transportation, informal food retailers, weak municipal policies, marketing strategies, and (lack of) employment. Micro-level factors comprise gender roles, cultural expectations, income, social networks, coping strategies, and food (in) security.Conclusions: Greater policy attention should focus at the meso-level, with priority investments in services and infrastructure within urban informal settlements. The role and engagement of the informal sector is an important consideration in improving the immediate food environment. Gender is also crucial. Women and girls have a central role in food provisioning but are more vulnerable to various forms of malnutrition.

Food Waste Behaviour and Awareness of Malaysian,"Food waste is a vast issue global, including in Malaysia. Food waste brings negative impacts, including increasing food production costs, impact on human health, and environmental degradation. Malaysian's animal- and plant-based diet preferences affected the desired food waste decomposition method as most of the methods only allow plant-based material to be utilized as food waste compost. The objectives of this study were to understand Malaysians' awareness of food waste behaviour and the food waste component for the decomposition. Malaysians usually produce more plant-based food waste than animal-based food waste. Most Malaysians have a high awareness of causes and impact of food waste, but they lack action on food waste reduction. Bio-compost is believed to be the most effective method to manage food waste, and most of them were willing to have it at home. However, some of them are unwilling to have a compost pile at home because there is no time to take care of it.",About Sufficiency
Food-Loss Control at the Macronutrient Level: Protein Inventory for the Norwegian Farmed Salmon Production System,"The growing world population and the growing need for food are raising the importance of more efficient and sustainable food production systems. Food loss is a significant global challenge and a major stressor on natural resources. True assessment of food loss is a precursor to its reduction. This study aimed to assess the actual food loss in the Norwegian farmed salmon production system in the year 2019 by quantifying the protein flows and stocks in the system. Protein served as an indicator substance of the true systemic food loss. This study highlights the system's qualitative value-adding conversion of plant protein into higher quality marine animal protein, with deposited vital trace minerals harvested from the sea and carried to the human food chain. However, it takes a lot of protein from multiple sources to produce salmon. We found that the total invested feed protein is about four times more than the harvested salmon protein, and about 40% of that harvested protein in the salmon biomass departs the human food chain by flowing to other non-food industries. The current post-harvest practices, material trade-offs, and waste management solutions could be adjusted to a context that prioritizes human food security. An alternative scenario is presented in this study, based on a hypothetical new food product in parallel to the main salmon fillet product. The alternative scenario turned 99% of the harvested protein into food and adjusted the ratio between the invested marine protein and the human food product protein. The originality of this research is in its approach to food loss assessment at the industrial level by means of a systemic macronutrient (protein) inventory.",About Sufficiency
Foraging Wild Food in Urban Spaces: The Contribution of Wild Foods to Urban Dietary Diversity in South Africa,"Globally, approximately one billion people benefit from contributions of wild foods to their food security and dietary diversity. Wild foods are known to be important in rural communities in terms of food and micronutrient provision, diversifying diets, reducing vulnerability to non-communicable diseases and overall health. However, the potential contribution of wild foods towards food security and dietary diversity in urban food systems has been largely overlooked. This study examined the contribution of wild foods to household dietary diversity in two towns in South Africa, based on a survey of 137 households. Household diets were quite diverse, with half (51%) having consumed >= 8 food groups, 39% consumed 6 or 7 food groups, and only 10% recorded <= 5 food groups in the previous 48 h. Wild foods were prevalent across the sample, with 62% of the households consuming them to some degree. Wild vegetables and fruits were the most common wild foods, consumed by 96 and 79% of the households, respectively. Although wild foods had limited significance on overall dietary diversity, they exhibited substantial contributions within particular food groups. For example, the consumption of vegetables and oil and fats was most prevalent among households consuming wild foods than those who did not. The findings show that wild foods could contribute towards diversifying urban diets at a micro-level, within particular food groups consumed, such as vegetables and fruits. Hence, wild foods are important in ameliorating the monotonous diets of some households and in turn promoting dietary diversity.",About Sufficiency
Forest management and soil respiration: Implications for carbon sequestration,"It is recognized that human activities, such as fossil fuel burning, land-use change, and forest harvesting at a large scale, have resulted in the-increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the onset of the industrial revolution. The increasing amounts of greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 in the atmosphere, is believed to have induced climate change and global warming. With the ability to remove CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, forests play a critical role in the carbon cycle and carbon sequestration at both global and local scales. It is necessary to understand the relationship between forest soil carbon dynamics and carbon sequestration capacity, and the impact of forest management practices on soil CO2 efflux for sustainable carbon management in forest ecosystems. This paper reviews a number of current issues related to (1) carbon allocation, (2) soil respiration, and (3) carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystems through forest management strategies. The contribution made by forests and forest management in sequestrating carbon to reduce the CO2 concentration level in the atmosphere is now well recognized. The overall carbon cycle, carbon allocation of the above- and belowground compartments of the forests, soil carbon storage and soil respiration in forest ecosystems and impacts of forest management practices on soil respiration are described.

Forest Restoration through Village Common Forests in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh: The Role of NGO Interventions,"Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are widely recognized for their support of biodiversity conservation and forest restoration in tropical developing countries. In the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs) of Bangladesh, ethnic forest-dependent communities have long maintained the Village Common Forest (VCF), an ancestral forest managed for community well-being. In recent years, some VCFs in the CHT have received support from local and international NGOs due to their perceived role in supporting biodiversity, ecosystem services, and improving local livelihoods. Although such support remains limited, its impacts on forest restoration and vegetation are not yet fully investigated. In the present study, we used remote sensing techniques and field surveys to measure vegetation cover changes and tree diversity in selected VCFs in the area. Our findings indicate that vegetation condition and tree diversity were better in NGO-supported VCFs compared with those without NGO intervention. Based on our study, we recommend increasing NGO involvement in VCF management with a more holistic and ecosystem-based approach, fostering institutional cooperation addressing land ownership issues, developing a market for forest ecosystem services, and improving local capacity for science-based forest management and ecosystem restoration in the CHT.",About Sufficiency
Formation of Ecological-Economic and Marketing Food Potential of Ukraine as a Component of Sustainable Development of Regions,"In Ukraine, the problem of providing food to the population is particularly acute today. Because of the decline in the food supply potential of the agro industrial complex, there was a fall in production and a decrease in the quality of agricultural products. This situation has led to the fact that imported agricultural products are gradually displacing domestic products from the market, which leads to higher prices and a shortage of high quality products. One of the main reasons that impedes the proper functioning of the market is the problem of managing food flows in the sales area. In this situation, there is a certain threat to food security in the regional market, so to meet the needs of the population in food products it is necessary to form a methodology for studying the regional food market based on the principles of logistical management of food flows. At the same time, the external environment of agricultural producers is becoming more dynamic, uncertain and complex, requiring a high level of adaptation and stability of the formed flow control systems. That is why the current practice of flow management in agricultural enterprises characterized by an intensive transition from coordination of individual logistics functions or operations to integrated management of logistics business processes, as well as ensures the development of production and logistics management in the direction of concentration and increase the value chain of agribusiness products.",About Sufficiency
Contrasting patterns in species and functional-trait diversity of bees in an agricultural landscape,"Land-use change frequently reduces local species diversity. Species losses will often result in loss of trait diversity, with likely consequences for community functioning. However, the converse need not be generally true: management approaches that succeed in retaining species richness could nevertheless fail to maintain trait diversity. We evaluated this possibility using bee communities in a California agroecosystem. We examined among site patterns in bee species diversity and functional-trait diversity in a landscape composed of a mosaic of semi-natural habitat, organic farms and conventional farms. We sampled bees from all three habitat types and compiled a data base of life-history (functional') traits for each species. Although species richness was higher on organic farms than conventional farms, functional diversity was lower in both farm types than in natural habitat. Nesting location (below-ground vs. above-ground) was the primary trait contributing to differences in functional diversity between farms and natural habitat, reflecting observed differences in availability of nesting substrates among habitat types. Other traits, including phenology and sociality, were also associated with species' occurrences or dominance in particular site types. These patterns suggest that management practices common to all farms act as environmental filters that cause similarly low functional diversity in their bee communities.Synthesis and applications. Although our results support the value of organic farming in maintaining abundant and species-rich bee communities, components of bee functional diversity are not well supported in farmed landscapes, regardless of farming practice. Maintenance of natural habitat, and/or the addition of natural habitat elements to farms, is therefore important for the retention of functionally diverse bee assemblages in agroecosystems.

Fortification: new findings and implications,"This article reviews the current landscape regarding food fortification in the United States; the content is based on a workshop sponsored by the North American Branch of the International Life Sciences Institute. Fortification of the food supply with vitamins and minerals is a public health strategy to enhance nutrient intakes of the population without increasing caloric intake. Many individuals in the United States would not achieve recommended micronutrient intakes without fortification of the food supply. The achievement and maintenance of a desirable level of nutritional quality in the nation's food supply is, thus, an important public health objective. While the addition of nutrients to foods can help maintain and improve the overall nutritional quality of diets, indiscriminate fortification of foods could result in overfortification or underfortification in the food supply and nutrient imbalances in the diets of individuals. Any changes in food fortification policy for micronutrients must be considered within the context of the impact they will have on all segments of the population and of food technology and safety applications and their limitations. This article discusses and evaluates the value of fortification, the success of current fortification efforts, and the future role of fortification in preventing or reversing nutrient inadequacies.

Fostering an enabling environment for equality and empowerment in agri-food systems: An assessment at multiple scales,"Inequalities by gender and intersecting sources of social differentiation in access to resources, exercise of agency, and desirable outcomes persist in agri-food systems in low- and middle income countries. Despite decades of development and theoretical assessment efforts calling for multiscale approaches to addressing inequalities in agri-food systems, common approaches remain specific to a scale rather than holistic. In this paper, we make the case that achieving lasting equality and empowerment in agri-food systems requires transformative change. This depends on fostering an enabling environment by relaxing 'deeper' - often interrelated - institutionalized constraints to equality and empowerment across multiple nested scales of the state, markets, communities, household and individuals. Based on a review of recent literature focused on agri-food systems in low- and middle income countries, we present newly emerging thinking and a status update of key structural constraints to equality at different scales - rooted in policy and discriminatory, formal and informal, social and economic institutions, including norms. We give examples that show how structural constraints to equality at different nested scales are interdependent and mutually reinforcing; demonstrating the need for holistic approaches tackling constraints at multiple scales to foster transformative change in agri-food systems. We recommend designing holistic policy and development programs that combine strategies for relaxing constraints to equality and empowerment at multiple scales using inclusive processes of tailoring and prioritizing. To inform the design of such programs, we present recent evidence of effective or promising strategies for addressing structural constraints to equality that relate to policy, market systems, collectives and norms.",About Sufficiency

Framework for evaluating risks in food supply chain: Implications in food wastage reduction,"Over the years, food supply chains (FSCs) have faced various challenges, including supply chain interruptions. Previous studies focused only on household food waste. In this study, the FSCs risks is connected with food wastage to develop sustainable framework to reduce food waste. A Pareto analysis is developed for risk identification based on feedback from 130 experts from food companies. Finally, a blended grey-based Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) model has been proposed to assess the relationships among the identified major risks in FSCs. The five risks of greatest priority include: lack of skilled personnel, poor leadership, failure within the IT system, capacity, and poor customer relationship. The risk mitigation strategies for these risks are also presented. The proposed model is applied to food processing companies in Bangladesh to establish a sustainable business policy to minimize food wastage. These results can guide managers and practitioners to formulate resilient strategies to mitigate the identified risks, thereby minimizing food wastage and lead to food safety, security and sustainability across the food supply chain. The proposed model can be extended to address sustainability risk and be integrated to the internet of things for planning, monitoring, controlling, and optimizing supply chains in real time.

Agroecology: The ecology of food systems,"We present a compelling rationale for defining agroecology as the ecology of food systems. Our purpose is to provide a framework that will guide research, education, and action in the multiple and interacting facets of an increasingly complex global agriculture and food system. To accomplish such goals, it is essential to build bridges and connections among and beyond our disciplines in production agriculture, as well as beyond the farm gate into the rural landscape and community. Fields of sociology, anthropology, environmental sciences, ethics, and economics are crucial to the mix. They provide additional vantage points from which we can view the food system anew, as well as insights on how to establish valuation criteria beyond neoclassical economics. Examples from Mexico, California, and the Nordic Region are used to illustrate the successful implementation of this educational strategy in universities. Design of individual farms using principles of ecology is expanded to the levels of landscape, community, and bioregion, with emphasis on uniqueness of place and the people and other species that inhabit that place. We conclude that defining agroecology as the ecology of food systems will foster the development of broader interdisciplinary research teams and attractive systems-based courses for tomorrow's best students. In contrast to the narrow focus on crop-soil interactions, this definition will help us raise higher-level research questions whose solutions will advance the development of a sustainable agriculture and food system.

"Livelihood Changes, Spatial Anticontagion Policy Effects, and Structural Resilience of National Food Systems in a Sub-Saharan African Country Context: A Panel Machine Learning Approach","The livelihood changes due to the COVID-19 policies in low-income and transitional economies serve as a lever for gauging the structural resilience of national food systems. Yet, few studies have addressed the cascading effects of the pandemic policies on the livelihood changes of farming system actors or modeled and provided coherent hypotheses about the transitory structural shifts at the micro-level. Other studies on the subject have either captured the early impacts of the pandemic on food systems with limited or no insight into the sub-Saharan African context or have used macro-level data, due to sparsely available micro-level data. These early insights are relevant for the design of early warning systems. However, an ongoing and deeper insight into the effects of pandemic policies is critical, since new and more comprehensive policies are needed to address the economic fallout and the extenuating effects of COVID-19 on food supply chain disruptions. The overriding questions are as follows: what are the effects of the pandemic policies on the livelihoods of food system actors and are there spatial-economic variations in the effects of the pandemic policies on the livelihoods of the farming system actors? Using 2019 and 2020 primary data from 836 farming system actors in Ghana, we offer fresh insights into the transitory micro-level livelihood changes caused by the COVID-19 anticontagion policies. We analyzed the data using the generalized additive, subset regression, classical linear, and logistic regression models in a machine learning framework. We show that the changes in the livelihood outcomes of the food system actors in Ghana coincide with the nature of pandemic mitigation policies adopted in the spatial units. We found that the lockdown policies had a negative and significant effect on the livelihoods of the farming system actors in the lockdown areas. The policies also negatively affected the livelihoods of the farming system actors in distant communities that shared no direct boundary with the lockdown areas. On the contrary, the lockdown policies positively affected the livelihoods of the farming system actors in the directly contiguous communities to the lockdown areas. We also document the shifts in the livelihood outcomes of the farming system actors, such as income, employment, food demand, and food security in the different spatial policy areas.",About Sufficiency
From fish and bushmeat to chicken nuggets: the nutrition transition in a continuum from rural to urban settings in the Colombian Amazon region,"The current contribution of wild animal proteins has been poorly quantified, particularly in the rapidly growing urban centers of tropical forests. Lack of such evidence impairs food security strategies to include the diversity of food supply inherent to traditional food systems. In this study we focus on wild sources of animal protein: wild fish and bushmeat, which have traditionally been important in people's diets in the Amazon. We compare the consumption of wild and non-wild (domestic, processed) sources of animal proteins in a rural to urban gradient in the Colombian Amazon. In rural areas, most people are indigenous from the Ticuna ethnical group, while in urban areas, the population is a result of a mixture of different indigenous groups, mestizos and colonos. Our results show that, despite its geographical position, the region is increasingly dependent on domestic and industrialized sources of animal protein. The frequency of wild fish and bushmeat consumption decreases from rural to urban areas to the advantage of domestic and processed meat/fish. Patterns of animal protein consumption for indigenous children indicate that indigenous families adopt non-indigenous consumption patterns when they move to town. Bushmeat consumption in urban areas is more frequent in wealthier families and could be considered as a luxury product. In urban areas, chicken is the protein of the poor and beef replaces chicken for the families that can afford it. In rural settings, chicken replaces wild sources of animal protein as people increase their income and move away from forest/agriculture dependent livelihoods. Despite, the low importance of bushmeat and wild fish in urban areas measured in terms of consumption frequencies, we show that these foods continue to play an important role in terms of dietary diversity, which is fundamental to eradicate energy and micronutrient deficiencies. The increased consumption of industrial chicken in rural communities poses important food security issues because it provides less nutritional balance than wild foods and access to this protein is dependent on the availability of cash in rural communities. While the harvest of wild proteins poses a sustainability problem, industrial foods also carry a heavy ecological footprint. In conclusion our results call for a better attention to the changes observed in diets in the Amazon, given their potential food security and ecological consequences.",About Sufficiency
From hinterland to heartland: Knowledge and market insecurity are barriers to crop farmers using sustainable soil management in Guyana,"In Guyana, the coastal plains dominate agricultural production, while the hinterland is an emerging agricultural frontier. The coastal and hinterland regions have differing agro-climatic conditions, but share immediate climate change and environmental degradation pressures, including soil degradation. Even though climate change adaptation is prioritized over greenhouse gas mitigation in Guyana, soil-focused farming, otherwise known as sustainable soil management (SSM), can provide a system that creates synergies between these two facets of climate-smart agriculture and, also, promotes soil security. This article proposes a bottom-up planning process for SSM in Guyana by assessing its underlying psycho-social and physical facilitators and barriers. The main questions addressed are: what are the attitudes of Guyanese farmers to climate change? What are their capabilities for SSM, in terms of education, technology and government support? In answering these questions, inductive-derived thematic analysis of transcripts derived from in-depth telephone interviews with seventeen (17) farmers, from coastal and hinterland regions, provides an initial basis for ground truthing on the local appropriateness of SSM. Results show that hinterland farmers are more emotive and value-driven about their environment, while coastal farmers, instead, prioritize access to markets and gaining favorable prices for their commodities. Additionally, the lack of education and training are identified as severe limitations to the capabilities of farmers to practice SSM. In conclusion, a weak marketing environment is seen as a binding constraint of sustainable intensification as surplus goods attract low prices. Stronger linkages to dynamic markets, as well as increased investment opportunities are needed for sustainable farming to become economically feasible. Therefore, psychosocial capital must be strengthened before any natural capital is improved under Guyana's various agro-environmental policies.",About Sufficiency
"From salt pan to saucepan: Salicornia, a halophytic vegetable with an array of potential health benefits","Domestication of novel crops from the wild is a key process that ensures food security by addressing adaptability to changing environments. These wild plants offer broader and unique health benefits beyond basic nutrition. Salinization resulted in a drastic reduction of arable land and freshwater intended for cultivation. Thus, the global food production is currently under a risk of meeting the demands. Salt-tolerant plants (i.e., halophytes) are potential food candidates that can be used to increase the productivity of salinized land and also to enhance the diversification of food production. Salicornia can survive under hypersaline and extreme climatic conditions and deliver tender shoots and dried seeds that can be used as a food with a unique taste, texture, and therapeutic benefits. Although Salicornia is not equally popular among all the food cultures globally, it has been consumed over centuries, and it is now making its way to the shelves of supermarkets in some countries such as the United States, UAE, South Korea, and Mexico. Despite being an underutilized crop, Salicornia possesses an array of chemical compounds or basic derivatives that can enhance antioxidant, anti-obesity, antidiabetes, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties of human nutrition. The presence of considerable amounts of nutritional elements and various functional bioactive phytochemicals have opened up avenues of using Salicornia as a functional food. The present paper reviews the recognition of Salicornia as a functional food and a potential cash crop in saline agriculture to enhance agricultural productivity and also to diversify the current food supply chain.",About Sufficiency
From trade-offs to synergies in food security and biodiversity conservation,"Providing universal food security and conserving biodiversity are prominent challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Typically, these challenges are believed to involve a trade-off, especially in farming landscapes of the Global South. We conducted a multivariate analysis of social-ecological data from 110 landscapes in the Global South, and found that different system characteristics lead to partly predictable outcomes, resulting either in trade-offs or, unexpectedly, in synergies (mutual benefits) between food security and biodiversity. Specifically, these synergies are fostered by social equity, by reliable access to local land, and by increasing social capital (eg maintenance of traditions) and human capital (eg health). In contrast, we also found high degrees of food security in landscapes with adequate infrastructure, market access, and financial capital, but this increased security came at the expense of biodiversity. Our findings demonstrate that a social-ecological systems perspective can help to identify previously unrecognized synergies between food security and biodiversity conservation.",About Sufficiency
Supplier Management in Halal Food Supply Chain: A Preliminary Case Study,"Halal food supply chain is unique as it is based on Islamic teachings and hence different from other kinds of supplier management. However, research in this specific field has been scarce, particularly empirical research. Conversely, many empirical researches on conventional supply chain management have focused mainly on supply risks. Therefore, it is important to explore supplier management in halal food supply chains by applying an existing framework of supplier management from other fields. With this in mind, as a preliminary case study, this paper explores supplier management of a small and medium-sized enterprise producing halal foods in Malaysia. The main aim is to identify risk consequences, risk drivers, supply risk sources, and risk mitigating strategies for supplier management in halal food supply chains. Future research needs to include and investigate more cases in which factors such as the size of companies, the capacity and role of halal certification bodies, and the location of operation are operationalized in order to develop the framework discussed in this study",About Sufficiency
Globalized supply chains: Emergent telecouplings in Mexico's beef economy and environmental leakages,"This article analyzes how trade liberalization in Mexico, particularly following the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has transformed that nation's cattle economy into a feedlot system manifesting multiple telecouplings and based on the transnational provision of inputs. A conceptual model is presented that suggests how environmental effects involving land use and GHG emissions emerge from changes in the beef supply chain. The article then presents an empirical analysis establishing that the production of corn and beef has intensified in the wake of NAFTA, and that deforestation rates have declined over the same period. Evidence is also presented showing that this has not precipitated a land sparing effect, given the leakage of deforestation into Central America, which supplies Mexican feedlots with 36 % of their source materials. The article calculates associated GHG emissions and establishes that enteric fermentation dominates deforestation as a source, and that ~14% of GHGs produced by the post-NAFTA Mexican supply chain are emitted in Central America. This raises accounting questions for signatories to the Paris Climate Treaty, given commitments are nation-based.",About Sufficiency
"Costs, Benefits and Challenges of Sustainable Livestock Intensification in a Major Deforestation Frontier in the Brazilian Amazon","Extensive livestock production is a major deforestation driver in the Brazilian Amazon. This study presents an assessment of the economic and environmental feasibility of sustainable livestock intensification in Sao Felix do Xingu municipality, a deforestation frontier with an area of more than 8.5 million hectares, and home to the largest cattle herd in Brazil. Proposed intensification was limited to approximately three animal units per hectare to avoid negative environmental impacts. Transition costs to sustainable cattle intensification were estimated for thirteen pilot farms taking into account adoption of good agriculture practices, pasture maintenance/restoration, and restoration of environmental liabilities. To move to sustainable intensification practices, a mean total annual investment of US$ 1335/ha +/- US$ 619/ha would be necessary, varying from US$ 750 to US$ 2595/ha. Internal rate of return and net present value estimates indicated that the sustainable livestock intensification approach proposed was profitable in farms with more than 400 hectares of pastureland, but not in those where the pasture areas were smaller than 150 hectares. Livestock sustainable intensification also had the potential to promote social and environmental benefits, including a 54% increase in the number of contract workers, improvement of landowners' managerial skills, and workers' training, in addition to avoiding emission of 1.9 Mt CO(2)eq and sequestration of 0.36 Mt CO(2)eq. We conclude that the sustainable intensification of pasture areas has the potential to prevent further deforestation in the Amazon while generating social and other environmental benefits.",About Sufficiency
"Land-use systems and resilience of tropical rain forests in the Tehuantepec Isthmus, Mexico","Land-cover types were analyzed for 1970, 1990 and 2000 as the bases for determining land-use systems and their influence on the resilience of tropical rain forests in the Tehuantepec Isthmus, Mexico. Deforestation (DR) and mean annual transformation rates were calculated from land-cover change data; thus, the classification of land-use change processes was determined according to their impact on resilience: a) Modification, including landcover conservation and intensification, and b) Conversion, including disturbance and regeneration processes. Regeneration processes, from secondary vegetation under extensive use, cultivated vegetation under intensive use, and cultivated or induced vegetation under extensive use to mature or secondary vegetation, have high resilience capacity. In contrast, cattle-raising is characterized by rapid expansion, long-lasting change, and intense damages; thus, recent disturbance processes, which include the conversion to cattle-raising, provoke the downfall of the traditional agricultural system, and nullify the capacity of resilience of tropical rain forest. The land-use cover change processes reveal a) the existence of four land-use systems ( forestry, extensive agriculture, extensive cattle-raising, and intensive uses) and b) a trend towards the replacement of agricultural and forestry systems by extensive cattle-raising, which was consolidated during 1990 - 2000 (DR of evergreen tropical rain forest = 4.6%). Only the forestry system, which is not subject to deforestation, but is affected by factors such as selective timber, extraction, firewood collection, grazing, or human-induced fire, is considered to have high resilience ( 2 years), compared to agriculture ( 2 - 10 years) or cattle-raising ( nonresilient). It is concluded that the analysis of land-use systems is essential for understanding the implications of land-use cover dynamics on forest recovery and land degradation in tropical rain forests.",About Sufficiency
Drivers of decoupling and recoupling of crop and livestock systems at farm and territorial scales,"Crop and livestock production have become spatially decoupled in existing commercial agricultural regimes throughout the world. These segregated high input production systems contribute to some of the world's most pressing sustainability challenges, including climate change, nutrient imbalances, water pollution, biodiversity decline, and increasingly precarious rural livelihoods. There is substantial evidence that by closing the loop in nutrient and energy cycles, recoupling crop and livestock systems at farm and territorial scales can help reduce the environmental externalities associated with conventional commercial farming without declines in profitability or yields. Yet such integrated crop and livestock systems remain rare as a proportion of global agricultural area. Based on an interdisciplinary workshop and additional literature review, we provide a comprehensive historical and international perspective on why integrated crop and livestock systems have declined in most regions and what conditions have fostered their persistence and reemergence in others. We also identify levers for encouraging the reemergence of integrated crop and livestock systems worldwide. We conclude that a major disruption of the current regime would be needed to foster crop-livestock reintegration, including a redesign of research programs, credit systems, payments for ecosystem services, insurance programs, and food safety regulations to focus on whole farm outcomes and the creation of a circular economy. An expansion of the number of integrated crop and livestock systems field trials and demonstrations and efforts to brand integrated crop and livestock systems as a form of sustainable agriculture through the development of eco-labels could also improve adoption, but would likely be unsuccessful at encouraging wide-scale change without a more radical transformation of the research and policy landscape.",About Sufficiency
"CLIMATE-AND LAND USE-INDUCED RISKS TO WATERSHED SERVICES IN THE NYANDO RIVER BASIN, KENYA","Climate change and land use change are two forces influencing the hydrology of watersheds and their ability to provide ecosystem services, such as clean and well-regulated streamflow and control of soil erosion and sediment yield. The Soil Water Assessment Tool, SWAT a distributed, watershed-scale hydrological model was used with 18 scenarios of rainfall, temperature and infiltration capacity of land surface to investigate the spatial distribution of watershed services over the 3587 km(2) Nyando basin in Western Kenya and how it is affected by these two forces. The total annual water yield varied over the 50 sub-basins from 35 to 600 mm while the annual sediment yield ranged From 0 to 104 tons ha(-1). Temperature change had a relatively minor effect on streamflow and sediment yield compared to change in rainfall and land surface condition. Improvements in land surface condition that result in higher infiltration are an effective adaptation strategy to moderate the effects of climate change on supply of watershed services. Spatial heterogeneity in response to climate and land use change is large, and hence it is necessary to understand it if interventions to modify hydrology or adapt to climate change are to be effective.",About Sufficiency
Scenario-Led Habitat Modelling of Land Use Change Impacts on Key Species,"Accurate predictions of the impacts of future land use change on species of conservation concern can help to inform policy-makers and improve conservation measures. If predictions are spatially explicit, predicted consequences of likely land use changes could be accessible to land managers at a scale relevant to their working landscape. We introduce a method, based on open source software, which integrates habitat suitability modelling with scenario-building, and illustrate its use by investigating the effects of alternative land use change scenarios on landscape suitability for black grouse Tetrao tetrix. Expert opinion was used to construct five near-future (twenty years) scenarios for the 800 km(2) study site in upland Scotland. For each scenario, the cover of different land use types was altered by 5-30% from 20 random starting locations and changes in habitat suitability assessed by projecting a MaxEnt suitability model onto each simulated landscape. A scenario converting grazed land to moorland and open forestry was the most beneficial for black grouse, and 'increased grazing' (the opposite conversion) the most detrimental. Positioning of new landscape blocks was shown to be important in some situations. Increasing the area of open-canopy forestry caused a proportional decrease in suitability, but suitability gains for the 'reduced grazing' scenario were nonlinear. 'Scenario-led' landscape simulation models can be applied in assessments of the impacts of land use change both on individual species and also on diversity and community measures, or ecosystem services. A next step would be to include landscape configuration more explicitly in the simulation models, both to make them more realistic, and to examine the effects of habitat placement more thoroughly. In this example, the recommended policy would be incentives on grazing reduction to benefit black grouse.",About Sufficiency
Impact of global food and agriculture laws on Africa's food security,"This study considers expanding beyond the current collective understanding of research on the impact of global food and agriculture laws on Africa's food security. This paper aims to answer two basic questions: are the current global food and agriculture laws capable of facilitating and supporting the goal of ending hunger in Africa and increasing food security; will the existing global food law promote fair and equitable food production and supply practices to benefit all who need it? This paper will answer the questions by using a qualitative approach to Africa's experience in dealing with the existing global food and agriculture laws. This will provide insight into understanding the law, the behaviour of society and the outcome of the application of the law in real life. This will enable us to identify the gap in the global food law addressing food security. The qualitative data in the study will help the in-depth explanation, exploration and understanding of the root cause of food insecurity. This is significant because of the growing tension between population growth and the demand for food which are incompatible, especially in Africa. Currently, Africa's population is estimated to be 1.3 billion people(1) and food production is not sufficient to feed the people. Of the almost 800 million people who are considered to be living with chronic hunger globally, the majority are from Africa.(2) A contemporary study suggests that the population growth in Africa is expected to double to 2.4 billion by 2050.(3) The question we have to ask here is if we cannot feed the current population, how can we feed the ever growing population and what can be done to overcome the deficit? This paper has sought to expose the primary gaps in the existing global food and agriculture laws, weakness and constrains. It is argued that the primary failing of the current global food and agriculture law in addressing food security should be tackled with great concern. It was found that negotiations on agriculture and food at various international forums should bear partial responsibility for the lack of commitment, consistency and transparency in addressing food security. In order to resolve the issue, it is argued that appropriate change in the system is needed, to ensure the fair distribution of benefits and burdens in society. The global food and agriculture law should, therefore, be able to provide a clear method to determine the future global food security.",About Sufficiency
Landscape composition influences farm management effects on farmland birds in winter: A pan-European approach,"This study examined the effects of agricultural intensity, various farming practices, landscape composition and vegetation cover on the abundance and species richness of wintering farmland birds, assessed simultaneously across seven European regions. The abundance and species richness of wintering farmland birds were negatively affected by agricultural intensity. The effects of yield and farm type were interlinked. Of the 10 farming practices assessed, mechanical weeding and the amount of organic fertilizer applied negatively affected farmland birds, presumably due to reduced food availability on arable fields. Positive effects of organic farming on farmland birds proved to be limited to simplified landscapes. More farmland birds were observed in areas with more stubble, pasture and green manure crops. Species richness was higher in areas with more pasture. The results of this study show that farm management, vegetation cover and landscape composition all influence wintering farmland birds. Heterogeneous landscapes comprising arable crops as well as grasslands support most species of farmland birds in winter. The effectiveness of organic farming and agri-environment schemes depends on landscape composition. Therefore, different agri-environment schemes should be designed for different landscape types.

Ecological-economic modelling to compare the impact of organic and conventional farming on endangered grassland bird and butterfly species,"We applied an ecological-economic modelling procedure to analyse the impact of organic versus conventional management of meadows on endangered bird and butterfly species in Saxony, Germany. Applying the modelling procedure enables us to focus on two aspects that hitherto have been neglected in analysing the impact of organic farming on biodiversity. (1) Possible differences in the timing of land use between organic and conventional farming, and (2) differences in the uptake of agri-environment schemes (AES) by organic and conventional farmers. We found that for the species considered the difference in the impact of conventional and organic farming is minor, because in our case study region the timing of land use on most areas with organic farming is very similar to the timing on areas with conventional farming. We also found that in comparison with conventional farmers, organic farmers generally face lower opportunity costs when implementing AES measures. Additionally, organic farmers are offered lower payments for such measures. These factors influence organic farmers' decisions to take part in AES, which in turn has an important impact on biodiversity conservation. In order to better conserve species it may be necessary to adapt the payment structure of AES with respect to organic farming.",About Sufficiency
Germplasm exchange is critical to conservation of biodiversity and global food security,"Global food security depends on the continual improvement of a relatively small number of food and feed crops. Today's food supply is heavily dependent on the movement of seed and other forms of plant germplasm for these crops across national and regional borders. As occurred during the Green Revolution, facilitated and widespread exchange of the major food crops is critical for food security. Plant breeders, molecular biologists, and agronomists, using scientifically guided processes and working collaboratively around the world, are achieving greater gains in crop yields and quality in shorter times than in the past. However, newer policies emerging from international environmental negotiations are giving rise to restrictions that are limiting access and exchange of germplasm and threatening food security. We argue that these evolving policies and practices are having far-reaching and negative impacts on plant breeding, agriculture, and food security. We provide some ideas on how to steer future policy negotiations to encourage germplasm exchange and thereby support food security and other important environmental objectives.",About Sufficiency
Land-use and land-cover assessment for the study of lifestyle change in a rural Mexican community: The Maycoba Project,"Background: In 1995, a study was conducted to identify the effects of traditional and westernized environments on the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians (Pimas) in Mexico and the United States. The study concluded that the more traditional lifestyle in Mexico had a protective effect against this metabolic disorder. In the ensuing 15 years, the environmental circumstances of the Mexican Pimas changed, and a follow-up study was conducted to determine the role environmental change plays in the development of diabetes in this genetically susceptible population. A major element of environmental transition relates to land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes that could affect physical activity and promote an obesogenic environment. This study examined changes in the region's LULC to determine whether there have been transitions in agricultural land use and urbanization that would be consistent with a more sedentary lifestyle. Changes were assessed from 1994 aerial photographs and 2007 satellite images. Results: The land-cover analysis showed that mixed vegetation and dense trees cover most of the study area. It suggested a rural environment that includes a low percentage of impermeable areas, and it indicated that the area experiencing human intervention covers 7% of the total area. The land-use-change findings showed a decrease or no change in agricultural or ranching areas and a decrease in farmland due to reforestation or revegetation. Three variables from the land-use-change analysis were examined as proxies for lifestyle change: urban development, dwelling-unit density, and variation in the road network. Two of the measures-the amount of urbanization and the number and density of dwelling units-showed increases, most notably in the town of Maycoba. There were only minor changes in the road network: most of the road segments are short and concentrated in Maycoba where most of the buildings, points of interest (e.g., church, stores), and cars are located. Conclusions: The LULC in Maycoba and surrounding settlements had changed during the study period. LULC change was used as a proxy to examine lifestyle changes that can affect levels of physical activity.",About Sufficiency
Global congruence of carbon storage and biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems,"Deforestation is a main driver of climate change and biodiversity loss. An incentive mechanism to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) is being negotiated under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Here we use the best available global data sets on terrestrial biodiversity and carbon storage to map and investigate potential synergies between carbon and biodiversity-oriented conservation. A strong association (r(S) = 0.82) between carbon stocks and species richness suggests that such synergies would be high, but unevenly distributed. Many areas of high value for biodiversity could be protected by carbon-based conservation, while others could benefit from complementary funding arising from their carbon content. Some high-biodiversity regions, however, would not benefit from carbon-focused conservation, and could become under increased pressure if REDD is implemented. Our results suggest that additional gains for biodiversity conservation are possible, without compromising the effectiveness for climate change mitigation, if REDD takes biodiversity distribution into account.",About Sufficiency
Global Patterns of Agricultural Investment and Food Security: Evidence from the fDi Markets Database,"The number of hungry people is on the rise and more efforts are needed to improve the global food security status. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) proposes more investment in the agricultural sector to boost production and alleviate hunger. However, there are fewer papers that distinguish enterprises investment from public investment. In this case, we take advantage of detailed investment data in the fDi Markets database to explore the global patterns of agricultural investment. In particular, we identify the top destination countries based on aggregate and sub-sectoral agricultural investment data. Then we investigate the relationship between agricultural investment and food security, which is measured by per capita protein intake. Finally, we propose some suggestions from the investment motivation perspective to help food-insecure countries to attract overseas investment. We find that developed countries are the primary sources of global agricultural investment and these sources have been becoming more diverse in the past decade. It implies the trend towards a more inclusive investment environment worldwide. However, the global distribution of agricultural investment is uneven as food-insecure countries only receive 20% of the global agricultural investment. The top three destination countries, USA, China, and Russia, have a relatively high food security level. In contrast, countries suffering from food insecurity receive fewer investment projects, and most of which are on a small scale. Given the limited socio-economic development status in food-insecure countries, it is essential for all levels of society to help them and contribute to ending hunger.",About Sufficiency
Global potential nitrogen recovery from anaerobic digestion of agricultural residues,"Meeting the anticipated 50% increase in global food demand by 2050 requires a crucial reassessment of agricultural practices, particularly in terms of nitrogen fertilizers inputs. This study analyzes the technical potential of nitrogen recovery from livestock manure and crop residues, bringing attention to the often-overlooked resource of digestate derived from anaerobic digestion. Our analysis highlights the significant capacity of the anaerobic digestion process, yielding approximately 234 +/- 5 million metric tons (Mt) of nitrogen annually, sourced 93% from livestock manure and 7% from crop residues. Additionally, we estimated that substituting synthetic nitrogen with nitrogen from anaerobic digestion has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70% (185 Mt CO2-eq yr-1). Lastly, 2.5 billion people could be sustained by crops grown using nitrogen from anaerobic digestion of manure and crop residues rather than synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Although agricultural residues have double the technical potential of current synthetic nitrogen fertilizer production, 30% of croplands encounter difficulties in satisfying their nitrogen needs solely through crop residues and anaerobic digestion manure. This deficiency primarily results from inefficient reuse attributed to geographical mismatches between crop and livestock systems. This underscores the urgent need to reconnect livestock and cropping systems and facilitate the transport and reuse of manure in crop production. In conclusion, the mobilization of these large amounts of nitrogen from livestock manure and crop residues will require to overcome the nitrogen from anaerobic digestion green premium with incentives and subsidies.",About Sufficiency
"Linking Coleopteran Diversity With Agricultural Management of Maize-Based Agroecosystems in Oaxaca, Mexico","Biodiversity is known to be influenced by agricultural practices in many ways. However, it is necessary to understand how this relation takes place in particular agroecosystems, sociocultural contexts and for specific biological groups, especially in highly biodiverse places. Also, in order to systematically study and track how biodiversity responds or changes with agricultural practices, it is necessary to find groups that can be used as practical indicators. We conduct a study of beetle (Coleoptera) diversity in maize-based agricultural plots with heterogeneous management practices in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca, Mexico, a region with outstanding biodiversity and a long agricultural history. We use a mixture of local knowledge and multivariate statistics to group the plots into two broad and contrasting management categories (traditional vs. industrialized). Then, we present an analysis of Coleopteran diversity for each category, showing higher levels across different diversity indexes for the traditional plots. Specifically, Coleopteran guilds associated with natural pest control and soil conservation are more common in traditional plots than in industrialized ones, while herbivorous beetles are more abundant in the second. Also, our results let us postulate the Curculionidae family as an indicator of both management type and overall Coleopteran diversity in the agricultural lands of the study site. We discuss our results in terms of the agricultural matrix quality and its role in strategies that favor the coexistence of culturally meaningful agricultural systems and local biodiversity.",About Sufficiency

"Influence of tillage, residue management, and crop rotation on soil microbial biomass and catabolic diversity","The densely populated, intensively cropped subtropical highlands of the world have agricultural sustainability problems from soil erosion and fertility decline. In 1991, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) initiated a long-term field experiment at its semi-arid highland experiment station in Mexico (2240 masl; 19.31 degrees N, 98.50 degrees W; Cumulic Phaeozem) to investigate the long-term effects of tillage/seeding practices, crop rotations, and crop residue management on maize and wheat grown under rainfed conditions. Soil ecology status contributes to agricultural system sustainability, and evaluations were made to determine the effect of different management practices on soil microbial biomass (SMB) (substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and chloroform fumigation incubation (CFI)) and micro-flora physiological and catabolic diversity (BIOLOG (TM) ecoplate well system). SMB-C (CFI, SIR) was significantly and respectively 1.2 and 1.3 times higher for residue retention (average 387 mg C kg(dry soil)(-1) and 515 mg C kg(dry soil)(-1), respectively) compared to residue removal. SMB-C (CFI) was significantly higher for wheat (369 mg C kg(dry soil)(-1)) compared to maize (319 mg C kg(dry soil)(-1)). SMB-N (CFI) was significantly 1.3 times higher for residue retention (average 28 mg N kg(dry soil)(-1)) compared to residue removal. The average well color development (AWCD) obtained by the BIOLOG (TM) ecoplate essay indicated there were large differences in the catabolic capability of soil microbial communities after 15 years of contrasting management practices. While maize and wheat rotation under conventional tillage with residue retention showed a significantly higher overall AWCD value compared to the other treatments, AWCD of maize with zero tillage and residue removal was significantly lower than in the other treatments. AWCD was significantly higher for residue retention compared to residue removal and for wheat as compared to maize. For maize, the management practices were divided into two groups; zero tillage with residue removal was separate from all other treatments. For wheat, conventional tillage was separate from all zero tillage treatments. This study suggests that in the target area, a cropping system that includes zero tillage, crop rotation, and crop residue retention can increase overall biomass and micro-flora activity and diversity compared with common farming practices. in the long term, zero tillage combined with residue retention creates conditions favourable for the development of antagonists and predators, and fosters a new ecological stability. Zero tillage without residue retention is an unsustainable practice that leads to poor soil health in the long run. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Governance regime and location influence avoided deforestation success of protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon,"Protected areas in tropical countries are managed under different governance regimes, the relative effectiveness of which in avoiding deforestation has been the subject of recent debates. Participants in these debates answer appeals for more strict protection with the argument that sustainable use areas and indigenous lands can balance deforestation pressures by leveraging local support to create and enforce protective regulations. Which protection strategy is more effective can also depend on (i) the level of deforestation pressures to which an area is exposed and (ii) the intensity of government enforcement. We examine this relationship empirically, using data from 292 protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon. We show that, for any given level of deforestation pressure, strictly protected areas consistently avoided more deforestation than sustainable use areas. Indigenous lands were particularly effective at avoiding deforestation in locations with high deforestation pressure. Findings were stable across two time periods featuring major shifts in the intensity of government enforcement. We also observed shifting trends in the location of protected areas, documenting that between 2000 and 2005 strictly protected areas were more likely to be established in high-pressure locations than in sustainable use areas and indigenous lands.

Social and temporal dynamics mediate the distribution of ecosystem service benefits from a small-scale fishery,"Small-scale fisheries are important for the livelihoods and food security of millions of people in low-income countries. Sustainably managing these dynamic social-ecological systems requires understanding links between ecosystems and human well-being: the focus of ecosystem service approaches. However, in-depth exploration of how co-production and temporal dynamics shape ecosystem benefits in small-scale fisheries remain nascent. There is thus an opportunity to better investigate pathways through which small-scale fisheries support food security. To address this gap, we ask how households allocate seafood landings across different uses, depending on supply and season. Using a daily survey, we collected panel data on landings from 15 households on Atauro Island, Timor-Leste, over six 1-week periods across three seasons, representing 630 survey days and 179 fishing trips. We found households mediate the pathways through which seafood contributes to food security. Specifically, the proportion of landings eaten, sold or shared changed with the amount landed and across seasons. As landings increased, households ate a smaller proportion and sold a greater proportion. The greatest proportion of landings were sold in the preparation season, when households save money to buy staple foods. Landings were shared with family and kin, reflecting the importance of seafood for social capital and community food security. Put broadly, households shaped a dynamic and non-linear (not directly proportional) relationship between service supply and benefits. Our findings demonstrate that seasonal context and livelihood priorities shape seafood provisioning benefits in small-scale fisheries. Careful consideration of temporal scale in ecosystem service assessments is critical for sustainable management of small-scale fisheries.",About Sufficiency
Grazing in the Mediterranean Mid-Mountains to Mitigate Climate Change: An Experience in the Northwestern Iberian System,"The livestock sector, especially in its intensive form, is considered highly relevant in the context of climate change due to its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.

On the other hand, extensive livestock farming can help to mitigate climate change through grazing. This study analyses how the combination of shrub clearing and grazing contributes to reducing forest fires and increasing organic carbon (SOC) storage in the soil. The study was conducted in the Northwestern Iberian System (Spain), a sparsely populated Mediterranean mid-mountain region. In the landscape predominates shrubs in different stages of plant succession after rural abandonment, with extensive livestock farming being the main economic activity. Since 1986, the regional government has cleared approximately 30% of shrublands, reducing the amount of available combustible material. The burned area has decreased from an average of 1,060 ha/year in the period 1968-1986 to 222.6 ha/year between 1987 and 2023. It has also been found that pastures regenerated after clearing, as well as managed forest plantations (thinning and grazing), accumulate more SOC than the shrublands. In these marginalized mountains there are people who want to continue living off local resources. Extensive livestock farming can help retain the population, while also contributing to climate change mitigation and providing ecosystem services to society.",About Sufficiency
"Green technological progress, agricultural modernization, and wage inequality: Lessons from China","Green technological progress (GTP) is crucial for environmental protection and economic growth in China. Over the past decades, China made huge GTP which exerts a far-reaching consequence on economic and social development. However, a paucity of research investigates the distributional effect of GTP. Meanwhile, we incorporate agricultural producer service sector into a three-sector general equilibrium model to reflect the modernization of small-scale agriculture. The agricultural producer service sector that acts as an intermediate sector can facilitate the utilization of intermediate inputs indirectly. To desalinate this process, a two-layer vertical production structure is established: parts of manufacturing goods are utilized by the service sector, outputs of which are intermediate inputs that could substitute labor in agriculture. Theoretical analysis shows that GTP increases both wage of skilled labor and unskilled labor. Nevertheless, GTP generates a greater impact on the wage of skilled labor than unskilled labor, leading to widening income disparity. Then, we examine the impact of GTP on wage inequality using a balanced panel data covering 30 provincial units in China during 2000-2019. In line with our theoretical conjecture, we find strong supportive evidences that GTP significantly widens the wage inequality.",About Sufficiency
Growth Performance of Broiler Chicken Supplemented with Bacillus velezensis D01Ca and Bacillus siamensis G01Bb Isolated from Goat and Duck Microbiota,"The increasing global demand for sustainable agricultural practices and the quest for food security has intensified the need for alternative solutions to promote healthy growth in farm animals. One potential strategy is the use of probiotics derived from diverse sources, which remains relatively uncharted. In this context, this study aimed to assess the probiotic potentials of Bacillus velezensis D01Ca and Bacillus siamensis G01Bb, strains sourced from the gut of ducks and goats. Using two completely randomized experimental designs with 150-day-old broiler chickens, two distinct set-ups were implemented. In the first, broilers were subjected to either a control condition, a single dose of B. velezensis D01Ca at 2.4 x 107 cfu/ml, or its double dose. The second set-up followed a similar setup, but with B. siamensis G01Bb at 2.29 x 107 cfu/ml. Throughout the 42-day trial, all broilers consumed a commercial ration ad libitum and accessed water freely, with specific groups receiving the supplemented water based on the treatment. Results show that the feed intake of broilers remained unaffected by the probiotic supplementation, with no significant difference (P <= 0.05). However, broilers in the supplemented groups exhibited a noticeable increase in body weight and body weight gain when compared to the control. The feed conversion ratio, crucially, was consistent across all test groups. Conclusively, our findings suggest that B. velezensis D01Ca and B. siamensis G01Bb hold promise as viable probiotics for broiler chickens, offering potential strides toward sustainable agricultural practices and enhanced food security.",About Sufficiency
"Comparative energy-economic analysis of the maize agroecosystem under conventional and conservation practices in the Frailesca region, Chiapas, Mexico","Given the need for scientific information to make better decisions to counteract pollution and environmental degradation, this research aimed to compare the maize-agroecosystem from an energy and economic perspective under two management practices: conservation and conventional in the Frailesca region of Chiapas, Mexico. Qualitative and quantitative variables were related through a factorial analysis of principal components. An interdisciplinary research methodology with socio-agronomic and economic approaches was used. Semistructured interviews were applied in 75 communities to 300 maize farmers who were grouped according to the type of practices implemented in the maize system: conventional or conservation agriculture. The variables analyzed for energy efficiency were: grain yield (t.ha(-1)), consumed energy (MJ), produced energy (MJ.ha(-1)), energy intensity and energy efficiency. Economic variables analyzed were net income, net outflow and income/cost ratio. Additionally, some land use variables were also analyzed. In the economic aspect, it was found that the main difference between both practices is the costs arising from soil preparation and stubble management which are higher for conventional maize management. In the energy aspect. conservation management differs from the conventional one by a more energy-use of efficiency expressed in the total energy required for production (5,854.55 MJ and 6,422.19 MJ, respectively). This efficiency comes mainly from the inputs used in the maize production process.",About Sufficiency
Compliance of agricultural practices used in family farms with those recommended in organic farming,"This research intended to evaluate to what extent the managers in family farms tend to adopt practices of organic farming and identify the possible factors that might be associated with those choices. For that, a survey was undertaken in Portuguese and Spanish municipalities. The participation, by direct interview, was voluntary and 125 valid responses were obtained distributed as: 30 in Viseu (PT), 30 in Braga (PT), 30 in Barcelos (PT), 16 in Pontevedra (SP) and 19 in Padron (SP). For the treatment of the data, basic descriptive statistics tools were used in combination with crosstabs and chi square tests. Also tree classifications were conducted following the Classification and Regression Trees algorithm. In all tests a level of significance of 5% was considered. The results identified factors that influenced the behaviour of the managers in family farms towards an approximation to organic farming practices, which were the level of education and municipality, found as major determinants of the level of compliance with organic farming practices. Also, other factors like age or gender influence, although to a lesser extent, the compliance with organic farming. These results were the same for the chisquare tests or the tree classification analysis, and they thus indicate that improvements could be achieved towards a more expressive adoption of organic farming practices if planned to target the influential factors identified.",About Sufficiency
Towards Intelligent Food Waste Prevention: An Approach Using Scalable and Flexible Harvest Schedule Optimization With Evolutionary Algorithms,"In times of climate change, growing world population, and the resulting scarcity of resources, efficient and economical usage of agricultural land is increasingly important and challenging at the same time. To avoid disadvantages of monocropping for soil and environment, it is advisable to practice intercropping of various plant species whenever possible. However, intercropping is challenging as it requires a balanced planting schedule due to individual cultivation time frames. Maintaining a continuous harvest throughout the season is important as it reduces logistical costs and related greenhouse gas emissions, and can also help to reduce food waste. Motivated by the prevention of food waste, this work proposes a flexible optimization method for a full harvest season of large crop ensembles that complies with given economical and environmental constraints. Our approach applies evolutionary algorithms and we further combine our evolution strategy with a sophisticated hierarchical loss function and adaptive mutation rate. We thus transfer the multi-objective into a pseudo-single-objective optimization problem, for which we obtain faster and better solutions than those of conventional approaches.",About Sufficiency
Assessment of the Successes and Failures of Decentralized Energy Solutions and Implications for the Water-Energy-Food Security Nexus: Case Studies from Developing Countries,"Access to reliable and affordable energy is vital for sustainable development. In the off-grid areas of developing countries, decentralized energy solutions have received increasing attention due to their contributions to reducing poverty. However, most of the rural population in many developing countries still has little or no access to modern energy technologies. This paper assesses the factors that determine the successes and failures of decentralized energy solutions based on local harmonized case studies from heterogeneous contexts from Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. The case studies were analyzed through the coupled lenses of energy transition and the Water-Energy-Food Security (WEF) Nexus. The findings indicate that access to modern decentralized energy solutions has not resulted in complete energy transitions due to various tradeoffs with the other domains of the WEF Nexus. On the other hand, the case studies point at the potential for improvements in food security, incomes, health, the empowerment of women, and resource conservation when synergies between decentralized energy solutions and other components of the WEF Nexus are present.",About Sufficiency

Small-scale agricultural landscapes and organic management support wild bee communities of cereal field boundaries,"Pollinators are sensitive to agricultural intensification at both local and landscape scales. High configurational landscape heterogeneity due to small fields and a high amount of field boundaries is hypothesized to enhance farmland biodiversity. Here, we investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming in large- vs. small-scale agricultural landscapes on wild bee communities and their floral resources to improve conservation schemes for pollinators. We sampled bees in Central Germany at the field boundaries of 18 pairs of conventionally and organically managed winter wheat fields along the former iron curtain using pan traps and trap nests. Around traps, we surveyed species richness and flower cover of insect-pollinated forbs. Compared to conventional farming, organic farming was related to higher insect-pollinated forb species richness and flower cover in the field boundaries, presumably due to the lack of herbicide use. Interestingly, small-scale agriculture did not counteract the loss of floral resources under conventional management, as the difference to organic management was even larger in Western small-scale agriculture. Organic farming, but not small-scale agriculture, enhanced species richness of solitary bees, which is in line with their small home ranges. In contrast, bumblebees benefitted only from small-scale agriculture, which matches with their high dispersal ability. Despite similar levels of abundance and diversity of trap-nesting bees in the two landscape types, brood cell parasitism was also higher in small-scale agriculture. Both organic farming and small-scale agriculture directly and indirectly supported different groups of wild bees, suggesting long-term benefits for conservation. Agri environment schemes should acknowledge the so far neglected benefits of small-scale agriculture for biodiversity and its potential services.",About Sufficiency
Poverty Alleviation Through Technology-Driven Increases in Crop Production by Smallholder Farmers in Dryland Areas of Sub-Saharan Africa: How Plausible Is This Theory of Change?,"The current paradigm of agricultural research and extension in support of rural development in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is to disseminate improved technologies designed to increase the generally low crop yields per hectare on individual farms. Using data from a baseline survey (n = 7,539) from a large rural development programme implemented in five countries in SSA, we calculate the increases in yield per hectare required to significantly contribute to poverty alleviation for households managing such farms. We estimate the gap between current crop productivity and the productivity required to reach a poverty line of $1.90 per capita per day adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). We find this gap to be very large, both in percentage and absolute terms. Median additional gross crop productivity required to reach this poverty threshold was: $324/ha/year (254% increase) in Mali; $1,359/ha/year (1,157% increase) in Niger; $4,989/ha/year (665% increase) in Ethiopia; $1,742/ha/year (818% increase) in Burkina Faso; $2,893/ha/year (1,297% increase) in Kenya. The required additional productivity taking account of production costs including the opportunity cost of family labor would need to be even higher. Given that (a) values of net productivity of improved rainfed crop technologies reported in the literature rarely exceed $1,000/ha/year; and (b) the majority of arable farms in SSA are two hectares or less with increasing trends toward land fragmentation, we argue that closing the yield gap among smallholder farmers in SSA will never-alone-be sufficient to meaningfully alleviate the high levels of poverty and deprivation many currently experience.",About Sufficiency
"Households' willingness to accept compensation for agricultural waste recycling: taking biogas production from livestock manure waste in Hubei, P. R. China as an example","The problem of agricultural waste pollution has aroused wide concern around the world. An effective measure to solve this problem is to implement the compensation policy so as to encourage people to participate in agricultural waste recycling. This paper seeks to estimate households' willingness to accept compensation in terms of agricultural waste recycling adopting the contingent valuation method, and to calculate the compensation standard for households' participation in agricultural waste recycling by methods of non-parametric and parametric estimate. It aims to answer two questions: how much the compensation should be given for encouraging households to participate in agricultural waste recycling? Which factors would affect willingness to accept compensation value of households for participating in agricultural waste recycling? The results show that most households recognize the value of agricultural waste recycling and a certain amount of compensation which is about 1.08%-1.31% of average family annual income does encourage households to participate in agricultural waste recycling. Household's willingness to accept compensation and household's expected value of compensation are affected by personal or family characteristics (such as gender, household income) as well as the non-economic variables (such as environmental knowledge and environmental attitude). According to this research, reasonable compensation standard is the cornerstone of the effectiveness and efficiency of compensation policies. Household income inequality and capital allocation in terms of households' willingness to accept compensation should be taken into consideration when compensation policies about agricultural waste recycling are formulated. Environmental education for households is an effective measure to enhance their environmental consciousness, while raising the strength of government's waste management is turned out to be effective for improving the rural ecological environment. Conclusions of this study provide an important scientific basis for developing countries and regions to formulate compensation policies in terms of inspiring their agricultural waste recycling.

"Health outcomes, environmental impacts, and diet costs of adherence to the EAT- Lancet Diet in China in 1997-2015: a health and nutrition survey","Background In 2019, the EAT- Lancet Commission proposed a global reference dietary pattern. Although research on the EAT- Lancet reference diet and its associations with mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, dietary environmental impacts, and cost of diets is increasing, studies done in low-income and middle-income countries remain scarce. This study aimed to assess the health outcomes, environmental impacts, and dietary costs of adherence to the EAT- Lancet reference diet in China. Methods In this health and nutrition survey study, 16 029 participants from the China Health and Nutrition Survey cohort (1997-2015) were included at baseline. All-cause mortality was reported by family members and risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes was self-reported. 3-day 24 h recall was used to assess adherence to the EAT- Lancet reference diet (Eat- Lancet Diet Index [ELDI]), diet-related environmental impacts (greenhouse-gas emissions [GHGE]), total water use (TWU), land use, and dietary costs in each survey round. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the ELDI-score were obtained by Cox models with time-varying covariates, adjusted for potential confounders. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression was used to assess the association of environmental impacts and dietary costs to the ELDI score. Findings During a median follow-up of 9<middle dot>86 years, 803 new cases of incident type 2 diabetes, 563 new cases of cardiovascular disease, and 908 cases of all-cause mortality were recorded. At baseline, the ELDI score ranged from 9<middle dot>4 points to 110<middle dot>8 points on a scale of 0 to 140, with a mean of 55<middle dot>3 points (SD 11<middle dot>8). With each SD increase in the ELDI score, there was an 8% decreased risk of mortality (95% CI 2<middle dot>2-14<middle dot>1), a 16<middle dot>1% decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (9<middle dot>2-20<middle dot>3), and a 25<middle dot>3% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (19<middle dot>5- 28<middle dot>4). Each SD increase in the index was associated with a decrease of 2<middle dot>2% (95% CI -2<middle dot>6 to -1<middle dot>8) in GHGE, 2<middle dot>3% (-2<middle dot>6 to -2<middle dot>0) in land use, no association with TWU, but an increase in diet costs of 3<middle dot>3% (2<middle dot>8 to 3<middle dot>8). Interpretation High adherence to the ELDI was associated with a lower risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. However, the association with diet-related GHGE and land use was modest, and adherence was also linked to higher diet costs. The study advocates for the integration of sustainable indicators into future Chinese dietary guidelines. Additionally, policy measures such as agricultural subsidies on fruit and vegetable and carbon taxes on red meat are recommended to increase affordability, reduce environmental impact, and enhance the overall sustainability of dietary practices in China.",About Sufficiency
Healthiness and environmental impact of dinner recipes vary widely across developed countries,"Individuals' food choices are typically based on recipes, not specific ingredients. This study compares almost 600 dinner recipes from the UK, the USA and Norway in terms of healthiness and environmental impact-including adherence to dietary guidelines and aggregate health indicators, as well as greenhouse gas emissions and land use. Contrary to food ingredients, little is known about recipes' healthiness or environmental impact. Here we examine 600 dinner recipes from Norway, the UK and the USA retrieved from cookbooks and the Internet. Recipe healthiness was assessed by adherence to dietary guidelines and aggregate health indicators based on front-of-pack nutrient labels, while environmental impact was assessed through greenhouse gas emissions and land use. Our results reveal that recipe healthiness strongly depends on the healthiness indicator used, with more than 70% of the recipes being classified as healthy for at least one front-of-pack label, but less than 1% comply with all dietary guidelines. All healthiness indicators correlated positively with each other and negatively with environmental impact. Recipes from the USA, found to use more red meat, have a higher environmental impact than those from Norway and the UK.",About Sufficiency
Health-promoting substances and heavy metal content in tomatoes grown with different farming techniques,"Background Organic farming is a production technique that imposes major restrictions on the use of fertilizers, pesticides, feed additives and veterinary drugs and for this reason consumers perceive organic foods to be healthier. The content of health-promoting molecules such as ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, lycopene and salicylic acid are important aspects of the nutritional quality of organic foods. Aim To evaluate health promoting substances and the heavy metal content of tomato berries grown using conventional, integrated pest management (IPM) and organic farming techniques. Methods Moisture was determined by drying, crude protein by the Kjeldhal method, and ashes by incineration at 550 degrees C. Ergosterol, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, lycopene and salicylic acid were determined by HPLC. The levels of heavy metals were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Results Compared to crops grown using conventional and IPM methods, organic tomatoes contained more salicylic acid but less vitamin C and lycopene. Organic tomatoes had higher Cd and Pb levels but a lower Cu content. Organic fruits had a slightly higher protein content than conventionally cultivated fruits, but the difference was minimal and consequently the nutritive significance was poor. Conclusions Farming techniques may have an impact on the quality of tomatoes. Their higher salicylate content supports the notion that organic foodstuffs are more wholesome. However, the lower lycopene and ascorbic acid levels of organic tomatoes are not to be regarded as positive. No residues of pesticides and ergosterol were detected.",About Sufficiency
Food security status of mothers at-risk for child maltreatment,"This study examined the food security status of a mother at risk for child protective service involvement in Missouri.

Heterogeneous impacts of greenhouse farming technology as climate-smart agriculture on household welfare in Ghana,"The contributions of climate-smart agriculture to the transformation of agri-food systems as well as reducing the vulnerability of smallholder agriculture production to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa have been acknowledged in the sustainable development literature. However, studies on the impacts of adoption of climatesmart agriculture (CSA) have not thoroughly explored the impact of greenhouse technology (GHT) adoption as a CSA practice on household welfare. This study attempts to fill-in this knowledge gap by analysing the drivers of GHT adoption as well as the heterogeneous impacts of GHT adoption as CSA practice on household welfare using the marginal treatments effect (MTE) model and a unique data on greenhouse and conventional farmers from southern Ghana. The findings from the study indicate that GHT adoption as a CSA practice assisted smallholder vegetable farmers to improve their crop yields, net farm returns and per capita consumption expenditures by 21%, 15% and 13%, respectively. Further evidence from policy relevant treatment effects (PRTE) of the MTE model suggests that having access to market and climate information tend to boost GHT adoption, which consequently improve household welfare. Hence, development agencies and practitioners should make conscious efforts to accelerate the promotion of GHT as a sustainable agricultural technology that could minimize the negative effects of climate change.",About Sufficiency
Historical land use patterns provide insight into contemporary insect diversity loss,"Healthy insect populations are vital for maintaining natural ecosystems and essential to global food security. The ongoing dramatic loss of insect species and biomass is thus a global cause for concern, with much focus on this topic in the media. Yet, determining the mechanism behind these declines remains difficult, particularly when attempting to differentiate between anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity loss and long-term natural fluctuations. In a From the Cover manuscript in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Crossley et al. (2022) examined the long-term impact of land use change on freshwater insects by estimating levels of genetic diversity with publicly available data for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) mitochondrial locus from >700 aquatic insect species across the United States. Contemporary genetic diversity measures reflect both current and past demography and therefore are related to both past and present habitat change. Crossley et al. found that environments with greater cropland extent over the last 200 years were associated with lower genetic diversity in contemporary aquatic insect populations. This indicates that historical land use is an important factor in contemporary population dynamics. Most critically, in regions of historical cropland cover that have been converted towards other uses (such as urban environments) more recently, aquatic insect populations exhibited higher levels of genetic diversity, indicating a possible rebound in insect populations after cessation of agricultural activity.

Technological Advancements and the Changing Face of Crop Yield Stability in Asia,"Recent technological advancements have revolutionized agriculture in Asia, leading to significant changes in crop yield stability. This study examines the changing face of crop yield stability in Asia resulting from the increasing adoption of innovative technologies in agriculture. Through a review of current research and case studies, the impact of technology-driven changes on yield levels, variability, and predictability is explored. The study applies a yield stability index (YSI) to evaluate the yield stability of six crops in seven Asian countries during two periods (1961-1994 and 1995-2020), comparing the countries, crops, and stability changes between the two segments. The novelty of the research is the application of YSI, which, contrary to usual stability metrics, can distinguish between rare large extreme yields and frequent minor fluctuations, and based on this feature, evaluates the suitability of the prevailing technologies to local environmental conditions. The YSI is used to evaluate the stability of technologies, indicating whether the technologies can respond well to the annual variations of environmental conditions. Positive YSI values indicate stable technologies that can respond well to the annual variations of environmental conditions, and the concept of a well-technologized crop is used for crops in countries with stable positive YSI values, indicating the suitability of the actual crop to the actual geographical environment. These results can guide production technology developments and the introduction or abandonment of certain crops in certain geographical zones, especially regarding the implications of climate change and global warming. This study highlights the transformative power of technology in improving crop yield stability and food security in Asia, while discussing the potential challenges associated with these changes and the need for continued research to address them.",About Sufficiency
Restoration of Rice Ecosystem Services: 'Ecological Engineering for Pest Management' Incentives and Practices in the Mekong Delta Region of Vietnam,"Ecological engineering is an agroecological approach to pest management that has been adopted by thousands of rice farmers in the Mekong Delta Region of Vietnam. Farmers adopted the intervention as part of a heuristic approach to developing the technology. This study assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices related to ecological engineering among participating and non-participating farmers. Interviews with 315 farmers revealed a diversity of practices under the umbrella of ecological engineering, all of which were associated with the establishment of linear vegetation strips as habitat for natural enemies. As a restoring service from society to the rice ecosystem, ecological engineering incorporated significant positive-feedback loops, particularly regarding the production of supplementary foods (provisioning services) and the aesthetic value (cultural services) of planted rice bunds. Participating farmers reported fewer insecticide applications to their main rice crop; they applied insecticides at a later crop growth stage (protecting pest regulating services); and they reported higher rice yields. However, a high dependency on government support, the role of agrochemical extensionists in providing information, a tendency to apply pesticides to vegetation strips and little change in the appreciation of wildlife-related services all threaten the social sustainability of the intervention. We recommend greater attention to optimizing linear strips to not only support natural enemies but to also enhance supplementary farm incomes while reducing material and labor costs.",About Sufficiency

Household factors and gestational age predict diet quality of pregnant women,"Adequate diet during pregnancy has positive effects on the mother and pregnancy outcome. Assessment of diet quality during pregnancy is particularly important in areas where household food security is suboptimal, to enable appropriate targeting and intervention. This study assessed diet quality and identified predicting factors among pregnant women in northern Ghana. A cross-sectional study involving 403 pregnant women was conducted in May 2018. Pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics (ANC) were selected using simple random sampling technique. We assessed socio-demographic characteristics, 24-h recall and household food security. The minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W) was used as a proxy measure for diet quality based on Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) guidelines. Logistic regression models were fitted to determine the predictors of diet quality. The mean dietary diversity score (DDS) of 10 food groups was 4.4 +/- 1.1 (95% CI: 4.3-4.5). Logistic regression showed that women of high educational level (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.21-4.84]; P = 0.01), women of high household wealth index (AOR = 1.78; 95% CI [1.14-2.77]; P = 0.01], none/mild household hunger (AOR = 2.71; 95% CI [1.26-5.82]; P = 0.01), medium household size (6-15 members) (AOR = 1.66; 95% CI [1.04-2.66]; P = 0.03) and women of gestational age 20-35 weeks (AOR = 1.89; 95% CI [1.05-3.40]; P = 0.03) were more likely to have quality diets after adjusting for potential confounding variables.

This study explores the impacts of COVID-19 on household income, food security, and food consumption patterns in the urban slums of Punjab, Pakistan. Using a multistage random sampling method, cross-sectional data was collected from 257 households through face-to-face interviews. Respondents were chosen randomly applying the random walk method. The data were analysed using Probit regression models. The household food security situation was estimated using the food insecurity experience scale (HFIES) developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Results show that household income and food security situations during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly affected by education level, household size, daily-wage earnings, salaried employment, and household income slot-I. Household participation in social safety programs appears to help mitigate income shocks and decrease food insecurity. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, 73.92% and 54.86% of the surveyed households faced income shocks and worsened food security, respectively. The consumption of meat, poultry products, and seafood decreased by 21.01%, 17.50%, and 14.39%, respectively, during the pandemic, in comparison to the pre-pandemic period. The study recommends that authorities should consider continuously focusing on supporting existing national social safety programs and designing new ones by providing responsive packages during such adversities.

This study aimed at characterizing how CC policies can help farmers to combine CC with other environmental issues to support the design of more effective policies at the farm level. It was conducted in Guadeloupe, where farming systems are highly vulnerable to CC. We analyzed the Agro-Environmental and Climate Measures (AECM) proposed by the European Union. We made surveys with 39 farmers and used an existing whole-farm simulation tool to assess practices promoted by the current AECM. The tool was also used to assess the new AECM under discussion by stakeholders. Structural characteristics allowed identifying various types of farms. These characteristics may affect farmers' capacity to implement the current AECM given that they are labour-intensive. New AECM focused on the decrease in pesticides and do not properly address CC since most of them lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and are very different from the current farmers' CC adaptation strategies. Synergies can be found between the reduction of pesticide use and CC if the alternatives proposed also permit to decrease in the use of synthetic fertilizers.",About Sufficiency

The assessment highlights the significant risks that climate change poses to Bangladesh's food security and vulnerable women, including increased susceptibility to food shortages and post-disaster issues, given that women in Bangladesh are more susceptible to these issues due to their social, economic, and political circumstances. The literature review demonstrates that disadvantaged groups, particularly women, are negatively impacted by climate change. Profound policy implications should propose for enhancing system performance, coordinating regional agricultural output, and fortifying resistance to climate change.",About Sufficiency
How Does Land Fragmentation Affect Agricultural Technical Efficiency? Based on Mediation Effects Analysis,"The scientific revelation of the mechanism underlying land fragmentation's influence on agricultural technical efficiency is extremely important. This study utilized survey data from 305 villages across 12 provinces in Southern China in 2020 to assess technical efficiency through the application of the stochastic frontier production function. Moreover, we investigated the direct impact of land fragmentation on technical efficiency and the indirect impact transmitted through crop diversification and part-time farming by employing Tobit and mediating effect models, respectively. The key findings are as follows: (1) The sampled farmers, on average, operated 0.614 hectares of land with 17.395 plots, and the mean of their technical efficiency was 0.630. (2) The overall effect of land fragmentation on technical efficiency demonstrated a ""U""-shaped relationship. (3) Crop diversification and part-time farming were mediating factors in the impact of land fragmentation on technical efficiency. Specifically, an ""inverted U""-shaped relationship existed between land fragmentation and crop diversification, whereas a negative linear relationship was observed between land fragmentation and part-time farming. Conversely, crop diversification presented a positive linear relationship with technical efficiency, and part-time farming had an ""inverted U""-shaped relationship with technical efficiency. (4) The impact of land fragmentation on technical efficiency varied across altitude zones. It is recommended to control land fragmentation based on local conditions, encourage crop diversification, and strengthen employment guidance and skills training for farmers to ensure the orderly transfer of land.",About Sufficiency
HOW ETHNOBIOLOGY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO FOOD SECURITY,"Food insecurity is a compelling global problem with compound causation in population expansion, industrialization of agriculture and food marketing, and environmental deterioration. The United Nations system has addressed the need for food and nutrition security from a foundation of human rights law and expressed the requirement for all people to be food secure with sustainable food systems and diets. Food biodiversity is a component of the sustainable food systems that are practiced by Indigenous Peoples living in intact ecosystems. This paper describes the evolution of the principles of food and nutrition security within the United Nations, explores current issues, and highlights a program with Indigenous Peoples' food systems that includes health promotion interventions using biodiverse local foods. Highlighted are the roles of ethnobiologists in understanding the principles and concepts underlying food and nutrition security, in promoting food biodiversity and healthy food systems, and in contributing to policies protecting food biodiversity and food and nutrition security.",About Sufficiency
"How green are you, really? Consumers' skepticism toward brands with green claims","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between perceptions of brands advertising claims of environmental sustainability, intention to purchase such brands and the role of trust. Design/methodology/approach - Adapted scales were used to measure perceptions of price-value perception, environmental concern, brand trust and purchase intention. Relationships were tested using simple regression and structural equations modeling. Findings - The results suggest that consumers who did not report high environmental concern had high brand trust but no significant purchase intention; consumers who reported high environmental concern had significant intention to purchase green products, but negative trust in brands which were advertised with a claim to be green. Research limitations/implications - Efforts to advertise green claims may only be effective for consumers without an intention to purchase green products, and may alienate consumers who are interested in purchasing such products. Structural equations modeling was tested on a post hoc basis with a sample size that did not warrant very good fit ratios. Originality/value - The present study indicates that green claims may be misguided, and that products that have genuine green benefits may need to find alternative methods of communicating those benefits to consumers who intend to engage in sustainable consumption behavior.",About Sufficiency
How Related Are the Prices of Organic and Conventional Corn and Soybean?,"Cointegration was tested between organic and conventional corn and soybean markets in several locations throughout the U.S. using a unique dataset. Organic prices were found to behave like pure jump processes rather than diffusions. A simple specification for pure jump processes is introduced and used with Monte Carlo methods to compute appropriate critical values for unit-root and cointegration tests. The findings indicate that no long-run relationship exists between organic and conventional prices, implying that price determination for organic corn and soybean is independent from that of the conventional crops. This suggests that organic corn and soybean prices are driven by demand and supply forces idiosyncratic to the organic market. For each crop, cointegrating spatial relationships are found between prices at the main organic markets. However, such relationships are generally weaker than the ones for the corresponding conventional prices, implying that organic markets are more affected by idiosyncratic shocks than conventional markets.

How to Measure the Performance of Farms with Regard to Climate-Smart Agriculture Goals? A Set of Indicators and Its Application in Guadeloupe,"Conceptualized by the Food and Agriculture Organization in 2010, climate-smart agriculture aims to simultaneously tackle three main objectives. These are increasing food security, building the resilience of agricultural systems for adaptation to climate change and mitigation of GHG. As much research focuses on one of these three objectives, our understanding of how agricultural systems address these three challenges simultaneously is limited by the lack of a comprehensive evaluation tool. In order to fill this gap, we have developed a generic evaluation framework that comprises 19 indicators that we measured in a sample of 12 representative farms of the North Basse-Terre region in Guadeloupe. The evaluation revealed clear differences in the performance of these farming systems. For example, nutritional performance varied from 0 to 13 people fed per hectare, the average potential impact of climatic conditions varied from 27% to 33% and the GHG emissions balance varied from +0.8 tCO(2eq)center dot ha(-1) to +3.6 tCO(2eq)center dot ha(-1). The results obtained can guide the design of innovative production systems that better meet the objectives of climate-smart agriculture for the study region. The evaluation framework is intended as a generic tool for a common evaluation basis across regions at a larger scale.

ICTs to address information inefficiencies in food supply chains,"In developing countries, incomplete and/or asymmetric information contributes to inefficiencies in food supply chains. Various products and services have emerged that rely on Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to facilitate information flows between agro-input providers, farmers, traders, and consumers. However, not all initiatives are equally effective and many struggle to reach scale. In this article, I review some of the earlier services that generally targeted farmers with price information to reduce search costs and increase their bargaining power vis-a-vis traders. I reflect on the reasons why these initiatives often led to disappointing results and provide examples of (complementary) interventions that look more promising. Furthermore, I highlight some of the dangers of relying too much on ICT-mediated information, such as exclusionary networks, bias in crowdsourced data, and ""fake news."" Finally, I explore why ICT applications that address information inefficiencies seem to be less successful than innovations that address other barriers to efficient and inclusive food supply chain development, such as risk or credit constraints.",About Sufficiency
Identifying Climate-smart agriculture research needs,"Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach to help agricultural systems worldwide, concurrently addressing three challenge areas: increased adaptation to climate change, mitigation of climate change, and ensuring global food security - through innovative policies, practices, and financing. It involves a set of objectives and multiple transformative transitions for which there are newly identified knowledge gaps. We address these questions raised by CSAwithin three areas: conceptualization, implementation, and implications for policy and decision-makers. We also draw up scenarios on the future of the CSA concept in relation to the 4 per 1000 Initiative (Soils for Food Security and Climate) launched at UNFCCC 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21). Our analysis shows that there is still a need for further interdisciplinary research on the theoretical foundation of the CSA concept and on the necessary transformations of agriculture and land use systems. Contrasting views about implementation indicate that CSA focus on the ""triple win"" (adaptation, mitigation, food security) needs to be assessed in terms of science-based practices.

Identifying crop water stress using deep learning models,"The identification of water stress is a major challenge for timely and effective irrigation to ensure global food security and sustainable agriculture. Several direct and indirect methods exist for identification of crop water stress, but they are time consuming, tedious and require highly sophisticated sensors or equipment. Image processing is one of the techniques which can help in the assessment of water stress directly. Machine learning techniques combined with image processing can aid in identifying water stress beyond the limitations of traditional image processing. Deep learning (DL) techniques have gained momentum recently for image classification and the convolutional neural network based on DL is being applied widely. In present study, comparative assessment of three DL models: AlexNet, GoogLeNet and Inception V3 are applied for identification of water stress in maize (Zea mays), okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and soybean (Glycine max) crops. A total of 1200 digital images were acquired for each crop to form the input dataset for the deep learning models. Among the three models, performance of GoogLeNet was found to be superior with an accuracy of 98.3, 97.5 and 94.1% for maize, okra and soybean, respectively. The onset of convergence in GoogLeNet models commenced after 8 epochs with 22 (maize), 31 (okra) and 15 (soybean) iterations per epoch with error rate of less than 7.5%.",About Sufficiency
Identifying plant mixes for multiple ecosystem service provision in agricultural systems using ecological networks,"Managing agricultural environments in a way that maximises the provision of multiple ecosystem services is a significant challenge in the development of sustainable and secure food systems. Advances in network ecology provide a way forward, particularly in arable landscapes, as they incorporate mutualistic and antagonistic interactions associated with crop production. Here, we present an approach to identify mixes of non-crop plant species that provide multiple ecosystem services while minimising disservices. Genetic algorithms were applied to the Norwood Farm ecological network-a comprehensive dataset of antagonistic and mutualistic species interactions on an organic farm in the United Kingdom. We aimed to show how network analyses can be used to select plants supporting a high diversity of insect pollinators and parasitoids of insect pests, but low diversity of herbivores. Further to this, we wanted to understand the trade-offs in ecosystem service provision associated with conventional management practices that focus on individual ecosystem services. We show that multilayer network analyses can be used to identify mixes of plant species that maximise the species richness of pollinators and parasitoids (natural enemies of insect pests), while minimising the species richness of herbivores. Trade-offs between ecosystem processes were apparent with several plant species associated with a high species richness of both positive (pollinators and parasitoids) and negative (herbivores) functional taxonomic groups. As a result, optimal plant species mixes for individual ecosystem services were different from the mix simultaneously maximising pollination and parasitism of pest insects, while minimising herbivory. Synthesis and applications. Plant mixes designed solely for maximising pollinator species richness are not optimal for the provision of other ecosystem services and disservices (e.g. parasitism of insect pests and herbivory). The method presented here will allow for the design of management strategies that facilitate the provision of multiple ecosystem services. To this end, we provide a protocol for practitioners to develop their own plant mixes suitable for farm-scale management. This avenue of predictive network ecology has the potential to enhance agricultural management, supporting high levels of biodiversity and food production by manipulating ecological networks in specific ways.",About Sufficiency
Impact of Advanced Agriculture Technologies and Energy Consumption on Crop Yields in Modern Agriculture Using Deep Learning Techniques,"Growing concern over food security has drawn worldwide scholarly attention. Addressing food security issues highlights the vulnerability of agricultural yield to the complexity of agriculture inputs. Therefore, this study considers the intricacies of cultivation inputs and their effect on cereal production across 20 developing Asian countries from 1990 to 2022. First, advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to investigate the combined impact of the farming Product Complexity Index on agricultural yields. Second, the Granger causality test was used to uncover the causality direction between agricultural yield and exogenous variables. Both the causal inference neural network (CINN) and deep neural network (DNN) models show a rapid initial decrease in loss during the early epochs, followed by a more gradual decline, indicating effective learning and convergence. Notably, the CINN model consistently starts with a lower loss compared to the DNN model, suggesting superior performance in minimizing the training loss. These machine learning techniques have successfully predicted the synergistic relationships, leading to significant improvements in cereal yield forecasting. The Granger causality results revealed feedback causality between the agricultural Product Complexity Index and crop yields and the use of fertilizer and agricultural yields on different lags. These results emphasize the potential for targeted guidelines that harness the interactions between complexities in agriculture and the application of fertilizer to improve cereal yields.",About Sufficiency
Impact of Agricultural Activities on Climate Change: A Review of Greenhouse Gas Emission Patterns in Field Crop Systems,"This review paper synthesizes the current understanding of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from field cropping systems. It examines the key factors influencing GHG emissions, including crop type, management practices, and soil conditions. The review highlights the variability in GHG emissions across different cropping systems. Conventional tillage systems generally emit higher levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) than no-till or reduced tillage systems. Crop rotation, cover cropping, and residue management can significantly reduce GHG emissions by improving soil carbon sequestration and reducing nitrogen fertilizer requirements. The paper also discusses the challenges and opportunities for mitigating GHG emissions in field cropping systems. Precision agriculture techniques, such as variable rate application of fertilizers and water, can optimize crop production while minimizing environmental impacts. Agroforestry systems, which integrate trees and crops, offer the potential for carbon sequestration and reducing N2O emissions.

Impact of crop establishment methods on rice insect pests incidence in Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP),"Rice (Oryza saliva L.), is the staple food for more than half of the world population and an important target to secure food security and livelihoods for millions. The production of rice to mitigate the consumption requirement needs huge amount of water. Direct seeded rice (DSR) technique is becoming popular nowadays because of its low-input demands and potential to maximize the water productivity under deficit soil moisture. Rice variety, Pusa 1121 is important variety in major rice growing areas of Indo Gangetic Plain that occupies more than 70% area. The population of planthoppers and stem borers were significantly higher and appeared early in direct seeding crop as compared with transplanted rice (TPR).

Impact of farming systems on soil ecological quality: a meta-analysis,"The productivist model implemented after the second world war has succeeded in improving production to meet growing demands for food, but it has also deeply affected soil physicochemical properties, as well as of aboveground and belowground biodiversity. Alternative farming systems such as organic farming, biodynamic farming and soil conservation farming are actually developing to enhance the sustainability of farming systems. Although the impact of agricultural practices on soil ecological quality is well known, there is little knowledge on the impact of the different farming systems as a whole. Here, we analysed the impact of the main farming systems on soil biodiversity and functioning, reported in about 100 scientific publications. We found that conventional, organic, and biodynamic systems are the most widely studied, whereas soil conservation farming is poorly documented. Soil biological indicators are improved by ca. 70% in organic farming and biodynamic farming relative to conventional farming. 43% of soil bioindicators are improved in biodynamic farming relatively to organic farming. Soil conservation farming scores better than conventional farming for 57% of the indicators. Therefore, biodynamic farming displays the highest soil ecological quality, followed by organic farming, soil conservation farming and, last, conventional farming. Organic fertilisation and longer crop rotations are the most favourable practices, whereas pesticides and soil tillage are the most deleterious ones. The review also evidences a lack of studies on soil conservation farming and on bioindicators of the soil fauna.",About Sufficiency
Impact of Indonesia's Forest Management Units on the reduction of forest loss and forest fires in Sulawesi,"The establishment of Forest Management Units (Kesatuan Pengelolaan Hutan/ KPH) represents one of Indonesia's most significant forest governance reforms, covering the 120 million hectares of designated Forest Areas.

This paper assesses the impact of KPHs on the reduction of forest loss, including forest loss due to fire, and the factors that influence this impact (e.g. KPH's primary objective, deforestation risk). We use remotely sensed data to estimate difference-in-differences models accounting for differences in baseline characteristics and multiple time periods. Our case study, Sulawesi Island, is primarily shaped by smallholder farmer land use, where KPHs can exert significant influence. We do not find evidence of an overall effect of KPHs on deforestation. However, we observe intriguing heterogeneous effects depending on the year, including significantly less deforestation in already-established KPHs during the El Nino years of 2015-16, and a notable impact on the reduction of forest loss due to fire in some early-established KPHs.

Impact of Technological Innovation on Performance in Dairy Sheep Farms in Spain,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the causal relationship between technological innovation and sheep farm's results, based on a Structural Equation Modeling Approach (SEM) in dairy sheep systems in the center of Spain. Different from traditional multiple-trait models, SEM analysis allows assessment of potential causal interrelationships among outcomes and can effectively discriminate effects. Information from 157 dairy sheep farms in Castilla La Mancha was used. The questionnaires included 38 technological innovations and 188 questions on productive, economic and social data. Four hypotheses were formulated oriented to understand how the farm's technological innovation will affect the productive structure and farm's performance. The results derived from the SEM analysis showed a positive relationship between the technological indicator and the farm's structure, productivity, and economic results. The variable technological adoption could be regarded as a predictable measure of structure, productivity, and economic performance. Technology is associated with the productive structure. Independent of sheep farms' size, dairy sheep farms can be positioned in the growing returns area as a consequence of a proper use of it.

Impacts of biochar and slag on carbon sequestration potential and sustainability assessment of MgO-stabilized marine soils: insights from MIP analysis,"Mineral carbonation is a promising strategy for mitigating carbon emissions and combating climate change. This study investigates the efficacy and sustainability of MgO-based stabilization techniques for soft marine soils, incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) such as biochar and slag. A combination of laboratory experiments and rigorous analyses was utilized to elucidate the complex interplay between the additives and their impacts on soil hydraulic characteristics, carbon sequestration potential, embodied energy, and economic viability. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) was employed to characterize pore structure changes induced by carbonation, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to correlate mineral formations. The results indicate that MgO-biochar-treated soils exhibit enhanced soil air content, pore connectivity, and carbon sequestration efficiency compared to MgO-slag-treated soils, exhibiting reduced pore volumes and limited CO2 diffusion. Integrating biochar with MgO enhanced brucite and nesquehonite precipitation due to biochar's porous structure and functionalized surface area, facilitating gas diffusion and nucleation for mineral formation. Sustainability assessments highlight the environmental and economic trade-offs, positioning MgO-biochar and MgO-slag combinations as cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives.

Implementing the circular economy paradigm in the agri-food supply chain: The role of food waste prevention technologies,"Food systems are plagued by the grand sustainability challenge of food waste, which represents a urging issue from economic, environmental and social point of view. dThe Circular Economy paradigm can open up different actions which are framed within the so-called Food Waste Hierarchy (FWH). In these regards, scholars recommend to leverage on those practices that are able to prevent the generation of surplus food, preserving a higher share of the sustainable value. For these pre-harvest and post-harvest practices that go under the name of prevention or reuse strategies in different FWH, technology plays a crucial role. Through a set of 34 semi-structured interviews with technology providers as well as with companies in the agri-food supply chain, the present work investigates extensively the range of the available technologies and the detailed objectives of such technologies for food loss and waste prevention (i.e., fore-casting, monitoring, grouping, shelf life extension, product quality and value upgrading). Moreover, different forms of collaboration enable to reach these objectives in different ways. Collaboration with technology providers can be based on continuous technical assistance and consulting for data elaboration and data analysis as well as on full data sharing and co-design, allowing to achieve a different impact on food loss and waste prevention.

Implications of land-use change to Short Rotation Forestry in Great Britain for soil and biomass carbon,"Land-use change can have significant impacts on soil and aboveground carbon (C) stocks and there is a clear need to identify sustainable land uses which maximize C mitigation potential. Land-use transitions from agricultural to bioenergy crops are increasingly common in Europe with one option being Short Rotation Forestry (SRF). Research on the impact on C stocks of the establishment of SRF is limited, but given the potential for this bioenergy crop in temperate climates, there is an evident knowledge gap. Here, we examine changes in soil C stock following the establishment of SRF using combined short (30cm depth) and deep (1m depth) soil cores at 11 sites representing 29 transitions from agriculture to SRF. We compare the effects of tree species including 9 coniferous, 16 broadleaved and 4 Eucalyptus transitions. SRF aboveground and root biomass were also estimated in 15 of the transitions using tree mensuration data allowing assessments of changes in total ecosystem C stock. Planting coniferous SRF, compared to broadleaved and Eucalyptus SRF, resulted in greater accumulation of litter and overall increased soil C stock relative to agricultural controls. Though broadleaved SRF had no overall effect on soil C stock, it showed the most variable response suggesting species-specific effects and interactions with soil types. While Eucalyptus transitions induced a reduction in soil C stocks, this was not significant unless considered on a soil mass basis. Given the relatively young age and limited number of Eucalyptus plantations, it is not possible to say whether this reduction will persist in older stands. Combining estimates of C stocks from different ecosystem components (e.g., soil, aboveground biomass) reinforced the accumulation of C under coniferous SRF, and indicates generally positive effects of SRF on whole-ecosystem C.

Improving Life Cycle Economic and Environmental Sustainability of Animal Manure Management in Marginalized Farming Communities Through Resource Recovery,"A growing world population with increasing levels of food consumption will lead to more dairy and swine production and increasing amount of manure that requires treatment. Discharge of excessive nutrients and carbon in untreated animal manure can lead to greenhouse gas emissions and eutrophication concerns, and treatment efforts can be expensive for small scale farmers in marginalized communities. The overall goal of this study was to determine the environmental and economic sustainability of four animal manure management scenarios in Costa Rica: (1) no treatment, (2) biodigesters, (3) biodigesters and struvite precipitation, and (4) biodigesters, struvite precipitation, and lagoons. Life cycle assessment was used to assess the carbon footprint and eutrophication potential, whereas life cycle cost analysis was used to evaluate the equivalent uniform annual worth over the construction and operation and maintenance life stages. Recovery of biogas as a cooking fuel and recovery of nutrients from the struvite reactor reduced the carbon footprint, leading to carbon offsets of up to 2,500 kg CO2 eq/year. Offsets were primarily due to avoiding methane emissions during energy recovery. Eutrophication potential decreased as resource recovery processes were integrated, primarily due to improved removal of phosphorus in effluent waters. Resource recovery efforts led to equivalent uniform annual benefits of $825 to $1,056/year, which could provide a helpful revenue source for lower-income farmers. This research can provide clarity on how small-scale farmers in marginalized settings can utilize resource recovery technologies to better manage animal manure, while improving economic and environmental sustainability outcomes.",About Sufficiency

Increasing impact of warm droughts on northern ecosystem productivity over recent decades,"The authors show increased negative extremes in gross primary productivity in northern midlatitude ecosystems, particularly over grasslands and croplands, attributed to impacts of warm droughts. This highlights the vulnerability of terrestrial carbon sinks and food security to increasing extreme events. Climate extremes such as droughts and heatwaves have a large impact on terrestrial carbon uptake by reducing gross primary production (GPP). While the evidence for increasing frequency and intensity of climate extremes over the last decades is growing, potential systematic adverse shifts in GPP have not been assessed. Using observationally-constrained and process-based model data, we estimate that particularly northern midlatitude ecosystems experienced a +10.6% increase in negative GPP extremes in the period 2000-2016 compared to 1982-1998. We attribute this increase predominantly to a greater impact of warm droughts, in particular over northern temperate grasslands (+95.0% corresponding mean increase) and croplands (+84.0%), in and after the peak growing season. These results highlight the growing vulnerability of ecosystem productivity to warm droughts, implying increased adverse impacts of these climate extremes on terrestrial carbon sinks as well as a rising pressure on global food security.",About Sufficiency

Functional grouping of herbaceous plants (discriminating between ""high conservation value"" plant species and ""competitive""/""ruderal"" species) and low mobility butterflies were used as indicators of conservation value, especially focusing on the few sites left with considerable remnant conservation value. The dialog processes revealed that the organic farmers' ideas and goals of conservation of wildlife quality were not necessarily the same as for biologists; the farmers expressed very different opinions on the biological rooted idea, that wildlife quality is related to the absence of agricultural impact. However, farmers also stated that the information given by the indicators and especially the dialogue with the biologist had influenced their perception and awareness of wildlife. We conclude that, combined with a dialogue process, using these indicators when mapping wildlife quality could be an important key component of a farm wildlife management advisory tool at farm level.",About Sufficiency
"Influence of Bio-Fertilizer Type and Amount Jointly on Microbial Community Composition, Crop Production and Soil Health","To ensure long-term food production in a changing world, it is critical to identify field management practices that increase crop yields and maintain soil health. Additionally, sustainable agriculture needs to provide experimental evidence to support the use of traditional agricultural practices. In this study, a 20-year investigation of the effects of different combinations of fertilizer types (control, chemical fertilizer, organic fertilizer, and bio-fertilizer) and fertilization amount (conventional dosages and high dosages) on wheat yield and soil health, including soil enzyme activity and microbial biomass, soil microbial diversity, and crop yield. Our long-term study indicates that the use of high dosages of bio-fertilizer can increase the fertilizer yield contribution rate by a minimum of 76.7% compared to other management combinations. Furthermore, this practice can improve soil biological quality, including the concentration of soil microbial biomass carbon, promote bacterial biodiversity, and enhance the soil health index. The effect of high dosages fertilizer was greater than that of conventional dosages fertilizer. The highest soil health index was 0.88 in high dosage bio-fertilizer, and the lowest was 0.12 in chemical fertilizer. In summary, these results suggested that the use of bio-fertilizer can help maintain soil health and crop productivity in the long term.",About Sufficiency
Innovative processes in smart packaging. A systematic review,"Smart packaging provides one possible solution that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In comparison with traditional packaging, which aims to extend the product's useful life and to facilitate transport and marketing, smart packaging allows increased efficiency, for example by ensuring authenticity and traceability from the product's origin, preventing fraud and theft, and improving security. Consequently, it may help to reduce pollution, food losses, and waste associated with the food supply chain. However, some questions must be answered to fully understand the advantages and limitations of its use. What are the most suitable smart packaging technologies for use in agro-industrial subsectors such as meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables, bakery, and pastry? What are the opportunities from a perspective of life extension, process optimization, traceability, product quality, and safety? What are the future challenges? An up-to-date, systematic review was conducted of literature relevant to the application of indicator technologies, sensors, and data carriers in smart packaging, to answer these questions.

Insights into soil and biochar variations and their contribution to soil aggregate status - A meta-analysis,"As a dynamic process in the soil, soil aggregation has a direct impact on several vital functions, including microbial activity, greenhouse gas emissions, water storage, and nutrient availability. Biochar as a recalcitrant soil amendment could potentially regulate soil functions, especially aggregation. However, there have been conflicting studies regarding the effectiveness of biochar, its variations, and how it interacts with various soil conditions to affect aggregate status. In this regard a thorough meta-analysis was conducted, considering six categories of significant variables: soil texture, soil organic carbon (SOC), application rate, pyrolysis temperature, feedstock type, and various biochar use methodologies as well as various soil aggregation indices as impacted factors. Based on the results, wood-based biochar showed the highest efficiency above straw and manure-based biochar with a positive effect size of 15.4 % and 17.7 % for mean weight diameter (MWD) and macro-aggregate. The highest geometric mean diameter (GMD) was obtained from biochars pyrolyzed at 550< degrees C with 19.9 % effect size. Also, low pyrolysis temperature (<450 degrees C) resulted in the maximum formation of micro-aggregates with a positive effect size of 14.9 %. The moderate application of biochar (10-20 t ha- 1) resulted in the lowest micro-aggregates (-8.9 %) and the highest macro-aggregates (24.2 %). The single application of biochar resulted in a positive effect size in the case of macro-aggregate (17.2 %) significantly higher than the combined application of biochar with fertilizer (8.1 %). The highest MWD (12.8 %) and GMD (7.1 %) were obtained from biochar-treated soils with loamy texture. Also, the high availability of SOC (2<%) caused the highest macro-aggregate formation with a positive effect size of 28.2 %. Expanding our knowledge of biochar capability and soil functions could change soil aggregation scenarios, as the variety of biochar pyrolysis processes and its application strategies could directly modify soil's dynamic structure, through inducing functional groups, carbon linkage, and soil particle rearrangement.",About Sufficiency
Integrated Farming System: Key to sustainability in arid and semi-arid regions,"Ensuring higher productivity and profitability, gainful employment and adequate supply of food, feed, fodder and fiber for a growing human and livestock population, along with maintaining environmental sustainability are major challenges in agricultural production systems of arid and semi-arid regions. Integrated farming systems (IFS) comprising of many agri-innovations have the potential to meet such requirements. An association of individual and interdependent components of farming on a given piece of land, taking cognizance of available natural resources and the differential requirement of a wide range of farming community, remains the guiding principle of IFS. Research conducted across arid and semi-arid regions is reviewed here in order to understand the role of IFS in enhancing production, income and livelihood; minimizing risk associated with farming in arid and drier semi-arid regions; utilizing and conserving the resources; and in enhancing mitigation and adaptation to climate change. It has been conclusively established that IFS involving integration of different enterprises (crop, livestock, horticulture, forestry, poultry and fish) enhanced productivity, profitability, resource use efficiency, generated more employment and minimized resources degradation and risks. IFS, therefore, could be a key form of farming intensification needed for achieving future food security and environmental sustainability in arid and semi-arid regions. Promoting adoption of the location-specific IFS in future is linked directly with coherent policy, institutional commitment, infrastructure development, better coordination among different agricultural and rural development programme and agencies, and a stimulus package of incentives. The relevance of IFS in adaptation to and mitigation of climate change is also discussed.",About Sufficiency
Integrated modeling as a decision-aiding tool for groundwater management in a Mediterranean agricultural watershed,"A decision-aiding methodology for agricultural groundwater management is presented; it is based on the combination of a watershed model, a groundwater flow model, and an optimization model. This methodology was applied to an agricultural watershed in northeastern Greece. The watershed model used was the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which provided recharge rates for the aquifers. These recharge rates were imported in the well-known MODFLOW groundwater flow model. Both models were calibrated and verified using field data. Then, the nonlinear optimization problem was solved by a piecewise linearization process, in which the Simplex algorithm was applied sequentially. Apart from several pumping and climate change sensitivity scenarios, a land use change scenario and a climate change scenario, combining the three models, were tested, showing the ability of this methodology to be used in the decision-making process.

Integrated pest management portfolios in UK arable farming: results of a farmer survey,"BACKGROUND: Farmers are faced with a wide range of pest management (PM) options that can be adopted in isolation or alongside complementary or substitute strategies. This paper presents the results of a survey of UK cereal producers, focusing on the character and diversity of PM strategies currently used by, or available to, farmers. In addition, the survey asked various questions pertaining to agricultural policy participation, attitude towards environmental issues, sources of PM advice and information and the important characteristics of PM technologies. RESULTS: The results indicate that many farmers do make use of a suite of PM techniques, and that their choice of integrated PM (IPM) portfolio appears to be jointly dictated by farm characteristics and government policy. Results also indicate that portfolio choice does affect the number of subsequent insecticide applications per crop. CONCLUSIONS: These results help to identify the type of IPM portfolios considered to be adoptable by farmers and highlight the importance of substitution in IPM portfolios. As such, these results will help to direct R&D effort towards the realisation of more sustainable PM approaches and aid the identification of potential portfolio adopters. These findings highlight the opportunity that a revised agri-environmental policy design could generate in terms of enhancing coherent IPM portfolio adoption.

Intensification of coffee systems can increase the effectiveness of REDD mechanisms,"In agricultural production systems with shade trees, such as coffee, the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production intensification can be compensated for, or even outweighed, by the increase in carbon sequestration into above-ground and below-ground tree biomass. We use data from a long-term coffee agroforestry experiment in Costa Rica to evaluate the trade-offs between intensification, profitability and net greenhouse gas emissions through two scenarios. First, by assessing the GHG emissions associated with conversion from shaded to more profitable full-sun (un-shaded) systems, we calculate the break-even carbon price which would need to be paid to offset the opportunity cost of not converting. The price per tCO(2)e of emissions reduction required to compensate for the coffee production revenue foregone varies widely from 9.3 to 196.3 US$ amongst different shaded systems. Second, as an alternative to intensification, production area can be extended onto currently forested land. We estimate this land-use change required to compensate for the shortfall in profitability from retaining lower intensity coffee production systems. For four of the five shade types tested, this land-use change causes additional GHG emissions >5 tCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) resulting in net emissions >8 tCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) for the whole system. We conclude that instead, by intensifying production, mechanisms similar to REDD that are based on reducing emissions through avoided land-use change (REAL) could play a major role in increasing the climate change mitigation success of agroforestry systems at the same time as aiding REDD through reducing pressure for further forest conversion to agriculture.

International Plant Pathology: Past and Future Contributions to Global Food Security,"The challenge of feeding the current and future world population is widely recognized, and the management of plant diseases has an important role in overcoming this. This paper explores the ways in which international plant pathology has contributed and continues to support efforts to secure adequate, safe and culturally appropriate nourishment and livelihoods for present and future generations. For the purposes of this paper, ""international plant pathology"" refers to the work that plant pathologists do when they work across international borders, with a focus on enhancing food security in tropical regions. Significant efforts involve public and philanthropic resources from the global North for addressing plant disease concerns in the global South, where food security is a legitimate and pressing concern. International disease management efforts are also aimed at protecting domestic food security, for example when pathogens of major staples migrate across national borders. In addition, some important crops are largely produced in tropical countries and consumed globally, including in industrialized countries; the diseases of these crops are of international interest, and they are largely managed by the private sector. Finally, host-microbe interactions are fascinating biological systems, and basic research on plant diseases of international relevance has often yielded insights and technologies with both scientific and practical implications.",About Sufficiency
"Interplay between yield, nitrogen application, and logistics on the potential energetic and greenhouse gas emissions from biomass crops","The interplay between nitrogen fertilization (N), yield, nitrous oxide emissions (N2O), and diesel fuel utilization associated with harvest and transport logistics of biomass crops remains poorly understood. In this research, we show that intensification (in terms of N) of bioenergy cropping to maximize yield supports not only minimized land use but also maximized logistics efficiency in terms of diesel use. This paradigm was examined within the scope of the billion-ton biofuels vision and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 using potential yields on marginal and prime agricultural land. Sixteen scenarios were investigated that considered the primary factors with agriculture bioenergy; biomass yield (11.2 and 22.4 Mgha(-1)yr(-1)), two nitrogen fertilizer application rates (50 and 100kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)), two Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE) factors for synthetic nitrogen to nitrous oxide (1.5 and 5%), and three harvest/transportation efficiencies (50, 65, and 80%). These scenarios resulted in energy consumption between 747 and 1351 MJ Mg-1 and GHGE between 72 and 311 kg CO2 eq Mg-1. GHGE emissions are strongly related to the emission of nitrous oxide from soils due to nitrogen fertilization and could represent over 80% of the GHGE relative to biomass harvest logistics. These data imply that synthetic N supplementation to maximize yield could reduce the burden due to diesel fuel for harvest, but would rapidly become the most significant contributor to GHGE. Minimizing the impact of N fertilization will be critical for reducing the GHGE associated with biomass production.",About Sufficiency
Interrogating food security and infectious animal and plant diseases: a critical introduction,"As part of a themed section, this introductory paper provides critical insights into important social science debates associated with food security and animal/plant diseases. Continued volatility in the price of basic foodstuffs on international commodity markets has ensured that food security will be one of the 'master frames' of early twentieth century public policy. While increasing food production through 'sustainable intensification' characterises the essentially scientific solution to food (in)security issues, other 'framings' of food security are also important. These include providing access to affordable and good quality food, reducing food waste and encouraging more urban-based agriculture. Animal/plant diseases are a considerable threat to food security because of growing trade, travel, transport and tourism. A range of national/international and scientific control measures help to reduce the risk of disease spread, but micro-scale studies are needed to help understand the practicalities of applying biosecurity controls at local geographical scales.",About Sufficiency
Investigating Key Factors Influencing Farming Decisions Based on Soil Testing and Fertilizer Recommendation Facilities (STFRF)A Case Study on Rural Bangladesh,"Proper nourishment is fundamental for satisfactory crop growth and production. However, for efficient crop production, it is important to understand the soil environment, to recognize the limitations of that environment, and to ameliorate them where possible without damaging the soil quality. Soil testing and fertilizer recommendation facilities (STFRF) can help farmers to achieve environmental and economic sustainability by assisting them in recognizing their soil condition, reducing agrochemicals usage, using an appropriate amount of fertilizer, minimizing input costs, and achieving higher yield. These facilities are not new in the context of Bangladesh, yet the adoption rate among farmers is low and its determinants have rarely been empirically tested based on microlevel data. Therefore, this study examined those factors underlying the adoption of soil testing and fertilizer recommendation facilities using field surveyed data of 176 individual farmers. Our evidence shows that young farmers with less farming experience are more likely to adopt these facilities. Additionally, being small-scale farmers, having higher education, having more farming income, and having more knowledge about these facilities and the fees of these facilities were found to have a significant effect on the adoption. On the other hand, gender, land ownership, and secondary income were found to be insignificant with regard to the adoption of soil testing and fertilizer recommendation facilities. Our results also revealed that most adopter farmers not only focused on profitability, but were additionally concerned with environmental well-being.",About Sufficiency
Investigating logistics-related food loss drivers: A study on fresh fruit and vegetable supply chain,"Food loss is one of the significant threats to sustainable development. Although various studies investigating food loss drivers disclosed that logistics is a significant reason for food loss, logistics-related food loss drivers have not been thoroughly studied. Thus, this paper aims to identify, classify and rank the logistics-related food loss drivers, having more influence on the amount of food loss in the fruit and vegetable supply chain, with the help of a mixed-method approach. First, a literature review was conducted to identify potential logistics-related food loss drivers. A total of 49 articles were analyzed. Second, 21 semi-structured interviews were conducted with industry experts to finalize the drivers. Third, the analytical hierarchy process was employed to rank the drivers having more influence on the amount of food loss. Five main drivers and nineteen sub-drivers were identified at the end of the literature review and interview process. Categorization of main drivers is based on the logistics activities. According to results, warehousing-related drivers and transportation-related drivers are the two most influential drivers on the amount of food loss, while lack of coordination and improper packaging material are the two most influential sub-drivers. Following the ranking of drivers and sub-drivers, mitigation strategies to diminish food loss are also discussed. The findings of this study are intended to guide fruit and vegetable supply chain actors in tackling food loss.",About Sufficiency
Is conservation tillage suitable for organic farming?: A review,"Conservation tillage covers a range of tillage practices, mostly non-inversion, which aim to conserve soil moisture and reduce soil erosion by leaving more than one-third of the soil surface covered by crop residues. Organic farmers are encouraged to adopt conservation tillage to preserve soil quality and fertility and to prevent soil degradation - mainly erosion and compaction. The potential advantages of conservation tillage in organic farming are reduced erosion, greater macroporosity in the soil surface due to larger number of earthworms, more microbial activity and carbon storage, less run-off and leaching of nutrients, reduced fuel use and faster tillage. The disadvantages of conservation tillage in organic farming are greater pressure from grass weeds, less suitable than ploughing for poorly drained, unstable soils or high rainfall areas, restricted N availability and restricted crop choice. The success of conservation tillage in organic farming hinges on the choice of crop rotation to ensure weed and disease control and nitrogen availability. Rotation of tillage depth according to crop type, in conjunction with compaction control measures is also required. A high standard of management is required, tailored to local soil and site conditions. Innovative approaches for the application of conservation tillage, such as perennial mulches, mechanical control of cover crops, rotational tillage and controlled traffic, require further practical assessment.",About Sufficiency
"Is nitrogen fixation (once again) ""vital to the progress of civilized humanity""?","The world food supply has become dependent on synthetic fertilizer from ammonia, which comes from the Haber-Bosch process. This process consumes large amounts of fossil fuels and releases large amounts of greenhouse gases. The excessive use of synthetic fixed nitrogen fertilizers has led to severe environmental effects, but fixed nitrogen is essential to the sustainability of biofuels. Nitrogen fertilizers are also required for biotic carbon capture schemes like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation, and soil carbon sequestration. Ammonia has been proposed as a non-carbon emitting alternative fuel that has many advantages over hydrogen. Organic agriculture and nitrogen recovery from waste streams may only partially reduce the demand for synthetic fixed nitrogen. Social solutions like population stabilization may be the best solution for the food supply problem, but ammonia is an enabling technology for alternative fuels and carbon sequestration. Alternative processes for nitrogen fixation are very early in development. This paper offers the viewpoint that alternative means of nitrogen fixation and the wise use of fixed nitrogen need to be developed quickly.",About Sufficiency

Evaluating the influence of information and communications technology on food security,"Background: This study integrates the diffusion of innovation, technology acceptance model and Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory to assess the role that information and communications technology (ICT) plays in ensuring food security. A survey of smallholder farmers from the iLembe district municipality of the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa was conducted, and the data were used to test the proposed model. Objectives: The study evaluates the influence of ICTs in improving food security in KwaZulu-Natal Province. A theoretical framework was developed as the lens through which diffusion and adoption of ICTs can be understood. The theorised model was developed using constructs from the diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory, technology acceptance model (TAM) and Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory. Method: Survey data from 517 smallholder farmers from the district municipality of iLembe were collected using a questionnaire. A quantitative approach was followed, and the developed theorised model was analysed using structural equation modelling techniques. Results: This study proposes that ICT influence on food security is associated with culture, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. The study further finds that perceived ease of use of ICTs has the most significant effect with regard to ICT adoption and diffusion amongst smallholder farmers in iLembe district municipality. There are, however, no associations found with perceived attributes of innovation and the nature of social systems. The study consisted of a largely homogeneous social system; therefore, the researcher could not make any comparisons. Conclusion: The proposed framework for evaluating the influence of ICTs on food security put forward in this study highlights a number of issues. Firstly, there is need for further study to be conducted to understand adoption of ICTs specifically for food security. This would help in creating more accurate adoption strategies. Secondly, the study informs ICT innovation developers on the need to prioritise ease of use of ICT-based interventions when developing innovations that focus on smallholder farmers.

"Quantitative Analysis of Hydrological Responses to Climate Variability and Land-Use Change in the Hilly-Gully Region of the Loess Plateau, China","Climate and land-use change are the two main driving forces that affect watershed hydrological processes. Separately assessing their impacts on hydrology is important for land-use planning and water resource management. In this research, the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and statistical methods were applied to evaluate the effects of climate and land-use change on surface hydrology in the hilly-gully region of the Loess Plateau. The results showed that surface runoff and soil water presented a downward tendency, while evapotranspiration (ET) presented an upward tendency in the Yanhe watershed from 1982 to 2012. Climate is one the dominant factors that influence surface runoff, especially in flooding periods. The average contribution rate of surface runoff on stream flow accounted for 55%, of which the flooding period accounted for 40%. The runoff coefficient declined by 0.21 after 2002 with the land-use change of cropland transformed to grassland and forestland. The soil water exhibited great fluctuation along the Yanhe watershed. In the upstream region, the land-use was the driving force to decline soil water, which reduced the soil water by 51%. Along the spatial distribution, it converted from land-use change to climate variability from northwest to southeast. The ET was more sensitive to land-use change than climate variability in all sub-basins, and increased by 209% with vegetation restoration. To prevent the ecosystem degradation and maintain the inherent ecological functions of rivers, quantitative assessment the influence of climate variability and land-use change on hydrology is of great importance. Such evaluations can provide insight into the extent of land use/cover change on regional water balance and develop appropriate watershed management strategies on the Loess Plateau.",About Sufficiency
Restoring wetlands on intensive agricultural lands modifies nitrogen cycling microbial communities and reduces N2O production potential,"The concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O), an ozone-depleting greenhouse gas, is rapidly increasing in the atmosphere. Most atmospheric N2O originates in terrestrial ecosystems, of which the majority can be attributed to microbial cycling of nitrogen in agricultural soils. Here, we demonstrate how the abundance of nitrogen cycling genes vary across intensively managed agricultural fields and adjacent restored wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA. We found that the abundances of nirS and nirK genes were highest at the intensively managed organic-rich cornfield and significantly outnumber any other gene abundances, suggesting very high N2O production potential. The quantity of nitrogen transforming genes, particularly those responsible for denitrification, nitrification and DNRA, were highest in the agricultural sites, whereas nitrogen fixation and ANAMMOX was strongly associated with the wetland sites. Although the abundance of nosZ genes was also high at the agricultural sites, the ratio of nosZ genes to nir genes was significantly higher in wetland sites indicating that these sites could act as a sink of N2O. These findings suggest that wetland restoration could be a promising natural climate solution not only for carbon sequestration but also for reduced N2O emissions.",About Sufficiency
"Understory plant species and functional diversity in the degraded wet tropical forests of Kolombangara Island, Solomon Islands","Anthropogenic activities have resulted in extensive deforestation and forest degradation on many tropical oceanic islands. For instance, some islands in the Solomon archipelago have as little as 10% of primary forests remaining with few of these remnants protected from future land use change. We examine the plant species and functional diversity (excluding adult canopy trees) of 48 sites from four forest land use types (two types of primary forest, secondary forest and abandoned tree plantations) and two common human-maintained land use types (coconut plantations and grazed pastures) across three elevation bands on Kolombangara Island, Solomon Islands. In total, we surveyed 384 species from 86 families of which only 6.5% were non-native. Species richness was lowest in coconut plantations and grazed pastures and declined with increasing elevation across all land use types. Functional diversity was similar between primary and secondary forest (high richness, high evenness and unaltered dispersion) and lowest in coconut plantations and grazed pastures. Our results suggest that species and functional richness have had divergent responses to land use change in forest land uses indicative of a loss of functional redundancy. Despite structural and compositional similarities among primary forests and degraded forest land uses, full recovery of secondary and commercial plantations has not been achieved. We suggest that conservation of Kolombangara's forest understory flora will require reserves across the island's elevation gradient and may require active restoration in the future, particularly if degrading activities continue at the current rate.

Redox-mediated electrochemical desalination for waste valorization in dairy production,"With the rapidly growing global population, achieving sustainable food production is a key challenge to mitigate the closely coupled environmental and nutrition crises. As demand for dairy products increases, large volumes of whey are produced - a highly polluting byproduct from food manufacturing, with strict disposal regulations. However, whey has been recognized as an attractive nutrient source; and as such, sustainable separation technologies for demineralizing the highly concentrated salts in whey waste can provide a pathway for the valorization of whey proteins from food processing waste. Herein, we propose a sustainable and energy-efficient strategy to valorize whey waste via a redox-mediated electrodialysis system. As a net-zero waste process, our system leverages reversible redox reaction for continuous desalination and salt concentration for reuse, as well as the simultaneous recovery of highly purified protein contents. The system demonstrates up to 99% salt removal with > 98% of whey proteins retained at various operating parameters: voltages, pHs, and salt concentrations. Remarkably, the performance of protein purification and salt recovery was maintained over multiple cycles, demonstrating outstanding stability and cyclability. Furthermore, a techno-economic analysis confirms the economic potential of our system with 51-73% lower energy consumptions and 51-62% lower operating expenditure than conventional desalination systems. Overall, our redox-electrochemical process offers a sustainable and electrified platform for the recovery of valuable proteins from dairy production waste, with envisioned integration with renewable electricity in the future.",About Sufficiency
Nutritional usability of thermal treated white and brown bread in broiler feed,"Growing consumer demand for safe and affordable food as well as the need for a sustainable food supply will force the producers to explore methods for production output increasing. The poultry industry has an important role in the provision of a sustainable food supply, especially because chickens have a high feed conversion efficiency compared to other birds or livestock and, chicken meat is a low greenhouse gas emission food compared to other sources of dietary protein and has accessible source of protein with a low-fat content. The most important aspect of broiler production is feeding, and it represents about 70% of total costs. In order to facilitate the broilers, feed mixture production, it is tending to replace corn component, with a new, cheaper but high-quality component. As an alternative, it is possible to use the old bread, which would enable its remediation. Its use in broiler feeding is possible only after thermal treatment. Following this work will include the possibilities of using 5 and 10% of the old white and brown bread share in broilers feed mixture after thermal processing by extrusion. Feeding with both types of old extruded bread proved to be satisfying and did not affect broilers performance so generally dried bread can be used in chicken feed by as a partial replacement for maize component. Although both breads have proved good feeding quality, slightly better results were obtained in feeding with 10% share of brown bread.",About Sufficiency
Dealing with uncertainty in famine predictions: How complex events affect food security early warning skill in the Greater Horn of Africa,"Early warning systems are essential tool for humanitarian preparedness and response. The diversity of inputs required, ranging from agricultural production estimates to market price variability and weather forecasts, means that interpreting food security signals is not an easy task. Each of these inputs is fraught with uncertainty which analysts need to assess when making projections about future food security. Understanding the accuracy rates of early warning systems is therefore of paramount importance to enable improvements to food security prediction. However, to date, limited analyses of early warning accuracy have been conducted. Here we analyze Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) early warning data for the Greater Horn of Africa and show that, despite accuracy in projections, there remain important challenges for food security projections. The two major sources of uncertainty are associated with complex weather phenomena and conflict - with uncertainty in weather forecasts being twice as important as conflict in overall FEWS NET accuracy. Indeed, the least accurate projections are recorded in seasons with particularly complex weather events such as the 2015/2016 El Nino Southern Oscillation as well as in zones that are affected by internal conflict (e.g. South Sudan). With respect to predicting crisis transitions, areas with more frequent transitions tend to be more accurate, possibly because predicting the drivers behind these transitions are better understood. Our novel analysis provides a framework to invest resources in specific aspects of early warning. We also hope that by measuring the reliability of these systems, we can increase the confidence of decision makers to act early to mitigate the growing risks posed by hunger and famine.",About Sufficiency
A critical review on biochar for enhancing biogas production from anaerobic digestion of food waste and sludge,"The conversion of food waste and sludge into biogas via anaerobic digestion technology is gaining attention in recent years, which plays a significant role in waste valorization into bioenergy and promotes environmental sustainability. Biochar is a carbonaceous material produced via thermochemical conversion of biomass waste, and tailoring biochar for diverse environmental applications adheres to the principle of circular economy. The emerging application of biochar as an additive in the anaerobic digestion of food waste and sludge has been intensively investigated in the last few years. However, a comprehensive understanding of multifunctional roles of biochar and its mechanisms in the production of biogas via miscellaneous/complex anaerobic digestion process is yet to be attained. This review scrutinizes the key roles of biochar as an additive and emphasizes the influences of biochar characteristics on the anaerobic digestion processes and their capability to address the foremost challenges. This review also evaluates the techno-economic and environmental impacts of biochar synthesis and its emerging application for biogas production via anaerobic digestion to make the integrated process more economical and environmentally sustainable, and identifies challenges and prospects for future studies.

Diversified cropping systems for reducing soil erosion and nutrient loss and for increasing crop productivity and profitability in rainfed environments,"CONTEXT: Globally, rainfed regions encounter several constraints that limit crop production. Poor and degraded soils resulting from soil erosion are one among them. We hypothesized that a diversified cropping system in rainfed drylands can reduce soil erosion and improve soil health and crop productivity and meet the food security needs of rainfed farmers. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess potential diversified cropping systems in terms of reducing soil erosion and water and nutrient losses, and increasing crop and systems productivity and profitability. METHODS: The study was carried out at the Gungal Research Farm of ICAR Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (17 o 05 ' N, 78 o 39 ' E) from 2015 to 16 to 2020 - 21. The study investigated seven diversified cropping systems (treatments): sorghum + pigeon pea- hedge lucerne, sorghum + pigeonpea- guinea grass, castor- hedge lucerne, castor- guinea grass, sorghum- fodder clusterbean- fodder cowpea- fodder horsegram, sole sorghum, and sole pigeonpea. Multi -criteria assessments were conducted to understand trade-offs related to soil nutrients and their losses, and productivity and profitability of various annual and perennial based systems. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Among the various systems evaluated, sole sorghum was the most sensitive to soil erosion, leading to highest amount of nutrient loss in all years (87.5, 47.3, and 9.8 kg N, P and K ha - 1 in 2019-20, 102.4, 58.2, 14.2 kg N, P and K ha -1 in 2020-21, and 78.6, 39.2, 6.16 kg N, P and K ha -1 in 2021-22). The perennial based cropping systems with more diverse crops and greater land cover that included sorghum + pigeonpea - guinea grass and sorghum + pigeon pea - hedge lucerne had the lowest amount of nutrient loss. The least cumulative monetary value of nutrient loss was in sorghum + pigeon pea - hedge lucerne (137.11 US$) followed by sorghum + pigeonpea - guinea grass (145.33 US$). The systems with diverse crops reduced runoff and soil erosion, improved soil health, and increased crop and systems productivity and profitability. The tradeoffs analysis using the radar graphs also showed lower soil loss and improved soil heath in diversified perennial based cropping systems, resulting in increase in net income to US$1981 for sorghum + pigeonpea - hedge lucerne compared to US$909 for sole sorghum. SIGNIFICANCE: Perennial based cropping systems with diverse crops can be an effective strategy to reduce soil erosion and improve soil health, and increase crop and systems productivity in rainfed areas of south India. These results have implications to other countries globally with rainfed climate and dryland farming.",About Sufficiency
Alternate wetting and drying in high yielding direct-seeded rice systems accomplishes multiple environmental and agronomic objectives,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation is critically important for global food security, yet it also represents a significant fraction of agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water resource use. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) of rice fields has been shown to reduce both methane (CH4) emissions and water use, but its effect on grain yield is variable. In this three-year study we measured CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, rice grain total arsenic (As) concentrations, yield response to N rate, and grain yield from two AWD treatments (drill-seeded and water-seeded) and a conventionally managed water seeded treatment (control). Grain yields (average= 10 Mg ha(-1)) were similar or higher in the AWD treatments compared to the control and required similar or lower N rates to achieve these yields. Furthermore, AWD reduced growing season CH4 emissions by 60-87% while maintaining low annual N2O emissions (average = 0.38 kg N2O-N ha(-1)); N2O emissions accounted for <15% of the annual global warming potential (GWP) in all treatments. Fallow season emissions did not vary by treatment and accounted for 22-53% of annual CH4 emissions and approximately one third of annual GWP on average. The AWD treatments reduced annual GWP by 57-74% and growing season yield-scaled GWP by 59-88%. Milled grain total As, which averaged 0.114 mg kg(-1) in the control, was reduced by 59-65% in the AWD treatments. These results show that AWD has the potential to mitigate GHG emissions associated with rice cultivation and reduce rice grain total As concentrations without sacrificing grain yield or requiring higher N inputs; however future research needs to focus on adapting AWD to field scales if adoption of thiS technology is to be realized.

Food Security and Land Use under Sustainable Development Goals: Insights from Food Supply to Demand Side and Limited Arable Land in China,"The conflict between economic growth and the arable land demand poses a significant challenge to maintaining food security and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Meanwhile, substantial regional disparities in food consumption contribute to variations in land demand, further exacerbating constraints on food security. However, few studies have delved into regional differences in land demand related to food consumption. To bridge these gaps, this study estimated the arable land demand and associated pressures, considering food consumption patterns and the land footprint across 31 provincial districts in China. The findings reveal that grains remain the primary crop consumed by Chinese residents. Notably, the food consumption pattern exhibits substantial disparities among provincial districts, particularly concerning livestock products. Given China's vast population and escalating consumption of livestock, the country demonstrates heightened land demands. While China does not face a national-level food security threat, regional disparities are evident, with eight provincial districts facing potential food security risks. This study explored the challenges and pathways in maintaining food security and the visions to achieve it, emphasizing the importance of sustaining a balanced food consumption pattern, reducing food waste, improving environmentally friendly agriculture practices, formulating effective and continuous laws and regulations, and exploring potential land resource development to alleviate the pressure on arable land and ensure food security.",About Sufficiency

Land Use Dynamics and Land Cover Structure Change in Thailand (As Exemplified by Mountainous Nan Province,"Changes in the land use pattern and in the land cover structure for the time interval 1995-2012 in Thailand are considered by using, as an example, Nan Province located in the northern mountainous part of the country. Interpretation of satellite images and vector data that were provided by the Land Development Department (Thailand) revealed the main directions of change in the region's land use: deforestation, expansion of areas under crops, transition from slash and burn cultivation to permanent cultivation, and intensive utilization of agrochemicals. In spite of a decrease in the deforestation rate across Thailand in general, it is shown that for the period under review the proportion of natural forests in Nan Province decreased by nearly one half. On the other hand, the agricultural lands increased for the same period by more than 50%. The highest deforestation rates were recorded during 2009-2012. It was found that the changes in the land use pattern disturbed the existing centuries-old balance of man-natural environment interaction within the framework of the traditional system of slash and burn agriculture which is well adapted to local conditions. The study revealed the chief causes for such changes: an ineffective monitoring of forests; an unclear character of the boundaries separating lands of rural communities and protected territories, and possibilities for sales of commercial products (maize, cassava, etc.) cultivated in illegal fields. It is shown that rapid changes in land cover due to deforestation and plowing of mountainous areas for cultivation of commercial crops led to an intensification of slope processes (landslides and solifluction), an increase in overland runoff, and to an enhanced hazard of heavy floods during the monsoon season. To keep track of deforestation and deal with nature management conflicts requires a continuous monitoring of the land cover dynamics.",About Sufficiency
Effects of land use type and incubation temperature on greenhouse gas emissions from Chinese and Canadian soils,"Purpose Land use type is an important factor influencing greenhouse gas emissions from soils, but the mechanisms involved in affecting potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in different land use systems are poorly understood. Since the northern regions of Canada and China are characterized by cool growing seasons, GHG emissions under low temperatures are important for our understanding of how soil temperature affects soil C and N turnover processes and associated greenhouse gas emissions in cool temperate regions. Therefore, we investigated the effects of temperature on the emission of N2O, CO2, and CH4 from typical forest and grassland soils from China and Canada. Materials and methods The soils were incubated in the laboratory at 10 degrees C and 15 degrees C under aerobic conditions for 15 days. Results and discussion The results showed that land use type had a large impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The N2O emissions were significantly higher in grassland than in forest soils, while CO2 emissions were higher in forest than in grassland soils. Grassland soils were weak sources of CH4 emission, while forest soils were weak sinks of atmospheric CH4. The global warming potential of forest soils was significantly greater than that of grassland soils. Soil pH, C/N ratio, and soluble organic carbon concentrations and clay content were dominant factors influencing the emissions of N2O and CO2, respectively. Increasing temperature from 10 degrees C to 15 degrees C had no effects on CH4 flux, but significantly increased N2O emissions for all studied soils. The same pronounced effect was also found for CO2 emission from forest soils. Conclusions Indications from this study are that the effects of land use type on the source-sink relationship and rates of GHG emissions should be taken into consideration when planning management strategies for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in the studied region, and temperature changes must be taken into account when scaling up point-or plot-based N2O and CO2 flux data to the landscape level due to large spatial and temporal variations of temperature that exist in the field. The reader is cautioned about the limitation with incubation studies on a limited number of samples/locations, and care need to be exercised to extrapolate the result to field conditions.",About Sufficiency
"Climate Change and Forest Ecosystems in the Philippines: Vulnerability, Adaptation and Mitigation","Climate change and Philippine forests are directly linked to each other. Changes in climate are affecting the forests and its ability to deliver its environmental services. In the same manner, degradation of the forest resources results to emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere which contributes to climate change. To enhance the mitigation role of the forests and at the same time increase their resilience to climate change, policies and programs must be put in place. Such policies and programs must however be science-based This paper reviewed one decade of research on climate change and forest ecosystems in the Philippines. Limited research suggests that dry forest types are the most vulnerable to climate change. Potential adaptation strategies do exist but have not yet been adequately studied Most of the past research has focused on the mitigation potential of terrestrial ecosystems. Significant amount of carbon is conserved in natural forests (up to 250 MgC/ha). These stored carbon can be emitted to the atmosphere as CO2 gas through deforestation. Planted trees have a high rate of carbon sequestration (mean of 4.3 MgC/ha/yr) and could help mitigate greenhouse gas concentration.

Risk and resilience in agri-food supply chains: the case of the ASDA PorkLink supply chain in Scotland,"Purpose - The paper examines one of Scotland's major pork supply chains and seeks to identify the key risks and challenges involved in developing a resilient agri-food supply system, particularly with regard to primary product supply, and to show how risk management and collaboration amongst stakeholders can increase chain resilience. Design/methodology/approach - The case study involved in-depth interviews with seven people involved in the chain and its management. Findings - Reduced supply chain vulnerability to risks arose through horizontal collaboration amongst producers, and vertical collaboration with the processor and retailer. Producers improved market and price security, and pig performance. For the processor and retailer the collaboration generated greater security of supply of an assured quality, improved communication with suppliers, and reduced demand risk as they could assure consumers on quality, animal welfare and product provenance. Research limitations/implications - The study's findings are based on the analysis of a particular supply chain, but the cooperative concerned currently produces over half of Scotland's weekly pig production. Practical implications The findings are highly transferable to other agri-food supply chains. Producers' successful efforts to deal with different risks and the role of collaboration in enhancing chain resilience are illustrated. Originality/value The case is interesting because pigmeat supply profitability has been under constant pressure. It discusses the risks faced by all chain participants and the collective development of a chain which is relatively resilient to variations in price, production and supply.",About Sufficiency
Physiological factors influencing climate-smart agriculture: Daylength-mediated interaction between tillering and flowering in rice,"BackgroundControlling rice tillering and flowering is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from paddy fields, a key objective in climate-smart agriculture. However, the interaction between tillering and flowering remains controversial and poorly understood. In this study, we subjected plants of the rice cultivars 'Saenuri' and 'Odae' to short- and long-day conditions and compared their growth and flowering responses after tiller removal.ResultsThe effects of tiller removal differed depending on daylength conditions. Under short days, plants in the tiller-removal group flowered earlier than the controls, whereas the opposite trend was observed under long days. This response was associated with changes in florigen gene expression. Under short days, the expression of Hd3a, which promotes flowering, increased in the tiller-removal group compared with that in the controls. In contrast, under long days, the expression of OsMFT1, a gene that delays flowering and promotes spikelet formation, was significantly upregulated, leading to an increased spikelet number. Notably, spikelets per panicle in the tiller-removal groups increased approximately 3.4-fold in 'Saenuri' and 2.2-fold in 'Odae' under long-day conditions compared with those in their respective controls.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the daylength-dependent variability in tillering and flowering interactions, providing new insights into their regulatory mechanisms. This study offers a foundation for optimizing rice growth strategies under varying photoperiod conditions, contributing to climate-smart agricultural practices and improved breeding programs.",About Sufficiency
"Legumes and common beans in sustainable diets: nutritional quality, environmental benefits, spread and use in food preparations","In recent decades, scarcity of available resources, population growth and the widening in the consumption of processed foods and of animal origin have made the current food system unsustainable. High-income countries have shifted towards food consumption patterns which is causing an increasingly process of environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources, with the increased incidence of malnutrition due to excess (obesity and non-communicable disease) and due to chronic food deprivation. An urgent challenge is, therefore, to move towards more healthy and sustainable eating choices and reorientating food production and distribution to obtain a human and planetary health benefit. In this regard, legumes represent a less expensive source of nutrients for low-income countries, and a sustainable healthier option than animal-based proteins in developed countries. Although legumes are the basis of many traditional dishes worldwide, and in recent years they have also been used in the formulation of new food products, their consumption is still scarce. Common beans, which are among the most consumed pulses worldwide, have been the focus of many studies to boost their nutritional properties, to find strategies to facilitate cultivation under biotic/abiotic stress, to increase yield, reduce antinutrients contents and rise the micronutrient level. The versatility of beans could be the key for the increase of their consumption, as it allows to include them in a vast range of food preparations, to create new formulations and to reinvent traditional legume-based recipes with optimal nutritional healthy characteristics.",About Sufficiency
The potential of soil functions and planner-oriented soil evaluation to achieve sustainable land use,"Purpose Since application of ecological soil evaluation is not widely introduced in planning processes, a need for harmonisation of soil evaluation methods and spatial planning is evident. Conflicts are caused by the discrepancy between a holistic and site-specific approach of soil evaluation and the demand of spatial planners for easy-to-handle planner-oriented evaluation methods. Planners require less differentiation of pedological aspects but a detailed consideration of land use aspects. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the evolution of the concept of soil function and the development of the understanding of the soil functionality with time, respectively. This is reflected before the background of its applicability for spatial planning. Restrictions and deficits are highlighted, and strategies for further research work are sketched. The relation of soil functions and soil evaluation is examined exemplarily with algorithms of the TUSEC method applied for typical but fictive planning situations. Main features An introduction comprising the early history of soil evaluation and the widening of the view on soil functionality with time is given. Since 1978, the restriction on the function of soil to biomass productivity was overcome, and today, a set of ecological functions ensuring a sustainable land use is introduced. This process is reflected here by drawing a time order of definitions of soil functions, whereas the function of soil as carbon stock and genetic pool are the most recently accepted ones. In addition, functions of special meaning for the environmental quality in urban areas are highlighted. The multi-functionality of soil is reflected as a basic principle of the modern understanding of soils. It is explained here that the complexity of the concept of multi-functionality of soils does not fit directly to the administrative sight on the belongings of soil protection. Therefore, the chapters in this paper dealing with principle aspects of soil functions are followed by passages focusing on the application of soil functions, its practice, problems and perspectives. Results and discussion Strategies for future adaptations of soil evaluation to the requirements of spatial planning are discussed. Thus, strategies to summarise soil functions are sketched, and a reasonable land use specified soil evaluation is proposed. Conclusions Spatial planning needs a method for soil evaluation allowing a multi-level approach and some simplifications to meet the goals of rational land-use planning. Further work on this topic is strongly necessary to make efforts in soil protection and to support sustainable land use or, if anything, to bring sustainability into effect.",About Sufficiency
Lentil (Lens culinaria) and its by-products inclusion in livestock nutrition: present insights and emerging trends in rabbit and poultry system,"The current agro-industrial system must develop a more efficient and sustainable food production model to achieve greater food security for the expanding global population, in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the European Agenda 2030.

Leverage of Essential Oils on Faeces-Based Methane and Biogas Production in Dairy Cows,"Currently, there is an ongoing intensive search for solutions that would effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mainly methane) into the environment. From a practical point of view, it is important to reduce methane emissions from cows in such a way as to simultaneously trim emissions from the digestive system and increase its potential production from feces, which is intended as a substrate used in biogas plants. Such a solution would not only lower animal-based methane emissions but would also enable the production of fuel (in chemical form) with a high yield of methane from biogas, which would boost the economic benefits and reduce the use of fossil fuels. We tested the effect of administering an essential oil blend consisting of 5.5% oils and fats on methane and biogas production from dairy cow feces during fermentation. Three subsequent series (control and experimental) were conducted in dairy cows fed a total mixed ration (TMR) rich in brewer's cereals and beet pulp, with 20% dry matter (DM) of the total diet. Cows from the experimental group received 20 g/cow/day of essential oil blend, namely a commercial additive (CA). The study showed that CA can increase the production of methane and biogas from dairy cow feces. It can be concluded that in the experimental groups, approx. 15.2% and 14.4% on a fresh matter basis and 11.7% and 10.9% on a dry matter basis more methane and biogas were generated compared to the control group, respectively. Therefore, it can be assumed that the use of CA in cow nutrition improved dietary digestibility, which increased the efficiency of the use of feces organic matter for biogas production.",About Sufficiency
Leveraging digital infrastructure for sustainable grain production: evidence from China,"Introduction Agriculture faces significant challenges in ensuring global food security while minimizing resource costs and environmental impacts. The development of digital infrastructure offers transformative potential for agricultural systems and aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This study examines the role of digital infrastructure in enhancing grain production capacity in China, a key player in the global food system.Methods We analyzed data from 277 prefecture-level cities in China from 2011 to 2021. A double machine learning model was employed to empirically assess the impact of digital infrastructure on grain production capacity, allowing for robust insights into causal relationships.Results Results reveal that digital infrastructure significantly enhances grain production. Mechanism analysis results indicate that digital infrastructure construction drives agricultural technological advancements and farmland scale, contributing to increased production capacity. Heterogeneity analysis results show that the impact of digital infrastructure construction is significant in major grain-producing regions and the central-eastern regions, while its effects are relatively limited in grain production-consumption balanced regions, main grain consumption regions, and the western regions.Discussion The results underscore the importance of strengthening digital infrastructure in rural areas to improve grain production capacity.

Estimating the opportunity costs of avoiding oil palm-based deforestation in Indonesia: Implications for REDD+,"Reducing emissions due to deforestation is considered a low-cost option for mitigating climate change. However, the recent literature suggests higher opportunity costs because of specific deforestation drivers, which render reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) for mitigating climate change an uncertain, less attractive, and controversial option. Indonesia is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters. Since 1989, 53.80% of its oil palm expansion has come from forestlands, which has generated a significant amount of carbon emissions. This study uses official data and results from the relevant literature to estimate the costs of oil palm-based deforestation under various scenario assumptions, including different output prices, yields, time horizons, and discount rates. We also calculate the additional cost to preserve a 1-ha forest. We demonstrate that the average opportunity cost from avoiding oil palm-based deforestation is 24.42 USD/tCO(2)eq in Indonesia, approximately 1.3 times the 2011 EUA carbon price. Additional sums of around 5,466.90-11,042.96 USD/ha should be provided to landowners for the deforestation avoidance caused by oil palm expansion. Special attention should be given to the extensive oil palm expansion in Indonesia and the resulting high opportunity costs for achieving the REDD+ target.",About Sufficiency
Effect of Biochar and Earthworms on Mineralization of Organic Matter in Top Soil and Deep Soil,"Biochar has been widely used for soil remediation and carbon sequestration. However, the effects of biochar and earthworms on the mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) remain controversial. In this study, SOM mineralization in top and deep soils with or without earthworm activity and 0.5% (w/w) maize straw biochar was investigated during a 43-day incubation experiment. The results showed that the organic carbon content was reduced after incubation, particularly during earthworm activity. The addition of biochar retained easily degradable fractions (such as tryptophan and tyrosine), whereas earthworms promoted the degradation of these fractions. Earthworms significantly increased the soil respiration rate and soil carbon emissions. The addition of biochar stimulated SOM mineralization under the effect of earthworms in the top soil within 7 days; however, biochar inhibited carbon emissions under earthworm activity for a longer time. Compared with deep soil, earthworms had a stronger respiration effect on top soil, which was mainly attributed to the more easily degradable SOM in the top soil. Overall, the positive effects of biochar on carbon sequestration were more pronounced under earthworm activity. This study emphasizes that soil mineralization was affected by biochar and soil macrofauna, particularly in areas with intense human activity.",About Sufficiency
"Effects of paddy field non-grainization consolidation on sustainable eco-functions protection of soil bacterial: Empirical evidence from Zhejiang province, China","The increasing ""non-grainization"" of paddy fields affecting large-scale grain cultivation and impacting the sustainable eco-functions protection of soil bacterial in China. The same problem of ""non-grainization"" has threatened food security and farmland soil ecological functions in other areas of the world. Although previous research has demonstrated that soil microorganisms are strongly affected by land use change, little is known about the effects of paddy field non-grainization consolidation (NGC) on soil microorganisms. This study examined soil samples before and after paddy field NGC in Zhejiang province, China, measured soil environmental factors and performed 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing to analyze the changes in soilbacterial communities and ecosystem functions before and after NGC. Results show that NGC increased the relative abundances of Proteobacteria (27.89%) and Actinobacteria (25.25%) in the project zones. Total soil bacteria increased in all samples after NGC implementation in terms of absolute soil bacterial community content, but there were large differences. NGC improved the alpha diversity indices, including Ace, Chao1, Coverage, and Shannon indices (p < 0.01) in terms of soil bacterial community diversity. The data analysis of RDA and the significance test showed that the environmental factors which were close-knitted with the soil bacterial diversity and structure of the sample sites were TN, AP, pH, SOM, FIQ, and AK. Wilcoxon rank sum test results showed that NGC also significantly enhanced the amino acid transport and metabolic functions of soil bacterial. Our findings suggest that NGC is beneficial to improve the paddy field soil bacterial diversity, enhance the versatility of soil ecosystems, and promote sustainable arable land soil ecosystem protection. The quantitative results would be useful for better studying the use of land remediation engineering measures to the remediation and maintenance of bacterial diversity and sustainable eco-functions protection in paddy fields.",About Sufficiency

This study aimed to explore the perceptions of Australian local government stakeholders regarding policy actions simultaneously addressing healthy eating and climate change, and the influences on policy adoption.MethodsWe conducted 11 in-depth semi-structured interviews with stakeholders from four local governments in Victoria, Australia. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. We applied Multiple Streams Theory (MST) 'problem', 'politics and 'policy' domains to explain policy adoption influences at the local government level.ResultsKey influences on local government action aligned with MST elements of 'problem' (e.g., local government's existing risk reports as drivers for climate change action), 'policy' (e.g., budgetary constraints) and 'politics' (e.g., local government executive agenda). We found limited evidence of coherent policy action in the areas of community gardens, food procurement and urban land use.ConclusionBarriers to further action, such as resource constraints and competing priorities, could be overcome by better tailoring policy action areas to community needs, with the help of external partnerships and local government executive support.So What?This study demonstrates that Victorian local stakeholders believe they are well-positioned to implement feasible and coherent interventions that address both healthy eating and climate.",About Sufficiency
Long-term organic farming improves the red soil quality and microbial diversity in subtropics,"Organic farming is considered a sustainable agricultural practice that can enhance soil health and reduce environmental pollution. However, the long-term effect of organic farming on soil quality, microbial structure and functions, as well as the underly mechanism still remains incomplete. Here, we investigated the effect of 5, 15, and 20 years of organic farming on soil chemical and biological properties at 0-20 cm (topsoil) and 20-40 cm (subsoil) depths in comparison with conventional farming in a subtropical region. The Soil quality index (SQI) was calculated using a total dataset of soil nutrients (i e., SOC, TN, TP, etc.), enzyme activities (C- and Nacquiring enzymes), and microbial diversity (Fungal chao1, bacterial chao1). The results showed that organic farming significantly increased soil quality by 53-103 % in topsoil and by 25-142 % in subsoil. Organic farming increased soil total and available nutrients, soil water content, C- and N-acquiring enzyme activities, and microbial diversity. Compared to conventional farming, the enzyme activities for C- and N- acquisition in organic farming increased by 3 times and 2 times, respectively, and stabilized over time. Microbial community analysis indicated a rich and complex network under long-term organic management, with a notable increase in the number of nodes and edges (doubled after 20-year), signifying a more resilient ecosystem. In conclusion, longterm organic farming significantly enhances soil quality and microbial diversity, with the most substantial improvements observed in longer duration, thereby supporting the sustainability of agricultural practices in subtropical regions. The study underscores the importance of long-term organic farming in improving soil quality and provides scientific evidence for advocating sustainable agricultural practices in subtropical regions.",About Sufficiency
Long-term organic fertilizer-induced carbonate neoformation increases carbon sequestration in soil,"Soil carbon is major driver of climate in the long term because soil can either decrease global warming by carbon sequestration or increase warming by emissions of greenhouse gases. Soil inorganic carbon is mainly composed of carbonates and represents globally more than half of the total soil carbon stock up to a 2-m depth. The dissolution of carbonates by fertilization-induced acidification may offset the global efforts aimed at organic carbon sequestration, yet this process is poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the effects of fertilization strategies on inorganic carbon contents and stocks to 120 cm soil depth by using natural delta C-13 signature of organic and inorganic carbon in 32- and 40-year field experiments. Results show that long-term application of mineral nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizers acidified soils by 0.2 pH units. This caused inorganic carbon dissolution and carbon dioxide emissions of 9-12 Mg C per hectare, representing 12-18% of the initial stock in the top 60 cm. By contrast, manure application increased inorganic carbon stock by 8.9-11 Mg C per hectare, representing 4.8-17% of the initial stock up to 120 cm depth. The main pathway of inorganic carbon accumulation under organic fertilization is the neoformation of pedogenic carbonates and the conservation of lithogenic carbonates. Manure combined with mineral fertilizers did not affect inorganic carbon and therefore provides an optimal solution to mitigate carbon losses from soil.",About Sufficiency
Low carbon agriculture: Objectives and policy pathways Original Research Article,"The threat of long-term climate change has driven a number of international and national bodies to call for a re-direction of development pathways so that they are more resource efficient and use less carbon (C) in the form of fossil fuel per unit of economic growth and cause lower greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Agriculture is one of the largest anthropogenic sources of GHG emissions yet few authorities take account of this fact in their proposals and programmes for low C development. Hence this policy review examines the case for promoting strategies and policies for low C agricultural growth. Most of the policy and technological options that it considers have already been put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others in the context of climate change mitigation, but constraints to their implementation have often been underestimated. This review reassesses their potential contribution in the light of known bio-physical, socio-economic and institutional limitations. It concludes that there is a very strong case for greatly increasing the priority given to policies for low C growth which can be true winwinwin responses. Many of them are more cost-effective than the responses available to other sectors. They can be pro-poor and have other socio-economic benefits. They not only limit GHG emissions but also provide a range of other environmental and ecosystem benefits. However there can be significant barriers to implementation that must be overcome by national policies shaped to meet the needs of different farmer groups and agricultural systems.

Low-Income Families' Direct Participation in Food-Systems Innovation to Promote Healthy Food Behaviors,"Low-income families, especially those who reside in food deserts, face significant systemic barriers regarding their ability to access affordable and nutritious food. The food behaviors exhibited by low-income families are a reflection of the shortcomings of the built environment and conventional food system. Policy and public-health initiatives to improve food security have, thus far, failed to deliver interventions that simultaneously address multiple pillars of food security. Centering the voices of the marginalized and their place-based knowledge may result in the development of food-access solutions that are a much better fit for the population that they intend to serve. Community-based participatory research has emerged as a solution to better meet the needs of communities in food-systems innovation, but little is known about the extent to which direct participation improves nutritional outcomes. The purpose of this research is to answer the following question: how can food-access solutions authentically engage marginalized community members in food-system innovation, and if participation is related to changes in their food behaviors, how is it related? This action research project leveraged a mixed-methods approach to analyze nutritional outcomes and define the nature of participation for 25 low-income families who reside in a food desert. Our findings suggest that nutritional outcomes improve when major barriers to healthy food consumption are addressed, for example, time, education, and transportation. Furthermore, participation in social innovations can be characterized by the nature of involvement as either a producer or consumer, actively or inactively involved. We conclude that when marginalized communities are at the center of food-systems innovation, individuals self-select their level of participation, and when primary barriers are addressed, deeper participation in food-systems innovation is associated with positive changes in healthy food behaviors.",About Sufficiency
"Deterioration of soil fertility by land use changes in South Sumatra, Indonesia: from 1970 to 1990","We monitored the land use changes in a hilly area of West Lampung, South Sumatra, Indonesia, from 1970 to 1990. The main data sources were the land use maps produced in 1970, 1978, 1984 and 1990 covering the area of 27 km x 27 km. Transmigration and the resultant effect of increased population were the major driving forces in land use changes. Fifty-seven per cent of the study area was covered with primary forests in 1970, but only 13% in 1990. Areas under plantations, which were absent in 1970, increased to 60% in 1990. In addition, the change from monoculture plantations (mostly coffee plantation) to mixed plantations was noticeable from 1984 to 1990. Total upland areas including upland areas under shifting cultivation and upland fields with crops and vegetables decreased from 21% in 1970 to 0.1% in 1990. Soil chemical properties (total organic C, total N, available P, total P, exchangeable cations, cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), etc.) were analysed for lands under different land use forms after deforestation in the study area. Soil samples (surface layers, 0-20 cm, and subsurface layers, 20-40 cm) were collected from three different locations, each comprised of four different land use systems: i.e. primary forests, secondary forests, coffee plantations and cultivated lands. The contents of total organic C, total N, available P, total P, exchangeable cations and CEC decreased significantly with land use change from primary forests to the other land use forms. Cultivated lands exhibited the lowest values. Although less remarkable than in the surface layers, the amounts of total organic C, total N, total P, exchangeable cations and CEC were also decreased by forest clearing in the subsurface layers. Based on the land use changes from 1978 in the study area and the deterioration of soil chemical properties by forest clearing, total decreases in the amounts of nutrients in the surface and subsurface layers were estimated. The land use changes were estimated to have decreased the total amounts of total organic C, total N, available P, total P, exchangeable cations and CEC by 2-9% in 1984 and by 2-15% in 1990 in the surface layers, and by 1-6%% in 1984 and by 2-9% in 1990 in the subsurface layers from the levels in 1978, respectively.

LINKING LAND DISTRIBUTION WITH FOOD SECURITY: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM PAKISTAN,"Equitable distribution of rural lands amongst farming communities plays a pivotal role in food production and contributes to adequate calorie intake. Based on land distribution, this study estimates the disparities of operational farmland holdings at the district level in Pakistan, and ranks the districts in terms of land distribution in descending order. It also investigates the impact of land distribution, farm fragmentation, and land-use intensity on various aspects of food security (i.e., food availability, food access, and food absorption) by employing Pearson correlation and econometric models. The results from show that food security is heigthened with the improvement in distribution of land (i.e., operational land holdings) and land-use intensity, while food security declines with an increase in farm fragmentation. Therefore, land reform policies which aim to reduce disparity in land distribution and fragmentation would strongly contribute to enhancing food security in Pakistan.",About Sufficiency
Comparing poultry manure and cow dung on Arachis hypogaea growth in savanna environment,"Mahmud AA, Abdulrahman MD. 2025. Comparing poultry manure and cow dung on Arachis hypogaea growth in Savanna environment. Nusantara Bioscience 17: 21-29. The study investigated the effects of poultry manure and cow dung on the growth of Arachis hypogaea L. (groundnut) in a controlled experimental setup at the botanical garden of Department of Plant Science and Biotechnology, Federal University Dutsin-Ma, Katsina State, Nigeria. The experiment followed a Completely Randomized Block Design (CRBD) with two organic fertilizer as treatments; poultry manure cow dung, and a control sample with no fertilizer. Two groundnut seeds varieties; pure red and light tan mixed each separately with cow dung, and poultry manure, and were subjected to viability test before planting. Growth parameters, including the number of leaves and plant height, were measured monthly for five months. The data obtained were analyzed using SPSS statistical software version 21, and significant differences were identified with Duncan's multiple range tests at a 5% probability level. Results indicated a significant impact of organic fertilizers on the growth parameters. The results revealed that cow dung promotes early growth while poultry manure contributes more to reproductive success and yield. The control group showed significantly lower leaf development, with an average of (43.4) leaves. The findings highlight the role of organic fertilizers in enhancing plant leaf production, as they provide essential nutrients that are often deficient in untreated soils. In terms of plant height, the light tan variety treated with cow dung achieved the greatest average height (16.53 cm), surpassing both the control (15.4 cm) and the pure red variety treated with poultry manure (13.45 cm). Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of using organic fertilizers like poultry manure and cow dung to improve groundnut growth, reduce dependence on synthetic fertilizers, and enhance soil health. These organic amendments are beneficial for sustainable agricultural practices, contributing to improved crop yield and environmental sustainability.",About Sufficiency
Maize edible-legumes intercropping systems for enhancing agrobiodiversity and belowground ecosystem services,"Intensification of staple crops through conventional agricultural practices with chemical synthetic inputs has yielded positive outcomes in food security but with negative environmental impacts. Ecological intensification using cropping systems such as maize edible-legume intercropping (MLI) systems has the potential to enhance soil health, agrobiodiversity and significantly influence crop productivity. However, mechanisms underlying enhancement of biological soil health have not been well studied. This study investigated the shifts in rhizospheric soil and maize-root microbiomes and associated soil physico-chemical parameters in MLI systems of smallholder farms in comparison to maize-monoculture cropping systems (MMC). Maize-root and rhizospheric soil samples were collected from twenty-five farms each conditioned by MLI and MMC systems in eastern Kenya. Soil characteristics were assessed using Black oxidation and Walkley methods. High-throughput amplicon sequencing was employed to analyze fungal and bacterial communities, predicting their functional roles and diversity. The different MLI systems significantly impacted soil and maize-root microbial communities, resulting in distinct microbe sets. Specific fungal and bacterial genera and species were mainly influenced and enriched in the MLI systems (e.g., Bionectria solani, Sarocladium zeae, Fusarium algeriense, and Acremonium persicinum for fungi, and Bradyrhizobium elkanii, Enterobacter roggenkampii, Pantoea dispersa and Mitsuaria chitosanitabida for bacteria), which contribute to nutrient solubilization, decomposition, carbon utilization, plant protection, bio-insecticides/fertilizer production, and nitrogen fixation. Conversely, the MMC systems enriched phytopathogenic microbial species like Sphingomonas leidyi and Alternaria argroxiphii. Each MLI system exhibited a unique composition of fungal and bacterial communities that shape belowground biodiversity, notably affecting soil attributes, plant well-being, disease control, and agroecological services. Indeed, soil physico-chemical properties, including pH, nitrogen, organic carbon, phosphorus, and potassium were enriched in MLI compared to MMC cropping systems. Thus, diversification of agroecosystems with MLI systems enhances soil properties and shifts rhizosphere and maize-root microbiome in favor of ecologically important microbial communities.",About Sufficiency
Maize intercropped with Panicum maximum cultivars and Pigeon pea improves silage yield and quality,"Integrated systems are efficient technologies used for diversifying production and promoting agricultural sustainability. The benefits of double intercropping are well-established in research. With advancements in sustainable food production technology, some studies have explored triple intercropping by adding legumes. However, triple intercropping methods must be comprehensively understood. This study aimed to evaluate the production of dry mass, fermentation profile, and nutritive values of silage from maize based intercropping. The experiment was conducted in the field, in Instituto Federal Goiano, Campus Rio Verde, State of Goi & aacute;s, Brazil, where we assessed silage production and quality in monoculture and intercropping systems, in a randomized block complete design with three replications. We evaluated 8 treatments, consisting of silage from: maize monoculture; Tamani guinea grass monoculture; Qu & ecirc;nia guinea grass monoculture; Zuri guinea grass monoculture; Pigeon pea monoculture; maize + Tamani guinea grass + Pigeon pea; maize + Qu & ecirc;nia guinea grass + Pigeon pea and maize + Zuri guinea grass + Pigeon pea. The results showed that maize silage intercropped with cultivars of Panicum maximum (Tamani, Qu & ecirc;nia and Zuri guinea grasses) and Pigeon pea increased silage mass production by 37.8% and the crude protein content at 25.1% compared with that of the monoculture maize silage. It also improved the fermentation characteristics of silage, reducing 5.1% of pH, 32.5% of buffering capacity, 28.9% of ammoniacal nitrogen in total nitrogen, 15.7% of effluent production, and 20.0% of dry matter losses, compared with those of grass and legume silage in monoculture.

Making visible the people who feed us: Educating for critical food literacy through multicultural texts,"The number of food systems education programs and curricula in the U.S. has increased in response to the growing interest in where food comes from and how it is grown. While these educational efforts aim to increase learners' connection to food and the land, they do not always focus explicitly on the structural inequities that shape food systems and the experiences of food workers. There is, however, a small but growing number of food systems education programs that seek to shed light on and challenge these inequities. We build on these existing critical approaches to food systems education by introducing the notion of critical food literacy-or the ability to examine one's assumptions, grapple with multiple perspectives and values that underlie the food system, understand the larger sociopolitical contexts that shape the food system, and take action toward creating just, sustainable food systems. In particular, we discuss and highlight the potential of multicultural texts to make visible food workers, especially those who tend to be less visible, and identify pedagogical strategies for cultivating critical food literacy by drawing on empirical research on response to multicultural literature and using a multicultural text produced by the Food Chain Workers Alliance as an illustrative example. Ultimately, we argue that citizens who develop and demonstrate critical food literacy can participate in public, democratic discourse about food systems and help create food systems that are just and sustainable for all.",About Sufficiency

However, there is limited information on the efficacy of different soil health indicators on commercial farms and perhaps less so on organic farms. To assess efficacy, three organic growers in cooperation with the Ecological Farmers Association of Ontario's Farmer-Led Research Program tested management sensitivity, measurement repeatability, and consistency of interpretation of different soil health indicators. On each farm, we compared permanganate-oxidizable carbon (active carbon), organic matter, wet aggregate stability, phospholipid fatty acid analysis, Haney soil health test, and Haney nutrient test on one field of grower-perceived high productivity, one field of grower- perceived low productivity, and one reference site (undisturbed, permanent cover). Our results were consistent with previous research that showed grower perception of productivity and soil health associated with management- sensitive soil health indicators. Of the indicators tested, active carbon was the only indicator that was sensitive, repeatable, and consistent across the three farms, and soil organic matter was highly repeatable and consistent to detect differences greater than 0.5% organic matter. This study highlights differences among soil health indicators on commercial farms, and it concludes that active carbon and organic matter were the most useful soil health indicators for these organic farms. Participating growers intend to use results to benchmark current soil status and to help guide land management decisions towards improved soil health.",About Sufficiency

A framework to assess the challenges to food safety initiatives in an emerging economy,"Emerging economies, e.g. India, China and Brazil etc., face challenges to adopt food safety (FS) practices in their food supply chains. Considering food industry's operations and processes, this study identifies 25 challenges to the FS initiatives involving the opinions of practitioners from six major Indian food producers and academic experts. The challenges are grouped into five categories, viz. organisational, government and policy, global, knowledge and financial. We identify the best and worst challenges to the FS initiatives along with causality among them using combined Best Worst Method (BWM) and 'Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory' (DEMATEL) approaches. BWM prioritises these challenges, while DEMATEL identifies causal relationship maps for the prioritised challenges. The BWM results demonstrate that the government and policy related challenges are the key challenges followed by the organisational, global, knowledge and financial related challenges. The DEMATEL results exhibit the organisational, government and policy, and global related challenges as the cause group challenges. The knowledge and financial related challenges represent the effect group challenges. Mitigation of these challenges inherently necessitates stakeholders' involvement in the food supply chains. We identify constructs for food safety initiatives policy in the emerging economies to raise public awareness while encouraging greater collaboration and efficiency in food supply chains to help achieve the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for securing food for everyone. The results of the study offer guidance and deeper insights to supply chain managers about synergy requirements between the government policymakers and key players of the industry in the emerging economies.

"Livelihood strategies, capital assets, and food security in rural Southwest Ethiopia","Households combine capital assets in a process involving human agency and resourcefulness to construct livelihood strategies and generate well-being outcomes. Here, we (1) characterized types of livelihood strategies; (2) determined how different capital assets are associated with different livelihood strategies; and (3) determined how livelihood strategies differed in food security outcomes. We conducted a survey in southwestern Ethiopia and used principal component and cluster analyses. Five types of livelihood strategies, which differed mainly in food and cash crops comprising the strategy, were identified. These were, in order of decreasing food security: three food crops, coffee and khat', n=68; three food crops and khat', n=59; two food crops, coffee and khat', n=78; two food crops and khat', n=88; and one food crop, coffee and khat', n=44. The livelihood strategy three food crops, coffee and khat' was associated with a wide range of capital assets, particularly having larger aggregate farm field size and learning from other farmers. A generalized linear model showed that livelihood strategies were significantly associated with food security outcomes. Particularly, a high number of food crops in a strategy was linked with relatively high food security. In this context, diversified livelihood strategies primarily through having a mix of food crops for subsistence, in combination with cash crops for income, are important for food security. This suggests a need to rethink dominant policy narratives, which have a narrow focus on increasing productivity and commercialization as the primary pathway to food security.",About Sufficiency
Food Security among Libyan Migrants Living in Australia: A Qualitative Study,"Food security among migrants and refugees is a concern across the globe, with the dearth of evidence on food labels and their influence on food security affecting disadvantaged communities especially. This paper discusses the experiences of food security among Libyan migrant families in Australia. The study is situated within the food and nutrition security framework. A qualitative approach was adopted with in-depth interviews conducted with 27 Libyan migrants. Thematic analysis identified three themes: food security, food label comprehension, and strategies for dealing with food insecurity and food labelling difficulties. Food security had different meanings to different individuals. Access to culturally appropriate (halal) foods was problematic for families in regional and rural areas due to a lack of availability outside the main cities. In terms of food labelling, the language and terms used were a common issue for most families in both rural and city environments. Many families attempted to find ways to counteract food insecurity; however, lower-income families found this more burdensome. It is crucial that health and social welfare providers consider means to reduce food insecurity among Libyan migrants to allow them to live a healthier life in Australia.",About Sufficiency
Children's liking for vegetarian and non-vegetarian school meals at the scale of a French city,"In Western countries, a behavioural shift towards more plant-based diets is helpful in protecting population and planet health. School canteens are an important public policy target to achieve this transition. Increasing the frequency of vegetarian meals in school canteens has been proposed as a solution to decrease greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining a good nutritional quality. However, vegetarian meals acceptance by children is key to limit unintended consequences such as increased food waste or increased nutritional inequalities. We aimed to examine children's liking for vegetarian and non-vegetarian main dishes at school canteens; and whether it varied across socioeconomic level. Connected scoring devices displaying a five-point smiley scale were installed in all the 38 primary school canteens of a French city, located in socially diverse neighbourhoods. Every day after their school lunch, children were asked to rate the main dish they had just eaten. During one school year, from September 2021 to June 2022, we collected 208,985 votes for 125 main dishes, including 32 vegetarian (i.e., no meat or fish) and 93 non-vegetarian dishes, for an average of 1672 (SD 440) votes per day across the 38 school canteens. We showed no difference in children's liking for vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Additionally, the socioeconomic level of the schools was found to interact negatively with children's liking for vegetarian main dishes whereby vegetarian main dishes tended to be more liked in schools of lower socioeconomic level.

Mechanistic Insights of Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria Mediated Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance in Plants for Sustainable Agriculture,"Climate change has devastating effects on plant growth and yield. During ontogenesis, plants are subjected to a variety of abiotic stresses, including drought and salinity, affecting the crop loss (20-50%) and making them vulnerable in terms of survival. These stresses lead to the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage nucleic acid, proteins, and lipids. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) have remarkable capabilities in combating drought and salinity stress and improving plant growth, which enhances the crop productivity and contributes to food security. PGPB inoculation under abiotic stresses promotes plant growth through several modes of actions, such as the production of phytohormones, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase, exopolysaccharide, siderophore, hydrogen cyanide, extracellular polymeric substances, volatile organic compounds, modulate antioxidants defense machinery, and abscisic acid, thereby preventing oxidative stress. These bacteria also provide osmotic balance; maintain ion homeostasis; and induce drought and salt-responsive genes, metabolic reprogramming, provide transcriptional changes in ion transporter genes, etc. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the effects of PGPB on drought and salinity stress to mitigate its detrimental effects. Furthermore, we also discuss the mechanistic insights of PGPB towards drought and salinity stress tolerance for sustainable agriculture.",About Sufficiency

An extended knowledge of the uptake, translocation, storage, and detoxification mechanisms in plants, of the interactions with microorganisms, and of the use of ""omic"" technologies (functional genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics), combined with genetic analysis and plant improvement, is essential to understand the fate of contaminants in plants and food, nonfood and technical crops. The integration of physicochemical and biological understanding allows the optimization of these properties of plants, making phytotechnologies more economically and socially attractive, decreasing the level and transfer of contaminants along the food chain and augmenting the content of essential minerals in food crops. This review will disseminate experience gained between 2004 and 2009 by three working groups of COST Action 859 on the uptake, detoxification, and sequestration of pollutants by plants and consequences for food safety. Gaps between scientific approaches and lack of understanding are examined to suggest further research and to clarify the current state-of-the-art for potential end-users of such green options. Phytotechnologies potentially offer efficient and environmentally friendly solutions for cleanup of contaminated soil and water, improvement of food safety, carbon sequestration, and development of renewable energy sources, all of which contribute to sustainable land use management. Information has been gained at more realistic exposure levels mainly on Cd, Zn, Ni, As, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and herbicides with less on other contaminants.

Agriculture and pasture soils were among the most diverse and presented higher functional redundancy, which is important to maintain the ecosystem functioning after the forest conversion. On the other hand, the ecosystem equilibrium in forest is maintained based on a lower alpha diversity but higher abundance of microorganisms. Our results indicate that land-use change alters the structure and composition of microbial communities; however, ecosystem functionality is overcome by different strategies based on the abundance and diversity of the communities.",About Sufficiency
Meta-Analysis Study on the Role of Biochar on Soil Nitrogen Cycling,"Soil nitrogen cycling is intricately related to soil physicochemical properties, enzymatic activity, and microbial vitality. Biochar, containing various elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, possesses a porous structure with strong adsorption capabilities. This characteristic renders it useful for ameliorating acidic soils, influencing soil nitrogen cycling, and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. To quantitatively analyze the diverse impacts of different biochar on soil nitrogen cycling and to highlight its implications for sustainable agriculture, this study collected 155 relevant articles and conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis. The results indicate that biochar can elevate the pH by 4.60% for acidic soils and significantly increase soil organic carbon content by 64.60%. Different feedstocks, such as Wooden Biochar (WB), Crop Husk (CH) Biochar, Crop Straw Biochar (CS), and Organic Waste Biochar (OW), exhibit distinct effects, with WB and OW showing the most significant increases in SOC. Pyrolysis temperature is also a critical factor, and biochar produced at medium and high temperatures enhances pH more effectively than low-temperature biochar. Additionally, biochar enhances the abundance of the nitrogen functional gene amoA-AOB by 25.58%, promoting ammonia oxidation, reducing ammonia (NH3) emissions by 16.39%. Experimental setups also influence outcomes that biochar application in woods and incubation studies significantly reduced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions compared to pot and field experiments. The findings suggest that adding biochar to soil accelerates nitrogen cycling, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The results advocate biochar's use in sustainable soil management practices. Biochar elevates soil pH by 4.57%, mitigating NH3 and N2O losses under certain conditions.Biochar accelerates nitrogen cycling with 25.58% increase in amoA-AOB gene abundance.Significant boost (64.60%) in soil organic carbon, promoting fertility.",About Sufficiency
Methodologies for simulating impacts of climate change on crop production,"Ecophysiological models are widely used to forecast potential impacts of climate change on future agricultural productivity and to examine options for adaptation by local stakeholders and policy makers. However, protocols followed in such assessments vary to such an extent that they constrain cross-study syntheses and increase the potential for bias in projected impacts. We reviewed 221 peer-reviewed papers that used crop simulation models to examine diverse aspects of how climate change might affect agricultural systems. Six subject areas were examined: target crops and regions; the crop model(s) used and their characteristics; sources and application of data on [CO2] and climate; impact parameters evaluated; assessment of variability or risk; and adaptation strategies. Wheat, maize, soybean and rice were considered in approximately 170 papers. The USA (55 papers) and Europe (64 papers) were the dominant regions studied. The most frequent approach used to simulate response to CO2 involved adjusting daily radiation use efficiency (RUE) and transpiration, precluding consideration of the interacting effects of CO2, stomatal conductance and canopy temperature, which are expected to exacerbate effects of global warming. The assumed baseline [CO2] typically corresponded to conditions 10-30 years earlier than the date the paper was accepted, exaggerating the relative impacts of increased [CO2]. Due in part to the diverse scenarios for increases in greenhouse gas emissions, assumed future [CO2] also varied greatly. further complicating comparisons among studies. Papers considering adaptation predominantly examined changes in planting dates and cultivars; only 20 papers tested different tillage practices or crop rotations. Risk was quantified in over half the papers, mainly in relation to variability in yield or effects of water deficits, but the limited consideration of other factors affecting risk beside climate change per se suggests that impacts of climate change were overestimated relative to background variability. A coordinated crop, climate and soil data resource would allow researchers to focus on underlying science. More extensive model intercomparison, facilitated by modular software, should strengthen the biological realism of predictions and clarify the limits of our ability to forecast agricultural impacts of climate change on crop production and associated food security as well as to evaluate potential for adaptation.

Microalgal-based sustainable bio-fungicides: a promising solution to enhance crop yield,"The agricultural sector plays a crucial role in the world economy and in the increasing population. The decrease of crop yield and productivity by fungal infestation is one of the main concerns in agriculture. Synthetic fungicides are effective against several fungal infestations. However, although the tremendous use of synthetic fungicides to obtain high production yield has helped to cope with the growing population, it is gradually contaminating the ecosystem. Chemical fungicides have raised major concerns regarding environmental sustainability, human health, and increased resistance in fungal strains. Therefore, there is a need for a safer and more sustainable alternative. Microalgae provide a clean and sustainable solution to this emerging problem. Microalgal extracts have been reported to be a potent bio-fungicide. This review explores the efficiency, uses, and environmental advantages of using microalgal extracts as bio-fungicide. The composition of microalgal extract contains many antifungal and antimicrobial chemicals that can be used as an eco-friendly bio-fungicide. Furthermore, microalgal extracts can contribute to sustainable agriculture practices by reducing the dependence on chemical fungicides.",About Sufficiency
Micro-nutrient pools and their mobility in relation to land-use system in a cold high altitude Himalayan mountainous region,"Land-use change significantly impacts soil micro-nutrients distribution and transformations due to their inefficient scale- and location-specific management in different ecosystems. We studied the changes in micro-nutrients (viz. Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn) availability and their transformations in soils of hilly landscapes under five distinct land-use systems including mono cropping, double cropping, agroforestry, orchards and the vegetable crops to explore relationship between different fractions of variable solubility and their mobility in response to land-use change. Among the compared land-use systems, DTPA-Zn, Fe, Mn and Cu comprised similar to 3.0 to 8.2%, similar to 0.21 to 0.35%, similar to 1.2 to 6.3% and similar to 7.6 to 17.5% of their respective total content in soils. The agroforestry system had significantly (p < 0.05) higher DTPA-Zn and Mn, compared with mono-and double cropping system. However, the orchard soils had similar to 2.1, 2.0 and 3.4-times higher DTPA-Zn, Fe and Cu concentration than the agroforestry system. The agroforestry system was distinct with significantly highest proportion of total Cu retrieved as amorphous oxide bound (similar to 20.5%), crystalline oxide bound (similar to 33.6%), organic matter bound (similar to 2.1%), while the lowest proportion was accumulated as residual form (similar to 43.8%), compared with the other studied land-use systems. The mobility factor that explicit micro-nutrient transformations among soluble and stable pool revealed that monocropping had the significantly lowest (similar to 3.3%), while the agroforestry system had the highest Zn mobility factor (similar to 4.9%). On the other hand, agroforestry system had significantly lowest (similar to 1.8%), while the soils under vegetable crops had the highest Mn mobility factor (similar to 7.5%). The principle component analysis (PCA) elucidated residual micro-nutrient (Zn, Fe and Mn) fraction as significant contributors to discern land-use change in fragile hilly landscapes.

Minimum dietary diversity among women of reproductive age in urban Burkina Faso,"Micronutrient malnutrition is a challenge for women of reproductive age, who are particularly vulnerable due to greater micronutrient needs. The minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W) indicator is a micronutrient adequacy's proxy for those women, but little is known about its relation to other dimensions. We assessed MDD-W and its association with other socioeconomic, food security and purchasing practices in urban Burkina Faso. We conducted multi-stage cluster sampling in two main cities of Burkina Faso, stratified by type of district, and interviewed 12 754 women in the 2009-2011 period. We obtained food consumption data through unquantified 24 hour recalls and computed MDD-W as consuming at least five out of ten predefined food groups. We constructed multivariable regression models with sociodemographic and food security covariates. MDD-W in urban Burkina Faso was 31%, higher in Ouagadougou (33%) than in Bobo-Dioulasso (29%), and lower in unstructured districts. The most frequently consumed food groups were 'all starchy', 'vitamin A rich dark green leafy vegetables' and 'other vegetables'. Household's expenses were associated with higher likelihood of MDD-W, while the association with household food security indicators varied by year and type of district. Purchasing foods in markets and choosing the place of purchase based on large choice rather than proximity showed a positive association with the MDD-W. Only one in three women in urban Burkina Faso reached the minimum dietary diversity, and although socioeconomic and food security variables had the greatest effect on MDD-W, purchasing practices, like going to the market, also showed a positive effect.",About Sufficiency
Mitigation of agricultural emissions in the tropics: comparing forest land-sparing options at the national level,"Emissions from agriculture-driven deforestation are of global concern, but forest land-sparing interventions such as agricultural intensification and utilization of available non-forest land offer opportunities for mitigation. In many tropical countries, where agriculture is the major driver of deforestation, interventions in the agriculture sector could reduce deforestation emissions as well as reduce emissions in the agriculture sector. Our study uses a novel approach to quantify agriculture-driven deforestation and associated emissions in the tropics between 2000 and 2010. Emissions from agriculture-driven deforestation in the tropics (97 countries) are 4.3 GtCO(2)e yr(-1). We investigate the national potential to mitigate these emissions through forest land-sparing interventions, which can potentially be implemented under REDD+. We consider intensification and utilization of available non-forested land as forest land-sparing opportunities since they avoid the expansion of agriculture into forested land. In addition, we assess the potential to reduce agricultural emissions on existing agriculture land. The use of a systematic framework demonstrates the selection of mitigation interventions by considering sequentially the level of emissions, mitigation potential of various interventions, enabling environment and associated risks to livelihoods at the national level. Our results show that considering only countries with high emissions from agriculture-driven deforestation, with potential for forest-sparing interventions and a good enabling environment (e.g. effective governance or engagement in REDD+),there is a potential to mitigate 1.3 GtCO(2)e yr(-1) (20 countries of 78 with sufficient data). For countries where we identify agricultural emissions as a priority for mitigation, up to 1 GtCO(2)e yr(-1) could be reduced from the agriculture sector including livestock. Risks to livelihoods from implementing interventions based on national level data call for detailed investigation at the local level to inform decisions on mitigation interventions. Three case studies demonstrate the use of the analytical framework. The inherent link between the agriculture and forestry sectors due to competition for land suggests that these sectors cannot be considered independently. Our findings highlight the need to include the forest and the agricultural sectors in the decision-making process to mitigate deforestation.",About Sufficiency

"MODELING BIOENERGY, LAND USE, AND GHG EMISSIONS WITH FASOMGHG: MODEL OVERVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF STORAGE COST IMPLICATIONS","Biofuels production has increased rapidly in recent years due to higher petroleum prices as well as heightened concerns regarding climate change and energy security. However, because commercially viable biofuels are currently produced primarily from agricultural feedstocks, higher production volumes increase pressure on land resources. Thus, large-scale biofuels production has important implications for the forest and agriculture sectors, land use, trade, and net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Competition for land is expected to continue growing in the future as mandated biofuels volumes increase along with rising demand for food, feed, and fiber, both domestically and internationally. In response to heightened concern regarding impacts such as indirect land-use change and higher food prices, the U.S. policy is focusing on second-generation (cellulosic) feedstocks to contribute the majority of the mandated increase in biofuels volume through 2022. However, there has been little work exploring the logistics of supplying these feedstocks or examining feedstock mix and net GHG effects of combining renewable fuels mandates with climate policy. In this paper, we apply the recently updated Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model with GHGs (FASOMGHG) to explore the implications of alternative assumptions regarding feedstock storage costs and carbon price for renewable energy production mix, land use, and net GHG emissions. The model is used to quantify the magnitude and regional distribution of changes in the optimal mix of bioenergy feedstocks when accounting for storage costs. In addition, we find that combining the biofuels volume mandate with a carbon price policy has additional implications for feedstock mix and provides a substantially larger net reduction in GHG than a renewable fuels mandate alone.",About Sufficiency

Antibiotic-Free Poultry Meat Consumption and Its Determinants,"In recent decades, meat consumption has increased globally due to increased incomes. A consequence of increased red meat consumption has been the rise in greenhouse gas emissions and nutrition-related diseases. Consumption of antibiotic-free (ABF) poultry meat is a viable healthy and sustainable substitute that will cause less damage to humans and the environment in the long run. This study was undertaken due to the increasing importance of healthy food consumption to preventing nutrition-related diseases. The health food industry is still in its preliminary stages; for market development of organic broiler meat and movement toward sustainable production of ABF meat, the first necessary step is conducting empirical research on ABF poultry meat consumption and identifying factors that influence household consumption patterns of ABF poultry meat. Therefore, the objectives of this study were the investigation of factors affecting poultry meat consumption by consumers and ABF poultry meat preference. Comparing the results could reveal what percentage of consumers are able to buy healthier higher-priced antibiotic-free poultry meat. Data were collected from 360 completed questionnaires completed by households from the city of Mashhad, Iran via simple random sampling in 2021. To investigate the first objective, an ordered logit model was used. The results showed that age, the head of household's education, awareness of the nutritional benefits of poultry meat, advertising, and family income were statistically significant determinants of poultry meat consumption. To investigate the second objective, since some consumers cannot buy ABF poultry meat due to the higher prices, we used a two-step Heckman model. The results showed that the awareness of the nutritional benefits of ABF poultry meat, the head of household's education, monthly family income, and advertising had positive impacts, with prices having a negative impact on the amount of antibiotic-free poultry meat consumed by the households. Comparing the results of the two models revealed that only about 30% of consumers could buy ABF poultry meat, mainly due to the higher prices. This study recommends improving consumer awareness, targeted distribution of ABF poultry meat according to customers' economic and demographic characteristics, affordable prices, and appropriate marketing tools for sustainable consumption of ABF poultry meat.",About Sufficiency
"Planning for climate action in British Columbia, Canada: Putting agricultural greenhouse gas mitigation on local government agendas","Significant greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions from all sectors of human enterprise are necessary to avoid further effects and reduce the current effects of climate change. Agriculture and the global food system are estimated to contribute to one-third of all anthropogenic GHGs. In British Columbia, Canada, mandated GHG reduction targets and voluntary climate action programs are challenging local governments to include emission reduction targets, policies, and actions within official planning documents. At this early stage of GHG reductions, local government attention does not yet include agriculture but is directed toward the transportation, buildings, and waste management sectors. Given agriculture's contribution to GHG emissions and local government's engagement with GHG mitigation and food system planning, it seems reasonable to anticipate that over time, local governments should and will engage increasingly in reducing GHGs from agriculture. With the goal of advancing agriculture GHG mitigation by local governments, this paper reviews the jurisdictional powers governing agriculture and climate change within British Columbia. It examines how local governments can support mitigation within the sector through their roles in planning, policy, programming, and public engagement, and identifies potential research agenda items.",About Sufficiency
"Farmers' Perception of Climate Change and Climate-Smart Agriculture in Northern Benin, West Africa","Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an approach that identifies actions needed to transform and reorganize agricultural systems to effectively support agricultural development and ensure food security in the face of climate change. In this study, we assessed farmers' perception of climate change, available CSA practices (CSAP) and the determinants of CSAP adoption in northern Benin. A list of CSAP was generated from a workshop with different stakeholders. Face-to-face interviews were then carried out with 368 farmers selected based on stratified random sampling in the study area. Binomial generalized mixed-effect models were run to analyze the relation between socio-demographic characteristics and the use of CSAP. CSAP were evaluated using a three-point Likert scale and the frequency of agreement with the statement that the selected practices meet the pillars of CSA. More than 60% of farmers had heard about climate change, and more than 80% had observed changes in temperature, rainfall amounts and distribution. Thirty-one CSAP were identified in the area, and only 11 were known by more than 50% of farmers. Out of the 12 selected CSAP for the assessment of adoption and evaluation, seven (7) were used by more than 50% of those who knew them. Farmers agreed with the statements that the evaluated practices improved farm productivity and adaptation to climate change but did not mitigate climate change. Ethnic group and education level were the two major factors that significantly determined the use of the evaluated CSAP.",About Sufficiency
Does Decentralized and Voluntary Commitment Reduce Deforestation? The Effects of Programa Municipios Verdes,"One-third of total CO2 emissions from deforestation in the 2000s took place in the Amazon region, in Brazil. This paper examines the effectiveness of a locally-led policy-the Green Municipalities Programme-in curbing illegal deforestation in the Para state, part of the legal Amazon. We combine a regression discontinuity (RD) design and a 10-year high-resolution spatial dataset (1,781,122 pixels covering 162,242 km(2)) to evaluate the programme's impact. Evidence suggests that municipalities reduced deforestation only 4 years after joining the programme at about 0.01 km(2) within the optional bandwidth (10 km). The effect comes mainly from municipalities traditionally with lower deforestation rates. This effect represents avoidance of 0.02 MtCO(2)/year released to the atmosphere, or USD 1.7 million per year of avoided damage. Since Brazil has committed through its NDC to eliminate deforestation in the Amazon by 2030, decentralized programmes focusing on indirect benefits appear to be effective only in the long run, serving as a ""bonus"" to support regions with relatively higher levels of forest cover.",About Sufficiency
Use of bio-based polymers in agricultural exclusion nets: A perspective,"The use of exclusion netting as an Integrated Pest Management technique is likely to become increasingly important as a means to increasing crop yields whilst minimising pesticide use. However, the increasing use of these nets will also lead to a rise in greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural sector and pose problems related to their end-of-life disposal. Employing biopolymers made from low-carbon and renewable biomass feedstock to fabricate exclusion nets can potentially resolve these issues by merging the benefits of the two emerging technologies. Despite this, there has only been limited work on the use of biopolymer netting in agriculture. By looking at the challenges needed to be overcome for biopolymers to be widely used as a netting material, this review aims to bridge the gaps between the two fields of research. To do so, the past work done on agricultural netting is discussed, with a focus on the implemented materials and their desired properties. After this, potential candidate biopolymers for manufacturing agricultural nets are pointed out, emphasising their sustainability with respect to widely used Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) parameters, including the end-of-life treatment.

Mycotoxins and consumers' awareness: Recent progress and future challenges,"While food shortages have become an important challenge, providing safe food resources is a point of interest on a global scale. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites that are formed through various fungi species. They are mainly spread through diets such as food or beverages. About one quarter of the world's food is spoiled with mycotoxins. As this problem is not resolved, it represents a significant threat to global food security. Besides the current concerns regarding the contamination of food items by these metabolites, the lack of knowledge by consumers and their possible growth and toxin production attracted considerable attention. While globalization provides a favorite condition for some countries, food security still is challenging for most countries. There are various approaches to reducing the mycotoxigenic fungi growth and formation of mycotoxins in food, include as physical, chemical, and biological processes. The current article will focus on collecting data regarding consumers' awareness of mycotoxins.

Multicommodity international agricultural trade network equilibrium: Competition for limited production and transportation capacity under disaster scenarios with implications for food security,"The number of people affected by disasters, including man -made ones, is on the rise globally, with rising food insecurity being one of the most critical impacts. Disasters, both sudden-onset and slow-onset ones, can cause disruptions to the production and transportation of agricultural commodities. Having the tools that can quantitatively assess the changes in agricultural commodity shipment volumes and their prices under disruptions caused by disaster scenarios is of major importance. In this paper, we utilize the theory of variational inequalities as the methodology to construct a multicommodity international agricultural trade network equilibrium model, which contains novel features of capacities on the production and transportation of multiple agricultural commodities to capture competition. The model includes exchange rates and accounts for multiple routes and possibly distinct transportation modes and combinations. Theoretical results are given and an algorithm is proposed. A series of numerical examples, both illustrative and algorithmically solved ones, inspired by Russia's war on Ukraine, highlight the effects of reduced production and transportation capacities on food security in the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries of Lebanon and Egypt.

Moreover, the land suitability of the land for two plantations of the tree's oak (Quercus robur), and pine (Pinus silvestris), respectively was assessed using a parametric approach. A total of 82 soil profiles were selected to fulfill the objectives of the study. Based on the samples' PC scores, and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC, the data was divided into two clusters: Cluster I and Cluster II, which collectively account for approximately 57% and 43% of the total data, respectively.. . The findings indicated that land suitability for planting Q. robur planted identified 2.14% of the research area as highly suitable (S1), 37.98% as moderately suitable (S2), and 59.89% as not suitable (N). Furthermore, the assessment of suitability for P. silvestris indicated that 50.88% of the investigated area was classified into: S1, 48.73% as S2, and 0.39% as N, which means it is not suitable for conservation activities. The research identified that soil depth beside excessive salinity and calcium carbonate as the primary soil constraints in the area in both clusters.

"Mussel and oyster culture in Saldanha Bay, South Africa: potential for sustainable growth, development and employment creation","Worldwide declines in fish stocks have a significant impact on the livelihoods of coastal fishing communities as jobs are lost and alternative forms of employment are limited. Mariculture (marine aquaculture) is considered by governments to be a viable solution to address unemployment and poverty in such communities. In Saldanha Bay, South Africa, the growing mussel and oyster industry has considerable potential for poverty alleviation, hence food security enhancement. In the first part of this study, we examine the potential ecological carrying capacity of the Bay to produce bivalves, and estimate the impact of this on employment creation should the sector's growth potential be fully realised. This growth potential could take the sector to 10 to 28 times its current size, providing direct employment for 940 to 2,500 people in the Saldanha area. Secondly, we assess five factors that affect the sustainable growth, development and employment creation potential of small-scale mariculture in South Africa and other countries. These are state support, markets, funding, the natural environment and the local community. Participants in the sector perceive its expansion potential to be hampered by regulatory issues such as incomplete implementation of a cohesive and accessible financial support policy, slow processing of mandatory samples required to monitor product safety, poor facilitation of access to international markets, price undercutting by imports subsidized in their countries of origin, and injuriously high lease fees for water levied by the parastatal harbour authority, coupled with lack of medium- and long-term lease tenure.

Perception of climate change and coping strategies among smallholder irrigators in Zimbabwe,"IntroductionAcross sub-Sahara Africa, governments and international aid agencies are making huge investments in smallholder irrigation schemes to enhance food security, climate resilience and economic transformation in rain-fed farming systems. Unfortunately, a majority of the smallholder irrigation schemes have performed dismally on these fronts. Climate change is a major exacerbating factor to existing challenges resulting in the poor performance of the schemes. Hence, it is crucial to understand smallholder irrigators' perceptions of climate change and current adaptation strategies to co-design appropriate and acceptable adaptation strategies to address water stress in the schemes. This area had received less significant research attention. This study aims to determine the perception of climate change and coping strategies in smallholder schemes. MethodsA mixed-method research strategy was used to collect data from 317 irrigation scheme farmers in three schemes (Exchange, Insukamini, and Ruchanyu) in Midlands Province. A binary logistic regression (BLR) method was used for data analysis. ResultsThe results suggest that scheme farmers have noticed changes in temperature and rainfall patterns. Results obtained from the model show that climate change perception was mainly influenced by age, gender, location, irrigation experience, and plot size. Farmers perceived that climatic change has resulted in decreased irrigation water availability, thus leading to poor yields. This study also shows that the main adaptation strategies to water stress include improving soil moisture conservation, construction of small-scale reservoirs, water charging and trade, setting clear water use priorities, and adoption of climate-resilient and short-season crop varieties. Perception of high temperatures, long dry periods, late rainfall, increase in the frequency of drought, shortening of cold season, and shortening of rain season influence adaptation strategies adopted by scheme farmers. ConclusionThis study offered useful data for policymakers and irrigation developers to develop appropriate policies and programs to improve the sustainability of schemes given current and projected water stress in Zimbabwe and sub-Sahara Africa in general.",About Sufficiency
"The curious case of C-88: impacts of a potato variety on farmers in Yunnan, China","BackgroundLimited analysis has been conducted of the role of agricultural research in promoting Chinese agricultural growth in less-favored areas. This paper analyzes how a particular potato variety generates benefits to producers and discusses how these benefits may have contributed to poverty reduction in Yunnan province. Cooperation 88 (C88) is a high-yielding, late blight-resistant variety that was developed through a partnership between the International Potato Center and Yunnan Normal University in Kunming, China.MethodsQualitative and quantitative methods are used to analyze determinants of adoption of C88, and to estimate impacts of adoption on producer well-being. A unique farm-household database is used to document the determinants of C88 adoption and disadoption. The quantitative assessment is supplemented with a qualitative analysis of the potato value chain to understand how seed availability and concern for processing attributes contributed to and eventually constrained diffusion. Market-level information was used in an economic surplus model to quantify the substantial economic impact of C88 over 20 years since its release.ResultsC88 spread rapidly in Yunnan following its release and was widely adopted by commercially oriented farmers. Disadoption began after 2010 with limited seed availability driving the shift toward newer varieties. Farmers, however, appreciate the ease of marketing, the 15% higher yields, and late-blight resistance associated with C88 suggesting that seed constraints are countervailing the economic benefits of the variety. Total impact on Yunnan potato farmers of the variety was estimated to be around $2.5 billion for the 1996-2015 period.ConclusionsOn per-person terms among C88 growing farm households, the economic advantage of the variety is likely to have contributed to poverty reduction.

Evidence from thirty-nine sub-Saharan African countries,"Objective: The present study aimed to determine the relationship among food insecurity, social support and mental well-being in sub-Saharan Africa, a region presenting the highest prevalence of severe food insecurity and a critical scarcity of mental health care. Design: Food insecurity was measured using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). Social support was assessed using dichotomous indicators of perceived, foreign perceived, received, given, integrative and emotional support. The Negative and Positive Experience Indices (NEI and. PEI) were used as indicators of mental well-being. Multilevel mixed-effect linear models were applied to examine the associations between mental well-being and food security status, social support and their interaction, respectively, accounting for random effects at country level and covariates. Participants: Nationally representative adults surveyed through Gallup World Poll between 2014 and 2016 in thirty-nine sub-Saharan African countries (n 102 235). Results: The prevalence of severe food insecurity was 39%. The prevalence of social support ranged from 30 to 72% by type. In the pooled analysis using the adjusted model, food insecurity was dose-responsively associated with increased NEI and decreased PEI. Perceived, integrative and emotional support were associated with lower NEI and higher PEI. The differences in NEI and PEI between people with and without social support were the greatest among the most severely food insecure. Conclusions: Both food insecurity lack of social support c onstitY to sources of vulnerability to poor mental well-being. Social support appears to modify the relationship between food security and mental well-being among those most affected by food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa.",About Sufficiency

Nanotechnology in food packaging materials: role and application of nanoparticles,"Global concerns about food security, driven by rising demand, have prompted the exploration of nanotechnology as a solution to enhance food supply. This shift comes in response to the limitations of conventional technologies in meeting the ever-increasing demand for food products. Consequently, nanoparticles play a crucial role in enhancing food production, preservation, and extending shelf life by imparting exceptional properties to materials. Nanoparticles and nanostructures with attributes like expansive surface area and antimicrobial efficacy, are versatile in both traditional packaging and integration into biopolymer matrices. These distinctive qualities contribute to their extensive use in various food sector applications. Hence, this review explores the physicochemical properties, functions, and biological aspects of nanoparticles in the context of food packaging. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of nanoparticles with different biopolymers, alongside its different potential applications such as food shelf-life extenders, antimicrobial agents and as nanomaterials for developing smart packaging systems were summarily explored. While the ongoing exploration of this research area is evident, our review highlights the substantial potential of nanomaterials to emerge as a viable choice for food packaging if the challenges regarding toxicity are carefully and effectively modulated.

Nature-based solutions for improving food security: A systematic global review,"Nature-based solutions (NBS) have been promoted as a holistic way to solve a variety of societal issues while benefiting biodiversity at the same time. To date, applications of NBS approaches that help ensure food security have yet been systematically reviewed. In this paper, we critically review the specific NBS for food security, highlighting their limitations, to provide recommendations that promote their applications for improving global food security. We accessed and evaluated publications on four different scholastic databases, and our systematic review of relevant materials indicated that many NBS approaches can be applied to enhance food security dimensions individually or together. However, there is a strong bias towards food availability, and not enough research has been done to link NBS with improvements in food access and utilization. Over 80 % of the reviewed papers were of short-term studies or without specific time- frames, and 25 % offered no information on the economic effectiveness of NBS. Environmental benefits of NBS were explicitly described in about 60 % of these papers, and biodiversity enhancement was measured in only about 10 %. We, therefore, recommend future applications of NBS to safeguard food security be shifted to food access and utilization with careful consultation with local communities to address their specific context, using indicators that are easily measured and managed. Systematic monitoring regimes and robust and diversified financial support systems are also equally important in efforts to successfully implement NBS. Moreover, environmental and societal benefits, especially water productivity and biodiversity, must be incorporated into the planning and design of NBS.",About Sufficiency
Genotype by environment interaction for milk production traits between organic and conventional dairy cattle production in the Netherlands,"Estimates of genetic parameters for organic dairy farming have not been published previously, and neither is information available on the magnitude of genotype by environment interaction ( G x E) between organic and conventional farming. However, organic farming is growing worldwide and basic information about genetic parameters is needed for future breeding strategies for organic dairy farming. The goal of this study was to estimate heritabilities of milk production traits under organic farming conditions and to estimate the magnitude of G x E between organic and conventional dairy farming. For this purpose, production records of first-parity Holstein heifers were used. Heritabilities of milk, fat and protein yield, and somatic cell score (SCS) were higher under organic farming conditions. For percentages of fat and protein, heritabilities of organic and conventional production were very similar. Genetic correlations between preorganic and organic, and organic and conventional milk production were 0.79 and 0.80, respectively. For fat yield, these correlations were 0.86 and 0.88, and for protein yield, these were 0.78 and 0.71, respectively. Our findings indicate that moderate G x E was present for yield traits. For percentage of fat and protein and SCS, genetic correlations between organic and conventional and preorganic production were close to unity, indicating that there was no G x E for these traits.",About Sufficiency
Assessing risks of climate variability and climate change for Indonesian rice agriculture,"El Nino events typically lead to delayed rainfall and decreased rice planting in Indonesia's main rice-growing regions, thus prolonging the hungry season and increasing the risk of annual rice deficits. Here we use a risk assessment framework to examine the potential impact of El Nino events and natural variability on rice agriculture in 2050 under conditions of climate change, with a focus on two main rice-producing areas: Java and Bali. We select a 30-day delay in monsoon onset as a threshold beyond which significant impact on the country's rice economy is likely to occur. To project the future probability of monsoon delay and changes in the annual cycle of rainfall, we use output from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR4 suite of climate models, forced by increasing greenhouse gases, and scale it to the regional level by using empirical downscaling models. Our results reveal a marked increase in the probability of a 30-day delay in monsoon onset in 2050,as a result of changes in the mean climate,from 9-18% today (depending on the region) to 30-40% at the upper tail of the distribution. Predictions of the annual cycle of precipitation suggest an increase in precipitation later in the crop year (April-June) of approximate to 10% but a substantial decrease (up to 75% at the tail) in precipitation later in the dry season (July-September). These results indicate a need for adaptation strategies in Indonesian rice agriculture, including increased investments in water storage, drought-tolerant crops, crop diversification, and early warning systems.",About Sufficiency
HIV affected households in Western Kenya experience greater food insecurity,"This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the first Millennium Village in Western Kenya. We compared the food security status of households affected by HIV/AIDS to households not affected by HIV/AIDS. We also identified coping strategies adopted by members of food insecure households. 315 Households were included in the study, consisting of 169 HIV affected households, (44 households with self-identified HIV positive adults, 80 households with orphans, and 45 households with both orphans and self-identified HIV positive adults). These households were compared to 146 HIV unaffected households. Food security status was measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale Indicator (HFIAS) guide. Coping strategies were measured using the Coping Strategies Index (CSI). HIV affected households had a significantly higher food insecurity score 11.11, compared to 9.53 in HIV unaffected households (p = 0.037). Female headed households had the worst food security, regardless of household type. There were also significant difference in the coping strategies scores between HIV affected (64.48) and unaffected households (50.31) (p = 0.004). HIV affected households were associated with more severe coping strategies. The food security of HIV affected households is compromised by a variety of factors including the synergy generated by hosting a HIV positive family member and orphans. The gender of the household head is also an important consideration. Households headed by women tend to be more vulnerable, predisposing households to greater food insecurity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"New green revolution in Ghana: perceived benefits, challenges, and implications for the environment","This paper reflects on Africa's new green revolution (NGR) movement by drawing data from Ghana as an illustrative case to assess the benefits and challenges of NGR and discuss the long-term environmental implications of NGR interventions. We draw insights from agrarian change theory to understand the complexity of local, national, and international factors that interact to produce changes in agricultural systems that affect smallholder farmers in poor settings. Data were collected using qualitative methods based on the lived experiences of farmers and analyzed to understand farmers' perspectives. We identified increased yield and income levels as crucial benefits of the NGR. Politicization and excessive bureaucracy resulting in perennial delays in the delivery of inputs emerged as critical challenges to the NGR. These findings have implications for the social environment (including the transformation of traditional gender roles and the erosion of traditional knowledge systems) and the physical environment (including forest degradation and the depletion of beneficial soil microbial organisms), which may erode short-term gains of the NGR and compromise broader scale environmental sustainability goals. Critical steps are needed toward consolidating actors and innovations for sustainable agriculture in Africa if global ecological management and poverty reduction objectives are to be achieved consistently with the principles of environmental sustainability.",About Sufficiency
"New high nature value map of Estonian agricultural land: Application of an expert system to integrate biodiversity, landscape and land use management indicators","This paper describes the national databases and methods that have been used to construct a new expert system-based tool to map High Nature Value (HNV) agricultural land in Estonia. Twenty appropriate indicators from four thematic groups, i.e., land use management, nature conservation, landscape diversity and inherent natural quality, were selected on the basis of use in the literature, the requirement of consistent national datasets and statistical analysis. Each variable was divided into four appropriate classes to produce indicator values according to expert judgement. These classes were added together for each 1 km square to provide a single score to develop an expert system to define HNV. A statistical analysis showed there are few moderate correlations between the individual indicators, suggesting that their selection was sound. The HNV scores for all 1 km squares with agricultural land in Estonia exhibit a normal distribution. The top and bottom 10% of the 1 km squares (3707 and 3501 squares, respectively) were identified in order to investigate the structure of the data further. The former is termed Exceptionally High HNV (EHNV) and the latter Relatively Low HNV (RLNV), while the intermediate class is termed Median HNV (MHNV). The distribution of these groups in Estonia shows readily identifiable patterns linked to known biodiversity ""hot spots"". A cluster analysis within the EHNV squares produced three classes whose distribution and composition are described to demonstrate the detailed character of Estonian agricultural land with high biodiversity. The methodology is adaptable to other countries that have extensive relevant data bases. The map will be valuable for agricultural policy makers to identify zones with high biodiversity where agri-environment schemes can be targeted. Other stakeholders could also direct development away from EHNV 1 km squares. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Non-invasive identification of combined salinity stress and stalk rot disease caused by Colletotrichum graminicola in maize using Raman spectroscopy,"Food security is an emerging problem that is faced by our civilization. There are millions of people around the world suffering from various kinds of malnutrition. The number of people that starve will only increase considering the continuous growth of the world's population. The problem of food security can be addressed by timely detection and identification biotic and abiotic stresses in plants that drastically reduce the crop yield. A growing body of evidence suggests that Raman spectroscopy (RS), an emerging analytical technique, can be used for the confirmatory and non-invasive diagnostics of plant stresses. However, it remains unclear whether RS can efficiently disentangle biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as detect both of them simultaneously in plants. In this work, we modeled a stalk rot disease in corn by inoculating the plant stalks with Colletotrichum graminicola. In parallel, we subjected plants to salt stress, as well as challenging plants with both stalk rot disease and salinity stress simultaneously. After the stresses were introduced, Raman spectra were collected from the stalks to reveal stress-specific changes in the plant biochemistry. We found that RS was able to differentiate between stalk rot disease and salinity stresses with 100% accuracy, as well as predict presence of both of those stresses in plants on early and late stages. These results demonstrate that RS is a robust and reliable approach that can be used for confirmatory, non-destructive and label-free diagnostics of biotic and abiotic stresses in plants.",About Sufficiency
Greenhouse gases and ammonia emissions from organic mixed crop-dairy systems: a critical review of mitigation options,"Dairy production systems represent a significant source of air pollutants such as greenhouse gases (GHG), that increase global warming, and ammonia (NH3), that leads to eutrophication and acidification of natural ecosystems. Greenhouse gases and ammonia are emitted both by conventional and organic dairy systems. Several studies have already been conducted to design practices that reduce greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions from dairy systems. However, those studies did not consider options specifically applied to organic farming, as well as the multiple trade-offs occurring between these air pollutants. This article reviews agricultural practices that mitigate greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions. Those practices can be applied to the most common organic dairy systems in northern Europe such as organic mixed crop-dairy systems. The following major points of mitigation options for animal production, crop production and grasslands are discussed. Animal production: the most promising options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the livestock management level involve either the improvement of animal production through dietary changes and genetic improvement or the reduction of the replacement rate. The control of the protein intake of animals is an effective means to reduce gaseous emissions of nitrogen, but it is difficult to implement in organic dairy farming systems. Considering the manure handling chain, mitigation options involve housing, storage and application. For housing, an increase in the amounts of straw used for bedding reduces NH3 emissions, while the limitation of CH4 emissions from deep litter is achieved by avoiding anaerobic conditions. During the storage of solid manure, composting could be an efficient mitigation option, depending on its management. Addition of straw to solid manure was shown to reduce CH4 and N2O emissions from the manure heaps. During the storage of liquid manure, emptying the slurry store before late spring is an efficient mitigation option to limit both CH4 and NH3 emissions. Addition of a wooden cover also reduces these emissions more efficiently than a natural surface crust alone, but may increase N2O emissions. Anaerobic digestion is the most promising way to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions from storage and land spreading, without increasing NH3 emissions. At the application stage, NH3 emissions may be reduced by spreading manure during the coolest part of the day, incorporating it quickly and in narrow bands. Crop production: the mitigation options for crop production focus on limiting CO2 and N2O emissions. The introduction of perennial crops or temporary leys of longer duration are promising options to limit CO2 emissions by storing carbon in plants or soils. Reduced tillage or no tillage as well as the incorporation of crop residues also favour carbon sequestration in soils, but these practices may enhance N2O emissions. Besides, the improvement of crop N-use efficiency through effective management of manure and slurry, by growing catch crops or by delaying the ploughing of leys, is of prime importance to reduce N2O emissions. Grassland: concerning grassland and grazing management, permanent conversion from arable to grassland provides high soil carbon sequestration while increasing or decreasing the livestock density seems not to be an appropriate mitigation option. From the study of the multiple interrelations btween gases and between farm compartments, the following mitigation options are advised for organic mixed crop-dairy systems: (1) actions for increasing energy efficiency or fuel savings because they are beneficial in any case, (2) techniques improving efficiency of N management at field and farm levels because they affect not only N2O and NH3 emissions, but also nitrate leaching, and (3) biogas production through anaerobic digestion of manure because it is a promising efficient method to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, even if the profitability of this expensive investment needs to be carefully studied. Finally, the way the farmer implements the mitigation options, i.e. his practices, will be a determining factor in the reduction of greenhouse gas and NH3 emissions.",About Sufficiency
Nutrient capture and sustainable yield maximized by a gear modification in artisanal fishing traps,"Coral reef artisanal fisheries are an important source of nutrition and economic wellbeing for coastal communities, but their management is subject to conflicts and tradeoffs between short-term food security benefits and long-term ecological function. One potential tradeoff is between nutrient capture and fish yields, where targeting small, nutrient-dense species may be more valuable for food security than maximizing fish yields, which is more closely aligned with supporting biodiversity and ecological function. We explored these potential tradeoffs by comparing two similar gears: traditional African basket traps and traps modified with an escape gap. Traps without escape gaps captured a higher frequency of fish with body sizes below their estimated lengths at maximum sustainable yield than gated traps. Estimates of nutrient yields for six micronutrients among the 208 captured species indicated high hump-shaped relationships for gated traps and low and linear positive relationships for traditional traps. Maximum nutrients in gated traps frequently corresponded to body sizes at maximum sustainable yield. Daily capture rates of nutrients were above daily needs more often in gated than traditional traps, but calcium values were low in both trap designs. Gated traps were more likely to capture species with unique and potentially important functional traits, including browsing herbivores, which could have negative effects on ecological functions and reef recovery. However, gated traps also catch fewer immature fish and fewer predators. Our results indicate that nutrient yields can be maximized while using a gear that captures larger and more sustainable body sizes in coral reef artisanal fisheries. Preferential targeting of nutrient-dense fishes is only one of many metrics for evaluating a nutrition-centered management strategy and may only be a management target in specific contexts.",About Sufficiency
Soil aggregate characteristics and organic carbon concentration after 45 annual applications of manure and inorganic fertilizer,"Soil management practices that increase soil carbon sequestration can improve soil quality and reduce agricultural contribution to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The long-term (45 years) effect of applications of manure (FYM) and inorganic (NPK) fertilizers on soil aggregate characteristics and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was studied in surface soil of a Typic Haplustalf sandy loam. Soils from four treatments: inorganic fertilizer in combination with farmyard manure (FYM + NPK), fertilizer only (NPK), farmyard manure only (FYM) and a control receiving neither NPK nor FYM were studied. Results indicate that long-term application of manure with or without NPK improved aggregate stability by increasing mean weight diameter (MWD) of dry aggregate and fraction of dry aggregate > 2.0 mm. Higher values of MWD were also recorded in the water-stable aggregate size distributions for soils amended with either FYM or NPK. Soils amended with FYM + NPK sequestered more SOC than all other treatments. There was a low, but significant positive correlation between MWD of dry aggregates and SOC. Highest values of SOC were recorded in the > 2.0 mm aggregate fractions. This tendency towards greater SOC concentration for > 2.0 mm dry aggregate is suggestive of the effectiveness of this aggregate size range to sequester SOC in savanna Alfisols. These results demonstrate that continuous application of soil amendments like FYM and NPK over a long-term promotes soil aggregate stability and long-term SOC sequestration. Hence, for sustainable production in savanna Alfisols, there is a need to design policies that will promote soil aggregate stability and long-term carbon sequestration under continuous cultivation. Such policies must give attention to soil management practices that maintain higher level of SOC. Here, FYM with or without NPK was essential to increase stability of dry aggregates and SOC sequestration. However, the NPK amended soils possess higher fraction of water-stable aggregates.",About Sufficiency
Climate change mitigation potential of tree crop and alley farming practices in Africa,"This paper examines tree crop farming and alley farming practices in Africa and the impact of such practices on carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation.

Optimizing nitrogen management in the food system for sustainable development: a case study of Quzhou County,"Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for food production. The rapid increase in population requires high inputs of N to meet the growing food demand. If not managed well, the substantial loss of N from the food system has multiple impacts on grain yield, air and water pollution, and the economic benefits of agricultural. Multi -objective (food security, environmental sustainability and economic sustainability) synergistic consideration of N management in the food system is still lacking. This study employed strategies for optimizing N management in the food system, using Quzhou County as a typical example on the North China Plain. Firstly, a food chain approach was adopted to understand drivers and reasons behind N losses from the food system. Secondly, a top -down approach was used to define multi -objective N management, taking into consideration food security, environmental sustainability and economic sustainability. Multi -objective N management aims to reduce N losses to the environment and increase N use efficiencies, while simultaneously increasing yields and economic benefits. Thirdly, 3R (reduce -retain -recycle) N management strategies were identified for specific crops and animals through a bottom -up approach and then analyzed the potential of these strategies to achieve the multi -objectives. Finally, there is a discussion of how to engage different stakeholders to promote the technologies implementation.

Optimizing Rice Field Mapping in the Northern Region of China: An Asynchronous Flooding Signal and Object-Based Method,"Accurate delineation of paddy fields holds importance in ensuring food security, efficient water resource management, and precise evaluation of greenhouse gas emissions. Here we propose an innovative approach, the asynchronous flooding and object-based (AF-OB) model, aimed at optimizing phenology-based paddy field mapping. The AF-OB model capitalizes on the asynchronous flooding phenomenon observed between paddy fields and nonpaddy fields, along with the seasonal variations in the normalized difference vegetation index.

Optimizing water and nitrogen productivity of wheat and triticale across diverse production environments to improve the sustainability of baked products,"Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major global commodity and the primary source for baked products in agri-food supply chains. Consumers are increasingly demanding more nutritious food products with less environmental degradation, particularly related to water and fertilizer nitrogen (N) inputs. While triticale (x Triticosecale) is often referenced as having superior abiotic stress tolerance compared to wheat, few studies have compared crop productivity and resource use efficiencies under a range of N-and water-limited conditions. Because previous work has shown that blending wheat with triticale in a 40:60 ratio can yield acceptable and more nutritious baked products, we tested the hypothesis that increasing the use of triticale grain in the baking supply chain would reduce the environmental footprint for water and N fertilizer use. Using a dataset comprised of 37 site-years encompassing normal and stress-induced environments in California, we assessed yield, yield stability, and the efficiency of water and fertilizer N use for 67 and 17 commercial varieties of wheat and triticale, respectively. By identifying environments that favor one crop type over the other, we then quantified the sustainability implications of producing a mixed triticale-wheat flour at the regional scale. Results indicate that triticale outyielded wheat by 11% (p < 0.05) and 19% (p < 0.05) under average and N-limited conditions, respectively. However, wheat was 3% (p < 0.05) more productive in water-limited environments. Overall, triticale had greater yield stability and produced more grain per unit of water and N fertilizer inputs, especially in high-yielding environments. We estimate these differences could translate to regional N fertilizer savings (up to 555 Mg N or 166 CO2-eq kg ha(-1)) in a 40:60 blending scenario when wheat is sourced from water-limited and low-yielding fields and triticale from N-limited and high-yielding areas. Results suggest that optimizing the agronomic and environmental benefits of triticale would increase the overall resource use efficiency and sustainability of the agri-food system, although such a transition would require fundamental changes to the current system spanning producers, processors, and consumers.",About Sufficiency

Oxidation of methane from manure storages in soils,"Dutch methane emissions from manure treatment and storage are estimated to be 115 Gg CH4, which is about 1.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions. A possible option to reduce methane emissions from manure storages is to feed emissions into the soil next to the storage, where it is oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria, comparable to the way methane is oxidized in top-layers of landfills. A feasibility study is performed to evaluate the technical and economic viability of the method. An annual average methane oxidizing capacity of about 23 g m2 h1 seems to be feasible in sandy or loamy soils, without major modifications. A single manure storage will require a few 100m2 of soil to abate 70% or more of its methane. The system seems to be economically feasible and cost-effective.

Effects of Vermicompost on Soil and Plant Health and Promoting Sustainable Agriculture,"This review highlights the potential of vermicompost and its derived products as sustainable and eco-friendly solutions for enhancing production and pest management in grain crops. It assesses their impact comprehensively on crops such as maize, wheat, barley, rice, and pearl millet. Vermicompost improves soil quality, increases nutrient availability, boosts crop productivity, and enhances pest and disease tolerance. It acts as an organic fertilizer, enriching the soil with essential nutrients, humic acids, growth-regulating hormones, and enzymes, improving plant nutrition, photosynthesis, and overall crop quality. Furthermore, vermicompost shows promise in mitigating soil degradation and sequestering organic carbon while demonstrating the potential for pest management, including effectiveness against pests like fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). This review emphasizes the importance of integrated nutrient management and proper application strategies to maximize the benefits of vermicompost in grain crops. Factors such as the form and timing of application, efficacy against specific pests, and economic viability for different farming scales are discussed. Understanding these factors is crucial for successfully implementing and adopting vermicompost-based pest management strategies in grain crops. This review also explores the potential of vermicomposting as an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution to remediate organic contaminants, emerging contaminants, personal-care and pharmaceutical products, and microplastics. The review further identifies knowledge gaps and highlights the need for future studies to effectively utilize vermicompost and its derived products in cereal production for sustainable agriculture, contributing to global food security.",About Sufficiency
Vulnerability to Food Poverty in Nigeria,"Economists have in recent times recognized that a household's sense of well-being depends not just on its average income or expenditure but on the risk it faces as well. Vulnerability is thus a very crucial issue in welfare analysis. This study estimated and analysed the magnitude of vulnerability to food poverty based on data from the 2004 Nigeria Living Standard Survey (NLSS) obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics. The three-step Feasible Generalized Least Squares (3FGLS) procedure was employed in estimating the extent of vulnerability to food poverty in Nigeria. The results show that 61.68 per cent of Nigerians were vulnerable to food poverty; the incidence of vulnerability to food poverty varied significantly across zones and between the urban and rural sectors; and was highest in the South West zone (68.32 per cent) and lowest in North East zone (50.19 per cent); and it is more in the urban sector (64.61 per cent) than in the rural (59.37 per cent). It is evident that the magnitude of vulnerability to food poverty is very high. Thus, policies that will enhance people's access to food should be adopted and targeted transfers of subsidized basic food items should be used to sufficiently reduce vulnerability to food poverty in the country.",About Sufficiency
Comparing the effects of growing conditions on simulated Ethiopian tef and wheat yields,"Tef and wheat are staple grains in Ethiopia and are an important part of Ethiopian food security. The DSSAT NWheat and DSSAT Tef models were used to examine the effects of nitrogen fertilizer, planting date, and atmospheric CO2 on tef and wheat grain yields across four locations in Ethiopia and a 30-year time period. Observed wheat yields were consistently higher than observed tef yields, but the models showed that tef could outproduce wheat in some low yielding scenarios. Wheat yields were more responsive to N fertilizer than tef, due to a higher harvest index causing more of the additional biomass to be allocated to grain yields. Frequently, high rainfall increased N leaching, exacerbated N stress, and reduced yields for both crops. Early planting was often detrimental to yields, except for regions and years with terminal drought and heat stress. With continuously increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, wheat, as a C3 crop, will further outperform tef, a C4 crop, in the future, as long as N is not limiting. Breeding for lodging resistance and a higher harvest index could significantly improve future tef yields, while higher N applications and the use of split fertilizer applications to avoid leaching would improve both tef and wheat yields. As wheat has a higher N response than tef, is more responsive to future elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, and is generally higher yielding, wheat could add more to food security in Ethiopia. However, under low input, low yielding conditions, growing tef will likely remain the preferred cereal in Ethiopia due to its higher cultural, nutritional and economic value.",About Sufficiency
CONSIDERATIONS ON COVID 19 IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,"The COVID 19 pandemic is one of the greatest threats of the 21st century that disturbed whole human's life and all sectors of the global economy. Due to highly infectious and spreading capacity of SARS-CoV-2 the governments took unprecedented measures worldwide with a great impact on the most vulnerable groups (people affected by chronically hunger, malnourished children and small farmers) and sectors. Agriculture is the most important economic sector that cares the responsibility for food security and human development. The present paper identifies and synthetize relevant literature to provide an integrated overview of the current state-of-knowledge on the economic impact of COVID 19 pandemic on agriculture and food security, including also forward-looking statements on future measures to mitigate the effects on crop production, food demand, agricultural products supply, inputs supply, agricultural products market, farmers' income and rural poverty. The study emphasizes that due to the mobility restrictions, decline in international trade, reduced purchasing power, disturbance in food production and food processing, food insecurity may arise affecting especially the small farmers from the regions already affected by poverty, climate change and conflicts. Therefore, the governments and international organizations should enforce the measures to control the pandemic, with minimum economic losses, without disturbing the food supply chain and re-enforcing the food security of their citizens.",About Sufficiency
Inequality of access in irrigation systems of the mid-hills of Nepal,"Access to, and control over, water for irrigation is one of the most important factors for increasing agricultural productivity, thereby affecting household food security and levels of poverty in developing countries. However, investments in the irrigation sector have often failed to consider equity aspects of irrigation interventions. Using data from 199 households from three irrigation systems in the mid-hills of Nepal, we analyse access and control of water in different levels of socio-economic heterogeneities. The results demonstrate that efforts to improve livelihoods of the rural poor should give due consideration to the distributional aspects of irrigation interventions, with authority for allocating the level of access to irrigation water given to the farmers throughout the system.",About Sufficiency
"Pattern of land-use and land cover changes in Driefontein Grassland Important Bird Area, Zimbabwe","We assessed land cover and land use change in Driefontein Grasslands Important Bird Area (Driefontein IBA), Zimbabwe, after the land reforms that took place in 2000, using remotely sensed satellite land cover images of 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010. A drive transect was done for ground truthing. Data were analysed spatially in a Geographical Information System environment. Changes in land cover and land use proportions were recorded from 1995 to 2010 throughout the Driefontein IBA. The land cover classes of grassland and wetland showed a decrease, whereas land area under cultivation increased during 1995-2010. However, the woodland area marginally remained constant over the same time. We concluded that changes in land cover in the study area were largely driven by land use change, i.e., increase in cultivation, following the resettlement of people within the Driefontein IBA. It is likely that with increasing human population the natural habitat of the study area will be degraded further, negatively impacting key sensitive habitats such as wetlands, bird species, and other biodiversity. Threats to birds and wetlands habitats are also threats to human livelihoods because people in this semi-arid area depend on wetland ecosystem services for their survival. The study recommends continuous monitoring of Driefontein IBA for conservation of birds and their habitats.",About Sufficiency
Economic and employment implications of a carbon market for integrated farm forestry and biodiverse environmental plantings,"Many studies have predicted, at a national scale, the economic viability of new forestry plantings to contribute to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia's cleared agricultural lands. Such predictions are highly uncertain given: (i) differences in site quality, management regimes and planting geometries (belt versus block configurations) result in rates of sequestration that are highly variable at regional scales and (ii) uncertainties in carbon accounting methods in future carbon markets. Here we examined the economics of three case studies (two of farm forestry and one of biodiverse environmental plantings) to address these issues. There was significant variation in economic viability both between and within case studies (average coefficient of variation of 39%) as a result of differences in site quality, management regime and planting geometries. We conclude that if carbon offset investment targets marginal land (i.e. areas of farms of lowest productivity), carbon prices required for economic viability are <$18t CO2-e, even at a relatively high discount rate of 8%. Although regional employment generated per hectare tends to be less than many existing agricultural enterprises, any jobs generated from use of this low productivity land for carbon forestry would be additional. Economic viability was generally greatest for 3-4 row belt farm forestry plantings because of increased growth, particularly in areas of relatively high rainfall. Supplementary payments may therefore be needed to make biodiverse environmental plantings competitive in areas of lower rainfall and thus less profitability.

"Peasant family farming multifunctionality index (PFFMI): Case study, municipality of Calpan, Puebla","Peasant farming systems are multifunctional, since their culture-based structure generates different environmental, social and economic functions. However, agricultural modernization and the change from agricultural to urban zones have caused the loss of multifunctionality in these systems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to generate a peasant family farming multifunctionality index for the municipality of Calpan, Puebla. A survey was conducted to gather information and the instrument was a questionnaire applied to a sample of 81 producers. A peasant family farming multifunctionality index (PFFMI) was generated, made up of four fields: sociocultural, environmental, economic, and territorial; four general functions, 12 specific ones, and 17 indicators. The results show a PFFMI of 72.61, corresponding to category IV, medium high, with outstanding functions such as: conservation of knowledge, maintenance of agricultural biodiversity, conservation of agroecological practices, consolidation of food security, promotion of job generation, support of landscapes configurations, and rootedness of the territory.

Soil carbon sequestration strategies with alternative tillage and nitrogen sources under risk,"This study examines the economic potential of using either no-tillage or conventional tillage with either commercial nitrogen or cattle manure to sequester soil in continuous corn production. This research uses stochastic efficiency with respect to a function to determine the preferred production systems under various risk preferences and utility-weighted certainty equivalent risk premiums to determine the carbon credit values needed to motivate adoption of systems, which sequester higher levels of carbon. The results indicate that no-tillage and cattle manure increase carbon sequestration. Carbon credits or government program incentives are not required to entice risk-averse managers to use no-tillage, but are required to encourage manure use as a means of sequestering additional carbon even at historically high nitrogen prices. New environmental rules for confined animal feeding operations may increase the demand for land to apply manure as a primary nutrient source and participation in the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, Conservation Security Program, and a carbon credit market to obtain payments to offset some or all of the costs of manure application.",About Sufficiency
Perception of product sustainability: The case of processed tomatoes - A qualitative study in Germany,"One way to slow down climate change is to help consumers to make more sustainable decisions. The food system accounts for up to one third of greenhouse gas emissions. To ensure consumers can make more sustainable food choices they need to have the necessary knowledge to do so. But consumer perception of the sustainability of food product characteristics might differ from results of greenhouse gas emissions or other environmental impacts in a life-cycle assessments of food products. The aspects of sustainability that are estimated incorrect by consumers need to be identified, so that the necessary knowledge to make more sustainable choices can be provided. To gain insights into consumer perception of the sustainability of food product characteristics, using the example of processed tomatoes, we conducted a qualitative study in Germany using focus group discussion. Ten young consumers, aged between 18 and 37, participated. Millennials and consumers from Generation Z were selected as they are considered to be crucial to a change towards more sustainable food production in the future. The focus group discussion was analyzed using the qualitative summarizing content analysis according to Mayring. The main findings indicate that consumers overestimate the sustainability of glass packaging and regional production. In contrast, consumers underestimate the emissions from heated greenhouses and the sustainability of composite boards and plastic packaging. The study shows that consumers are misinformed regarding sustainability of food product characteristics, such as production systems, packaging, and origin and that there is a need to better inform consumers, so that they have the knowledge to make more sustainable food choices.",About Sufficiency
Perception of the environmental impacts of current and alternative modes of pig production by stakeholder groups,"The current industrial pig production model is in crisis, due to its association with environmental pollution, doubtful product quality and lack of animal well-being. In Bretagne (France), a region of intensive pig production, a survey of seven stakeholder groups concerned with pig production was conducted, as part of a research programme dedicated to the assessment of the environmental impact of different modes of pig production. A very large majority of pig. producers (93%) and their suppliers (100%) considers pig farms as an asset for the region, whereas a majority of scientists (58%), activists (78%) and consumers (54%) sees it as a handicap. Differences among stakeholder groups are minor with respect to the perceived importance of environmental and social issues. Stakeholders agree on the relative level of responsibility of pig farms with respect to specific problems. For all groups unpleasant odours and water quality come first with respect to responsibility, for most groups soil quality comes second, followed by product safety and air quality. For a future improved mode of pig production, 76% of pig producers and their suppliers prefer to adapt the current model, for all other groups the majority prefers an alternative model. While pig producers and their suppliers prefer a slurry-based housing system, all other groups prefer a straw-based system. Pig producers see the slurry-based system as technically superior and associate the straw-based system with poor working conditions, whereas consumers associate the slurry-based system in the first place with poor water quality and associate the straw-based system with less pollution. These results will be of use in the research programme on the environmental impact of modes of pig production, as they indicate the environmental impacts to be considered and their relative importance. The results will also help in deciding which options should be assessed. It is concluded that the poor image of the current pig production model and its production practices with consumers does not seem compatible with a sustainable demand for pork products.

"Perennial vegetables: A neglected resource for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and nutrition","Perennial vegetables are a neglected and underutilized class of crops with potential to address 21(st) century challenges. They represent 33-56% of cultivated vegetable species, and occupy 6% of world vegetable cropland. Despite their distinct relevance to climate change mitigation and nutritional security, perennial vegetables receive little attention in the scientific literature. Compared to widely grown and marketed vegetable crops, many perennial vegetables show higher levels of key nutrients needed to address deficiencies. Trees with edible leaves are the group of vegetables with the highest levels of these key nutrients. Individual ""multi-nutrient"" species are identified with very high levels of multiple nutrients for addressing deficiencies. This paper reports on the synthesis and meta-analysis of a heretofore fragmented global literature on 613 cultivated perennial vegetables, representing 107 botanical families from every inhabited continent, in order to characterize the extent and potential of this class of crops. Carbon sequestration potential from new adoption of perennial vegetables is estimated at 22.7-280.6 MMT CO2-eq/yr on 4.6-26.4 Mha by 2050.",About Sufficiency
The Sustainable Cultivation of Mexican Nontoxic Jatropha Curcas to Produce Biodiesel and Food in Marginal Rural Lands,"The objective of this study is to identify Mexican nontoxic ecotypes of Jatropha curcas with potential for a sustainable agriculture practice to produce biodiesel and food products through a methodology and criteria of sustainability. In a rural region of Morelos state in central Mexico, nine Mexican ecotypes of Jatropha curcas were evaluated in an experimental plantation with minimal water resources and fertilization. The experimental trial was assessed in terms of (1) toxicity, (2) growth and survival of the plants, (3) yield of seed, (4) residual biomass production, (5) oil characteristics for biodiesel production, (6) nutrimental properties of the seeds, and (7) changes in the chemical properties of the soil. Finally, two outstanding nontoxic ecotypes were identified as the most suitable for the establishment of Jatropha curcas crops to produce biodiesel and, at the same time, for food products using the de-oiled endosperm cake, for energy production from the residual biomass and for improvement of soil properties in marginal lands of rural regions of Morelos state.",About Sufficiency
Persistent soil carbon enhanced in Mollisols by well- managed grasslands but not annual grain or dairy forage cropping systems,"Intensive crop production on grassland-derived Mollisols has liberated massive amounts of carbon (C) to the atmosphere. Whether minimizing soil disturbance, diversifying crop rotations, or re-establishing perennial grasslands and integrating livestock can slow or reverse this trend remains highly uncertain. We investigated how these management practices affected soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual and distribution between particulate (POM) and mineral-associated (MAOM) organic matter in a 29-y-old field experiment in the North Central United States and assessed how soil microbial traits were related to these changes. Compared to conventional continuous maize monocropping with annual tillage, systems with reduced tillage, diversified crop rotations with cover crops and legumes, or manure addition did not increase total SOC storage or MAOM-C, whereas perennial pastures managed with rotational grazing accumulated more SOC and MAOM-C (18 to 29% higher) than all annual cropping systems after 29 y of management. These results align with a meta-analysis of data from published studies comparing the efficacy of soil health management practices in annual cropping systems on Mollisols worldwide. Incorporating legumes and manure into annual cropping systems enhanced POM-C, microbial biomass, and microbial C-use efficiency but did not significantly increase microbial necromass accumulation, MAOM-C, or total SOC storage. Diverse, rotationally grazed pasture management has the potential to increase persistent soil C on Mollisols, highlighting the key role of well-managed grasslands in climate-smart agriculture.",About Sufficiency
Pesticides in Agricultural Soils: Major Findings from Various Monitoring Campaigns in Switzerland,"Synthetic pesticides are widely applied in modern agriculture, where they are used against diseases, pests, and weeds to secure crop yield and quality. However, their intensive application has led to widespread contamination of the environment, including soils. Due to their inherent toxicity, they might pose a risk to soil health by causing harm to non-target organisms and disrupting ecosystem services in both agricultural and other exposed soils. Following the Swiss National Action Plan on the reduction of pesticide risks, Agroscope has conducted several soil monitoring studies that are briefly presented here. All of them resort to different multi-residue trace analytical approaches to simultaneously quantify up to about 150 modern pesticides by either accelerated solvent, or Quick, Easy, Cheap, Efficient, Rugged, Safe (QuEChERS) extraction, followed by separation and detection with liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. While partly still in progress, our investigations led to the following major findings thus far: Multiple pesticides are commonly present in soils, with individual concentrations in agricultural soils often reaching up to a few tens of mu g/kg. Pesticide occurrence and concentrations in agricultural soils primarily depend on land use, land use history and cultivated crops. Pesticides can prevail much longer than predicted by their half-lives and were found in soils even decades after conversion from conventional to organic farming. Corresponding residual fractions can be in the order of a few percent of the originally applied amounts. We further found negative associations of pesticide residues with the abundance of beneficial soil life, underpinning their potential risk to the fertility of agricultural soils. Traces of pesticides are also detected in soils to which they were never applied, indicating contamination, e.g. via spray drift or atmospheric deposition. These results confirm the general notion of both scientists and legislators that prospective risk assessments (RA; as executed during registration and use authorization) should be confirmed and adjusted by retrospective RA (e.g. by environmental monitoring studies of currently used compounds) to jointly lead to an overall reduced environmental risk of pesticides.",About Sufficiency
The Impact of Village Savings and Loan Associations as a Financial and Climate Resilience Strategy for Mitigating Food Insecurity in Northern Ghana,"In semi-arid Northern Ghana, smallholder farmers face food insecurity and financial risk due to climate change. In response, the Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) model, a community-led microfinance model, has emerged as a promising finance and climate resilience strategy. VSLAs offer savings, loans, and other financial services to help smallholder farmers cope with climate risks. In northern Ghana, where formal financial banking is limited, VSLAs serve as vital financial resources for smallholder farmers. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how VSLAs can bridge financial inclusion and climate resilience strategies to address food insecurity. From a sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) perspective, we utilized data from a cross-sectional survey of 517 smallholder farmers in northern Ghana's Upper West Region to investigate how VSLAs relate to food insecurity. Results from an ordered logistic regression show that households with membership in a VSLA were less likely to experience severe food insecurity (OR = 0.437, p < 0.01). In addition, households that reported good resilience, owned land, had higher wealth, were female-headed, and made financial decisions jointly were less likely to experience severe food insecurity. Also, spending time accessing the market increases the risk of severe food insecurity. Despite the challenges of the VSLA model, these findings highlight VSLAs' potential to mitigate food insecurity and serve as a financially resilient and climate-resilient strategy in resource-poor contexts like the UWR and similar areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. VSLAs could contribute to achieving SDG2, zero hunger, and SDG13, climate action. However, policy interventions are necessary to support and scale VSLAs as a sustainable development and food security strategy in vulnerable regions.",About Sufficiency
"Effects of fencing and grazing on the temporal dynamic of soil organic carbon content in two temperate grasslands in Inner Mongolia, China","This study aimed to investigate the impact of long-term grassland management on the temporal dynamic of SOC density in two temperate grasslands. The top soil SOC density, soil total nitrogen density and soil bulk density (0-20 cm) under long-term fencing and grazing treatments, the aboveground net primary productivity of fenced plots and the associated climatic factors of Leymus chinensis and Stipa grandis grasslands in Inner Mongolia were collected from literatures and analyzed. The results showed that the SOC density increased linearly with fenced duration but was insensitive to grazed duration in both grasslands. Compared with long-term grazing, fenced plots had larger potential for carbon sequestration, and the accumulation rate of SOC density was 29 and 35 g Cm(-2)y(-1) for L. chinensis and S. grandis grasslands. Fenced duration and mean annual temperature jointly contributed large effect on temporal pattern of SOC density. Climate change and grazed duration had little influence on the inter-annual variance of SOC density in grazed plots. Our results confirmed the enhancement effect of long-term fencing on soil carbon sequestration in degraded temperate grassland, and long-term permanent plot observation is essential and effective for accurately and comprehensively understanding the temporal dynamic of SOC storage.",About Sufficiency
Policy analysis in agrochemical supply chain: a system dynamics approach,"Sustainable agriculture has emerged as a critical topic in the context of sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. A key aspect impacting the sustainability of the agriculture supply chain is the usage of agrochemicals. Transitioning to sustainable alternatives from agrochemicals poses challenges, as it affects farms' productivity, income, and food supply to the market. The delicate balance between farm income and greenhouse gas emissions related to chemical fertilizer usage has not been addressed adequately using a dynamic system behavior perspective. This study employs a System Dynamics model to simulate the impact of adopting biofertilizers on the triple-bottom-line performance of the agrochemical supply chain from a policy perspective. The model aims to understand stakeholder behavior within the fertilizer supply chain and enhance its sustainability. Additionally, the study models the effects of various input subsidies using the design of experiments in an Indian agrochemical supply chain, examining trade-offs involved in the triple-bottom-line (social, environmental, and economic) parameters for each subsidy. The simulation model offers policymakers insights into determining appropriate subsidy levels to facilitate a sustainable transition of agricultural supply chains. In this context, various possible scenarios were obtained by simulating the policy parameters (agriproduct price, chemical fertilizer prices, biofertilizer fixed costs, and biofertilizer subsidies) resulting in optimal levels of environmental impact, producer profit, and social benefit. It also provides a comprehensive evaluation of the triple-bottom-line effects of policy strategies, thereby facilitating the comprehension of trade-offs in the supply chains of lower/middle-income countries. The study contributes valuable guidance for policymakers to make informed decisions for promoting sustainable agriculture and achieving the triple-bottom-line objectives in the agrochemical industry.",About Sufficiency
Post-cyclone resilience of an agroforest-based food system in the Pacific Islands,"As climate change increases the probability and/or severity of major disturbances worldwide, understanding how agroecological food systems can be resilient to the effects of major disturbances becomes critical. Farm-level crop and cultivar richness are critical to food security and nutritional dietary diversity, but quantitative research of how they are impacted by major disturbances, including the dynamics of their recovery, is largely lacking. We assessed the resilience of an agroforest-based food system to a recent Category 5 cyclone. Specifically, we carried out vegetation surveys in Fijian agroforests pre-cyclone, and 1 and 3 years post-cyclone, to assess changes in staple starch crop and cultivar richness over time. Resilience, measured as robustness, redundancy, reactivity, and resourcefulness, varied with the scale of analysis. At both the crop and cultivar scale, the agroforestry systems were highly reactive to cyclone disturbance. Crop species richness increased immediately post-cyclone and 3 years later remained higher than pre-cyclone levels, largely due to the increased presence of famine food crops, indicating system robustness, redundancy, and resourcefulness as well. Farmers also planted many new starch crop cultivars post-cyclone, especially of sweet potatoes, but the total number of cultivars declined over time, indicating limited redundancy and resourcefulness. Frequent crop substitutions for cassava over taro or yams, and high cultivar dynamism that resulted in the loss of traditional varieties, can have consequences both for nutritional diversity and the maintenance of cultural traditions. This research suggests resilience is present in Fijian agroforest systems, yet a greater focus on crop cultivar diversity is needed.",About Sufficiency
Potential and Constraints of Use of Organic Amendments from Agricultural Residues for Improvement of Soil Properties,"Agricultural residues are produced in large quantities and their management is an issue all over the world. Many of these residues consist of plant materials in different degrees of transformation, so returning them back to soil is a management option that closes loops in a circular economy context. The objective of this paper is to summarize current knowledge on the options and effects of reusing agricultural residues as organic soil amendments. The reuse of these residues in soil is a good solution for minimizing the problems associated with their management, while improving soil health and ecosystem functions. While some agricultural residues can be applied directly to soil, others will need previous transformations such as composting to improve their properties. This allows the recovery of plant nutrients and increase in soil organic matter contents, with many positive effects on the soil's physical, chemical and biological properties, and ultimately, crop production, although potential risks derived from some materials must also be considered. The concept of regenerative agriculture and soil management using organic soil amendments contribute to the significant enhancement of soil biodiversity, the protection of the environment and climate goal achievement.",About Sufficiency
"Green manuring, mustard residue recycling and fertilizer application affects productivity and sustainability of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.) in Indian semi-arid tropics","An experiment was conducted for five-years (2005-06 to 2009-10) to evaluate the impact of Sesbania green-manuring (GM), mustard-residue recycling and fertilizers on soil health and productivity of Indian mustard under fallow-mustard sequence. Sesbania (GM) significantly increased SOC, carbon-sequestration-potential rate, infiltration rate, available NPK status but decreased bulk density. Supplementing mustard-residue recycling 2.5 t ha(-1) further improved the soil quality attributes significantly. The increase in fertilizer from N40P8.7K0 to N80P17.4K33.3 also improved the soil attributes gradually. This improvement in soil properties due to Sesbania (GM) and mustard-residue recycling significantly influenced plant height, branches/plant, siliquae/plant, seeds/siliqua and ultimately seed and oil yield compared to existing fallow-mustard practice. The mustard seed yield was increased by 42.3% due to Sesbania (GM) and by 63.9% due to supplementary mustard residue recycling in five years. Increase in fertilizers levels from N-40 to N-80 and P-8.7 to P-17.4 significantly improved mustard yield attributes, seed and oil yield while results of K application was inconsistent. The combined application of N80P17.4K33.3 synergistically increased the seed yield by 82.1% over N40P8.7K0. Sustainability yield index, partial factor productivity, production efficiency and incremental benefit cost ratio also showed significant improvement due to Sesbania (GM), mustard-residue recycling and judicious fertilizer use.

Prospects for Long-Term Agriculture in Southern Africa: Emergent Dynamics of Savannah Ecosystems from Remote Sensing Observations,"Hydro-climatic resilience is an essential element of food security. The miombo ecosystem in Southern Africa supports varied land uses for a growing population. Albedo, Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), and precipitation remote-sensing data for current climate were jointly analyzed to explore vegetation dynamics and water availability feedbacks. Changes in the surface energy balance tied to vegetation status were examined in the light of an hourly albedo product with improved atmospheric correction derived for this study. Phase-space analysis shows that the albedo's seasonality tracks the landscape-scale functional stability of miombo and woody savanna with respect to precipitation variations. Miombo exhibits the best adaptive traits to water stress which highlights synergies among root-system water uptake capacity, vegetation architecture, and landscape hydro-geomorphology. This explains why efforts to conserve the spatial structure of the miombo forest in sustainable farming of seasonal wetlands have led to significant crop yield increases. Grass savanna's high vulnerability to water stress is illustrative of potential run-away impacts of miombo deforestation. This study suggests that phase-space analysis of albedo, SIF, and FVC can be used as operational diagnostics of ecosystem health.",About Sufficiency
PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN AGRI-FOOD SYSTEM INNOVATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,"Research is essential for improvement of agricultural productivity, resource use and resilience, and for food systems transformation more broadly. This article analyzes the drivers of past agricultural productivity growth in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) and argues that productivity is not growing fast enough to meet the needs of a global population of 10 billion by 2050. A sustainable transformation of agri-food systems in LMICs will need greater and faster technical change. Higher investment in agri-food R&D is therefore needed to accelerate productivity growth and address the social, economic, nutritional and environmental challenges facing LMICs. Greater and better -targeted investment in sustainable technologies and climate change mitigation and adaptation will be particularly important to reducing the climate change impacts on agriculture and food security in the coming decades. However, LMICs with small research systems and limited innovation capacity lack the scale and resources to effectively tackle the challenges ahead. Better coordination and a clear articulation of roles and responsibilities among national, subregional, regional and global R&D actors (both from the public and private sectors) are essential to ensuring that scarce financial, human, and infrastructure resources are optimized, duplications minimized, and synergies and complementarities enhanced.(c) The Author(s) 2023.

Improving the sustainability of agricultural land use: An integrated framework for the conflict between food security and environmental deterioration,"In rapidly developing countries, intensive agriculture faces the conflict between food security and environmental deterioration. To improve the sustainability of agricultural land use, this paper proposes an integrated framework for risk assessment and conflict coordination to cope with these salient challenges at the administrative unit level. This framework is demonstrated using a case study conducted in the Dongting Lake area in China. Drawing upon diverse sources of statistical data concerning agricultural inputs and outputs, water resources and natural hazards as well as questionnaire surveys conducted at the household level, this paper uses the Cobb Douglas production function and the water environmental pressure index to assess food insecurity risk and environmental risk from food production, respectively. A double matrix method is used to characterize the degree of sustainability based on the risk assessment. The results indicate that the overall food security of the region can be maintained in the negligible-risk range. However, rising agro-environmental risks from grain production in the coming years are likely to threaten the sustainability of agricultural land use in most administrative units. It is suggested that optimization of land use patterns and mitigation of natural hazards could be effective approaches to improve the sustainability of local agricultural land use.",About Sufficiency
Does Rural Labor Transfer Contribute to the Reduction in Chemical Fertilizer Use? Evidence from China's Household Finance Survey Data in China,"In recent years, the Chinese government has been continuously promoting reduced use of chemical fertilizers and enhancing the sustainable development capacity of agriculture.

The results show that: (1) rural labor transfer is helpful for reducing chemical fertilizer use, and it has a negative impact on the intensity of chemical fertilizer use; (2) rural labor transfer will enhance the socialization of agricultural machinery services by promoting the adoption of mechanized fertilization and expanding the scale of agricultural land management to promote the reduction of chemical fertilizers use; (3) different topographic conditions have different regulatory effects on the use of socialized agricultural machinery services, and for mountainous areas with poor topographic conditions, socialized agricultural machinery services may be difficult to implement, resulting in poor effects of chemical fertilizer use reduction. These findings provide important evidence for sustainable agriculture development and have significant theoretical and policy implications.",About Sufficiency
Qualitative assessment on the chances and limitations of food fraud prevention through distributed ledger technologies in the organic food supply chain,"The prevention of food fraud is becoming more difficult in globalized supply chains that are increasing in their complexity. Information asymmetry is the major root cause of food fraud and especially problematic in products with value adding credence attributes, such as organic foods. Therefore, vulnerability mitigation is an important task for participants of the supply chain. As statistics show a rise in food fraud cases, certification schemes such as organic farming, fairtrade, or animal welfare are adapting their standards accordingly and can cause barriers to participation in such schemes. Distributed ledger technologies (DLT), such as Blockchains, hold the potential to supervise and manage supply chains and hold promising potential for reducing risk of food fraud from different angles. However, targeted orchestration of the different functionalities is to date missing in the organic food supply chain. This gap is addressed by this study, focusing on the extent to which DLTs can help prevent food fraud in organic-certified supply chains. The findings show that the technological capacity is further advanced than the readiness of industry stakeholders regarding technology adoption. Yet stakeholders approve of the potential benefits of introducing DLTs in their supply chains, which are scarcely used today. Policy schemes hold the potential to overcome current obstacles such as legal prerequisites and financials by fostering technology dissemination through different measures.",About Sufficiency
"Quantifying reasonable straw removal rate to achieve food security, bioenergy transition and climate mitigation in China","Effective management of crop straw is crucial for sustainable food production, renewable energy transition and climate change mitigation. However, accurately estimating reasonable removal rates to enhance grain yield and transition to bioenergy remains challenging. Through nationwide systematic surveys and meta-analysis, reasonable straw removal rates of 45 % for rice, 19 % for wheat, and 42 % for maize were identified in China. The potential bioenergy production derived from these reasonably removed straws ranges from 23 to 100 Mtce in 2022. The combined adjustment of straw utilization and fossil fuel offset through bioenergy leads to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 218 to 309 Mt in 2022. Particularly, maize straw emerges as a preferred feedstock for bioenergy and climate mitigation due to its highest bioenergy production and GHG emissions reduction potential.

Rainfed Areas and Animal Agriculture in Asia: The Wanting Agenda for Transforming Productivity Growth and Rural Poverty,"The importance of rainfed areas and animal agriculture on productivity enhancement and food security for economic rural growth in Asia is discussed in the context of opportunities for increasing potential contribution from them. The extent of the rainfed area of about 223 million hectares and the biophysical attributes are described. They have been variously referred to inter alia as fragile, marginal, dry, waste, problem, threatened, range, less favoured, low potential lands, forests and woodlands, including lowlands and uplands. Of these, the terms less favoured areas (LFAs), and low or high potential are quite widely used. The LFAs are characterised by four key features: i) very variable biophysical elements, notably poor soil quality, rainfall, length of growing season and dry periods, ii) extreme poverty and very poor people who continuously face hunger and vulnerability, iii) presence of large populations of ruminant animals (buffaloes, cattle, goats and sheep), and iv) have had minimum development attention and an unfinished wanting agenda. The rainfed humid/sub-humid areas found mainly in South East Asia (99 million ha), and arid/semi-arid tropical systems found in South Asia (116 million ha) are priority agro-ecological zones (AEZs). In India for example, the ecosystem occupies 68% of the total cultivated area and supports 40% of the human and 65% of the livestock populations. The area also produces 4% of food requirements. The biophysical and typical household characteristics, agricultural diversification, patterns of mixed farming and cropping systems are also described. Concerning animals, their role and economic importance, relevance of ownership, nomadic movements, and more importantly their potential value as the entry point for the development of LFAs is discussed. Two examples of demonstrated success concern increasing buffalo production for milk and their expanded use in semi-arid AEZs in India, and the integration of cattle and goats with oil palm in Malaysia. Revitalised development of the LFAs is justified by the demand for agricultural land to meet human needs e.g. housing, recreation and industrialisation; use of arable land to expand crop production to ceiling levels; increasing and very high animal densities; increased urbanisation and pressure on the use of available land; growing environmental concerns of very intensive crop production e.g. acidification and salinisation with rice cultivation; and human health risks due to expanding pen-urban poultry and pig production. The strategies for promoting productivity growth will require concerted R and D on improved use of LFAs, application of systems perspectives for technology delivery, increased investments, a policy framework and improved farmer-researcher-extension linkages. These challenges and their resolution in rainfed areas can forcefully impact on increased productivity, improved livelihoods and human welfare, and environmental sustainability in the future.",About Sufficiency
Effect of vermicompost on greengram productivity and soil health under hilly ecosystem of North East India,"Aim: The study aimed at evaluating of an appropriate nutrient management practice for increasing greengram productivity, improving soil health, and thus bringing sustainability to pulse production system in the hilly terrains of North East India. Methodology: Afield experiment was conducted during 2013 and 2014 to evaluate the effect of vermicompost, Rhizobium and lime in different combination with fertilizers on greengram productivity and soil health under terrace land situation of Meghalaya. Treatments comprised of recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF), 50% RDF + Rhizobium, 50% RDF + Rhizobium + lime 4 q ha(-1),50 % RDF + Vermicompost (VC)2.5 t ha(-1), 50% RDF +lime 4 q ha-1 and 50 % RDF + VC 2.5 t ha(-1) +lime 4 q ha(-1). Results: Nutrient management practices significantly influenced the yield components, yield, soil nutrient status, as well as microbial population in soils. Integrated use of 50% RDF + VC 2.5 tha(-1) + lime 4 q ha(-1) resulted in significantly higher yield of greengram (10 q ha(-1)) and improved the soil organic carbon (2.5 %), bacterial and fungal population, pH and available N, P2O5 and K2O compared to recommended dose of fertilizer applied alone. Interpretation: The results of the study indicated that the integrated use of 50 % RDF with vermicompost 2.5 t ha(-1) and lime 4 q ha(-1) is profitable for enhancing greengram productivity and improving soil health under hilly ecosystem of North East India.",About Sufficiency
Reclaiming traditional food systems in alternative food networks. Insights from Mexico city peri-urban agriculture,"In the literature on how to make food systems just and sustainable, we often look at Alternative Food Networks (AFN) as a way forward. AFNs are initiatives that pose alternatives to conventional food systems (driven by productivism and harmful to human and environmental health). Despite this broad understanding of what AFNs can be, in practice, most cases presented in the literature look surprisingly alike. In this article, we challenge the scholars working on alternative food networks to look beyond the narrow definition of AFNs by considering cases of traditional agriculture and distribution systems. We illustrate this argument using the case of chinampas, a traditional agricultural system in Mexico City that contributes in different ways to local sustainability. Analysing semi-structured interviews conducted on site, we argue that chinampas can be defined as an alternative food network because of their modes of production, their diverse distribution channels, and their economic practices. We conclude that traditional food systems present an alternative to conventional food systems and should therefore be included in AFN research. Broadening the definition of AFNs so to include traditional and non-institutional practices can help identify diverse cases fitting this new lens, including in the Global North; it can also contribute to affirming the value of these traditional systems in building sustainable and just societies.",About Sufficiency
Environmentalism and localism in agricultural and land-use policies can maintain food production while supporting biodiversity. Findings from simulations of contrasting scenarios in the EU,"Increasing food production without further harming biodiversity is a key challenge of contemporary societies. In this paper, we assess trade-offs between agricultural output and two key agri-environmental indicators in four contrasting scenarios for Europe in 2040. The scenarios represent different storylines encompassing assumptions on macro-economic drivers (e.g. population and GDP growth rate), demand for food and livestock products as well as policy choices on trade liberalisation/protectionism, biodiversity conservation, regulations on land-use planning and subsidies to farmers through the European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Through a complex modelling chain, we projected for the year 2040: i) the total energy content of agricultural output; ii) the total nitrogen surplus, a proxy of the overall impact of agriculture on the environment; and iii) an index measuring the capacity of agricultural systems to support biodiversity. We present both aggregate results (EU level) and spatially explicit assessments at a fine resolution (1 km(2)). Results indicate that a strong neo-liberal approach to agriculture (full liberalisation, abolition of subsides) will lead to increased use-input efficiency and decrease of impact from Nitrogen input; however, a large amount of agricultural area in Europe will be abandoned, which will lead to an absolute decrease in production and increased land homogenisation and polarisation, with negative effects on the capacity of agricultural areas to support biodiversity. Protectionist and sovereigntist policies will keep absolute production and cultivated area high, but at the cost of less efficiency in the use of inputs and higher impacts on the environment and biodiversity. Under a scenario characterised by environmental-friendly practices, multifunctional landscapes and localism, significant decreases in the environmental pressure of agriculture (compared to other scenarios) can be achieved with minimum decrease in agricultural output. Our results indicate that agricultural and land-use policies aiming at preserving production over large rural areas, multifunctionality and diversification of agricultural landscapes can contribute to the jointly achievement of biodiversity protection and high food production.",About Sufficiency
Relation between household food insecurity and breastfeeding in Canada,"BACKGROUND: Qualitative studies have suggested that food insecurity adversely affects infant feeding practices. We aimed to determine how household food insecurity relates to breastfeeding initiation, duration of exclusive breastfeeding and vitamin D supplementation of breastfed infants in Canada. METHODS: We studied 10 450 women who had completed the Maternal Experiences Breastfeeding Module and the Household Food Security Survey Module of the Canadian Community Health Survey (2005-2014) and who had given birth in the year of or year before their interview. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regression to examine the relation between food insecurity and infant feeding practices, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, maternal mood disorders and diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Overall, 17% of the women reported household food insecurity, of whom 8.6% had moderate food insecurity and 2.9% had severe food insecurity (weighted percentages). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, women with food insecurity were no less likely than others to initiate breastfeeding or provide vitamin D supplementation to their infants. Half of the women with food insecurity ceased exclusive breastfeeding by 2 months, whereas most of those with food security persisted with breastfeeding for 4 months or more. Relative to women with food security, those with marginal, moderate and severe food insecurity had significantly lower odds of exclusive breastfeeding to 4 months, but only women with moderate food insecurity had lower odds of exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months, independent of sociodemographic characteristics (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.39-0.92). Adjustment for maternal mood disorder or diabetes slightly attenuated these relationships. INTERPRETATION: Mothers caring for infants in food-insecure households attempted to follow infant feeding recommendations, but were less able than women with food security to sustain exclusive breastfeeding. Our findings highlight the need for more effective interventions to support food-insecure families with newborns.",About Sufficiency

Agrodiversity lessons in mountain land management,"Intensification,of crop production in the mountains has long been perceived as unsustainable. However, since the late 1980s has become increasingly evident that decline and collapse are not always inevitable. The present article provides examples from the highlands of northern Thailand to show that local food security can be improved while impacts on the resource base and the environment are minimized. This was achieved with the help of cropping systems developed and adapted by farmers themselves (Figure 1). Studying farmers' management techniques will allow this success to be repeated elsewhere, but only if it is based on the idea of dynamic variation in cropping system management that occurs within and between mountain agroecosystems, defined as agrodiversity.",About Sufficiency
Response and resilience of Asian agrifood systems to COVID-19: An assessment across twenty-five countries and four regional farming and food systems,"Context: The COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting health and economies across the world, although the nature of direct and indirect effects on Asian agrifood systems and food security has not yet been well understood. Objectives: This paper assesses the initial responses of major farming and food systems to COVID-19 in 25 Asian countries, and considers the implications for resilience, food and nutrition security and recovery policies by the governments. Methods: A conceptual systems model was specified including key pathways linking the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 to the resilience and performance of the four principal Asian farming and food systems, viz, lowland rice based; irrigated wheat based; hill mixed; and dryland mixed systems. Based on this framework, a systematic survey of 2504 key informants (4% policy makers, 6% researchers or University staff, 6% extension workers, 65% farmers, and 19% others) in 20 Asian countries was conducted and the results assessed and analysed. Results and conclusion: The principal Asian farming and food systems were moderately resilient to COVID-19, reinforced by government policies in many countries that prioritized food availability and affordability. Rural livelihoods and food security were affected primarily because of disruptions to local labour markets (especially for off-farm work), farm produce markets (notably for perishable foods) and input supply chains (i.e., seeds and fertilisers). The overall effects on system performance were most severe in the irrigated wheat based system and least severe in the hill mixed system, associated in the latter case with greater resilience and diversification and less dependence on external inputs and long market chains. Farming and food systems' resilience and sustain ability are critical considerations for recovery policies and programmes, especially in relation to economic performance that initially recovered more slowly than productivity, natural resources status and social capital. Overall, the resilience of Asian farming and food systems was strong because of inherent systems characteristics reinforced by public policies that prioritized staple food production and distribution as well as complementary welfare programmes. With the substantial risks to plant-and animal-sourced food supplies from future zoonoses and the institutional vulnerabilities revealed by COVID-19, efforts to improve resilience should be central to recovery programmes. Significance: This study was the first Asia-wide systems assessment of the effects of COVID-19 on agriculture and food systems, differentiating the effects of the pandemic across the four principal regional farming and food systems in the region.",About Sufficiency
Rethinking natural resource management in Thailand,"Environmental science is shaped by the socio-political context in which it is produced. Environmental problems and explanations are context specific, and this article contributes to a critical political ecology by illustrating the changing relationship between conceptualisation of environmental problems and explanations of them, and the socio-political context in contemporary Thailand. During the 'development epoch' from the 1950s, both natural and social sciences became compartmentalised and the epistemology of environmental science became dominated by the demands of a growth economy and utilitarian values. The resulting impasse of conventional knowledge of natural resource management coincided with a socio-political and bureaucratic reform process pushed by various democratic movements. Together with a request for decentralisation and devolution of state power, these movements are also fighting for sustainable utilisation of natural resources, and sustainable agricultural practices. A precondition, however, for sustainable utilisation of natural resources is a change in conceptualisation and knowledge creation for resource management. The Sustainable Land Use and Natural Resource Management (SLUSE) collaboration offers alternative ways of creating knowledge for sustainable utilisation of natural resources, that aim to support the present socio-political reform process in Thailand.",About Sufficiency
Review: The challenge to integrate animal welfare indicators into the Life Cycle Assessment,"The transition to a more sustainable livestock sector represents one of the major challenges of our time. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is recognised as the gold standard methodology for assessing the environmental impact of farming systems. Simultaneously, animal welfare is a key component of livestock production and is intrinsically related to human and environmental well-being. To perform an overall onfarm sustainability assessment, it would be desirable to consider both the environmental impact and the welfare of the animals. The present work aimed to summarise and describe the methodologies adopted in peer-reviewed papers published to date, that combine animal welfare evaluation with LCA. Citations, retrieved from four bibliographical databases, were systematically evaluated in a multi-stage approach following the JBI and PRISMA scoping review guidelines. The searches identified 1 460 studies, of which only 24 were compliant with the inclusion criteria. The results highlighted how the environmental LCA was undertaken with a much more homogenous and standardised method than animal welfare assessment. When studies were grouped based on the type of animal welfare assessment performed: 16.7% used single welfare indicators, 45.8% multiple indicators, 8.3% applied existing validated protocols (i.e., TGI-200 and TGI-35L), 16.7% used non-validated protocols and 12.5% employed other methods. The papers were further classified with respect to the ""5 Animal Welfare Domains Model"": the most assessed domain was ""environment"" (90.5% of the papers%), followed by ""health"" (52.4%), ""nutrition"" (33.3%), ""behavioural interactions"" (28.6%) and ""mental state"" (9.5%). None of the studies assessed all the domains simultaneously. In addition, 66.7% of papers (n = 16) aggregated the animal welfare indicators into a final score. Within these, only four papers proposed to associate the animal welfare scores with the LCA functional unit. An overall sustainability score, calculated with several different approaches to summarise the information, was provided by 46% of the papers. In summary, despite the topic's relevance, to date, there is neither a consensus on the animal welfare assessment approach to be carried out (indicators selection and their aggregation) nor on the standardisation of an integrated animal welfare-LCA evaluation. The present review provides a basis for the development of common future guidelines to carry out a comprehensive, true-to-life and robust farm sustainability assessment. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

Rice straw application improves yield marginally and increases carbon footprint of double cropping paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.),"Sustainable production of paddy rice is essential in supplying staple food worldwide. In the present study, we determined annual yield, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and carbon footprint of double cropping paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) as impacted by organic and inorganic amendments in a 38-year study from central China. A balanced synthetic fertilizer of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) combined with rice straw application (NPK_RS) consistently produced higher annual grain yield by 5%, 11% and 64%, respectively, compared with NPK, anaerobically digested manure (NKM) and NK. Average GHGs associated with both early -and late-season rice production were 47,300 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 for the NPK_RS, 24,100 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 for the NPK, 27,700 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 for the NKM, 24,300 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 for the NK, and 20,400 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 for the non-fertilized control (CK). Of the total GHGs, approximately from 80% to 95% of the emissions resulted from methane fluxes, and from 3% to 7% emitted as soil nitrous oxide while only from 2% to 15% of the total emissions derived from other sources such as fertilizer, herbicide and pesticide production and field operation. As a result, carbon footprint of paddy rice varied from 2.1 to 3.9 kg CO2eq kg-1 grain. Straw addition with the NPK improved rice yield only marginally, but increased methane emissions and carbon footprint significantly, compared with the NPK. On the other hand, the NKM increased rice yield by 48% and GHGs by 10% and lowered carbon footprint by 23%, compared with the NK. Timing of straw application and manure amendments are critical for improving yield of paddy rice, reducing GHGs, and lowering carbon footprint.",About Sufficiency
"Assessing on-farm productivity of Miscanthus crops by combining soil mapping, yield modelling and remote sensing","Biomass from agricultural land is a key component of any sustainable bioenergy strategy, and 2nd generation, ligno-cellulosic feedstocks are part of the UK government policy to meet the target of reduced CO2 emission. Pre-harvest estimates of the biomass supply potential are usually based on experimental evidence and little is known about the yield gap between biologically obtainable and actual achievable on-farm biomass yields. We propose a systematic integration of mapped information fit for estimating obtainable yields using an empirical model, observed on-farm yields and remote sensing. Thereby, one can identify the sources of yield variation and supply uncertainty. Spatially explicit Miscanthus potential yields are compared with delivered on-farm yields from established crops >= 5 years after planting, surveyed among participants in the Energy Crop Scheme. Actual on-farm yield averaged at 8.94 Mg ha(-1) and it varied greatly (coefficient of variation 34%), largely irrespective of soil type. The average yield gap on clay soils was much larger than that on sandy or loamy soils (37% vs 10%). Miscanthus is noticeably slower to establish on clay soils as shown by fitting a logistic Gompertz equation to yield time series. However, gaps in crop cover as identified by density counts, visual inspection (Google Earth) and remote sensing (Landsat-5) correlated with observed on-farm yields suggesting patchiness as causal for reduced yields. The analysis shows ways to improve the agronomy for these new crops to increase economic returns within the supply chain and the environmental benefits (reduced GHG emission, greater carbon sequestration) and reduce the land demand of bio-energy production.

"Climate change and groundwater overdraft impacts on agricultural drought in India: Vulnerability assessment, food security measures and policy recommendation","The problem of drought in India is a major issue in terms of various adverse impacts on livelihood of society. Drought Early Warning System (DEWS), a real-time drought-monitoring tool, has reported that over a fifth of India's geographical area (21.06 %) is suffering drought-like situations. This is 62 % larger than the drought-affected area during the same period last year, which was 7.86 %. Drought affects 21.06 %, with conditions ranging from unusually dry to extremely dry. While 1.63 % and 1.73% of the area are experiencing 'extreme' or 'exceptional' dry conditions, 2.17% is experiencing `severe' dry conditions. Under `moderate' dry circumstances, up to 8.15 % is possible. In this perspective groundwater vulnerability assessment in the overall country is needed for implementing the sustainable and long-term strategies for escaping from this type of hazardous situation. The main objective of this study is to estimate the drought vulnerability in changing climate which eventually influences the food security of India. The groundwater overdraft is one of the crucial elements in agricultural drought vulnerability. Various related parameters have been selected for estimating the drought vulnerability and its impact to food security in India. Here, MaxEnt (maximumentropy) andANN (analytical neural network) has been considered in this perspective. The AUC values for the training datasets in the ANN and MaxEnt model are 0.891 and 0.921, respectively. The AUC values in ANN and MaxEnt model for the validation datasets are 0.876 and 0.904, respectively. Here MaxEnt model is most optimal than ANN considering predictive accuracy. From this study analysis it is established that western, south and middle portion of country is very much prone to drought vulnerability.

The dynamic simulation of organic farming development scenarios - A case study in Slovenia,"In this paper a system dynamics model for organic farming development to support government decision making is presented. The system incorporates relevant variables which affect organic farming development. The user seeks answers to strategic questions related to the level of organic farming development achievable in a long term dynamic horizon. The model's basic structure is fully described and results are presented which show that the conversion process relies mainly on subsidies and self-organization resources. User can simulate different policy scenarios for organic farming and for assessing their impact on the economic and environmental parameters of organic production at aggregate level. After performing several simulation scenarios we discovered that conversion to organic farming relies on subsidies which provide the main motivation for conversion from conventional farming to organic farming. However, the subsidies are not the only driving force in the system, even more important are activities that promote organic farming, since sufficiently large subsidies could not be provided in order to complete the conversion from conventional to organic farming to the extent desired. Another important feature is food demand, determined by population size, which negatively influences the conversion to organic farming due to the increased demand leading to increased food prices.

Emerging and re-emerging diseases of agricultural importance: why local perspectives matter,"This paper examines local farmers' perspectives about emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of humans, crops and livestock and their impact on household food security in the Tanzania-Uganda interface ecosystem to the west of Lake Victoria. While it is increasingly accepted that such an approach could yield vital information not only regarding the extent of the impact of EIDs but also on practical strategies for their control, recent studies have examined only a narrow part of the disease-food security spectrum, often lacking a clear analysis of how local people conceptualise the co-occurrence, interactions and impact on food security of multiple plant, animal and human disease afflictions. Findings of the present study reveal that farmers perceive diseases as products of wider social, economic, environmental and institutional realities. They employ a wide range of names to describe disease problems and often such labels have nothing in common with the binomial nomenclature used in scientific taxonomy. Frequently, local people's perceptions of severity of the impact of disease on food security are at variance with views held by experts. Consequently, disease control measures and strategies advocated by experts and policy makers are often not adhered to. This paper reveals that local or emic perspectives on diseases not only convey the sense of how local people feel and think about a particular disease but also how such knowledge shapes their response effort. Finally, the paper argues for a strategy to harness and incorporate aspects of local perspectives and practices into formal disease control programmes.",About Sufficiency
A Method for Assessing the Prevalence of Food Insecurity in Older Adults Based on Resource Constraints and Food-Related Physical Functioning Limitations,"Background: Older adults with food-related physical functioning limitations often face food insecurity because of challenges that go beyond resource constraints. Difficulties with food acquisition at retailers, and food preparation and consumption are not captured by the United States Department of Agriculture's food security measure. Objectives: The objective of this study was to develop a method to assess the overall prevalence of food insecurity regardless of underlying cause using validated measures that capture both food-related physical functioning limitations and resource-constraint food hardships. It also aims to examine the validity of this method in relation to sociodemographic characteristics, health, appetite, and dietary outcomes. Methods: Using information from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2007-2018), 10,237 adults aged 60 y and older with complete food security and food-related physical functioning limitations data were included in the study. Comparisons of the cross- classification method and the standard food security methods are made and their relationships with depression, self-reported health, and healthy eating index 2015 are examined using multiple linear regression models. Results: Using the cross-classification method, prevalence of low and very low food security because of resource constraints and food- related physical functioning limitations was found to be higher (13.6% and 7.3%, respectively) compared with food insecurity based solely on resource constraints (4.7% and 3.3%, respectively) or food-related physical functioning limitations (11.4% and 4.4%). Low and very low food security levels using the cross-classification method were associated with higher odds of depression and poor self-reported health, compared with the standard United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) resource-constrained food security measure. Conclusions: The cross-classification method enables the identification of potentially food insecure older adults who might be classified otherwise if only each measure is used alone. This method serves as guidance for using both measures jointly to estimate food insecurity, regardless of its cause.",About Sufficiency
Green horizons: Using fodder crops to harness carbon and combat climate change,"Climate change, influenced by both natural processes and human activities, has notably transformed Earth's atmospheric composition, primarily due to heightened energy use in industrial and agricultural sectors. To combat this, a study was conducted focusing on soil management strategies, particularly using cumbu napier hybrid grass, to mitigate climate change by enhancing carbon sequestration. The research evaluated the effects of different nutrient sources including inorganic fertilizers, farmyard manure (FYM), poultry manure (PM) and biofertilizers like Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and Azophos on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil carbon pools and soil organic carbon (SOC). The findings revealed that integrating organic manures with biofertilizers, particularly in the treatment involving PM at 75 % nitrogen equivalent combined with AM and Azophos (T10), significantly increased SOC levels (1.04 %) and lowered GHG emissions. This treatment also recorded the highest levels of soil inorganic carbon (0.131 %), passive carbon (7890 mg kg-1), permanent soil carbon stock (14.91 t ha-1 green fodder yield (370.2 t ha-1 year-1). On the other hand, the treatment with FYM alone at 100 % nitrogen equivalent (T7) resulted in the highest CO2 emissions (71.4 t ha-1 year-1), while the untreated control plot (T11) exhibited the highest global warming potential (GWP).

To investigate the presence of indirect greenhouse gas emissions, we measured the concentrations of dissolved N2O, CH4, and CO2 in pipe drainage, seepage, and stream water in a livestock farm located in Hokkaido, Japan. Large spatial and seasonal variations in the gas concentrations in the pipe drainage and seepage were observed: the concentrations of the dissolved gases ranged from 0.06 to 95.2 mug N2O-N L-1, from 0.03 to 3,400 mug CH4-C L-1, and from 3.34 to 53.9 mg CO2-C L-1. Almost all the concentrations were supersaturated, indicating the possibility of indirect N2O, CH4, and CO2 emissions from the farm. The N2O and CO2 concentrations in the stream water were near equilibrium with ambient air and were almost constant from the upstream to the downstream. However, the concentration of dissolved CH, was remarkably higher in the lower part of the stream, suggesting that there may be a relatively strong indirect CH4 emission from the drainage in the lower part of the farm.",About Sufficiency
Why do cereal-legume intercrops support large earthworm populations?,"The relative importance of reduced soil disturbance and increased food supply in supporting large earthworm populations in cereal-legume intercropping systems was investigated in two replicated field experiments over a 3-year period. In the first experiment, the effects of the absence of tillage and the presence of a permanent white clover understorey on earthworm populations were assessed in three winter wheat cropping systems. The mean earthworm abundance as assessed by electrical extraction in conventional wheat, direct drilled wheat and direct-drilled wheat-clover intercrops was 211, 280 and 572 individuals m(-2) and the corresponding earthworm biomass was 62, 92 and 203 g m(-2). In the second experiment, the effects of dairy cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer applications on earthworm populations in wheat-clover intercropping systems were assessed. Neither the input of additional organic matter (as slurry) nor mineral N fertilization increased earthworm population levels which were already remarkably high, averaging 1097 individuals m(-2) and 266 g biomass m(-2) in the third year of the experiment. These results suggest that while the absence of ploughing alone had only a modest effect, the combination of absence of ploughing and presence of a clover understorey increased earthworm populations greatly. It is concluded that cereal-legume intercrops support large earthworm populations primarily because the organic matter input from such systems is favourable for earthworms in terms of quantity, quality and continuity of food supply throughout the year.

Restoring soil health to reduce irrigation demand and buffer the impacts of drought,"Irrigation consumes three quarters of global water withdrawals each year. Strategies are needed to reduce irrigation water use, including increasing the efficiency of transfer methods and field application. Comprehensive restoration of soil health, specifically through organic matter amendments, can substantially reduce irrigation demand and increase crop yield. A program to restore severely degraded and desertified soils by incorporating coarse woodchips into the soil successfully increased rainfall capture and elevated soil moisture for several weeks between rainfall events at both Ningxia, north-west China and North Dakota, USA. With addition of fertilizer, woodchip incorporation further increased growth of wheat and alfalfa. Comprehensive soil health assessment of remnant grasslands was used to develop target reference soil profiles by which to guide restoration efforts. Given that most agricultural soils are degraded to some degree, soil health restoration can provide a powerful strategy toward achieving global food and water security.",About Sufficiency
Scouting for Food Heritage for Achieving Sustainable Development: The Methodological Approach of the Atlas of the Ark of Taste,"Over the last two decades, scholars and organizations across the world have carried out research projects and promoted dissemination tools aimed at promoting food and food-related elements embedded in local and traditional foodways. In this regard, the documentation of food and biocultural heritage has been seen as the starting point of processes directed toward their safeguarding and promotion. Drawing from this premise, the paper presents an original methodological approach, designed within the framework of the Ark of Taste project, to map, inventory, and document food and food-related resources to produce a comprehensive dissemination tool for the promotion of local food and biocultural heritage. To this end, the paper discusses the case study of the Atlas of the Ark of Taste in Tanzania, looking at the approach used, and the challenges faced, in undertaking field and desk activities aimed at inventorying Tanzanian food products and in the creating of the gastronomic atlas of this country. Drawing from this experience, the paper highlights the potentially crucial role that food and gastronomic inventories may have in achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals from a grassroots perspective. Acknowledging the limitations and possible unintended effects of these initiatives on the protection of food and biocultural resources, the authors recognize the promising role that these tools could have in fostering the achievement of environmental (SDGs 13, 14, 15) and social sustainability (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 10) objectives.",About Sufficiency
Effects of cover crops on multiple ecosystem services: Ten meta-analyses of data from arable farmland in California and the Mediterranean,"Cover crops are considered to be beneficial for multiple ecosystem services, and they have been widely promoted through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the EU and Farm Bill Conservation Title Programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), in the USA. However, it can be difficult to decide whether the beneficial effects of cover crops on some ecosystem services are likely to outweigh their harmful effects on other services, and thus to decide whether they should be promoted by agricultural policy in specific situations. We used meta-analysis to quantify the effects of cover crops on five ecosystem services (food production, climate regulation, soil and water regulation, and weed control) in arable farmland in California and the Mediterranean, based on 326 experiments reported in 57 publications. In plots with cover crops, there was 13% less water, 9% more organic matter and 41% more microbial biomass in the soil, 27% fewer weeds, and 15% higher carbon dioxide emissions (but also more carbon stored in soil organic matter), compared to control plots with bare soils or winter fallows. Cash crop yields were 16% higher in plots that had legumes as cover crops (compared to controls) but 7% lower in plots that had non-legumes as cover crops. Soil nitrogen content was 41% lower, and nitrate leaching was 53% lower, in plots that had non-legume cover crops (compared to controls) but not significantly different in plots that had legumes. We did not find enough data to quantify the effects of cover crops on biodiversity conservation, pollination, or pest regulation. These gaps in the evidence need to be closed if cover crops continue to be widely promoted.

"Effects of food supply on size at first maturity, fecundity and growth of hybrid tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (L) x Oreochromis aureus (Steindachner), in outdoor concrete tanks in Saudi Arabia","The effects of four levels of food supply (0.5%, 1%, 2% and 3% body weight daily) were investigated on some reproductive traits and growth of hybrid tilapia in outdoor concrete tanks. Fast-growing fish matured early in the season (March), but spawning started late in May. Smallest size of males and females at first maturity was? 8.1 cm. Fish size at maturity appears to be influenced by the feeding lever, which affects the growth of fish. For both sexes, no significant difference was found in gonadosomatic index (GSI) among different treatments. Mean percentage of mature fish decreased with decreasing food supply and was found to be significantly different between fishes fed at 3% (46%) and 0.5% (28%) body weight. Fecundity increased with increased feeding levels, although significant differences were found only between 3% and other feeding rates (0.5-2.0%). The fecundity per g female was higher at the lower ration levels (0.5% and 1%) than at the higher feeding levels. Egg quality, with respect to egg size, hatchability, fry length and weight, was not affected by the feeding rates. Final mean weight and food conversion ratios were significantly influenced by feeding rates. Higher increase in ovary weight with increasing body weight: of mature females fed at 0.5% body weight than fishes receiving higher food levels suggests that in these fish, more food resources are diverted towards gonad building than to somatic growth.",About Sufficiency
The potential for carbon sequestration through reforestation of abandoned tropical agricultural and pasture lands,"Approximately half of the tropical biome is in some stage of recovery from past human disturbance, most of which is in secondary forests growing on abandoned agricultural lands and pastures. Reforestation of these abandoned lands, both natural and managed, has been proposed as a means to help offset increasing carbon emissions to the atmosphere. In this paper we discuss the potential of these forests to serve as sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide in aboveground biomass and soils. A review of literature data shows that aboveground biomass increases at a rate of 6.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years of succession, and at a rate of 2.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) over the first 80 years of regrowth. During the first 20 years of regrowth, forests in wet life zones have the fastest rate of aboveground carbon accumulation with reforestation, followed by dry and moist forests. Soil carbon accumulated at a rate of 0.41 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) over a 100-year period, and at faster rates during the first 20 years (1.30 Mg carbon ha(-1) yr(-1)). Past land use affects the rate of both above- and belowground carbon sequestration. Forests growing on abandoned agricultural land accumulate biomass faster than other past land uses, while soil carbon accumulates faster on sites that were cleared but not developed, and on pasture sites. Our results indicate that tropical reforestation has the potential to serve as a carbon offset mechanism both above- and belowground for at least 40 to 80 years, and possibly much longer. More research is needed to determine the potential for longer-term carbon sequestration for mitigation of atmospheric CO2 emissions.",About Sufficiency
Soil organic matter in water-stable aggregates under different soil management practices in a productive vineyard,"In a productive vineyard, the influence of different soil management practices on carbon sequestration and its dynamic in water-stable aggregates of Rendzin Leptosol was studied. In 2006, an experiment of different management practices in a productive vineyard was established in the locality of Nitra-Draovce, in the Nitra winegrowing area of Slovakia. The following treatments were established: (1) control (grass without fertilization); (2) T (tillage); (3) T+FM (tillage+farmyard manure); (4) G+NPK3 (grass+NPK 120-55-195 kgha(-1)); and (5) G+NPK1 (grass+NPK 80-35-135 kgha(-1)). The results showed that the lowest soil organic matter content (9.70 gkg(-1)) in water-stable microaggregates was determined in G+NPK3, as well as in T. However, the highest soil organic matter content in the highest size fractions of water-stable macroaggregates (>5mm) was observed in T+FM (19.7 g kg(-1)). The highest value for carbon sequestration capacity in water-stable microaggregates was observed in the ploughed farmyard manure treatment. However, the control treatment showed the highest values for carbon sequestration capacity in water-stable macroaggregates, including agronomically favourable size fractions (0.5-3 mm). In all soil management practices under a productive vineyard the most intensive changes in the soil organic matter content were observed in the highest size fractions (>3mm) of water-stable macroaggregates.",About Sufficiency
Simulating and Predicting Crop Yield and Soil Fertility under Climate Change with Fertilizer Management in Northeast China Based on the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer Model,"The risks of climate change and soil degradation for the agricultural environment and crop production are increasingly prominent. Based on the limitations of land resources, it is important to explore a sustainable and effective fertilization strategy to reduce risks and ensure there is a high yield of grain and sustainable development of agriculture. Soil fertility underpins cultivated land, which is the most important resource of agricultural production, and is also the key for maintaining agricultural sustainability. The central elements of soil fertility are soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil nitrogen (SN). This study applied the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer-Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM) and the CENTURY-based soil module to simulate the trends of crop yields, SN storages and SOC storages until the end of this century under different climate change circumstances, based on a 36-year long-term experiment established at Shenyang site, China. Four fertilizer practices were applied: control (CK), combined chemical fertilizer of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK), NPK with manure (MNPK), and NPK fertilizers plus a high application rate of manure (hMNPK). The outcomes indicated that the DSSAT model can fully simulate the yields of maize and soybean as well as the dynamic stocks of the SN and SOC. Three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5) for future development were chosen from the fifth assessment report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Moreover, a baseline was installed. Crop yields, SN, and SOC storages from 2016 to 2100 were estimated under four climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5, and Baseline). The RCP scenarios in some treatments reduced SN and SOC stocks and maize yield, and had no effect on soybean yield. However, the application of NPK with manure could improve crop yields, while it increased SN and SOC storages substantially. To some extent, the negative effects of climate scenarios could be mitigated by applying manure. In the RCP 4.5, maize yields of NPK, MNPK, and hMNPK treatments declined by 14.8%, 7.7%, and 6.2%, respectively, compared with that of NPK under Baseline. The NPK fertilizers plus manure treatments could cut the reduction of maize yield caused by climate change in half. Additionally, the SOC storage and SN of chemical fertilizers plus manure treatments under RCP scenarios increased by 20.2%-33.5% and 13.7%-21.7% compared with that of NPK under baseline, respectively. It was concluded that a rational combination of organic and inorganic fertilizer applications is a sustainable and effective agricultural measure to maintain food security and relieve environmental stresses.",About Sufficiency
Simulating Maize Productivity under Selected Climate Smart Agriculture Practices Using AquaCrop Model in a Sub-humid Environment,"Crop models are crucial in assessing the reliability and sustainability of soil water conservation practices. The AquaCrop model was tested and validated for maize productivity under the selected climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices in the rainfed production systems. The model was validated using final biomass (B) and grain yield (GY) data from field experiments involving seven CSA practices (halfmoon pits, 2 cm thick mulch, 4 cm thick mulch, 6 cm thick mulch, 20 cm deep permanent planting basins (PPB), and 30 cm deep) and the control (conventional practice) where no CSA was applied. Statistics for coefficient of determination (R-2), Percent bias (Pbias), and Nash-Sutcliffe (E) for B and GY indicate that the AquaCrop model was robust to predict crop yield and biomass as illustrated by the value of R-2 > 0.80, Pbias -1.52-1.25% and E > 0.68 for all the CSA practices studied. The relative changes between the actual and simulated water use efficiency (WUE) of grain yield was observed in most of the CSA practices. However, measured WUE was seemingly better in the 2 cm thick mulch, indicating a potential for water saving and yield improvement. Therefore, the AquaCrop model is recommended as a reliable tool for assessing the effectiveness of the selected CSA practices for sustainable and improved maize production; although, the limitations in severely low soil moisture conditions and water stressed environments should be further investigated considering variations in agroecological zones.",About Sufficiency
Simultaneous minimization of nitrous oxide and methane emission from rice paddy soils is improbable due to redox potential changes with depth in a greenhouse experiment without plants,"Rice (Oryza sativa L) paddy soils have the potential to emit both of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), depending on redox potential. Results from incubation studies with homogenized soil led to a proposed ""healthy redox potential"" range that minimizes both CH4 and N2O emission. We examined whether controlled irrigation with the water-saving practice of ""safe alternate wetting and drying"" (AWD) could maintain a healthy redox potential throughout the rooting layer of rice paddy soil in a greenhouse experiment without plants. We hypothesized that a surface redox potential for N2O and a rooting-depth redox potential for CH4 would both be important in determining gas emissions, making it difficult to minimize rice paddy greenhouse gas emissions through water management. We monitored gas emission for 7 weeks from soil treated by continuous flooding, AWD, or ""healthy redox"" water management, with and without rice residue incorporation, with no fertilizer application. Nitrous oxide, after the initial flush, was emitted only when the redox potential at 2-cm soil depth was above + 140 mV. Methane was emitted even when the 7.5-cm redox potential was above -150 mV. Measurement of dissolved CH4 in soil solution confirmed that there was 17 to 100 times more methane at 20-cm depth than 7.5 cm. with no significant differences between water treatments at 20 cm (P<0.05). The AWD treatment emitted significantly more N2O than the continuously flooded treatment (P<0.05), while the reverse was true for CH4 (P<0.05). Residue incorporation significantly increased CH4, but not N2O, emission in both water treatments (P<0.05), and thus had more impact than water management. We conclude that simultaneous minimization of both CH4 and N2O emission cannot be maintained in rice soils due to the redox potential changes with depth, but that appropriate water and residue management can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Without residue incorporation, continuous flooding has the lowest combined risk of N2O and CH4 emission, but with residue incorporation, AWD has similar or lower risk. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Smallholder farmers expand production area of the perennial crop enset as a climate coping strategy in a drought-prone indigenous agrisystem,"Societal Impact Statement Climate resilient crops will become increasingly important, especially in regions where smallholder farmers are vulnerable to climate extremes. Enset, a multipurpose perennial staple crop consumed by over 20 million people in Ethiopia, purportedly provides food security during periods of drought. Here, we find evidence that frequent severe drought events led to an increase in enset production area. This is consistent with a broader pattern whereby farmers preferentially cultivate perennial and storable crops after long-term drought events, providing an example of adaptation to fluctuations in climate through crop choice in indigenous agrisystems. Smallholder farms in the semiarid and subhumid tropics are particularly vulnerable to increased climate variability. Indigenous agrisystems that have co-evolved with climate variability may have developed resilience strategies. In the Southwest Ethiopian Highlands, agrisystems are dominated by the multipurpose perennial staple enset (Ensete ventricosum), characterised by flexible harvest timing, high yield, long storage, and putative drought tolerance, earning it the name 'the tree against hunger'. We tested three hypotheses using crop production area and climate data. First, that enset production area is greatest in the most drought-prone locations. Second, that farmers respond to drought events by increasing enset production area. And third, that drought encourages shifts in agrisystem composition more widely towards perennial or storable crops. We found that regions with a higher severe drought frequency are associated with significantly higher proportion of enset production. Similarly, the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index of the previous 3 years is significantly negatively correlated with enset production area time series, suggesting that prior drier conditions led farmers to increase the land under enset production. Regarding other crops, storage crops roots and tubers were also preferentially selected after long-term drought over annual crops, indicating their capacity for longer-term resilience. Promoting the production of crops such as perennials, which have more extensive and established root systems, may be a strategy to ensure food security during drought or climate variability. These results indicate the potential of farmer's resilience strategies to improve food security in a changing climate.",About Sufficiency
Small-scale low-tropic ocean farming and coastal rural landscapes: Why the logistics of seaweed matter? Insights from Ireland for collaborative planning,"Kelps are part of large brown macroalgae species with a fundamental role in temperate to subpolar coastal marine ecosystems and their cultivation has been expanding as part of several efforts and countries ' policies. This study explores the relevance of post-harvesting logistics planning involving marine operations of emerging seaweed-based supply chains including kelp species. In the Irish context, we explore the potential of collaboration among low-tropic ocean farming sectors regarding shared space and infrastructure in rural and remote landscapes. Based on empirical data and a novel methodological approach, a multi-method analysis was performed involving geographic information systems, mathematical modelling and qualitative content analysis. The results indicate large potential production and collaboration capacity if current licensed areas and existing infrastructure were integrated with kelp cultivation for further processing and distribution in 40 local supply hubs and 14 optimal locations for shared processing facilities. Moreover, the different transportation scenarios considered indicate that costs and greenhouse gas emissions could be minimised by reducing moisture content locally and with increased payload. Further linkages reveal uncertainties in the uses of alternative methods of preservation such as ensiling and a lack of attention to non-market values. For future valorisation in diverse commercial and non-commercial applications, seaweed farming and collaborative processing opportunities still need to be incorporated into societal discourses and futures envisioned by rural coastal communities, including the engagement of young generations in such transformation pathways.",About Sufficiency
Smart approaches to Aquaponics 4.0 with focus on water quality - Comprehensive review,"The fast growth of the world population associated with the ever-increasing need for food and the significant contribution of agriculture to anthropogenic global warming is driving the changes from conventional farming approaches to innovative and sustainable agriculture ones. One of these approaches is aquaculture which is founded on the principle of circular economy combining aquaculture and hydroponics in symbiose with aquaculture waste serving as nutrients for plant growth. Conventional Aquaponics has evolved to Aquaponics 4.0 with a fully automated and remote-controlled system for producing foods at an industrial scale. The implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) could simplify farmers' tasks with remote operations while allowing them to achieve automatic and precise control of inputs and outputs as well as to improve the overall efficiency of the system. This review focuses on the use of these smart technologies to analyze, monitor, and maintain good water quality and appropriate replenishment in Aquaponics systems.

Smart integration of food and bioenergy production delivers on multiple ecosystem services,"Agriculture is expected to feed an increasing global population while at the same time meeting demands for renewable energy and the supply of ecosystem services such as provision of nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration. However, the current structure of the agricultural system works against meeting these expectations. The spatial separation of crop and livestock farms has created negative environmental consequences, and bioenergy production has created a trade-off between food and energy production. In this paper, we explore the opportunities for ecological intensification at a regional scale made possible by combining food and energy production. We built three scenarios representing farming systems including biogas production using grass biomass and manure. These scenarios included the following: (a) The current system with energy production (CSE) from non-edible agricultural biomasses (CSE). (b) Agroecological symbiosis (AES) identical to CSE except with 20% of the arable cropping area converted to clover-grasses for use in biogas production. (c) Agroecological symbiosis with livestock (AES-LST) where the available grass biomass (20% as in the AES) is fed to livestock and manure then used as a feedstock in biogas production. In each scenario, nutrients were circulated back to crops in the form of digestate. The supply of soil functions (primary production for food and energy, provision of nutrient cycling, and climate mitigation) and impacts on water quality through nutrient losses in these three scenarios were then compared to the current system. Integrating biogas production into food production resulted in an increased supply of nutrient recycling, reduced nutrient losses, and increased carbon inputs to the soils indicating enhanced climate mitigation. Food production was either not affected (CSE), increased (AES-LST), or decreased (AES), and biogas was produced in substantial quantities in each scenario. Our study demonstrated potential synergies in integrating food and energy production without compromising other ecosystem services in each scenario.",About Sufficiency
SNAP Participants Improved Food Security And Diet After A Full-Service Supermarket Opened In An Urban Food Desert,"The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest US food and nutrition assistance program, tasked with improving food security among low-income households. Another federal effort to improve food access is the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI), which invested tens of millions of dollars to incentivize healthy food retail outlets in areas lacking access to nutritious, fresh food. We explore the intersection of these programs, testing the impact of a new, HFFI-financed full-service supermarket on SNAP participants in an urban food desert. After the supermarket's opening, SNAP participants' food security improved and intake of added sugars declined in the intervention neighborhood, but both were unchanged in a comparison neighborhood without a new supermarket. Intervention neighborhood participants also experienced relative declines in the percentage of daily calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars. Our findings suggest that HFFI amplifies the effects of SNAP participation on improving food security and dietary quality in food deserts.",About Sufficiency
Social conditions of smallholder dairy farmers influence their environmental decisions,"The objective of this study is to characterize the social conditions for making agricultural decisions. Particular attention is paid to sustainable agricultural practices in dairy farming. The theoretical framework has been developed around two major explicatory perspectives: sustainable development and quality of life. In the study, we assume that the regional dimension of problems related to the sustainable development of the dairy sector requires solutions adequate to the needs of the regions to create sustainable milk production systems. We put forward a thesis on the impact of objective living conditions of farmers on the readiness to introduce changes in the farm and to apply sustainable agricultural practices. The study has been carried out using the survey method, conducted in a face-to-face interview with fifty farmers engaged in milk production. This study contributes to revealing the role of social sustainability criteria for adopting environmentally friendly farming practices. The novelty of the approach is the use of in-depth sociological analysis in research on the sustainable development of agriculture in small farms (1-5 cows). The results have revealed a significant positive relationship between the assessment of farmers' well-being and the willingness to adopt sustainable agricultural practices. The results also suggest that the analysis of social determinants of agricultural decisions is essential for the implementation of the assumptions of sustainable agriculture. Here we demonstrate that the criteria of subjective well-being can be considered important factors in a positive attitude towards sustainable development and openness to changes in agricultural production.",About Sufficiency
Social Empowerment and Its Effect on Poverty Alleviation for Sustainable Development among Women Entrepreneurs in the Nigerian Agricultural Sector,"Despite the fact that the issue of female poverty is widespread, continuous attempts are made to combat it and advance women's empowerment. To achieve the goals of sustainable development, such as eradicating poverty, attaining gender equality, promoting good jobs and economic growth, and eliminating inequities, creative strategies must be developed. This study focused on the Nigerian Youth and Women Farmers Association in order to examine the effect of social empowerment on alleviating poverty in Nigeria's agricultural sector. Out of the 353 issued questionnaires, 335 were returned and used in this study's investigation. The structural equation model with partial least squares (SEM-PLS) was used to analyse the acquired data. The results showed an important correlation between social empowerment and reductions in poverty among women working in the agricultural sector. This highlights how crucial it is to work together, provide resources, and extend support in order to empower women socially and foster an atmosphere that supports their social and economic advancement. This research recommends that lawmakers, organisations, and governmental entities actively support the empowerment of women in the agricultural sector in order to encourage sustainable farming practices among female entrepreneurs.",About Sufficiency
Social inclusion increases with time for zero-tillage wheat in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains,"Sustainable intensification (SI) approaches to agricultural development are urgently needed to meet the growing demand for crop staples while protecting ecosystem services and environmental quality. However, SI initiatives have been criticized for neglecting social welfare outcomes. A recent review found that better-off farmers benefitted disproportionately from SI and highlighted the dearth of studies assessing the equity of outcomes. In this study, we explore the social inclusiveness of zero-tillage (ZT) wheat adoption in Bihar, India. ZT is a proven SI technology for enhancing wheat productivity while boosting profitability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural machinery in the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plains. With an average landholding size of 0.39 ha, most farmers in Bihar depend on custom-hiring services to access the technology. While service provision models should foster inclusive growth by reducing financial barriers to technology adoption, early evidence suggested that small-holders remained at a disadvantage. Building on this previous research, we use a panel dataset from 961 wheat-growing households that spans a six-year period to analyze ZT adoption dynamics over time while accounting for the role of social networks and access to service provision. Using a heckprobit approach to correct for non-exposure bias, we compare determinants of ZT awareness and use in 2012 and 2015. We apply a multinomial logit model to identify determinants of early adoption, recent adoption, nonadoption, and dis-adoption. Furthermore, we explore the quality of ZT services as an additional dimension of socially-inclusive technology access. We find that the strong initial scale bias in ZT use declined substantially as awareness of the technology increased and the service economy expanded. Land fragmentation replaced total landholding size as a significant adoption determinant, which also affected the quality of ZT services received. Hence, farmers with small but contiguous landholdings appear to have gained a significant degree of access over time. We conclude that early-stage assessments of SI may be misleading, and that private sector-based service provision can contribute to socially inclusive development outcomes as markets mature.

Social procurement practices in food logistics: A case study of a South European food processing company,"The covid-19 pandemic has shown how an unpredictable event may affect the sustainability of the entire food supply chain highlighting the need for a sustainable approach to food logistics. While existing literature has focused on production and consumption, little attention has been paid to measuring social sustainability in food transportation. This is a critical gap, as transportation plays a vital role in ensuring the timely and safe delivery of food. This paper proposes a novel approach to measure social sustainability in the context of food logistics within a South European food processing company. The focus is on assessing social procurement practices at the level of logistics suppliers. The methodology developed is based on two levels, seven dimensions, and twenty-one food logistics social sustainability indicators. To validate this, the methodology is adopted to assess the social procurement of five food logistics suppliers (FLS) of a European food company and found significant variations in performance across different dimensions. The results suggest that the dimension in which suppliers perform well are: ""characteristics and work welfare"", ""health of employees"", and ""human rights implementation and integration"". On the other hand, the dimensions that score lowest for all suppliers are ""diversity and equal opportunities"", ""external stakeholder community capital"", and ""innovation practices"". The strength of this methodology lies in its ability to quantify social sustainability in food logistics and its practical implementation within the food logistics company, as well as among its logistics suppliers, in terms of social procurement. The results offer valuable insights and suggestions for the case study food company to improve their consideration of social sustainability aspects in a more comprehensive and effective manner throughout their business operations.",About Sufficiency

Lastly, we explore how sociocultural change for sustainable or healthy diets is already happening through food movements, food lifestyles, and traditional diets.",About Sufficiency
"Socio-ecological Challenges and Adaptation Strategies of Farmers Towards Changing Climate in Vindhyan highlands, India","The Indian agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change which adversely affects crop production and livelihood of farmers. The effect is more intensified in Vindhyan highlands, where prolong drought and high rate of poverty exist in depredation environment. In this context, present study conducted to explore farmers' perception, attitude about climate change and adaptive capabilities. We undertook an interview schedules survey through structured questionnaire in Duddhi block of Sonbhadra district. A total of 400 households were selected in which 347 (86.75%) male and 53 (13.25%) female respondents have participated. The perception of farmers on climate change is presented in SI (severity index) which varies from 36% to 68.63%.

Socio-ecological changes on the Loess Plateau of China after Grain to Green Program,"Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) is now widely accepted as a policy tool for advancing both ecological and social progress. The Chinese government's Grain to Green Program (GTGP) is the world's largest PES program. It was initiated nearly 20 years ago to reverse previous environmental degradation. However, it is difficult to achieve both conservation and economic ""win-win"" gains, and care is needed in monitoring environmental and socioeconomic outcomes. Here we choose the Loess Plateau (LP), the area where GTGP was implemented most intensively, to study the social-ecological changes after GTGP and determine whether these changes are related to GTGP. The results show that LP has achieved ""win-win"" gains of restoring environment and promoting socioeconomic development: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series show a significant greening trend, and soil retention and carbon sequestration services have improved from 2000 to 2015. Simultaneously, grain output from the LP has increased by 56.7%. We also analyzed the effects of afforestation on changes of socio-ecological factors, and find that the changes of NDVI, soil erosion, and carbon sequestration mainly reflect the degree of afforestation rather than climate change, while the correlations between changes of socioeconomic factors and degree of afforestation are insignificant. We conclude that, despite some adverse outcomes such as water yield reduction, GTGP in LP has achieved considerable overall success in environmental factors. However, comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the social impacts of GTGP is needed, as the impacts are clouded by multiple socioeconomic factors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Socioeconomic barriers of nitrogen management for agricultural and environmental sustainability,"Synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers support global food production and feed over half of the global population. However, more than half of the N fertilizers applied to croplands are not absorbed by crops, but lost to the environment, leading to low N use efficiency (NUE) globally. Identifying and overcoming socioeconomic barriers to achieve an improvement of NUE and a reduction in N loss is thus key for N management and to attain agricultural and environmental sustainability. In this paper, we compiled the global cropland N budgets at a national scale (1961-2018) and developed robust econometric models to explore the relationship between cropland N use with socioeconomic factors. The results demonstrate that economic development and farm size are the key drivers to improve NUE for agricultural and environmental sustainability. In less developed countries, it is difficult for farmers to access chemical fertilizers, leading to croplands receiving too little N input and at a high NUE, but suffering from soil N depletion. As economic development progresses, more fertilizer is produced and applied, but smallholder farming typically leads to over-fertilization and consequently N losses to the environment. Large-scale farming improves NUE, reduces N loss and benefits agricultural production and environmental protection. Also, interactions between farm size and economic development, international trade, crop and livestock systems, and related policies are important causes for changes in the NUE of the whole agricultural system. Overcoming these socioeconomic barriers especially combining large-scale farming could effectively reduce excessive N inputs and sustain agricultural and environmental N management, while maintaining food production, resulting in a triple-win for food security, poverty alleviation, and environmental protection.",About Sufficiency

Soil microbiome interventions for carbon sequestration and climate mitigation,"Mitigating climate change in soil ecosystems involves complex plant and microbial processes regulating carbon pools and flows. Here, we advocate for the use of soil microbiome interventions to help increase soil carbon stocks and curb greenhouse gas emissions from managed soils. Direct interventions include the introduction of microbial strains, consortia, phage, and soil transplants, whereas indirect interventions include managing soil conditions or additives to modulate community composition or its activities. Approaches to increase soil carbon stocks using microbially catalyzed processes include increasing carbon inputs from plants, promoting soil organic matter (SOM) formation, and reducing SOM turnover and production of diverse greenhouse gases. Marginal or degraded soils may provide the greatest opportunities for enhancing global soil carbon stocks. Among the many knowledge gaps in this field, crucial gaps include the processes influencing the transformation of plant-derived soil carbon inputs into SOM and the identity of the microbes and microbial activities impacting this transformation. As a critical step forward, we encourage broadening the current widespread screening of potentially beneficial soil microorganisms to encompass functions relevant to stimulating soil carbon stocks. Moreover, in developing these interventions, we must consider the potential ecological ramifications and uncertainties, such as incurred by the widespread introduction of homogenous inoculants and consortia, and the need for site-specificity given the extreme variation among soil habitats. Incentivization and implementation at large spatial scales could effectively harness increases in soil carbon stocks, helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change.",About Sufficiency
Soil quality: why and how?,"The soil quality concept evolved throughout the 1990s in response to increased global emphasis on sustainable land use and with a holistic focus emphasizing that sustainable soil management requires more than soil erosion control. The concept includes two areas of emphasis-education and assessment-both based soundly on principles of soil science. Soil quality test kits, farmer-based scorecards, visual assessment procedures, fact sheets, and video presentations were developed as educational materials because many people have no basis to recognize, understand or appreciate the complexity of soil resources. Assessment tools for indexing soil quality at various scales were pursued to show the multiple functions (e.g. nutrient and water cycling, filtering and buffering of contaminants, decomposition of crop residues and other organic matter sources, and recycling of essential plant nutrients) that soils provide as the foundation for sustainable land management. Worldwide research and technology transfer efforts have increased awareness that soil resources have both inherent characteristics determined by their basic soil formation factors and dynamic characteristics influenced by human decisions and management practices. Soil quality assessment and education are intended to provide a better understanding and awareness that soil resources are truly living bodies with biological, chemical, and physical properties and processes performing essential ecosystem services.

A Bayesian spatial durbin probit model is used to survey data collected from farmers in the Waikato region of New Zealand. The results show that farmers located near each other exhibit similar choice behaviour, indicating the importance of farmer interactions in adoption decisions. The results also address that information acquisition is the most important determinant of farmers' adoption of best management practices. Financial problems are considered a significant barrier to adopting best management practices. Overall, the existence of distance decay effect and spatial dependence in farmers' adoption decisions highlights the importance of accounting for spatial effects in farmers' decision-making, which emerges as crucial to the formulation of sustainable agriculture policy.",About Sufficiency
Spatial restrictions inadvertently doubled the carbon footprint of Norway's mackerel fishing fleet,"The ocean is increasingly used for industry, energy and recreation or protected for conservation, resulting in increasing spatial restrictions for fisheries. Simultaneously, producing seafood with a low climate footprint is becoming increasingly important. Despite this, the effects of spatial restrictions on the emissions of fishing fleets are poorly known. In the Northeast Atlantic, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU (Brexit) meant that the UK regained autonomy in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This suddenly imposed a spatial restriction for several foreign fishing fleets targeting Northeast Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus). Here, we use this natural experiment and open fisheries data to investigate how Brexit affected the performance and emissions of the Norwegian mackerel fishery. As the fleet was excluded from fishing grounds in the UK, the catch per fishing trip almost halved, while the number of trips per vessel doubled. As a result, fuel use intensity (FUI) more than doubled from similar to 0.08 to similar to 0.18 L fuel per kg mackerel. We estimate that this shift required an additional 23 million liters of fuel per year, causing additional fuel costs of similar to<euro>18 million annually and emitting an additional similar to 72,000 tonnes CO2 per year(.) The policy change undid similar to 15 years of improved fuel efficiency in Norwegian pelagic fisheries. These findings provide rare empirical evidence on how spatial restrictions can undermine progress towards decreasing greenhouse gas emissions in fisheries, highlighting the need to monitor and account for emissions in fisheries management and consider these trade-offs in marine spatial management.",About Sufficiency
Spatio-temporal variation and relationship between agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity in a semi-arid region of India,"A surging population in Karnataka State, a semi-arid region in India, poses a threat to both food security and livelihood sustainability, necessitating a concentrated effort to bolster agricultural efficiency and achieve United Naton's Sustainable Development Goal 2 (zero hunger). Therefore, in order to address the pressing issue of food scarcity in Karnataka, this study meticulously examined the spatio-temporal variation of agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity in Karnataka, uncovering its significant dependence of agricultural efficiency on irrigation intensity. Specifically, this study used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to ascertain significant differences in the means of agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity during 2004-2005 and 2018-2019. This study showed that the maximum improvement in agricultural efficiency index was recorded in Belgaum (40.24), Gulbarga (24.77), and Yadgir districts (22.92) between 2004-2005 and 2018-2019, which indicated the progressing trend and better scope for agriculture extension. On the contrary, some districts expressed threat (a decline of above 20.00 of agricultural efficiency index) and needed special care for the improvement of agricultural efficiency in four northern districts (Bagalkot, Bidar, Raichur, and Bijapur), three southern districts (Chitradurga, Chikballapur and Hassan), and two southern districts (Koppal and Gadag) in Karnataka. During 2004-2005, irrigation intensity varied from 3.19% to 56.39%, with the lowest irrigation intensity in Kodagu District and the highest irrigation intensity in Shimoga District. During 2018-2019, irrigation intensity changed from 0.77% to 72.77%, with the lowest irrigation intensity in Kodagu District and the highest in Dakshin Kannad District. Moreover, the research scrutinized the complex relationship between agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity, with the correlation coefficient increased from 0.162 during 2004-2005 to 0.255 during 2018-2019. It implies that in both periods, a low positive correlation existed between these two variables. Over time, several factors (high-yield seeds and chemical fertilizers) other than irrigation intensity gradually became essential for agricultural efficiency. This research offers a wealth of valuable insights for regional planners and policy-makers contending with comparable challenges in various regions of India and other developing countries.",About Sufficiency
"Productivity, biodiversity trade-offs, and farm income in an agroforestry versus an arable system","The uptake of diversified farming systems is constrained by a scarcity of evidence regarding financial costs, benefits, and risks. Here, we evaluate the productivity and projected farm income of an agroforestry system, where apples are integrated with arable crops, by combining primary data with ecosystem service and costbenefit models. Our ecosystem service assessments included: 1) weed and pest associations with arable yields; 2) apple seed set as a proxy for pollination, and; 3) carbon sequestration. Arable yields were up to 11% lower in agroforestry than arable systems, and were significantly negatively associated with weed cover in both systems. Apple yields in agroforestry were similar to typical yields from comparable orchards. Apple seed set was significantly higher in agroforestry than conventional orchards for one of two varieties. Predicted gross mixed income was higher in agroforestry than arable systems in 15 of 18 productivity scenarios over 20 years, which was supported by a case-study. Apple yield and price were the major determinants of gross mixed income. Payments for carbon sequestration were predicted to contribute 47% to 88% of agroforestry establishment costs. This study demonstrates how a diversified farming system can improve farm income, but grant support would reduce the initial negative cash-flow.",About Sufficiency
"Status of research, regulations and challenges for genetically modified crops in India","A large number of genetically modified (GM) crops, including both food and non-food crops carrying novel traits have been developed and released for commercial agriculture production. Soybean, maize, canola and cotton for the traits insect resistance and herbicide tolerance are the main crops under commercial cultivation worldwide. In addition, many other GM crops are under development and not yet released commercially. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in its report, the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2017, highlights the severity of food security and malnourishment problem in most of the Asian and developing countries. GM crops could be an option for nutrients enhancement and yield increase in major crops and solve the problem of malnourishment and food security. India has progressed tremendously in GM crops research, evaluation and monitoring in last two decades but regulatory system impeded gravely due to lack of coordination and common stand on GM technology across different governments, ministries and departments. The increasing cultivation of genetically modified crops has raised a wide range of concerns with respect to food safety, environmental effects and socio-economic issues.

Plant pathogen infection risk and climate change in the Nordic and Baltic countries,"Climate change and global warming are already affecting food production, and the impact is predicted to intensify in the future. Previous studies have been based on global data and have provided general information about climate change effects on food production. Regional high-resolution data are, however, needed to evaluate the effect of future scenarios of climate change to support strategic and tactical planning to safeguard food production. Here, we provide results on the future potential distribution range of fungal plant pathogens in the Nordic and Baltic countries. This is done using regional climate model data at 12.5 km horizontal resolution. The temperature dependent infection risk and species richness are calculated using data for 80 plant pathogens. Within the region the studied pathogens will in most cases thrive more and be more abundant in a warmer climate; leading to a longer infection risk season and the introduction of new pathogens. This applies to all emissions scenarios, even though the effects are stronger with high emissions. Our results indicate that plant diseases will increase, and this will negatively affect crop production and food security.",About Sufficiency
STRAW MULCHING CAN REALIZE SOIL/PLANTS CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND YIELD INCREASING OF SUMMER MAIZE IN NORTH CHINA,"North China Plain is a main grain producing area in China. It is very important for China to find a simple and low carbon method for grain production. To better understand the potential for increasing grain yield and carbon absorption, treatment effects of straw mulching on grain yield, carbon absorption in crop growth period, and soil CO2 emission characteristics in 2012-2014 summer maize growing seasons were quantified. The experiment involved summer maize with two straw mulching rates, i.e., 0 and 0.6 kg m(-2). The result showed that soil respiration rate in straw mulching (M) was significantly lower than that in non-mulching (N). The carbon absorption and grain yield in M was significantly higher than that in N. In the three growing seasons, ear number, kernels per row, 1000-kernel weight, and grain yield in M were higher than that in N by 4.07%, 4.03%, 10.93%, and 20.54%, respectively.

"Strengths and weaknesses of crop diversification: a case study conducted in Vendee, France","Regarding environmental challenges, crop diversification provides some of the answers. Nevertheless, whatever the strengths, some weak points come up: low economical interest, knowledge of technical practices, lack of chain value and industry organization providing outlets and value. The authors present the results of a case study conducted in France (Pays de la Loire). Among the determining criteria identified in the study, which can turn into an incentive or disincentive factor, we can list: (1) turn-around time and location of the diversification crop inside the rotation, (2) environmental constraints (soil quality, soils sensibility to drought), (3) the work required and complexity of the cultural practices, (5) the potential synergy with stockbreeding and (6) technical support. If economic performance of those crops appears to be often considered too low, the study underlines how the lack of knowledge about diversification encourages farmers-respondents to adopt a ""wait and see"" attitude.",About Sufficiency
Suitability Evaluation of Cultivated Land Reserved Resources in Arid Areas Based on Regional Water Balance,"With rapid socioeconomic and population growth, high-quality arable land resources are decreasing daily, especially in arid areas, which makes arable land reserve resources an important way to supplement arable land. How to accurately evaluate cultivated land reserve resources is of great significance to socioeconomic development and sustainable land use in arid areas. Therefore, this study selected Hangjin Banner as a typical area and calculated the regional maximum available irrigation water based on the principle of regional water balance. Then, the ""irrigation area check algorithm"" was used to evaluate the amount of cultivated land reserve resources, and policy recommendations were proposed for the development and utilization of cultivated land resources. The results showed that Hangjin Banner had no cultivated land reserve resources under the current irrigation method and had cultivated land reserve resources under the efficient water-saving irrigation method, but only in the southern zone during normal and partially abundant water years. Therefore, we believe that arid areas should adhere to the ""set land by water"" principle, the allocation of water resources should be optimized, and cultivated land resources with high quality should be utilized based on the actual regional conditions.",About Sufficiency
Screening of siderophore-producing salt-tolerant rhizobacteria suitable for supporting plant growth in saline soils with iron limitation,"Iron (Fe) bioavailability to plants is reduced in saline soils; therefore, plants growing in arid soils face two major challenges for poor crop productivity: high salinity and Fe deficiency. Siderophore-producing plant growthpromoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) could be a promising alternative to chemical fertilizers that could tackle salt stress and Fe limitation in saline soils concurrently. Here, four salt-tolerant PGPR, isolated from the root area of salt-prone rice fields of Bangladesh were studied to evaluate their siderophore-producing ability. Bacillus aryabhattai MS3 exhibited the highest production, estimated at 60% and 43% under non-saline and saline (200mM NaCl) conditions respectively. The expression of the entD gene, which is involved in the biosynthesis of siderophore was evidenced irrespective of saline states. Therefore, consideration of such salt-tolerant, siderophoreproducing PGPR for producing biofertilizer could be an eco-friendly innovation for climate-smart agriculture in salinized soils with limited iron availability.",About Sufficiency
Serving Social Justice: The Role of the Commons in Sustainable Food Systems,"Food is a source of sustenance, a cause for celebration, an inducement to temptation, a vehicle for power, an indicator of well-being, a catalyst for change and, above all, a life good. Along with other life goods such as potable water, clean air, adequate shelter and protective clothing, food is something we cannot live without. The global corporate food system, however, allows 800 million to go hungry, while an even larger number of people grow obese. Based in money-values, this food system promotes accumulation first and foremost, enriching a few while creating economic, social and environmental externalities that are destroying local economies, devastating individuals, families and communities and degrading the planet. What would a food system look like that was based in life-values, centred on the commons and anchored by social justice?

Local food: the social construction of a concept,"Recently there has been more focus on food in general and local food in particular. But what is local food? And what are the perceptions of this concept according to theory and to providers and consumers of local food? This article first summarises and compares three different theoretical perspectives on local food, namely experience economy, local food systems and what is termed pro-industrialism. These have differing and sometimes opposite conceptualisations and aims for the concept of local food. Using the perspective of experience economy as theoretical background, the concept of local food as expressed by a group of Danish providers and consumers is empirically investigated through interviews, observation and surveys. From this, qualitative and quantitative data are generated, the analysis of which shows how varied perceptions of local food are. The elements of which the perceptions consist are identified and then categorised according to whether they pertain to the food product itself or the production methods and facilities and whether they describe physical or social properties of local food. From this a model with four categories is developed. It is found that properties of the product are more frequently mentioned than properties of the production process. Providers emphasise social properties of the product more often than consumers, and consumers emphasise physical properties of the product more often than providers. Inversely, providers emphasise physical properties of production more than consumers, who emphasise social properties of production more than providers. Experience marketing and events may create diffusion of a local food concept, but only when communication is massive and long-lasting. So far this has not been the case, hence there is no agreement in either theory or among the providers and consumers studied on what local food is.

Sustainability of sugarcane production in Brazil. A review,"Brazil is a major sugarcane producer and its production more than doubled over the last decades to meet global bioenergy demands for reducing crude oil dependency and mitigating climate change. Nevertheless, the adverse effects of this growth on jeopardizing the sustainability of sugarcane production are not known, especially when environmental impacts of agricultural inputs and production processes are not judiciously managed. This article is a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-knowledge and the main advances made thus far in the sugarcane sector. Here, we review the major environmental impacts of rapidly expanding sugarcane plantation on the land use change and its competition with food production, as well as those associated with sugarcane cultivation in Brazil. Our main finding are that sugarcane plantation did not contribute to direct deforestation, and its expansion on degraded pastures with the attendant increased yields of food crops and livestock intensification decreased land competition between food and sugarcane. Non-burning sugarcane harvesting is a win-win strategy because of its benefits involving agronomic and environmental aspects, but soil compaction is among the main issues in sugarcane cropping systems. Sugarcane is highly efficient in terms of nitrogen use efficiency, which is an important factor for its high energy balance. But, special attention should be given regarding emissions of nitrous oxide when straw mulching is combined with application of nitrogen fertilizer and vinasse. Recent advances in the sugarcane sector also show significant reductions in water consumption, making sugarcane ethanol one of the most favorable options in terms of water footprint. Growing realization of a vast potential indicates the need to further enhance the environmental benefits of sugarcane ethanol by optimizing the agricultural production chain. Based on this improved knowledge, the adoption of best management practices is among researchable priorities that can be developed to consolidate the large potential of sugarcane production towards greater sustainability.",About Sufficiency

Some of these systems are not only more sustainable than modern technologies, but more resilient in the face of environmental extremes. Ancient engineering and agricultural methods are often more appropriate for developing countries than modern technologies based on fossil fuel and imported materials.

Sustainable agriculture can also benefit the developed world by increasing yields, promoting biodiversity and supporting the rural economy.",About Sufficiency
Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change: Producing Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) and Bush Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) for Improved Food Security and Resilience in a Canadian Subarctic First Nations Community,"Aboriginal people in Canada experience disproportionately high rates of diet-related illnesses, such as obesity and diabetes. Food insecurity has been identified as a contributing factor to these illnesses along with a loss of traditional lifestyle. Current food systems within northern subarctic and arctic regions of Canada rely heavily on imported foods that are expensive (when available), and are environmentally unsustainable. A warming subarctic and arctic climate present challenges, but also offers the opportunity for local agricultural production that can increase food security and promote a more sustainable food system. In this study the feasibility of sustainably growing potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) utilizing agroforestry practices to enhance food security in remote subarctic communities is explored through a case study in Fort Albany First Nation in northern Ontario, Canada. Potato crops were grown over a two-year period and rotated into plots that had been planted with green bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.).

Sustainable supply chain design in the food system with dietary considerations: A multi-objective analysis,"Food is a vital component of everyday life, however current consumption and production patterns pose a threat to the environment and the food security of future generations. Thus, with environmental burdens becoming more apparent and rising societal awareness, it is time to reconsider dietary choices and the food system behind it. This paper presents a novel application of a network design problem, addressing sustainability issues in the context of the global food system. Taking into account several echelons and interlinkages between different food supply chains, the paper broadens the scope of the considered network and incorporates sourcing, processing and transportation decisions within a common framework. While minimising different environmental and economic objectives, the model aims to maintain a sufficient dietary intake level. Consumption decisions are incorporated in the model through different types of consumer demands. The problem is formulated based on linear programming and further analysis is carried out by applying the E-constraint method and compromise programming. Investigating alternative production and consumption scenarios as well as trade-offs between the conflicting objectives, the study is illustrated based on a nutritional case study and underpinned by real-life LCA data. The findings of this research are manifold, highlighting the importance of considering consumption and production decisions in an integrated and global setting. Moreover, the choice of sustainability indicator plays a crucial role given the often conflicting nature of different sustainability aspects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

"Sustaining vulnerable agroecosystems with compost: Lasting benefits to soil health and carbon storage in semiarid winter wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.)","Wheat agroecosystems provide one of the most important crops worldwide yet are often threatened by land degradation and climate change, making it vital to find practices that sustain soil health. Organic amendments can regenerate degraded soils, provide plant-available nutrients, and sequester carbon (C), and have long-lasting impacts in semiarid regions. This project evaluated the legacy of compost (0-50 Mg ha(-1)) in an organic winter wheat-fallow rotation by comparing soil health and plant growth either 1-2 or 5-6 years after compost application, with or without cover crops. We assessed soil chemistry, structure, labile organic matter pools, microbial activity (by extracellular enzymes), and microbial community composition (by phospholipid fatty acids). We aimed to understand how compost application and cover cropping contribute to long-term soil health and C storage in semiarid regions, and how these practices impact soil microbiology. Compost resulted in sustained increases in organic matter pools, but only marginally benefitted plant growth and soil structure. Compost did not impact microbial community composition or activity, possibly because cold and dry conditions inhibited microbial functioning and compost decomposition. Cover crops did not impact soil organic matter or microbiology. Overall, we found that compost can contribute to long-term soil C storage in semiarid degraded soils such as these, despite having no measurable impacts on soil microbial biomass or activity.",About Sufficiency
Multi-temporal remote sensing of ground cover reveals beneficial effects of soil carbon farming in a semi-arid landscape,"Sustainable land management practices are a strategic tool for addressing land degradation processes that threaten agroecosystem services supply. Currently, carbon credit schemes are important promoters of the adoption of such practices, yet their effectiveness on providing services other than carbon sequestration is not frequently assessed. Particularly, vegetation cover may not only be a mediator of CO2 fixation, but also act as protection against soil erosion and prevent water quality deterioration. The overarching aim was to develop generalizable methods to assess the effectiveness of sustainable land management practices for maintaining agroecosystem integrity. To achieve this, we assessed the effect of soil carbon sequestration practices on remotely sensed groundcover levels and its stability, and on its response to short-term antecedent accumulated rainfall. These methods were tested in the Cowra Trough, an agricultural region of semi-arid New South Wales, Australia. Time series statistics (mean and standard deviation) and non-parametric tests were used to analyse temporal change in remotely sensed groundcover on paddocks undergoing different land management change intensities. This was complemented with a regional scale analysis of the effect of land use to contextualize paddock-scale results. Moreover, sequential linear regressions of remotely sensed vegetation cover response to antecedent rainfall through a moving temporal window were employed to assess trends in this relationship. A significant effect of land management change was demonstrated: over 90% of the sites implementing sustainable practices had increased and more stable ground cover levels, and the same number (though not the same sites) decreased their ground cover dependence on rainfall. The size of the effect was not related to the intensity of management change implemented for soil carbon sequestration. Land use type proved to be an important spatiotemporal predictor of ground cover and its stability at the Cowra Trough scale with cropping performing worse than grazing systems. Notably, the implementation of carbon farming practices was found to have a more prevalent positive impact on ground cover than on soil carbon contents, suggesting that such practices may provide cobenefits even when no carbon sequestration occurred. This study advances the possibility of monitoring agroecosystem multifunctionality and the development of integrative 'payment for ecosystem services' schemes.",About Sufficiency
"INVESTIGATING THE LINK BETWEEN SOIL QUALITY AND AGRICULTURAL LAND USE CHANGE. A CASE STUDY IN THE LAKE BALATON CATCHMENT, HUNGARY","The social, political and economical driving forces behind land use change in Central and Eastern European countries, such as land privatisation and EU-membership are well documented. However, there are few studies that examine the possible role of environmental characteristics such as soil quality in land use change, and most of these studies keep a marginal importance of the environmental factors on the land use change. The objective of this study is to investigate the regional scale relationship between soil quality and land use change before (1981-1990), during (1990-2000), and after (2000-2006) the land privatisation in Hungary. The Lake Balaton catchment was selected as a study area for such analysis because of its rapidly changing historic landscapes which are well-documented in terms of data availability. Historic land use data were obtained from military topographic maps (1981), CORINE land cover maps (1990, 2000) and satellite images (2006) at 1:100,000 scale. The National Soil Quality Evaluation System (NSES) is used for representing soil quality by 'soil quality scores' that lump various soil parameters such as organic matter content, soil texture and erosion level, derived from regional soil mapping. GIS methods were used to analyse, verify and evaluate soil quality and it is connection with the agricultural land use change. Results of this study show that soil quality has a relevant role in shaping rural landscape patterns in Hungary. It is demonstrated that the soil quality acts as a location factor in the case of arable land use change between 1981-1990. In this period, arable lands have been moved to areas where the best soils were found. Models that are used to predict future land use changes should therefore take into account the change patterns (arable land migration) described in this paper. Results also show that spatial land use change can be linked to the pattern of the complex NSES soil quality scoring systems.",About Sufficiency
"The influence of natural preparations on the chemical composition, flesh structure and sensory quality of pepper fruit in organic greenhouse cultivation","Due to the emphasis on sustainable development and environmental protection, searching for new technologies in the production of fruit and vegetables is essential. Organic farming using natural preparations is aimed to produce healthy food, rich in nutrients that is unmodified and uncontaminated. Pepper fruit is characterized by its valuable chemical composition and dietary and taste values. The available information on the influence of natural preparations on pepper fruit is insufficient. Therefore, this study was aimed at evaluating the influence of the natural preparations and plant extracts, such as organic fertilizer Bio-algeen S90, growth and development stimulator Natural Crop (R) SL, nettle extract (fertilizer with a killing and nutritional effect) on the chemical composition, structure (image texture), and sensory quality of Devito F1 and Sprinter F1 pepper fruit in organic greenhouse cultivation under the conditions for organic farming. The combination of measurements of chemical properties, flesh image features, and sensory analysis for assessing the quality of pepper treated with these preparations is a great novelty of this study. The obtained results showed that the use of Bio-algeen S90 and Natural Crop (R) SL had an impact on the increase in the total yield compared to the control samples. Furthermore, the application of Bio-algeen S90 and Natural Crop (R) SL increased the content of nutrients and health-promoting compounds, such as total sugars, L-ascorbic acid, total polyphenols, and carotenoids for both pepper cultivars Devito F1 and Sprinter F1. The applied natural preparations had an impact on the flesh structure, which was greater for pepper Devito F1. The selected image textures allowed for distinguishing pepper slices in terms of natural preparations with higher accuracies for Devito F1 than Sprinter F1.

The study found that the prevalence of malnutrition is significantly higher in the mountains than nationally in both Pakistan and Nepal and identifies the decline in the cultivation and use of micronutrient-rich NUFCs as one of the key reasons for this. The deterioration of local food systems, changing food habits, lack of knowledge about the cultivation, use and nutritional value of NUFCs and lack of attention to NUFCs in programs and policies are the key reasons for the abandoning of NUFCs by mountain communities. There is an urgent need to mainstream these crops into national programs and policies and to integrate them into local food systems.

To gain better insight into the temporal variability of the impact of biochar on gross soil N dynamics, two N-15 tracing experiments, in combination with numerical data analysis, were conducted with soil from a biochar field trial, 1day and 1year after application of a woody biochar type. The results showed accelerated soil N cycling immediately following biochar addition, with increased gross N mineralization (+34%), nitrification (+13%) and ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) immobilization rates (+4500% and +511%, respectively). One year after biochar application, the biochar acted as an inert substance with respect to N cycling. In the short term, biochar's labile C fraction and a pH increase can explain stimulated microbial activity, while in the longer term, when the labile C fraction has been mineralized and the pH effect has faded, the accelerating effect of biochar on N cycling ceases. In conclusion, biochar accelerates soil N transformations in the short-term through stimulating soil microbial activity, thereby increasing N bio-availability. This effect is, however, temporary.",About Sufficiency
Territorialising Local Food Systems for an Agroecological Transition in Latin America,"An agroecological transition can enhance resilience by several means, e.g., managing ecological relationships through agroecosystems, enhancing farmers' knowledge of natural resources, recycling those resources, maintaining biodiversity, and thus, flexibly adapting to environmental stresses. However, the hegemonic agri-food system has been continuing its capitalist transition, thereby undermining agroecological methods and deterritorialising social bonds. Facing this pervasive threat, an agroecological transition needs a greater convergence between agroecological production and a solidarity economy (economia solidaria or EcoSol in Latin America). Their convergence can be called EcoSol-agroecology, based on short food supply chains (called circuitos cortos there). These efforts develop territorial markets, generate more stable livelihoods, and thus keep producers on the land. In our study, each research team collaborated with an EcoSol-agroecology network to develop Participatory Action Research methods. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted their circuitos cortos, stimulating creative adaptations or alternatives, alongside demands for policy support measures. These networks have regionally territorialised local initiatives, while also confronting obstacles from the hegemonic system. Although socioecological resilience often means a system's capacity to bounce back, here it has meant bouncing forwards through new opportunities for solidaristic livelihoods and bonds. EcoSol-agroecology networks, agri-extensionists, and researchers have jointly developed such counter-hegemonic strategies, as illustrated by the case studies here.",About Sufficiency
Territory in urban food policies: the case of Spain,"Over the last few decades, cities have taken on an active role in the formulation of food policies in line with the transition toward local, sustainable food systems. These policies have been materialized through the formulation of systemic, holistic urban food strategies. By setting up spatial, relational and organizational proximity circuits, they aim to reconnect the places involved in the production and consumption of food within the territory. The objective is to do so by interaction between the networks of actors on the different geographical scales. This article analyzes the food policies of six Spanish cities that signed the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact. Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Vitoria, Valladolid and Zaragoza have fulfilled their promise by formulating food strategies that set out their commitment to the construction of new, urban food systems that reconsider, from a territorial perspective, the relationship between the city and food. Using a conceptual framework that spans two well-known theoretical systems (the local territorial systems (LoTS) and the sustainable food networks (SFN)); a systematic review of the documents generated in the formulation of the urban food policies is carried out. The territorial capital linked to food is examined; the systems of actors that make up the food strategies are identified; the models of governance that the said strategies deploy and their capacity for self-organization are typified; and the potential of the public agendas for encouraging the construction of localized alternatives and the territorial sustainability of the urban food systems are evaluated. The results suggest that the Spanish urban food strategies, although conceptually inspired by the principles of the Milan Pact, are still far from possessing similarly transformative capacities. Such capacities are directly linked to the characteristics of the place: the existence of relational goods connected to food, the attributes of the territorial food capital, the density of the social capital, and the culture of the territorial planning. Beyond the generic references to the commitment to food, it is the context that determines its personality and reach, the solidity of the food governance, and the political sustainability of the processes that one wishes to set up.",About Sufficiency
Testing participation constraints in contract design for sustainable soil conservation in Ethiopia,"This paper focuses on contract design to improve the incentive structure of current coordination mechanisms related to sustainable land use management in the Ethiopian highlands. The main objective is to assess whether, and if so under which terms and conditions, rural households are willing to enter into contractual agreements to invest in soil conservation measures on their land. Participation constraints are tested under different soil erosion and institutional-economic conditions in a choice experiment targeting 750 rural households. We show that contracts provided by local government peasant associations offering additional credit, land use security and extension services could be an effective means to increase the share of farmers implementing soil conservation measures. However, trust in contract terms and conditions appears to play an important role. Farmers living in the most erosion prone areas are most likely to participate, while farmers taking soil conservation measures already are less likely to enter into a contractual agreement with the local government. Farmers not taking soil conservation measures will only do so if the contract price is lower than or equal to the income losses suffered from soil erosion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The Additional Costs of Organic Food Products - A Basket of Goods-based Analysis Differentiated by Income,"Sustainable consumption is an urgent issue regarding the rising global environmental pressures. Consequently, sustainable consumption is an important matter for more and more consumers in Germany. But the perception that sustainable consumer goods incur additional costs is a widely mentioned barrier. We have developed a statistical method based on the Laspeyres price index and the product descriptions of the Purchasing Power Parities (PPP) in order to examine the additional costs of organic food products compared to conventional food products. These costs depend on the households' expenditure structure, so called weighting scheme. Based on Engel's law, we predict a negative correlation between net equivalent income and the additional costs for organic food products. We verify and quantify this relationship by using income-related weighting schemes. The results show that organic food products are about 80 % more expensive than conventional food products. Furthermore, we find that households cannot afford to purchase solely organic food products without getting into debt when their net equivalent income is below median.",About Sufficiency
The Adoption of Sustainable Farming Practices by Smallholder Crop Farmers: Micro-Level Evidence from North-Eastern South Africa,"Sustainable farming practices (SFPs) are often touted as vehicles for improving crop productivity and the livelihoods of many rural households. However, SFP's adoption rates remain persistently low, especially among smallholder farmers in many rural parts of developing countries. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the adoption of SFPs amongst smallholder crop farmers in Mbombela, South Africa. A simple random sampling procedure was employed to collect data from 294 farmers who were solely specializing in crop production. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire, and the analysis was performed with descriptive statistics. A multivariate probit model was adopted to determine the socio-economic determinants of adopting SFPs. The findings of this study confirm that SFPs are essential for addressing the abiotic and biophysical challenges that impede crop productivity, as farmers view these practices as highly beneficial in their farming activities. Also, the results reveal that crop rotation was the most adopted practice, whereas intercropping and conservation tillage were the least adopted practices in the surveyed area. Furthermore, the study showed that ""gender, years of education, off-farm income, annual income, marital status, and satisfaction with extension services"" were significant socio-economic attributes that do indeed influence the adoption of SFPs by smallholder crop farmers in the surveyed area. These findings underscore the need for the Ministry of Agriculture and rural development stakeholders to address issues relating to economic incentives, improve farmers' perception of SFPs, provide financial literacy and support programs, and intensify efforts to promote underutilized practices.",About Sufficiency
The African Indigenous Vegetables Value Chain Governance in Kenya,"Increasingly, food security interventions in developing economies are adapting value chain approaches to facilitate the integration of smallholders into high margin value chains. In Kenya, the resurgence of African Indigenous Vegetables due to their medicinal value and rich micronutrients is a case in point. The vegetables are cultivated by smallholders, and the supply has not matched the demand in the high margin markets among urban consumers. Access to such high margin markets necessitates that smallholders gain entry or upgrade into the networks of those buyers who possess considerable control of these value chains. There is limited value chain scholarship on chain governance and its implication for smallholder participation in Kenya. This study investigated how value chain governance influences farmer participation in vegetable markets and food security in Kenya. This study employed exploratory case study design to provide chain architecture, isolate primary actors, their roles, relations, constraints and opportunities for upgrading by smallholders. A mixed method approach involving a multi-stage sampling technique of 339 respondents was employed to bring to the surface insights on chain architecture, market margins and governance structures and their implications as regards upgrading trajectories for small-scale farmers in Kenya. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. Spot market relations were found to dominate traditional value chains in rural areas while peri-urban areas exhibited both traditional and coordinated value chains. The value chains are characterised by very weak linkages between upstream actors and downstream partners, where wholesalers and supermarkets play the role of leading firms in traditional and coordinated value chains, respectively. The study recommends the inclusion of famers in market management committees and the establishment of binding contractual arrangements with supermarkets.",About Sufficiency
The Association Between Food Insecurity and Dietary Outcomes in University Students: A Systematic Review,"Background University students may experience a high prevalence of food insecurity. The impacts of food insecurity on dietary intake and meal patterns of students have not been fully researched. Objective This systematic review aimed to examine the association between food insecurity and dietary outcomes among university students. Methods Nine electronic databases and gray literature were searched from their inception to July 2020. Studies that reported dietary outcomes in both food-secure and-insecure students or the association between food insecurity and dietary outcomes among current students in tertiary education settings in any country were included. All study designs were eligible for inclusion, except qualitative studies. Two reviewers completed the screening, data extraction, and quality assessment independently. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools. Results Sixteen studies were included in the final qualitative synthesis of this review. Most studies were cross-sectional designs and of fair quality. The prevalence of food insecurity among university students ranged from 21% to 82% across studies. Lower intakes of healthy foods (eg, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains) and higher intakes of unhealthy foods (eg, fast foods, added sugars, and sugar-sweetened beverages) were observed in food-insecure students, and studies with the most representative samples of the student body found these trends. Some food-insecure students consumed breakfast and evening meals less frequently than food-secure students but the evidence was limited. Validated food security and dietary assessment tools were inconsistently used to assess diet quality among students with differing food security status. The heterogeneity of student sampling and data collection may contribute to inconsistent findings. Conclusion Poorer dietary outcomes were found in university students with food insecurity compared with food-secure students, but statistical significance was only observed in a small number of studies. Future longitudinal studies using food security and dietary assessment tools validated in this population are recommended to confirm the observed associations between food insecurity and diet quality among university students.

The carbon footprints of food crop production,"The agriculture sector contributes significantly to global carbon emissions from diverse sources such as product and machinery manufacture, transport of materials and direct and indirect soil greenhouse gas emissions. In this article, we use farm survey data from the east of Scotland combined with published estimates of emissions for individual farm operations to quantify the relative contribution of a range of farming operations and determine the carbon footprint of different crops (e.g. legumes, winter and spring cereals, oilseed rape, potato) and farming practices (conventional, integrated and organic). Over all crops and farm types, 75% of the total emissions result from nitrogen fertilizer use (both organic and inorganic) - from production, application, and direct nitrous oxide emissions from the soil resulting from application. Once nitrogen is accounted for, there are no major differences-between organic, integrated or conventional farming practices. These data highlight opportunities or carbon mitigation and will be of value for inclusion in full life cycle analyses of arable production systems and in calculations of greenhouse gas balance associated with land-use change.",About Sufficiency
The Compounded Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic and Desert Locust Outbreak on Food Security and Food Supply Chain,"The COVID-19 pandemic and locust swarm outbreaks pose a significant threat to global food systems, causing severe disruptions in both local and international food supplies from farm to fork. The main objective of this study is to understand and identify the disruptions during the crises and create a map of how resilience can be established to recover and sustain the food supply chain (FSC) functions as well as food security. The detrimental impacts of the compound crises on the FSC are explored and the effects of the affected areas are estimated under optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. As a response to the disruption caused by the crisis in FSCs, reactive and proactive solutions are proposed to develop resilience at the food sector level. In the short term, the reactive solutions, consisting of smoothing the food demand, supply and delivery, and food production and processing, can be borrowed. In the long term, the proactive solutions can be conducted by developing multi-level short intertwined FSCs. Our comprehensive investigation of the resilience elements in diverse operations and potential strategies should contribute to the improvement of FSC resilience in the face of ongoing and growing threats.",About Sufficiency
The current and potential role of urban metabolism studies to analyze the role of food in urban sustainability,"Food supply chains are essential for urban sustainability. To reflect on the state of knowledge on urban food flows in urban metabolism research, and the actual and potential role of urban metabolism studies to tackle food sustainability in cities, we systematically review scientific research on food from an urban metabolism perspective and apply statistical and thematic analyses. The analysis of 89 studies provides insights as to the relation between food supply and (environmental and social dimensions of) urban sustainability. First, food is an important contributor to urban environmental impacts, if a consumption-based approach is adopted. Secondly, the social impacts of urban food supply remain scarcely studied in urban metabolism research, but emerging results on public health, malnutrition, and food waste appear promising. In parallel, we find that the findings of the studies fail to engage with debates present in the broader literature, such as that of food justice. Our analysis shows that most studies focus on large cities in high-income, data-rich countries. This limits our understanding of global urban food supply. Existing studies use innovative mixed-methods to produce robust accounts of urban food flows in data-scarce contexts; expanding these accounts is necessary to get a better understanding of how urban food supply and its diverse impacts in terms of environmental and social sustainability may vary across cities, a necessary step for the urban metabolism literature to contribute to current debates around food sustainability and justice.",About Sufficiency
The cuticle as a key factor in the quality of horticultural crops,"In recent years, there has been a major increase in the commercialization of horticultural crops in response to population increase. However, several important factors associated with pre- and post-harvest conditions, including drought stress, pathogen infection, water loss and climate change are limiting the commercialization potential of many horticultural crops, thereby compromising agricultural sustainability. The cuticle, which is composed of cutin and waxes, provides a critical structural barrier between a plant parts and its environment. Cuticle biosynthesis is influenced by many factors during plant development and contributes to the pre- and post-harvest quality of many horticultural crops. However, many aspects of the structure-function relationships of many aspects of the plant cuticle are not well understood. Studies focusing on cuticles are increasingly important due to the major challenges of crop production, such as diseases and abiotic stresses. In this review, we focus on the cuticle as a key factor in the quality of horticultural crops and provide an overview of the recent research and conclusions in the field.",About Sufficiency
The effects of erosional and management history on soil organic carbon stores in ephemeral wetlands of hummocky agricultural landscapes,"Carbon sequestration by agricultural soils has been widely promoted as a means of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. In many regions agricultural fields are just one component of a complex landscape matrix and understanding the interactions between agricultural fields and other landscape components such as wetlands is crucial for comprehensive, whole-landscape accounting of soil organic carbon (SOC) change. Our objective was to assess the effects of management and erosional history on SOC storage in wetlands of a typical hummocky agricultural landscape in southern Saskatchewan. Wetlands were classed into three land management groups: native wetlands (i.e., within a native landscape), and uncultivated and cultivated wetlands within an agricultural landscape. Detailed topographic surveys were used to develop a digital elevation model of the sites and landform segmentation algorithms were used to delineate the topographic data into landform elements. SOC density to 45 cm, was assessed at seven uncultivated wetlands, seven cultivated wetlands, and twelve native wetlands. Mean SOC density decreased from 175.1 mg ha(-1) to 30 cm (equivalent mass depth) for the native wetlands to 168.6 mg ha(-1) for the uncultivated wetlands and 87.2 mg ha(-1) for the cultivated wetlands in the agricultural field. The SOC density of sediment depositional fans in the uncultivated wetlands is high but the total SOC stored in the fans is low due to their small area. The uncultivated wetlands occupy only 11% of the site but account for approximately 23% of SOC stores. Re-establishing permanent vegetation in the cultivated wetlands could provide maximum C sequestration with minimum energy inputs and a minimum loss of productive acreage but the overall consequences for the gas emissions would have to be carefully assessed.

"The effects of site preparation practices on carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide fluxes from a peaty gley soil","The effects of site preparation practices (drainage, mounding and fertilization) on the fluxes from the soil surface of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were studied on an organic-rich peaty gley soil at Harwood Forest, north-east England. Drained plots had significantly higher CO2 fluxes but significantly lower CH4 fluxes compared with undrained plots, while N2O emissions were not affected by drainage. Mounding caused significantly higher CH4 emissions, while it significantly reduced N2O emissions. Fertilization caused significant increases in emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O. In terms of overall greenhouse warming potential, drainage and fertilization increased CO2-equivalent emissions by similar to 18-29 and 7-23 per cent, respectively, while mounding reduced CO2-equivalent emissions by similar to 8 per cent in year 1, but had no effect on emissions in year 2 of study. Soil temperature was the main environmental variable controlling CO2 emissions, while CH4 was controlled primarily by water table depth. Nitrous oxide emissions responded to changes in soil temperature and water table depth. In the short term, drainage and fertilization contributed to accelerating greenhouse gas emissions significantly, although their long-term effects are likely moderated by accelerating carbon accumulation in the tree biomass. Long-term studies are required to assess the cumulative impacts of site preparation practices during the whole rotation cycle.",About Sufficiency
The Effects of Water Crisis on Food Production in Iran,"Food is an essential factor to human life and its production is strongly related to water.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of water crisis on food production of Iran. Results showed that Iran is suffering from a high water stress situation. The agriculture sector of Iran is the major source for feeding its fast growing population and this section has put a severe pressure on groundwater resources in order to meet food demand of the country. Since then Iran has used a great part of its hydrologic renewable water resources and due to which it could be estimated that the withdrawals reached to non-renewable part of groundwater.

"The environmental aspects of agriculture, merchandize, share, and export value-added calibrations in Turkey","The intricacy associated with policy design for environmental sustainability has necessitated a reconsideration of the output and environmental degradation relationship. Like many economies across the globe, the sector contributions to environmental woe are likely contingent on the respective economic performance of the sectors. From this perspective, this study examines the environmental effects of the contributions of agriculture value-added, merchandize value-added, export value-added, and share value-added over the period 1991-2019. By employing a combination of econometric techniques, the result revealed that agriculture value-added and export value-added mitigate environmental hazards, while a 1% increase in total energy utilization, merchandize value-added, and share value-added induce carbon emission by about 0.6%, 0.02%, and 0.001%. Moreover, the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis is validated for agriculture value-added and carbon emission nexus. However, there is a significant U-shaped relationship between carbon emission and economic contributions from the merchandize value-added, export value-added, and share value-added, thus suggesting that the EKC hypothesis is not valid. The study suggests that Turkey's agricultural sector is possibly living to the expectation of adopting and incorporating environmental sustainability practices. On the other hand, sustainable environmental policies related to other sectors of the economy are proffered in consonance with the indicated result from the study.",About Sufficiency
THE EVOLVING STATE OF AGRI-FOOD SECURITY IN THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA - A REVIEW,"Moldova faces substantial agri- food security challenges, including the availability, accessibility, and affordability of safe, nutritious food for its population. With high poverty rates and a large rural population relying on agriculture, Moldova's agricultural sector has small landholdings, low productivity, and insufficient investment in modern technologies. Climate change and extreme weather events have led to declines in agricultural production and increased dependence on imports for food needs.

The fruits of knowledge co-creation in agriculture and food-related multi-stakeholder platforms in sub-Saharan Africa - A systematic literature review,"Food insecurity and the weak position of smallholders in food value chains are key challenges in many lowand middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In order to increase food security and make agricultural value chains more inclusive, donors, governments and researchers increasingly stimulate partnerships between multiple actors, in which knowledge exchange, joint learning and knowledge co-creation play a central role in reducing the time lag between research findings and their translation into practical outcomes. Yet, despite the growing body of literature on multi-actor and cross-sector learning in these partnerships, an overview of existing literature and a strong evidence base of results of knowledge co-creation in these platforms is missing. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper documents existing evidence of knowledge co-creation processes in multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings reveal, first, many examples of positive results, including increased yields and income for farmers; policy, regime and institutional changes; and changes in environmental sustainability. Second, there are several limitations to what MSPs can achieve, including limited attention for scaling up and a lack of sustainability due to dependency on donor funding. Third, there are limitations related to the evidence base: there is a tendency to report less on failures and available findings on the effectiveness of MSPs are mixed. Considering the evidence base, we conclude that there is a need to systematically document, report and assess MSPs and not take their effectiveness for granted. A systematic literature review thereby has an important added value because the critical assessment of methodological rigour increases the credibility of results documented in the included studies.",About Sufficiency
"The good, the bad, or the ugly?

Traditional models for business response strategies can explain this divergence only partly. We develop a supplementary, explanatory perspective focusing on company size and predatory opportunities, to show how large and dominant corporate players can use environmental regulation strategically to strengthen their competitive advantages at the expense of small and weaker rivals. This highlights a neglected dimension of regulatory effects and motives behind corporate demand for strict and costly standards.

The greenhouse emissions footprint of free-range eggs,"Eggs are an increasingly significant source of protein for human consumption, and the global poultry industry is the single fastest-growing livestock sector. In the context of international concern for food security and feeding an increasingly affluent human population, the contribution to global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from animal protein production is of critical interest. We calculated the GHG emissions footprint for the fastest-growing sector of the UK egg market: free-range production in small commercial units on mixed farms. Emissions are calculated to current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and UK standards (PAS2050): including direct, indirect, and embodied emissions from cradle to farm gate compatible with a full product life-cycle assessment. We present a methodology for the allocation of emissions between ruminant and poultry enterprises on mixed farms. Greenhouse gas emissions averaged a global warming potential of 2.2 kg of CO(2)e/dozen eggs, or 1.6 kg of CO2 equivalent (e)/kg (assuming average egg weight of 60 g). one kilogram of protein from free-range eggs produces 0.2 kg of CO(2)e, lower than the emissions from white or red meat (based on both kg of meat and kg of protein). of these emissions, 63% represent embodied carbon in poultry feed. A detailed GHG emissions footprint represents a baseline for comparison with other egg production systems and sources of protein for human consumption. Eggs represent a relatively low-carbon supply of animal protein, but their production is heavily dependent on cereals and soy, with associated high emissions from industrial nitrogen production, land-use change, and transport. Alternative sources of digestible protein for poultry diets are available, may be produced from waste processing, and would be an effective tool for reducing the industry's GHG emissions and dependence on imported raw materials.",About Sufficiency
The hidden risk in China's cropland conversion from the perspective of slope,"Cropland conversion is a significant theme of the influence of human activities on ecological systems and global food security. Conventionally, cropland conversion in China has been deemed to match the dynamic balance of cropland resources well and to ensure food security for the whole country. However, local studies have presented some conflicting signs that call for an integrated analysis from a national viewpoint. In this paper, by considering the significance of slope in cropland-related natural and socioeconomic issues, we explore the slope features of China's cropland conversion during 2000-2015 and endeavor to identify some potential risks hidden in the process. High-resolution remotely sensed images, digital elevation model and spatial analytical methods are adopted to conduct the analysis. The results show that, the features of cropland conversion in diverse slope division areas are all distinct. Some risks indicated by these conversion features can be identified as follows: (1) unsuitable reclamation of cropland in flat areas causes ecological damage, (2) the invasion of sparsely populated construction land on cropland in steep areas has a dramatic impact on the local area, (3) excessive greening in Northwest and Northeast China, and insufficient greening in Southwest China are not healthy for regional sustainability, (4) cropland's upslope reclamation and downslope loss pose potential risks for food security. In the context of dynamic balance management and other related national policies, cropland conversion in China is not as optimistic as former surveys have indicated, and promoted measures should be elaborately adjusted based on local conditions.",About Sufficiency
The Hydrological Balance in Micro-Watersheds Is Affected by Climate Change and Land Use Changes,"Temperate forests are key to the balance and provision of hydrological and environmental services. Currently, these forests are subject to human alterations as well as to the effects of global change, including warming, variability, deforestation, and forest fires. As a consequence, the hydrological balance has been modified. The present study simulates the effects of climate change and land use change on the hydrological balance of micro-watersheds in Mexico using the hydrological model Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP). The land use change between 1995 and 2021 was estimated to establish a baseline. Climate scenario SSP585 was projected using three global models, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, HadGEM3-GC31-LL, and CNRM-CM6-1 by the 2081-2100 horizon, along with two scenarios of land use change: one with forest permanence and another with loss of forest cover and increased forest fires. Results indicate that future climatic conditions will modify the hydrological balance at the microbasin level. Even with positive conditions of forest permanence, increases in surface runoff of 124% (CNRM), 35% (HadGEM3), and 13% (MPI) are expected. The projections of coverage loss and fires showed surface runoff increases of 338% (CNRM), 188% (HadGEM3), and 143% (MPI). In the high areas of the microbasins where temperate forest predominates, climatic variations could be contained. If the forest is conserved, surface runoff decreases by -70% (CNRM), -87% (HadGEM3), and -89% (MPI). Likewise, the moisture in the soil increases. In areas with temperate forests, there will be modifications of the hydrological balance mainly due to the increase in evapotranspiration (due to the increase in temperature and precipitation). This will cause a significant decrease in flow and interflow. The alteration of these flows will decrease water availability in soil for infiltration. It is expected that the availability of hydrological and environmental services will be compromised in the entire study area due to climate change.",About Sufficiency
The impact of alternative energy technology investment on environment and food security in northern Ethiopia,"Energy is a key factor in the economic development. Currently, however, millions of people across the world suffer from energy poverty, having little or no access to energy for cooking, lighting, heating, cooling, or using information and communication technologies. Objective of this study was to investigate the domestic energy sources for households and the impact of biomass use as a source of energy on the environment and food insecurity in the drought-affected northern highlands of Ethiopia. A total of 398 household heads were interviewed using a structured questionnaire, whereas 16 focus group discussions and 12 key informant interviews were conducted. Descriptive data analysis techniques were used to analyze quantitative data while content analysis methods were used to analyze qualitative data. The use of traditional biomass fuels such as firewood, charcoal, crop residue, animal dung, and biomass residue that can be combusted were prevalent in the area, which aggravated the degradation of agricultural lands. As commented by the majority of respondents, the move towards the adoption of modern energy sources was not common due to finance (98%), access (97%), durability (97%) and lack of awareness (93%). The findings showed that land degradation has been severe to the extent that no grain yield can be collected from crop production. As a result, people were exposed to both chronic and transitory food insecurity, and hence the majority of people make their living on food aid. In food-insecure areas, relying on biomass energy could increase land degradation or retard the speed of land restoration, which adversely affects agricultural production and food security.

The Impact of the Agricultural System on the Environmental Footprints: New Insights from Contemporary Chinese Agricultural Perspectives,"It is generally accepted that in order to preserve the sustainability of resource utilization worldwide, it is imperative to maximize the positive environmental effects and minimize the negative ones in agriculture. To assess the impact of agricultural ecosystems on environmental footprints in China, this study used a timeseries econometric approach spanning the period from 1990 to 2020. The suitability of the variables was confirmed through stationarity tests, followed by the application of the Johansen technique. The Johansen technique's findings showed that long-run co-integration is present in both exogenous and endogenous variables. Moreover, the bound testing technique with the ARDL model was applied to validate the long-run results. The findings revealed a positive correlation between agricultural ecological footprints and factors such as agricultural land, energy consumption, fertilizer usage, and agricultural employment with short-run elasticity. In the long run, agricultural land, energy consumption, and fertilizer usage were all identified as having a positive impact on the ecological footprint. Consequently, the agricultural ecosystem faces strain due to stringent agricultural practices aimed at enhancing production. The integration of modern technology becomes imperative to reduce carbon emissions, promote environmentally-friendly industries, and enhance the nation's land bio-capacity, thereby mitigating the strain on the ecological ecosystem. This study offers valuable insights for academia, policymakers, researchers, and planners in formulating a comprehensive strategy and vision for establishing sustainable food production and fostering favorable environmental conditions, particularly pertinent to China and with broader applicability to the global context.",About Sufficiency
The impacts of biofuel crops on local biodiversity: a global synthesis,"Concerns about the impacts of climate change have led to increased targets for biofuel in the global energy market. First-generation biofuel crops contain oil, sugar or starch and are usually also grown for food, whereas second-generation biofuel is derived from non-food sources, including lignocellulosic crops, fast-growing trees, crop residues and waste. Biofuel production drives land-use change, a major cause of biodiversity loss, but there is limited knowledge of how different biofuel crops affect local biodiversity. Therefore, a more detailed understanding could inform more environmentally-conscious decisions about where to grow which biofuel crops. We synthesised data from 116 sources where a potential biofuel crop was grown and estimated how two measures of local biodiversity, species richness and total abundance, responded to different crops. Local species richness and abundance were 37% and 49% lower at sites planted with first-generation biofuel crops than in sites with primary vegetation. Soybean, wheat, maize and oil palm had the worst effects; the worst affected regions were Asia and Central and South America; and plant species richness and vertebrate abundance were the worst affected biodiversity measures. Second-generation biofuels had smaller, but still significant, effects: species richness and abundance were 19% and 25%, respectively, lower in such sites than in primary vegetation. Our models suggest that land clearance to cultivate biofuel crops reduces local biodiversity. However, the yield of biofuel from different crops influences the biodiversity impacts per unit of energy generated, and the geographic and taxonomic variation in effects are also relevant for making sustainable land-use decisions.",About Sufficiency
"The Invisible Crisis of Urban Food Security in Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia","Much of the research on food security in Ethiopia focuses on the rural poor, paying very little attention to the urban poor. The urban poor, marginalized from employment opportunities and other services, are usually made invisible by the government. Hence, exploring the invisible crisis of urban food security can help policymakers to design and implement effective strategies to reduce food insecurity. Study results indicated that unpredictable market prices, lack of employment opportunities, and distress-coping strategies are indicators of household food insecurity. In conclusion, the study argues that attaining food security must be an urgent government concern in urban areas.",About Sufficiency
The logistics of the short food supply chain: A literature review,"The sustainability of food chains is an issue consumers, policy makers, researchers, food producers and suppliers are increasingly interested in. This interest is also confirmed by the considerable development of short food supply chain (SFSC) initiatives as an alternative to the globalised food chains typical of the contemporary food industry. However, while SFSCs have grown over the recent years, their logistics is still a challenging issue affecting their performance. Previous SFSC-focused literature reviews have neglected this particular aspect, concentrating primarily on the different forms of supply chains and the benefits and limitations associated with SFSC. The goal of this paper, instead, is to increase researchers? and practitioners? knowledge of the role and potential of logistics in improving the effectiveness and sustainability of SFSCs. This work, in fact, focuses on this specific and relevant aspect of SFSC and highlights its possible impact on SFSC development. From a logistics perspective, it identifies a series of actions to be implemented to effectively improve SFSC: to make environmental sustainable choices during all the phases of food distribution, to optimise the location of supply chain nodes, to improve the distribution route and restructure the supply chain. In addition to these actions, farmers are required to adopt an open approach to innovative distribution systems, vertical and horizontal collaboration as well as to cooperation with researchers. The paper's conclusions provide suggestions for future research development and underline the necessity to adopt a holistic and integrated approach and abandon a retrospective evaluation analysis in favour of a more dynamic and future-orientated attitude.

The normative analysis of agricultural policy: A general framework and review,"The paper provides a general framework of nonnative agricultural policy analysis within which it is possible to unify forty years of literature. It is shown that the literature has gone from examining a very small set of simple policies to a much broader set of policies that combine policy instruments simultaneously. In ranking alternative policies agricultural economists have tried to consider distributive equity. I While at a glance it may seem that many different methods have been used to consider distributive equity, we show that in general all these methods can be traced back to three alternative methods based on welfarism and Pareto efficiency.",About Sufficiency
The potential for urban household vegetable gardens to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"We carried out a life cycle assessment to model the potential for alternative household vegetable gardens (AHHVGs) to mitigate global climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) for Santa Barbara County, California, USA. Our model included changes in GHGE due to the effect of creating an AHHVG for five components: reduction of lawn area due to replacement by the AHHVG; reduction of vegetables purchased from the conventional agrifood system due to replacement by vegetables produced in the AHHVG; reduction in amount of greywater exported to treatment facilities due to diversion to irrigate the AHHVG; reduction in amount of household organic waste exported to treatment facilities due to diversion to composting at the household level for application to the AHHVG; and composting organic household waste for use in the AHHVG. We found that AHHVGs could reduce emissions by over 2 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) vegetable, but that results were sensitive to the range of values for the key variables of yield and alternative methods for processing household organic waste. In our baseline scenario (50% of singlefamily households with an 18.7 m(2) AHHVG, providing 50% of their vegetable consumption), AHHVGs contributed 3.3% of the GHGE reduction goals of unincorporated Santa Barbara County for 2020, 0.5% of the goals for the City of Santa Barbara for 2050, and by extrapolation, 7.8% of the goals for California for 2020. Our results could provide an incentive for governments to include support of AHHVG as part of climate mitigation strategies, and for households to grow vegetables in AHHVGs to address climate change.

The Potential of Absorbing Foreign Agricultural Investment to Improve Food Security in Developing Countries,"Global food security has been in a severe condition in recent years, especially in developing countries. These countries need sufficient investment to promote their agricultural development. At the same time, the increasing foreign investment in agriculture has aroused widespread concern in the international community. It is controversial whether it is conducive to the host country's agriculture and social development. In order to study whether developing countries can promote food security by absorbing adequate and effective foreign agricultural investment, we use principal component analysis and select 135 countries (regions) as samples to construct an indicator system from three aspects: investment demand, investment environment and investment motivation. We use cross-section data consisting of the values of the most recent year updated for each indicator. The results show that the demand for foreign investment in developing countries is strong, but overall, it does not have much investment appeal and the investment environment is bad. There is a gap between the expectations and realities in societies in each developing country in terms of the introduction of foreign agricultural investment to promote food security. Governance and capacity building should be strengthened to reconcile their investment needs with investors' motives. Meanwhile, more inclusive rules for foreign agricultural investment will help it to play its due role in developing countries.",About Sufficiency
The Potential Role of Short Food Supply Chains in Strengthening Periurban Agriculture in Spain: The Cases of Madrid and Barcelona,"Periurban agriculture is being hit by the effects of the globalized food system, as well as by concrete aspects of urban sprawl. Nonetheless, proximity to the main markets provides an opportunity to sustain agriculture in highly urbanized areas. In this sense, an increasing number of local initiatives is arising within the context of Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs). The economic impact of these initiatives, however, is limited by problems and inefficiencies that hinder their capacity to scale up. The present paper sets forth the results of a research project developed in Madrid and Cataluna. The study is based upon documentary and empirical research addressing the main problems periurban farmers are facing in relation to local food distribution. Among other factors, these refer to regulatory barriers, logistics, competition and dealing with consumers' preferences. We conducted a questionnaire with a representative group of farmers from each region in three towns presenting different demographic sizes along with another questionnaire extended to the owners of small grocery stores, who play a vital role in the supply of fresh food in these municipalities. Our research demonstrates that most of the problems arising when dealing with SFSCS can be solved by introducing new forms of cooperation among the different agents of the food chain.",About Sufficiency
The Relationship Between Food Security and Poor Health Among Female WIC Participants,"This study evaluated the prevalence and relationship of food security, dietary choices, and health status within the Butte County Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in California. One hundred fifty-five postpartum non-lactating female WIC participants were surveyed on their health and food security status through validated measures and their dietary choices through 7 Likert statements. Participants who were food insecure scored significantly lower on the general and mental health scales and their diet choice score. The participants' dietary choices also affected mental and general health scores. Food insecurity significantly increased the likelihood of having a lower mental health score and seldom or never eating 21/2 cups of vegetables per day. These results suggest that food insecurity is associated with decreased general and mental health and vegetable consumption among Butte County WIC participants.",About Sufficiency
The role of agroforestry systems in reconciling food and cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) and coffee (Coffea spp. L.) production in a changing environment,"Perennial export crops such as cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) and coffee (Coffea spp. L.) contribute indirectly to food security by providing an income that can be used to buy food, household goods and/or supplies for the cultivation of basic food crops. Thus, any perennial crop loss incurred due to the effects of climate change will also negatively impact food security and, more generally, the livelihoods of smallholders, farmers and rural communities. It is foreseen that in the not so distant future (2050), climate change and increased land use for food crop production, to meet increasing demands for food as the world's population increases, will negatively impact global production of perennial crops such as coffee and cocoa by reducing the availability of land suitable for their cultivation. Furthermore, the current trend towards full sun systems with excessive use of external inputs (agrochemicals, irrigation) increases the vulnerability of the cocoa and coffee sectors to climate change. To reconcile the need for food crops and the demand for export crops such as coffee and cocoa, under the scenarios of climate change and population growth, innovative production systems have to be developed. Such systems should also contribute to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and provide other ecosystem services such as regulation of pests and diseases. Agroforestry systems are some of the production systems which can address these manifold demands. Here, ideas for the development of competitive and sustainable agroforestry systems and the evaluation of their environmental benefits are presented and reviewed.",About Sufficiency
The Role of Food Banks in Addressing Food Insecurity: A Systematic Review,"Food banks play a major role in the food aid sector by distributing donated and purchased groceries directly to food insecure families. The public health implications of food insecurity are significant, particularly as food insecurity has a higher prevalence among certain population groups. This review consolidates current knowledge about the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted. Thirty-five publications were reviewed, of which 14 examined food security status, 13 analysed nutritional quality of food provided, and 24 considered clients' needs in relation to food bank use. This review found that while food banks have an important role to play in providing immediate solutions to severe food deprivation, they are limited in their capacity to improve overall food security outcomes due to the limited provision of nutrient-dense foods in insufficient amounts, especially from dairy, vegetables and fruits. Food banks have the potential to improve food security outcomes when operational resources are adequate, provisions of perishable food groups are available, and client needs are identified and addressed.",About Sufficiency
"The roles of urban agriculture to household food security: a case study in Kirkos sub-city, Addis Ababa city, Ethiopia","Introduction The main objective of the study was to explore the contribution of urban agriculture (UA) to the household food security of urban farmers in Addis Ababa, using Kirkos Subcity as a case study.Methods Both quantitative and qualitative research approaches were employed to ascertain and describe the characteristics of variables of interest. The data collection involved surveys and interviews with urban farmers.Results The study revealed that 48.2% of respondents were food secure, while 23.1% and 28.7% were mildly or moderately food insecure, respectively. Additionally, 33.8% of respondents believed that urban agriculture helped them meet their daily food needs, while the remaining respondents felt it was insufficient. Approximately 47.2% of respondents reported that UA helped them meet their food requirements year-round, whereas 22.6% said it was unable to cover their year-round needs. Most respondents indicated that their income increased due to engaging in urban agriculture. Furthermore, 72.3% of respondents had access to land resources for urban agriculture, while 27.7% did not have access to land. The ordinal logistic regression model indicated that age, family size, formal education, household head, monthly income, marital status, educational level, main income source, farming experience, land access, and market access were statistically significant predictors of household food security.Discussion The prevalence of food insecurity among urban households engaged in agriculture highlights the need for additional support and increased intensity of various types of urban agriculture. Policymakers should consider integrating urban agriculture into urban planning strategies to enhance food security and resilience in urban areas.",About Sufficiency
The Root towards More Circularized Animal Production Systems: From Animal to Territorial Metabolism,"Simple Summary The relationship between the rates of world population growth and the consumption of natural resources is a subject of strong debate in the political and academic areas. Since the 1960s, technological progress has made it possible to achieve extraordinary increases in agricultural productivity, which was at the basis of the so-called green revolution. However, this happened at the expense of environmental sustainability. Agricultural activities impact natural resources such as water, air, biodiversity, which are crucial for future generations. The livestock sector is particularly sensitive to the problem, being responsible for an important part of the global greenhouse gas emissions. To make livestock production more sustainable, a radical rethinking of livestock production models is required. In the face of these needs, the circular economy provides a sound basis for a sustainable transition. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the crucial factors for a transition towards more ""circularized"" animal production systems. More precisely, our work aims to identify economic, social, and environmental factors that can boost transition, by framing it within a circular vision of livestock farming. This paper deals with a relevant topic in the literature on sustainable management of animal farms, concerning the transition towards circular methods of animal production. The paper aims to put forward an original analytical multilevel perspective overlapping different dimensions at either micro, meso, and macro level. Starting from the Malthusian analysis on depletion of natural resources, with risks of the fragility of the natural and economic systems, the paper points out the importance of moving away from intensive methods of production, by adopting more circularized approaches based on resources efficiency. The application of circular economy approaches to animal production is theorized through the concept of territorial metabolism involving not only internal resources (at the animal farm level) but also territorial resources. The paper underlines the critical points of the transition, which is labeled as a socio-technical transition in that it involves not only technical issues but also social aspects. Critical points are addressed through consumers' acceptance of products drawn on circular approaches and political support to transition, through political tools which are boosted in recent documents of the European Union, like the Green Deal and Farm to Fork strategy.",About Sufficiency
The Use of Si-Based Fertilization to Improve Agricultural Performance,"Silicon (Si) is a ""quasi-essential "" element, associated to stresses/limitations alleviation in crops. However, stressful situations are becoming the norm, due to climate change, human exhaustion of natural resources, land degradation and loss of soil biodiversity. In this context, Si becomes a critical element, capacitating crops to grow more and better with less. A total of 467 articles up to 2021 were selected, reporting 501 experiments (lab-oriented and field trials) resulting in 682 cases where different Si-based fertilizers were used to study crops/plants with agronomic value to evaluate its physiological and/or agronomic performance under a specific motivation. Results show that 63% of cases testing Si-fertilization show increase in productivity, while 13% refuted this observation and 24% did not evaluate plant growth. Crop physiological responses was registered in 42% of the cases and only 3% did not report any alteration, although 55% did not evaluate these indicators. Symptom alleviation, in cases where stresses/limitations were studied, was registered in 74% of the cases with a low number of negative outcomes (9%). Field trials where crop yield was measured after application of Si-fertilization show that 69% of different measurements (599) register a yield improvement >= 5%, while 18% of the measurements registered between 0 and 5% and only 14% reported yield loss. Si-fertilization is therefore and important factor to improve crop yield and capacitate crops with resilience to endure future limitations. Its inclusion in modern agriculture should be considered in larger scales to adapt crops to the current challenges of sustainable agriculture and food provision.",About Sufficiency
"The Value of Producing Food, Energy, and Ecosystem Services within an Agro-Ecosystem","Agricultural ecosystems produce food, fiber, and non-marketed ecosystem services (ES). Agriculture also typically involves high negative external costs associated with, for example, fossil fuel use. We estimated, via field-scale ecological monitoring and economic value-transfer methods, the market and nonmarket ES value of a combined food and energy (CFE) agro-ecosystem that simultaneously produces food, fodder, and bioenergy. Such novel CFE agro-ecosystems can provide a significantly increased net crop, energy, and nonmarketed ES compared with conventional agriculture, and require markedly less fossil-based inputs. Extrapolated to the European scale, the value of nonmarket ES from the CFE system exceeds current European farm subsidy payments. Such integrated food and bioenergy systems can thus provide environmental value for money for European Union farming and nonfarming communities.",About Sufficiency

We find that while socio-demographic variables and farm structural variables are frequently included, they were insignificant more often than they were significant. For behavioural factors we find stronger evidence for the importance of cognitive or attitudinal variables compared to dispositional attitudinal variables. We also find a growing interest in social factors which will be valuable for researchers to explore further and reflect on the policy implications of our findings.",About Sufficiency
Time management governs climate resilience and productivity in the coupled rice-wheat cropping systems of eastern India,"India will need to produce 30% more wheat by 2050, and these gains must principally come from intensification in eastern India where low productivity is common. Through a dense network of on-farm surveys for the rice-wheat system in this region, we show that contemporary wheat sowing dates have a central influence on achieved and attainable yields, superseding all other crop management, soil and varietal factors. We estimate that untapped wheat production potential will increase by 69% with achievable adjustments to wheat sowing dates without incurring undesirable trade-offs with rice productivity, irrigation requirements or profitability. Our findings also indicate that transformative gains in wheat yields are only possible in eastern India if rice and wheat are managed as a coupled system. Steps taken to 'keep time' through better management of the annual cropping calendar will pay dividends for food security, profitability and climate resilience now and as a foundation for adaptation to progressive climate change. Current cropping calendar management erodes wheat yield potential in the rice-wheat cropping system of eastern India. By combining field and household survey data, time series of remotely sensed information and dynamic crop simulations, this study shows that exploitable wheat yield gaps could increase by 69% through planting date adjustments that enhance climate resilience.",About Sufficiency
"Time to clean up food production? Digital technologies, nature-driven agility, and the role of managers and customers","This article employs a multiple-case study research design to unpack the complex relationship between digital transformation, agility, and environmental sustainability in the agri-food industry. Our findings show that to achieve a cleaner food production that does not compromise the natural life cycle, firms need to deploy nature -driven agility, a novel type of agility. We conceptualized nature-driven agility as the firm ability to flexibly and effectively utilize natural resources to adapt the full production process to market changes and capture new value-creation opportunities within nature constraints. This study found that nature-driven agility relies on digital technologies to make predictions about natural resource dynamics that may impact the critical steps of the agri-food production process. We also identify some factors that clarify how the benefits of nature-driven agility on cleaner food production strongly depend on managers' commitment to environmental sustainability and the pressure of customers for new products aligned with ecological sustainability purposes. Finally, we synthesized the findings in the Nature-driven Agility (NaDrA) framework, which practitioners can use to design proper operations that capture value-creation opportunities while improving agri-food firms' environmental performance.",About Sufficiency
Exploring solution spaces for nutrition-sensitive agriculture in Kenya and Vietnam,"Smallholder agriculture is an important source of livelihoods in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In these regions the highest concentrations of nutritionally vulnerable populations are found. Agricultural development needs to be nutrition-sensitive, and contribute simultaneously to improving household nutrition, farm productivity and environmental performance. We explored the windows of opportunities for farm development and the potential of crop diversification options for meeting household dietary requirements, whilst concurrently improving household economic performance in contrasting smallholder farm systems in Kenya and Vietnam. Farm and household features and farmer perspectives and priorities were integrated into a farm-household model that allowed quantification of a diverse set of nutritional, labour and productive indicators. Using a multi-objective optimization algorithm, we generated 'solution spaces' comprising crop compositions and management configurations that would satisfy household dietary needs and allowed income gains. Results indicated site-specific synergies between income and nutritional system yield for vitamin A. Diversification with novel vegetables could cover vitamin A requirements of 10 to 31 extra people per hectare and lead to greater income (25 to 185% increase) for some households, but reduced leisure time. Although the Vietnamese sites exhibited greater nutrient system yields than those in Kenya, the household diets in Kenya had greater nutrient adequacy due to the fact that the Vietnamese farmers sold greater proportions of their on-farm produced foods. We conclude that nutrition-sensitive, multi-method approaches have potential to identify solutions to simultaneously improve household income, nutrition and resource management in vulnerable smallholder farming systems.",About Sufficiency
Towards (Global) Food Equity - The Role of Intellectual Property and Trade,"The Covid-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted global food systems, aggravating vulnerabilities in consumption, production, hygiene, and access. These disruptions intensified economic instability and reduced the production capacity of small and medium-sized agribusinesses, widening the gap between food supply and demand and contributing to a dramatic rise in global undernourishment. Economic fallout and price inflation compounded these issues, particularly affecting low-income countries and exacerbating social inequities. The recent escalation in global food crises, exacerbated by events such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and climate change, underscores the urgent need for a transformative approach to food ecosystems. This article examines the critical role of intellectual property (IP) and trade in fostering equitable food governance, particularly within the post-pandemic and post-crisis global legal order. It assesses how IP and trade mechanisms might bridge gaps in food security and advance the right to food as part of a broader human rights framework. Using equity as a guiding concept, this article analyzes ongoing initiatives at the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization, focusing on recent developments in trade negotiations and the International Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Traditional Knowledge.

Traditional Yerba Mate Agroforestry Systems in Araucaria Forest in Southern Brazil Improve the Provisioning of Soil Ecosystem Services,"Soils are a source of natural capital that provide and regulate a range of ecosystem services (ES) and play an important role in sustaining human welfare. Nonetheless, the quality and quantity of soil ecosystem services (SES) delivery over the long term depend on the use of sustainable land management practices. In the present study, we assessed seven SES using a set of soil quality indicators in four production systems based on yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil) in the Araucaria Forest biome of Southern Brazil: two sites were under traditional agroecological agroforestry management, one was a silvopastoral system with dairy pasture, and the last one was a monoculture yerba mate production system. The SES measured were soil fertility, carbon sequestration, erosion control, nutrient cycling, plant provision, biodiversity, and health. Soil samples were collected at various depths and analysed for chemical, physical, and biological attributes. A principal component analysis on the dataset showed that the soil quality indicators that best represent the variance between the systems at the 0-10 cm layer were acidity, microbial activity (FDA), total nitrogen, (TN), structural stability index (SSI), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, sum of bases (SB), microbial quotient (qMic), density of earthworms (EwD), bulk density (BD), and carbon stocks (Cstock). Soil quality indicators ranging from 0 to 1 were used to graphically represent the set of SES. The indicator-based approach used to explain the differences among the four production systems was able to capture the soil functions and offered a good starting point for quantifying SES provision.",About Sufficiency
Integrating ecosystem services with geodesign to create multifunctional agricultural landscapes: A case study of a New Zealand hill country farm,"An ecosystem-based management approach (EBM) is suggested as one solution to help to tackle environmental challenges facing worldwide farming systems whilst ensuring socio-economic demands are met. Despite its usefulness, the application of this approach at the farm-scale presents several implementation problems, including the difficulty of (a) incorporating the concept of ecosystem services (ES) into agricultural land use decision-making and (b) involving the farmer in the planning process. This study aims to propose a solution to overcome these challenges by utilising a geodesign framework and EBM approach to plan and design a sus-tainable multifunctional agricultural landscape at the farm scale. We demonstrate how the proposed approach can be applied to plan and design multifunctional agricultural landscapes that offer improved sustainability, using a New Zealand hill country farm as a case study. A geodesign framework is employed to generate future land use and management scenarios for the study area, visualize changes, and assess the impacts of future land use on landscape multifunctionality and the provision of associated ES and economic outcomes. In this frame-work, collaboration with the farmer was carried out to obtain farm information and co-design the farmed landscapes. The results from our study demonstrate that farmed landscapes where multiple land use/ land cover types co-exist can provide a wide range of ES and therefore, meet both economic and environmental demands. The assessment of impacts for different land use change scenarios demonstrates that land use change towards increasing landscape diversity and complexity is a key to achieving more sustainable multifunctional farmed landscapes. The integration of EBM and geodesign, is a transdisciplinary approach that can help farmers target land use and management decisions by considering the major ES that are, and could be, provided by the landscapes in which these farm systems are situated, therefore maximising the potential for beneficial outcomes.",About Sufficiency

Transhumant pastoralism in Indian western Himalaya: traditional ecological knowledge and contemporary practices,"Transhumant pastoralism guided by traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) helps people in adapting to extreme biophysical conditions and remoteness in the high-altitude region of the western Himalaya. However, the age-old practice is currently under threat due to changes in socioeconomic, policy and environmental conditions, which may lead to erosion of pastoralism-related TEK. This study was undertaken to document traditional knowledge concerning transhumant pastoralism of the Kinnaura community in three high-altitude villages, namely Chhitkul, Rakchham and Batseri in the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, India, using semi-structured interviews and participant observation methods. A total of 38 key informants were interviewed to elicit information about the contemporary practices and TEK related to transhumant pastoralism.

Many such countries are net food importers using food subsidy systems, as water resources do not allow national food self-sufficiency. As this leaves countries in a position of dependency on international markets, prices and export bans, it is imperative that every domestic drop of water is used efficiently. In addition, policies can be geared towards 'water footprints', where water use efficiency is not just evaluated at the field level but also at the level of trade and import/export. In this paper, Egyptian food systems are described based on production, distribution and consumption statistics, key drivers and food system outcomes, i.e., health, sustainable land and water use, and inclusiveness. This is done for three coarsely defined Egyptian food systems: traditional, transitional and modern. A water footprint analysis then shows that for four MENA countries, differences occur between national green and blue water volumes, and the volumes imported through imported foods. Egypt has by far the largest blue water volume, but on a per capita basis, other countries are even more water limited. Then for Egypt, the approach is applied to the wheat and poultry sectors. They show opportunities but also limitations when it comes to projected increased water and food needs in the future. An intervention strategy is proposed that looks into strategies to get more out of the food system components production, distribution and consumption. On top of that food subsidy policies as well as smart water footprint application may lead to a set of combined policies that may lead to synergies between the three food system outcomes, paving the way to desirable food system transformation pathways.",About Sufficiency
Unveiling the dynamics of agriculture greenhouse gas emissions: The role of energy consumptions and natural resources,"Nearly every country has committed to minimizing its energy emissions and sharing climate change research, particularly on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Therefore, this research aimed to explore the association between renewable (REN) and non-renewable (NREN) energy consumption, total natural resources (TNR), and agricultural greenhouse gas (AGHG) emissions in Pakistan. This study employs a novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (DYNARDL) simulation model to estimate the long- and short-term causality among study variables using data from 1990 to 2022. In addition, our study uses a kernel-based regularized leastsquares technique to check the robustness of the DYNARDL findings. Our empirical findings show that the use of renewable energy and natural resources decreases, whereas the utilization of nonrenewable energy increases AGHG emissions in the long run. DYNARDL simulations also show that a positive (+10 %) counterfactual shock change in the projected renewable energy and natural resources leads to a decrease in AGHG emissions, whereas the utilization of NREN leads to increase the AGHG emissions. This study implies that policymakers and stakeholder should rise the share of REN energy and ensure sustainable utilization of natural resources to enhance agricultural sustainability.",About Sufficiency
"Unveiling the nexus of climate change, adaptation strategies, and food security: Insights from small-scale farmers in zagros mountains in Iran","In today 's world, climate change and its unprecedented impact on food and nutrition security have emerged as a significant and formidable global challenge. This study aimed to investigate the effect of adaptation strategies on the food security of small-scale farmers in Khorramabad city, Iran, using a survey -based analysis. To assess the food security level, the Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) was employed. Additionally, Structural Equation Modeling was utilized to examine the relationship between adaptation dimensions and food security. The findings revealed that households without children exhibited a higher level of food security (48%) compared to households with children (6%). Moreover, the results demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between the food security of households, regardless of whether they had children, and the different adaptation components. Despite a satisfactory level of knowledge regarding climate change adaptation in the study area, the actual implementation of such measures remained low. While weed management, agricultural crop insurance, and access to meteorological information were identified as the top three strategies employed by farmers, the results suggested that sustainable -oriented operations and organic -oriented practices could serve as more effective strategies for both climate change resilience and enhancing food security status.",About Sufficiency
Urban food policies in German city regions: An overview of key players an policy instruments,"Although food is an emerging topic on municipal policy and planning agendas, a systematic examination of policy development, its implementation and the instruments used at the urban level is lacking. This study was carried out with the aim of gaining new insights into the prevalence of certain food policy instruments and capacity of policy action. In order to do so, we developed an analytical framework to investigate urban policy and planning approaches related to food issues and applied it in ten large German cities. First, we identified different actor groups and analysed their role in urban food policy (level of involvement in municipal food projects). We then studied the variety of policy and planning instruments and their application for different elements in the food system. For the empirical study, we employed a case study approach and utilised data gathering methods of qualitative research, i.e. expert interviews and document analysis. Our empirical findings in the studied cities reveal that urban food policy activities are still very fragmented and often based on individual initiatives within the administration. Integrated urban food policies and their implementation through urban food strategies are still an exception in major cities in Germany. We found that municipal actors follow mainly sectoral approaches, using a wide array of steering instruments, i.e. informational instruments and public procurement policies. However, their capacities for policy implementation remain limited due to missing financial and staffing resources. Accordingly, the potential the urban food system offers for sustainable development through multifunctionality and sectoral integration, is still underexploited. The systematic approach developed in this study may contribute to a better understanding of different policy approaches taken. The applied typology of policy instruments might also be useful for identifying effective ways to implement urban food strategies, to understand mismatches between instruments and different policy domains, levels and administrative units, e.g. at the urban-rural interface, and to design of new policy instruments.",About Sufficiency
Urban planning roles in responding to food security needs,"Food security is a daily problem for vulnerable groups of urban citizens in developed countries, who face physical and mental stress and poor health outcomes from limited food choices. They are often unable to change their circumstances through the marginalizing impacts of urban planning policy, regulation, and infrastructure barriers. Local government is often confronted with these impacts and absorbs the responsibility to act ""on the ground"" in the absence of a coordinated, multilevel institutional response. Health professionals and local government urban planners increasingly collaborate to examine the design of cities and towns to improve food security. Despite increased awareness and the inclusion of food security in some planning strategies, regulation, and decision-making, results are limited in many jurisdictions. This research uses a case study methodology to gain insights into the systemic barriers facing local government planners in the state of Victoria, Australia, in responding to municipal food security challenges. Four food-related themes drawn from the data show that both internal systemic barriers and an external lack of fit with federal and state governments blur the understanding of food security challenges and limit planning solutions. Local government planners need consistent legislative and planning scheme priorities, combined with strengthened regulatory tools, to address food security more effectively. Increased feedback opportunities for local government staff to share their valuable experience and knowledge with higher levels of government would allow for a more coordinated approach to addressing this multijurisdictional problem.",About Sufficiency
"Use of weeds as traditional vegetables in Shurugwi District, Zimbabwe","Background: Most agricultural weeds are usually regarded as undesirable and targeted for eradication. However, weeds are useful to human beings as food and traditional medicines. Few studies have been done to document the uses of weeds as traditional vegetables. This study was therefore, done to document indigenous knowledge related to the diversity and use of agricultural weeds as traditional vegetables in Shurugwi District, Zimbabwe, emphasizing their role in food security and livelihoods of the local people. Materials and methods: Semi-structured interviews, observation and guided field walks with 147 participants were employed between December 2011 and January 2012 to obtain ethnobotanical data on the use of edible weeds as traditional vegetables. Based on ethnobotanical information provided by the participants, botanical specimens were collected, numbered, pressed and dried for identification. Results: A total of 21 edible weeds belonging to 11 families and 15 genera, mostly from Amaranthaceae (19%), Asteraceae and Tiliaceae (14.3%), Capparaceae, Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae (9.5% each) were identified. Of the documented edible weeds, 52.4% are indigenous while 47.6% are exotic to Zimbabwe; either semi-cultivated or growing naturally as agricultural weeds in farmlands, fallow land and home gardens. Among the main uses of edible weeds were leafy vegetables (81%), followed by edible fruits (19%), edible corms (9.5%), edible flowers and seeds (4.8% each). The most important edible weeds were Cleome gynandra, cited by 93.9% of the participants, Cucumis metuliferus (90.5%), Cucumis anguria (87.8%), Corchorus tridens (50.3%) and Amaranthus hybridus (39.5%). All edible weeds were available during rainy and harvest period with Cleome gynandra, Corchorus tridens, Cucumis anguria, Cucumis metuliferus and Moringa oleifera also available during the dry season, enabling households to obtain food outputs in different times of the year. The importance of edible weeds for local livelihoods was ubiquitously perceived, with all participants reporting their contribution towards food security and nutrition. Conclusion: The present study confirm findings from similar studies conducted elsewhere that rural households engage in harvesting of wild edible vegetables and other non-timber forest products (NTFPs) as a survival strategy. Based on their potential nutritional and medicinal value, edible weeds could contribute in a major way to food security, basic primary health care and balanced diets of rural households and possibly urban households as well.",About Sufficiency
Using ABM to Study the Potential of Land Use Change for Mitigation of Food Deserts,"Land-use transition is one of the most profound human-induced alterations of the Earth's system. It can support better land management and decision-making for increasing the yield of food production to fulfill the food needs in a specific area. However, modeling land-use change involves the complexity of human drivers and natural or environmental constraints. This study develops an agent-based model (ABM) for land use transitions using critical indicators that contribute to food deserts. The model's performance was evaluated using Guilford County, North Carolina, as a case study. The modeling inputs include land covers, climate variability (rainfall and temperature), soil quality, land-use-related policies, and population growth. Studying the interrelationships between these factors can improve the development of effective land-use policies and help responsible agencies and policymakers plan accordingly to improve food security. The agent-based model illustrates how and when individuals or communities could make specific land-cover transitions to fulfill the community's food needs. The results indicate that the agent-based model could effectively monitor land use and environmental changes to visualize potential risks over time and help the affected communities plan accordingly.",About Sufficiency
Using household survey data to identify large-scale food security patterns across Uganda,"To target food security interventions for smallholder households, decision makers need large-scale information, such as maps on poverty, food security and key livelihood activities. Such information is often based on expert knowledge or aggregated data, despite the fact that food security and poverty are driven largely by processes at the household level. At present, it is unclear if and how household level information can contribute to the spatial prediction of such welfare indicators or to what extent local variability is ignored by current mapping efforts. A combination of geo-referenced household level information with spatially continuous information is an underused approach to quantify local and large-scale variation, while it can provide a direct estimate of the variability of welfare indicators at the most relevant scale. We applied a stepwise regression kriging procedure to translate point information to spatially explicit patterns and create country-wide predictions with associated uncertainty estimates for indicators on food availability and related livelihood activities using household survey data from Uganda. With few exceptions, predictions of the indicators were weak, highlighting the difficulty in capturing variability at larger scale. Household explanatory variables identified little additional variation compared to environmental explanatory variables alone. Spatial predictability was strongest for indicators whose distribution was determined by environmental gradients. In contrast, indicators of crops that were more ubiquitously present across agroecological zones showed large local variation, which often overruled large-scale patterns. Our procedure adds to existing approaches that often only show large-scale patterns by revealing that local variation in welfare is large. Interventions that aim to target the poor must recognise that diversity in livelihood activities for income generation within any given area often overrides the variability of livelihood activities between distant regions in the country.",About Sufficiency

Gender mainstreaming in sweetpotato breeding and dissemination in Ghana and Malawi,"Gender responsiveness in breeding programs to meet client and end user preferences for crops is essential. This case study analyzes the implementation experience of gender-responsive breeding and variety dissemination in Malawi and Ghana, focusing on good practices and challenges encountered. In Malawi, a training-of-trainers approach was employed to share knowledge among trained farmers. In Ghana, a research study was conducted to identify gender-based preferences for sweetpotato to define breeding objectives. The participation of social scientists, food scientists, and sweetpotato breeders in the GREAT (Gender Researchers Equipped for Agricultural Transformation) team provided a multidisciplinary perspective, addressing questions and responses in the field. Research efforts were strengthened by focusing on food quality through the establishment of an analytical laboratory for rapid evaluation of nutrition and food quality, including sugars. This helped develop sensory analytical capacity to better understand quality attributes and market segments, guiding breeding and improving market opportunities for women. Breeding outcomes resulting from gender inclusion led to the release of some sweetpotato varieties meeting end user and consumer preferences, as well as adoption of OFSP varieties by men and women. Other good practices for gender inclusion and responsiveness include providing funds for gender-based research and activities, engaging gender specialists and social scientists in trans-disciplinary teams, designing program activities with gender considerations, and incorporating traits in seed multiplication and dissemination decisions. Application of these gender inclusion practices resulted in adoption and development of acceptable sweetpotato varieties.",About Sufficiency
Value chains in renewable and sustainable food systems,"Globalization of food trade in agricultural commodities is in some senses the antithesis of key concepts of sustainable agriculture. Global trade in food products distances the depletion of resources and environmental impacts of food production from the economic and social processes that drive consumption and increases the global risks from introduction of species that become pests. However, both supply and market value chains have emerged as major sub-systems in the larger global agro-food trade system that exert enormous importance over the potential for change in agricultural production at the farm level. This special issue presents studies of seven value chains that exhibit the breadth of research about value chains and their potential contributions to sustainable agriculture. They address value chains at different scales and dealing in various products. These studies contribute to the body of knowledge with a focus on lesser researched regions and products. Most important, they demonstrate the potential for value chains to enhance agricultural sustainability for rural populations and reduce food insecurity and inequities.",About Sufficiency
Valuing farmers in transitions to more sustainable food systems: A systematic literature review of local food producers' experiences and contributions in short food supply chains,"Industrial food systems are being increasingly challenged by alternative food movements globally that advocate for better environmental, social, economic, and political outcomes as part of societal transitions to more sustainable food systems. At the heart of these transitions are local food producers operating within shorter food supply chains, their experiences, and their knowledge of ecologically sustainable food production, biodiversity and climate, and their communities. Despite their important contributions to the resilience of food systems, society and ecology, local food producers' experiences and knowledges are often undervalued, ignored, or inaccurately reflected. This systematic literature review identifies the values, motivations, and concerns as key elements of the experiences of local food producers within short food supply chains across literature globally, their contributions to social-ecological resilience, and discusses how these experiences and contributions can influence transitions to sustainable food systems. Eighty-five research articles were distilled from 5 databases and thematic analysis revealed four major themes: (1) concerns for exploitative operating contexts and hidden labor expectations within short food supple chains, (2) local food producers' value and need for social networks, (3) their environmental values, connections, and concerns, and (4) how they can value and be motivated by alternative models but are concerned by their economic viability. This review also observed an important paradox within local food producers' experiences showing that whilst farming is a demanding profession and lifestyle, they can feel a deep fulfilment when they live and work in harmony with their values and motivations. This systematic review is significant for how it values and synthesizes the experiences of local food producers and the diverse personal, social, ecological, and economic contributions that local food production has for social-ecological resilience of communities. By better communicating these experiences and contributions to decision-makers, policy makers and planners, this research can have major implications for enabling societal transitions that are fairer and more just in ways that empower, protect, and privilege local food producers' voices.",About Sufficiency
Social sustainability of cod and haddock fisheries in the northeast Atlantic: what issues are important?,"Research on the sustainability of capture fisheries has focused more on environmental and economic sustainability than on social sustainability. To assess social sustainability, first relevant and important social sustainability issues need to be identified. The objective of this study was to identify relevant social sustainability issues for cod and haddock fisheries in the northeast Atlantic and to determine the importance of these issues based on stakeholder input. A heterogeneous group of stakeholders was invited to take part in two consecutive surveys on social sustainability issues. The first survey (n = 41) resulted in a long list of 27 relevant social sustainability issues, including six issues that were not identified in previous studies and that address aspects of fish welfare, employees' training and education opportunities, and employees' time off from work. The second survey (n = 51) resulted in a ranking of the social sustainability issues in order of importance. The most important issues are worker safety, product freshness and companies' salary levels. In general, social sustainability issues concerning working conditions, employees' job fulfilment and fish welfare are seen as more important than other social sustainability issues. A main discussion point concerns the relation between the importance of a social sustainability issue on the one hand and the type of need that the issue relates to and the state of the issue on the other hand. From the study it can be concluded that the relative importance of social sustainability issues differs per stakeholder group depending on the relation between the stakeholder group and each particular issue. This demonstrates the importance of consulting different stakeholder groups in future studies on social sustainability in order to get a balanced view on the importance of social sustainability issues. Results on the relevance and importance of social sustainability issues for cod and haddock fisheries in the northeast Atlantic enable the fishing industry and policy-makers to direct improvement efforts towards the more important issues.

'Rescaling' alternative food systems: from food security to food sovereignty,"In this paper, we critically interrogate the benefits of an interdisciplinary and theoretically diverse dialogue between 'local food' and 'alternative food networks' (AFNs) and outline how this dialogue might be enriched by a closer engagement with discourses of food sovereignty and the politics of scale. In arguing for a shift towards a greater emphasis on food sovereignty, we contend that contemporary discourses of food security are inadequate for the ongoing task of ensuring a just and sustainable economy of food. Further, rather than treating the local and the global as ontologically given categories around which to contest the politics of food, it is our contention that recognising the socio-spatial aspects of the politics of scale has the potential to reinvigorate discourses of food security, food sovereignty and AFNs. Understanding scale as both fixed to a degree as well as contingent and dynamic has implications for an understanding of the role of food systems, for how the rescaled state privileges certain food systems and the possibilities for resistance through 'jumping scale' and food utopias. All of these aspects are significant if we are to fully comprehend and contest the challenges of envisioning and enacting real utopias of food sovereignty.",About Sufficiency
Preferences for legume attributes in maize-legume cropping systems in Malawi,"Adoption rates of leguminous crops remain low in sub-Saharan Africa despite their potential role in improving nutrition, soil health, and food security. In this study we explored Malawian farmers' perceptions of various legume attributes and assessed how these perceptions affected allocation of land to legume crops using a logit link model. We found high regional variation in both consumption- and production-related preferences, but relatively consistent preferences across samples. While scientific understanding and farmer perceptions were aligned on some topics and for some legumes, there were discrepancies elsewhere, particularly in terms of soil fertility and nutrition. Understanding why these discrepancies exist and where there were potential biases are critical in explaining the extent of adoption. In many cases perceptions of legume attributes may be influenced by the cultural role of the crop in the household, particularly in terms of food security or market-orientation. The findings also suggest that researchers need to look beyond both the agronomic properties and farmers' preferences to fully understand the extent of adoption. Socioeconomic factors, biases, and marketing concerns may also influence integration of legumes into maize-based cropping systems.",About Sufficiency

"Food insecurity, COVID-19 and diets in Fiji - a cross-sectional survey of over 500 adults","IntroductionFood insecurity is associated with inadequate nutrition and increased rates of chronic disease. The primary aim of this study was to assess self-reported food insecurity and the perceived impact of COVID-19 on food security, in two regional districts of Central Fiji, as part of a broader program of work on strengthening and monitoring food policy interventions. The secondary aim was to explore the relationship between food insecurity and salt, sugar and fruit and vegetable intake.MethodsSeven hundred adults were randomly sampled from the Deuba and Waidamudamu districts of Viti Levu, Fiji. Interview administered surveys were conducted by trained research assistants with data collected electronically. Information was collected on demographics and health status, food security, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on food security, and dietary intake. Food insecurity was assessed using nine questions adapted from Fiji's 2014/5 national nutrition survey, measuring markers of food insecurity over the last 12 months. Additional questions were added to assess the perceived effect of COVID-19 on responses. To address the secondary aim, interview administered 24-hour diet recalls were conducted using Intake24 (a computerised dietary recall system) allowing the calculation of salt, sugar and fruit and vegetable intakes for each person. Weighted linear regression models were used to determine the relationship between food insecurity and salt, sugar and fruit and vegetable intake.Results534 people participated in the survey (response rate 76%, 50.4% female, mean age 42 years). 75% (75.3%, 95% CI, 71.4 to 78.8%) of people reported experiencing food insecurity in the 12 months prior to the survey. Around one fifth of people reported running out of foods (16.8%, 13.9 to 20.2%), having to skip meals (19.3%, 16.2 to 22.9%), limiting variety of foods (19.0%, 15.9 to 22.5%), or feeling stressed due to lack of ability to meet food needs (19.5%, 16.4 to 23.0%). 67% (66.9%, 62.9 to 70.7%) reported becoming more food insecure and changing what they ate due to COVID-19. However, people also reported positive changes such as making a home garden (67.8%, 63.7 to 71.6%), growing fruit and vegetables (59.5%, 55.6 to 63.8%), or trying to eat healthier (14.7%, 12.0 to 18.0%). There were no significant associations between food insecurity and intakes of salt, sugar or fruit and vegetables.ConclusionParticipants reported high levels of food insecurity, exceeding recommendations for salt and sugar intake and not meeting fruit and vegetable recommendations, and becoming more food insecure due to COVID-19. Most participants reported making home gardens and/or growing fruit and vegetables in response to the pandemic. There is an opportunity for these activities to be fostered in addressing food insecurity in Fiji, with likely relevance to the Pacific region and other Small Island Developing States who face similar food insecurity challenges.",About Sufficiency
"The Impact of Environmental Regulation on Farmland Non-Point Source Pollution: Evidence from the Dongting Lake Plain, China","Non-point source pollution from agricultural land use is a significant contributor to environmental pollution, causing serious threats to water, air, and soil quality. Environmental regulations have been shown to have a significant negative effect on pollutant emissions. However, empirical studies examining the impact of agricultural environmental regulations on cultivated land non-point source pollution are limited. To explore the effects of environmental regulations on cultivated land non-point source pollution, this study focuses on the Dongting Lake Plain. Using statistical data from 2010 to 2020, we analyze the temporal and spatial changes in cultivated land non-point source pollution before and after the implementation of the ""Zero Growth of Fertilizer and Pesticide Use Action Plan"". A spatial econometric model is used to assess the impact of environmental regulations on pollution. The results indicate that non-point source pollution in the Dongting Lake Plain shows positive global spatial autocorrelation. Locally, in 2010 and 2015, high-high clusters were dominant, while low-low clusters were less common. By 2020, low-low clusters became the main pattern of pollution. The introduction of the Zero Growth Action Plan had a negative impact on pollution intensity within the region and positive spillover effects on neighboring areas. In terms of emission structure, the plan significantly reduced nitrogen emission intensity and pesticide loss, but had a positive impact on phosphorus emissions. The level of regional economic development had a significant negative effect on pollution intensity, while urbanization had a positive effect. Agricultural technological progress showed a negative spatial spillover effect on phosphorus emissions, and regional economic development had a negative spatial spillover effect on nitrogen and pesticide emissions. This study provides evidence of the impact of environmental regulations on cultivated land non-point source pollution and offers valuable insights for the development of future pollution control policies.",About Sufficiency
What is the 'alternative'? Insights from Istanbul's food networks,"Outside of the Global North, where agri-food systems have not yet consolidated into a 'funnel shape,' what makes an urban provisioning actor 'alternative' is not always clear. In this paper, I use members' own definitions, emphases, and arguments to differentiate 'alternative' networks from other provisioning actors. Using data from semi-structured interviews, I show that while community-building and an affiliation with the food movement (broadly defined) are the most critical features identified by people who participate in these networks, more informal, ad hoc, familial or village networks that are utilized as a response to urban food insecurity are excluded. While such exclusions may not be unique, in this case, they reflect more fundamental divisions regarding what 'alternative' implies and how to challenge the throttling hold of conventional provisioning agents on the contemporary agri-food system.",About Sufficiency
What we can learn from US food policy response to crises of the last 20 years-Lessons for the COVID-19 era: A scoping review,"The U.S government has historically responded to human, natural and economic disruptions that threaten food insecurity by modifying federally-funded public food programs. The authors conducted a scoping review to identify and summarize available evidence on the efforts of a 20-year period to modify food benefit programs in response to emergencies; describe how food benefit programs interact to support vulnerable populations; identify key facilitators and barriers to effective implementation and impact; and assess relevance of evidence to COVID19 pandemic. Scoping reviews address broad research questions aimed at mapping key concepts and available evidence in a defined area, and include academic and gray literature and reports from governments and NGOs. This review followed the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews and included a three-stage search strategy. Studies were independently screened for eligibility by two researchers with multiple rounds of review. A content based charting method was used to summarize evidence. More than 2289 documents were identified and screened. After review, 44 documents were analyzed. Only 18% of documents reported program or policy impact data. Additionally, review of 149 policy records from State by State FNS Disaster Assistance Data from Oct 2016-Dec 2020 assessed 96 state specific food policy responses to 72 distinct events. Analysis revealed 53 distinct packages of food policy modifications used in response to crises. This scoping review demonstrates that few studies document the impact on food insecurity of food benefit modifications in response to crises. Most documents present output level details about costs and total number of individuals served. Many documents describe food policy response to crises without providing evaluation of response. Analysis points to SNAP and Child Nutrition Programs as most commonly modified food benefit programs in the wake of U.S. crises.

"Wheat Yield, Biomass, and Radiation Interception and Utilization Under Conservation Tillage: Greater Response to Drip Fertigation Compared to Intensive Tillage","Conservation tillage, particularly no tillage (NT), has been recognized as an efficient farming practice, particularly in dryland agriculture, as it significantly enhances crop yields, improves soil health, and contributes to environmental sustainability. However, the influence of NT on winter wheat radiation interception and utilization, biomass, and yield under NT in irrigated fields, especially under drip fertigation, is unclear. A field experiment was carried out for two growing seasons in Shandong province, China, using a split-plot design with the tillage method as the main plot (no tillage, NT; rotary tillage, RT; and first plowing the soil and then conducting rotary tillage, PRT), and water-nitrogen management as the sub-plot (N fertilizer broadcasting and flood irrigation, BF and drip fertigation, DF). Our results showed that DF increased yield by 11.0-28.5%, but the yield response to DF depended on the tillage methods. NT had the highest response in yield of 26.3-28.5%, followed by RT of 14.6-15.1% and PRT of 11.0-11.9%. Both increased grains per ear and ear number, a result of the greater maximum stems number donating to the yield gain by DF under NT. This gain was also due to the substantially promoted post-anthesis biomass (36.7-47.3%), which resulted from the increased interception of solar radiation and radiation use efficiency after anthesis. In addition, the extended post-anthesis duration also benefited biomass and yield. To conclude, our findings underscore the critical need to optimize water and nitrogen management strategies to maximize yield under conservation tillage systems.",About Sufficiency
Which functional unit to identify sustainable foods?,"Objective: In life-cycle assessment, the functional unit defines the unit for calculation of environmental indicators. The objective of the present study was to assess the influence of two functional units, 100 g and 100 kcal (420 kJ), on the associations between three dimensions for identifying sustainable foods, namely environmental impact (via greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE)), nutritional quality (using two distinct nutrient profiling systems) and price. Design: GHGE and price data were collected for individual foods, and were each expressed per 100 g and per 100 kcal. Two nutrient profiling models, SAIN, LIM and UK Ofcom, were used to assess foods' nutritional quality. Spearman correlations were used to assess associations between variables. Sustainable foods were identified as those having more favourable values for all three dimensions. Setting: The French Individual and National Dietary Survey (INCA2), 2006-2007. Subjects: Three hundred and seventy-three foods highly consumed in INCA2, covering 65 % of total energy intake of adult participants. Results: When GHGE and price were expressed per 100 g, low-GHGE foods had a lower price and higher SAIN, LIM and Ofcom scores (r=0.59, -0.34 and -0.43, respectively), suggesting a compatibility between the three dimensions; 101 and 100 sustainable foods were identified with SAIN, LIM and Ofcom, respectively. When GHGE and price were expressed per 100 kcal, low-GHGE foods had a lower price but also lower SAIN, LIM and Ofcom scores (r=0.67, 0.51 and 0.47, respectively), suggesting that more environment-friendly foods were less expensive but also less healthy; thirty-four sustainable foods were identified with both SAIN, LIM and Ofcom.

Whole-Systems Analysis of Environmental and Economic Sustainability in Arable Cropping Systems: A Case Study,"The long-term sustainability of crop production depends on the complex network of interactions and trade-offs between biotic, abiotic and economic components of agroecosystems. An integrated arable management system was designed to maintain yields, whilst enhancing biodiversity and minimising environmental impact. Management interventions included conservation tillage and organic matter incorporation for soil biophysical health, reduced crop protection inputs and integrated pest management strategies for enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and intercropping, cover cropping and under-sowing to achieve more sustainable nutrient management. This system was compared directly with standard commercial practice in a split-field experimental design over a six-year crop rotation. The effect of the cropping treatment was assessed according to the responses of a suite of indicators, which were used to parameterise a qualitative multi-attribute model. Scenarios were run to test whether the integrated cropping system achieved greater levels of overall sustainability relative to standard commercial practice. Overall sustainability was rated high for both integrated and conventional management of bean, barley and wheat crops. Winter oilseed crops scored medium for both cropping systems and potatoes scored very low under standard management but achieved a medium level of sustainability with integrated management. In general, high scores for environmental sustainability in integrated cropping systems were offset by low scores for economic sustainability relative to standard commercial practice. This case study demonstrates the value of a 'whole cropping systems' approach using qualitative multi-attribute modelling for the assessment of existing cropping systems and for predicting the likely impact of new management interventions on arable sustainability.",About Sufficiency
Main challenges and key features of indicator-based agroecological assessment frameworks in the context of international cooperation,"Agroecology increasingly gains importance in the discussion about sustainable food systems. To facilitate the transition from conventional farming to agroecological farming, adequate methods and concepts to measure and assess impact and productivity of agroecological farming systems (AFSs) are needed, which consider their multifunctionality and other specific characteristics, here called agroecological sustainability assessment frameworks and tools (ASAFTs). In the past years, many agricultural sustainability assessment tools and frameworks were developed but their suitability and applicability to AFSs was not investigated. To close this knowledge gap, we aimed at identifying, reviewing, and discussing published ASAFTs in the context of international cooperation, providing an overview of the current challenges, needs, and requirements in assessing AFSs at the farm level with the means of indicators. Desktop and scientific database research was conducted to identify and discuss published indicator-based ASAFTs at the farm level. The analysis was based on the following four framework elements that the authors considered to be essential for ASAFTs: (1) the adaptability to local conditions all over the world, (2) the involvement of farmers in the development process, (3) the consideration of the multiple functions of an agroecosystem in the definition and measurement of its productivity, and (4) the accounting for interactions between multiple agroecosystem functions and their measurement. Only a few analyzed assessment frameworks at least partly consider these essential elements and were designed specifically for AFSs. However, our study also showed that these frameworks were (1) restricted in their geographical application scope, (2) quite heterogeneous and barely comparable, and (3) based on productivity indicators that do not fully capture the multiple functions of AFSs. Therefore, we identified the need for the development of appropriate agroecological productivity indicators and common standard or reference frameworks for assessing AFSs, which will be crucial for upscaling agroecology.",About Sufficiency
"Wild Vegetable Species in Makawanpur District, Central Nepal: Developing a Priority Setting Approach for Domestication to Improve Food Security","Makawanpur district in Central Nepal is considered a biodiversity hotspot of the country. Numerous wild plant species are traditionally used as vegetables and contribute to nutrition and food security of local communities. However, abundance and use of many of these wild vegetables have been decreasing, which calls for domestication and cultivation of priority species. This study aimed at documenting wild vegetable species and their use to develop a priority list for future domestication efforts. Wild vegetables were surveyed in three agro-climatic zones (500-2,200 masl) of the Makawanpur district in natural forest, homegardens, farmer's fields, fallow land, and markets. Information about local names, plant parts used, seasonal availability, mode of consumption, primary consumers, and preference ranking for consumption and sale was gathered during forest/field walks and by semi-structured interviews of 144 respondents (including men, women, and children) of three ethnic groups. Priority setting was based on nine variables related to priorities for taste and sale, species' occurrence in homegardens, wide use among ethnic groups, broad altitude range, harvest season, level of threat as perceived by respondents, children's preference for consumption, and possibility for processing. A total of 89 vegetable species were identified. Forests and fallows were most important for collecting wild vegetables, which were mainly used for home consumption. Only 26 species were also sold in markets. Ethnic group, respondent's age, and altitude of the location had a significant influence on the respondents' knowledge of wild vegetables, while gender had no influence. The following six species were rated highest in the priority setting: Bauhinia variegata L., Dendrocalamus hamiltonii Nees & Arn. ex Munro, Bambusa tulda Roxb., Diplazium esculentum (Retz.) Sw., Dryopteris cochleata (Ham. ex D. Don) C. Chr., and Tectaria gemmifera (F,e) Alston. The developed priority setting approach was considered suitable, but it should also include further variables such as nutritional value and market potential of the species before it being recommended for further testing.",About Sufficiency
Will international pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals alleviate poverty in mountains?,"Since September 2000, when world leaders agreed on time-bound, measurable goals to reduce extreme poverty, hunger, illiteracy, and disease while fostering gender equality and ensuring environmental sustainability, the Milennium Development goals (MDGs) have increasingly come to dominate the policy objectives of many states and development agencies. The concern has been raised that the tight time frame and financial restrictions might force governments to invest in the more productive sectors, thus comprimising the quality and sustainability of development efforts. In the long term, this may lead to even greater inequality, especially between geographical regions and social strata. Hence people living marginal areas, for example in remote mountain regions and minority peoples risk being disadvantaged by this internationally agreed agenda. Strategies to over come hunger and poverty in their different dimensions in mountain areas need to focus on strengthening the economy of small-scale farmers, while also fostering the sustainable use of natural resources, taking into consideration their multifunctionality.",About Sufficiency
"Implications of the Urban Water and Food Systems Governance Nexus for Household Food Security in the City of Gweru, Zimbabwe","Innovative water governance practices are essential to achieve sustainable cities through robust public policies and stakeholder engagement. This study assessed the dynamics of water service delivery in Gweru and its impact on household food security. The study focused on the city's food sources, water service pricing, power struggles in decision-making, and the implications for household food security. A household survey was conducted with 489 respondents selected by stratified random sampling. Interviews with purposively enrolled key informants and observations were also used. Findings revealed a multi-faceted scenario of water governance challenges that crippled household food security. Food purchases and farming, the primary household food streams for the city, were under threat due to water shortages and high monthly water bills. More than 90% of household incomes were below the Poverty Datum Line and the Total Consumption Poverty Line; water bills accounted for a significant portion, ultimately causing food insecurity. The grant-aided municipality emphasized revenue collection to mitigate the central government's 2013 debt cancellation. Gweru had no useful alternative sources of water for agriculture. The existing water governance failed to capture the complex symbiotic relationship between the city's water and food availability. While we advocate minimal central government interference, the municipality must introduce an efficient dual-purpose water system to protect residents, the natural environment, and the local authority's finances.",About Sufficiency
Big Data in Smart Farming - A review,"Smart Farming is a development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stake-holders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.

"Wood energy production, sustainable farming livelihood and multifunctionality in Finland","Climate change and the projected depletion of fossil energy resources pose multiple global challenges. Innovative technologies offer interesting possibilities to achieve more sustainable outcomes in the energy production sector. Local, decentralized alternatives have the potential to sustain livelihoods in rural areas. One example of such a venture has emerged around heating businesses in rural Finland, and is referred to as heat entrepreneurship. Heat entrepreneurship entails a system where a local forest owner, usually a farmer, provides heat to a small community or local building, such as a school. Heat is produced using local forest resources that would otherwise be unutilized. The purpose of this study is to examine heat entrepreneurship as a potential sustainable alternative for energy production and its multifunctionality. The data was collected by interviewing 15 heat entrepreneurs in the area of Central Finland. The study demonstrates how multifunctional farming-related energy production can provide more sustainable livelihoods for farmers by increasing social, economic and environmental sustainability. This is achieved by diversifying farmers' economic options, enhancing rural areas economically, increasing farmers' social networks and well-being and, to some extent, by boosting local environmental capital. However, the study also points to differences among the farmers and sustainability trade-offs, suggesting for the need to better acknowledge the local perceptions in policy-making.

"Performance of cropland low-carbon use in China: Measurement, spatiotemporal characteristics, and driving factors","Low-carbon cropland use is of significant importance in addressing global warming. Most research has paid attention to measuring cropland use efficiency under carbon emission constraints to reconcile carbon mitigation and food security. However, there are limitations with carbon accounting, approach selection, and subsequent regression. To extend existing research, this study aimed to evaluate the performance of cropland low-carbon use (PCW) and determine the driving factors. In this study, carbon emissions and sequestration of cropland use in Chinese provinces from 2000 to 2019 were calculated. Based on the carbon accounting, an extended slack-based efficiency measurement was applied to evaluate the provincial PCLU. Besides, spatiotemporal characteristics of the PCLU were portrayed. Owing to spatial correlation, the spatial Durbin model was employed to elucidate the driving factors. The results indicate that: (1) cropland use systems acted as net carbon sinks in China with sequestration and emissions of 5.624 t/hm(2) and 1.980 t/hm(2), respectively. (2) In China, the average PCLU was 0.727, whereas the provinces had values ranging from 0.2-1.2, with significant gaps. (3) PCLU evolved stably in northeastern China and fluctuated in the other three regions. Meanwhile, provinces with high PCLU shifted from the south to the north of the country during the study period. The global Moran's index demonstrated that a positive spatial correlation existed. (4) Agricultural structure adjustment and urbanization can promote PCW, whereas investment and disaster can undermine it. PCLU of a province would be affected by the agricultural structure and disaster in its nearby provinces owing to spillover effects. Consequently, it is suggested that emissions in provinces should be mitigated according to the local carbon structure. Harnessing the key factors and spatial interactions can potentially help achieve regional low-carbon cropland use. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Combined application of chemical and organic fertilizers enhances soil organic carbon sequestration and crop productivity by improving carbon stability and management index in a rice-rice cropping system,"Soil organic carbon (OC) sequestration in farmlands can be improved through fertilizer applications, particularly with the addition of organic amendments. However, our knowledge of the effects of long-term different fertilization on OC chemical stability and carbon management index (CMI), as well as their response to crop productivity remains limited in rice-rice cropping system. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of fertilization on various OC sequestration indicators in bulk soil and chemical fractions, and establish their relationships with crop productivity. The treatments selected in the present study were those which had undergone long-term fertilization under double-rice cropping including: (1) no fertilization (CK); (2) combined application of chemical nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium fertilizers (NPK); (3) the doubled rate of NPK treatment (2NPK); and (4) NPK treatment plus organic fertilizers (NPKM). After 29 years of fertilization, we observed that NPKM resulted in the highest OC stocks (11.47 and 26.15 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and distribution ratios (24 and 54%, respectively) in the less-labile fraction and passive pool. Conversely, it showed the lowest OC values in the labile fraction and active pool compared to CK, NPK, and 2NPK treatments. Additionally, NPKM significantly (P < 0.05) increased CMI (by 47 and 33%) over CK and NPK treatments, which suggests that soil receiving NPKM was better managed. Apart from maintaining higher crop yields and increasing OC input, NPKM also tremendously enhanced OC sequestration as indicated by the highest soil OC stock (48.80 Mg ha(-1)) and OC sequestration rate (CSR, 0.37 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). There was an increasing trend of CSR and passive OC pool, but a decreasing trend of carbon sequestration efficiency with increasing OC input, which may be associated with OC saturation behavior of soil. Furthermore, crop yield showed significant positive linear correlations with passive OC pool and CMI. In summary, long-term combined application of chemical and organic fertilizers enhanced OC sequestration and crop productivity by improving passive OC pool and CMI, which contributed to realize agricultural sustainability in double-cropping rice regions.",About Sufficiency
Spatial and temporal dynamics of agricultural residue resources in the last 30 years in China,"The availability and distribution of biomass resources are important for the development of the bioenergy industry in a region. Biomass resources are abundant in China; however, the raw material is severely deficient, which makes the Chinese bioenergy industry an embarrassment and a contradiction. Unclear reserves and distribution and changing trends of biomass resources are the reason for this situation. A collection coefficient model of Chinese agricultural residue resources was established and the spatial and temporal pattern dynamics of agricultural residue resources in the last 30 years were analyzed. The results show that agricultural residue resources increased in stages from 1978 to 2011, including a rapid increase from 1978 to 1999, a significant fall from 2000 to 2004, and a slow increase from 2004 to 2011. Crops straw and livestock manure are the main ingredients of agricultural residue resources with proportions of 53-59% and 31-38%, respectively. However, the former has gradually decreased, while the latter is increasing. This mainly resulted from the strategic reorganization of the Chinese agriculture structure and the rapid development of large-scale livestock breeding and agricultural mechanization. Large regional differences existed in Chinese agricultural residue resources, and three distribution types formed, including resource-rich areas in North China, Northeast and Inner Mongolia, resource-limited areas in Central and Southwest China, and resource-poor areas along Northwest and Southeast coasts. This pattern is a reverse of the distributions of climatic conditions, water resources, economic development, human resources, and technological levels. Finally, it can be predicted that livestock manure and biomass conversion technology at low temperature will play increasingly significant roles in bioenergy industry development.",About Sufficiency
Assessing regional-scale variability in deforestation and forest degradation rates in a tropical biodiversity hotspot,"Deforestation and forest degradation are major drivers of global environmental change and tropical forests are subjected to unprecedented pressures from both. For most tropical zones, deforestation rates are averaged across entire countries, often without highlighting regional differentiation. There are also very few estimates of forest degradation, either averaged or localized for the tropics. We quantified regional and country-wide changes in deforestation and forest degradation rates for Madagascar from Landsat temporal data (in two intervals, 1994-2002 and 2002-2014). To our knowledge, this is the first country-wide estimate of forest degradation for Madagascar. We also performed an intensity analysis to categorize the magnitude and speed of transitions between forest, vegetation matrix, cultivated land and exposed surface. We found significant regional heterogeneity in deforestation and forest degradation. Deforestation rates decreased annually in lowland evergreen moist forest by -0.24% and in all other vegetation zones. Forest degradation rates had annual increases in the same period in lowland evergreen moist forest (0.09%), littoral forest (0.06%) but decreased in medium altitude moist evergreen forest (-0.25%), dry deciduous forest (-0.23%) and scelrophyllous woodland (-0.61%) in the same period. Despite these regional differences, higher rates of deforestation and forest degradation were consistently driven by rapid and large-sized conversions of largely intact forest to cultivated lands and exposed surfaces, most of which occurred between 1994 and 2002. These results suggest that while targeted conservation projects may have reduced forest degradation rates in some areas (e.g. medium altitude moist evergreen forest), the drivers of land cover change remain intense in relatively neglected regions. We advocate a more balanced approach to future conservation initiatives, one recognizing that deforestation and forest degradation, particularly in tropical Africa, are often driven by region-specific conditions and therefore require conservation policies tailored for local conditions.",About Sufficiency
Yield and quality analyses of bioenergy crops grown on a regulatory brownfield,"Agriculture faces unique challenges as increasing world population places unprecedented demands on food, feed, and energy resources. In an effort to become more efficient and sustainable, marginal land, including regulatory brownfields prohibited for food consumption purposes could be utilized for bioenergy crop production. In 2006-2008, we evaluated soybean (Glycine Max (L.) Merr.), canola (Brassica napus L. var. napus), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) to determine crop suitability for bioenergy production on a regulatory brownfield site. Sites selected for the study included a remediated brownfield site in Rose Township, Oakland County, and a historically cropped agricultural site at East Lansing, Ingham County, serving as the control. Comparisons of biofuel quality components were conducted. The total oil yield of oilseed crops was not significantly different ( p < 0.05) between locations. Concentrations of palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic (C18:3) fatty acids differed by location, yet oleic acid concentrations, optimal for quality biodiesel production, were not significantly different across all oilseed crops. Total crystalline cellulose levels from switchgrass were higher at the agricultural land site compared to the brownfield site in 2007 yielding 16% more crystalline cellulose; but there were no differences between locations in 2008. Detectable levels of PCB's were found in soils at the brownfield site; however, transfer to grain or biomass was not detected. Results suggest that brownfield sites have the potential to produce feedstock of suitable quality for conversion to liquid transportation fuels. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",About Sufficiency
Evaluation of the environmental sustainability of farmers' land use decisions in the saline-alkaline areas,"Environmental sustainability has become the focus of agricultural sustainability. This study is aimed at evaluating the environmental sustainability of farmers' land use decisions on saline-alkaline soil in China. Based on empirical and theoretical approaches, the decisions mainly include planting, crop distribution, irrigation, drainage, and fertilization. By surveying 22 administrative villages in typical ecologically fragile saline-alkaline areas of five regions (Shandong, Jiangsu, Jilin, Ningxia, and Xinjiang), the paper builds the evaluation criteria at village level, and obtains a comprehensive index. From the results, irrigation concerns are absent from decision-making. For other decisions, farmers in most villages can appropriately deal with planting, drainage, and fertilization according to the regional natural and social geography conditions. But the comprehensive index of crop distribution in the coastal areas is much stronger than in the northeast and northwest. It is found that the similarities of unsustainability lie in the planting of water-consuming crops, the arbitrary distribution of crops, lack of drainage planning, obsolete water conservancy facilities, excessive use of chemical fertilizers, etc. According to the research, on the one hand, it can guide farmers to rationally make use of saline-alkaline land; on the other hand, it can also provide the basis for government to make differentiated policies in different areas and enhance pertinence in the course of technological extension and application.",About Sufficiency
Advanced technologies of soil moisture monitoring in precision agriculture: A Review,"Facing the dual challenges of limited natural resources, particularly water, and increasing demands for food security, the role of precision agriculture has become increasingly critical, especially in resource-constrained environments of developing countries. Since its inception in the mid-1980s, precision agriculture in the United States and Europe has evolved to integrate advanced technologies to optimize resource use and minimize environmental impacts, yet it remains in its nascent stages in major developing countries despite attempts at precision irrigation practices. This paper reviews the evolution of soil moisture monitoring technologies from 2013 to 2024, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and accuracy in various soil depths to guide modern practices in water and irrigation management within precision agriculture. Highlighting the shift from traditional methods to innovative on-the-go sensors, including electrical, optical, and radiometric sensors, as well as the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite remote sensing (RS), and IoT-based systems and wireless sensor networks (WSNs), these technologies provide timely, cost-effective, and detailed soil moisture data, significantly enhancing irrigation precision. Our analysis not only showcases technological advancements but also identifies current research gaps, proposing the integration of these technologies to enhance soil moisture management and support sustainable, high-yield agriculture. The anticipated benefits of this integration include improved soil health, increased crop yields, and more effective utilization of water resources, crucial for the sustainability of agriculture in developing nations. By bridging the research-practice gap, this paper aims to foster the adoption of these technologies in precision agriculture, addressing specific agricultural challenges in water-limited settings.",About Sufficiency
Acceptance of the summer fishing moratorium among small-scale fishers in China,"Understanding the acceptance and views of small-scale fishers regarding the summer fishing moratorium (SFM) is essential for the sustainability of marine fishery resources and social development of traditional fishing areas in China. This study explored the acceptance and impact of the SFM from the perspective of small-scale fishers, reviewed the existing literature on policy acceptance, and developed a research framework for evaluating their acceptance of the marine SFM. In addition, this study identified factors affecting policy acceptance, including policy awareness, law enforcement effectiveness, resource protection effects, and livelihood impacts. A total of 325 valid questionnaires were collected from small-scale fishers in four towns around the Beibu Gulf. The results revealed that respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the positive long-term impact of the SFM. However, they acknowledged that the SFM affected their livelihoods to varying degrees. Most fishers believed that stricter enforcement of the policy was necessary and that violations to the rules must be strongly punishable, leading to a high overall acceptance of the policy. Policy acceptance was positively affected by awareness, effective implementation, and perceived resource protection but negatively affected by livelihood impacts. These results highlight the need to formulate balanced policy measures that consider both resource protection and the economic well-being of small-scale fishers. The study recommends strengthening policy implementation, improving communication strategies, and providing targeted financial support to mitigate negative livelihood impacts, thereby fostering greater acceptance of sustainable fishery management.",About Sufficiency
Supply chain integration and resilience in China's pig sector: case study evidences from emerging institutional arrangements,"Pig sector in China is faced with high risks, such as price fluctuation and food safety, and environmental regulation uncertainty. The recent African swine fever has caused public panic and drop down of pork consumption in a short term. The ""wu-shui-gong-zhi"" policy is a newly recognized environmental policy risk, and its key content is to shut down directly the pig farms close to water resources. Lots of small- and medium-sized farms have been affected, especially in coastal provinces. Supply chain integration received wide attention in supply chain management. Literature has shown that a well-coordinated food supply chain will bring positive outcomes for chain stakeholders. However, the relationship between food supply chain integration and resilience is not empirically captured. This research aims to explore the relationship between supply chain integration and supply chain resilience, and the mechanism of how supply chain integration works on supply chain resilience. To achieve the research purpose, an in-depth ethnographical case study is performed. Four cases in China's pig sector were selected, with different types of supply chain integration between cooperative and companies. They differ in supply chain resilience levels. We found that supply chain integration has a positive effect on supply chain resilience through agility and robustness. Supply chain agility also has positive relationship with supply chain robustness. It implies that supply chain stakeholders should efficiently exchange information, enhance circulation rate, and jointly make plans to be more resilient to risks. The government needs to make policies to encourage and facilitate supply chain integration among supply chain members to enhance supply chain resilience.",About Sufficiency
"The importance of diversity in local food systems: a network analysis of food-related interactions in the indigenous food system on St. Paul Island, Alaska","Arctic Indigenous food systems are typified by diverse social interactions that maintain food security. Given the numerous challenges Arctic Indigenous communities face, it is important to understand diversity in these systems and how they are impacted by change. This study adopts a mixed methods approach that combines participatory methods with network analysis to assess the diversity of food-related interactions between different actor types in the mixed food system on St. Paul Island, Alaska. We conducted 36 interviews with local food system actors to identify current food security challenges and food-related interactions in the local food system. We used network analysis to investigate the diversity of interactions in the food system quantitatively. We simulated the effects of two key food security challenges (out-migration and knowledge loss) on food system diversity and explored interventions to increase diversity. Qualitative data from the same interviews were used to embed our results in the lived realities of the St. Paul Island community. Our approach reveals diverse interactions in the local food system, reflecting both subsistence and market-based elements of the St. Paul Island mixed economy. While both challenges threaten the system's diversity, out-migration presents a more immediate risk to food system diversity than knowledge loss. We advocate for targeting a combination of food system interventions at the community level to enhance food system diversity effectively. Our research contributes to understanding the importance of diversity for Arctic Indigenous food security and emphasizes the need to recognize the complex interactions between food system interventions and their implications for Arctic Indigenous communities.",About Sufficiency
