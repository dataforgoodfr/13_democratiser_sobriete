Good governance in energy efficiency - Strategy to shape public attitudes on energy efficiency,"The special focus on historic buildings is important as little progress has been made in this respect, although it is a crucial problem in most European cities. The fact that public institutions are often located in historic buildings makes this problem relevant for decision-makers themselves. Fossil fuels heating these buildings are expensive and further difficulties arise from the complexity of regulations that need to be complied with and also from possible social implications. How can GovernEE Central Europe Project help? GovernEE aims at rationalising energy use of public buildings, with a special focus on historic buildings, by approaching the problem from the point of view of good governance: · Strengthen the responsibilities of policy makers and the wider public regarding energy efficiency; · Incorporate energy efficiency measures into decision-making processes of municipalities by promoting a cross-sectoral approach; · Strengthen policy makers' planning competences by developing integrated urban development plans prioritising energy efficiency goals.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable performance evaluation of the supply chain,"Being sustainable is now a source of competitive advantage and a question of survival for the supply chains. Indeed, several researches were conducted about this topic by covering several aspects such as the design of the supply chains, their optimization and the evaluation of their performance. However, concerning the performance evaluation of the sustainable supply chain, the models suggested are generally limited to some indicators of performance. In this regard, the objective of this article consists in presenting a framework for the economic, environmental and social performance evaluation within the supply chain. To this end, we proposed a model of performance evaluation of the supply chains relying on indicators which reflect the three dimensions of sustainable development.

"Edible films and coatings, its chemical crosslinking, starch-protein interaction and application in food system: A systematic review","Food waste is a significant issue for food packaging companies, with extending the shelf life of perishable items a primary goal of modern preservation technology. Edible films and coatings (EFC) offer a promising, sustainable solution to this challenge, drawing attention for their effectiveness in reducing waste by prolonging food shelf life. These coatings and films incorporates binding agents (food-grade), solvents, and additives (plasticizers, surfactants, cross-linkers, antimicrobial agents, nanoparticles, and fruit or vegetable residues) to modify EFC properties. Biopolymers in EFCs, when combined with plasticizers and other additives, alter the film and coatings physical and functional characteristics. The film-forming processes involve intermolecular forces like covalent bonding (disulphide bonds and cross-linking) along with electrostatic, hydrophobic, and ionic interactions. EFC are produced through methods like spraying, dipping, extrusion etc. Integrating polysaccharide, protein, and lipid ingredients into the film and coating matrix improves the quality of minimally processed or fresh-cut foods, helping to reduce post-harvest losses of perishable items. Broader adoption of EFCs by consumers and the food industry would enhance food quality and bring social and environmental benefits.

Machine learning-based analysis of occupant-centric aspects: Critical elements in the energy consumption of residential buildings,"The housing sector consumes a significant amount of energy worldwide, which is mainly attributed to operating energy systems for the provision of thermally comfortable indoor environments. Although the literature in this field has focused on investigating critical factors in energy consumption, only a few studies have conducted a quantitative sensitivity analysis for thermal occupant factors (TOF) (i.e., metabolic rate and clothing level). Therefore, this paper introduces a framework for testing the criticality of TOF with a cross-comparison against building-related factors, considering the constraint of occupant thermal comfort. Using a building energy simulation model, the energy consumption of a case study is simulated, and building energy model alternatives are generated. The scope includes TOF and building envelope factors, with an established orthogonal experimental design. A popular branch of machine learning (ML) called linear genetic programming (LGP) is used to analyse the generated data from the experiment. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted using the developed LGP model to determine and rank the criticality of the considered factors. The findings reveal that occupants' metabolic rate and clothing level have relevancy factors of −0.48 and −0.38 respectively, which ranked them 2nd and 3rd against building envelope factors for achieving energy-efficient comfortable houses.

The current study elucidated the principles, advantages, and limitations of IWWT by the DHS-based system, giving detailed explanations on the removal mechanisms of heavy metals, dyes, emerging contaminants, and nutrients. The techno-economic analysis revealed profitability indicators of 6.4-year payback period, 819 USD net present value, and 8.9 % internal rate of return from pollutant shadow price, carbon credits, and biogas selling. The life cycle assessment (LCA) observations exhibited minimal impacts on toxicity, eutrophication, acidification, human health, and ecosystem quality at the midpoint/endpoint hierarchy levels. The proposed DHS-based plant could fulfil sustainable development goals (SDGs), primarily SDG#3 by reducing water-borne disease, SDG#6 by enhancing water availability, SDG#13 by minimizing the carbon footprint issue, and SDG#14 by conserving aquatic environment. This study depicted that the techno-financial analysis and LCA tools could be integrated with the design and optimization strategies of DHS, offering insights into profitability and holistic management approaches in sustainable wastewater treatment. Because energy utilization for pumps’ operation emerged as a critical factor influencing the overall LCA score, future investigations should employ biogenic sources for electricity supply and apply artificial intelligence techniques to optimize the equipment operation mode that could reduce the expected CO2 emissions.

Dominating Sets-Based Approach for Maximizing Lifetime of IoT-Based Heterogeneous WSNs Enabled Sustainable Smart City Applications,"The versatility and diverse applications of IoT-based Heterogeneous WSN (HWSN) technologies make them valuable tools for achieving sustainability goals in Sustainable Smart Cities (SSCs). Proper management of underlying heterogeneous architecture is crucial for the successful operation of smart applications. To prolong the WSN’s lifespan and avoid failures, effective energy management is essential. Although researchers are continually exploring heterogeneity in WSN, it gets more and more important to create cost-effective paradigms that cover multiple facets of SSC while ensuring their stability and reliability. The concept of Dominating Sets (DS) in a graph can be leveraged to minimize resource utilization in WSNs by arranging nodes into disjoint DS, with only one set executing duties at any given time.

EAA algorithm attentively tries to form the set that maximizes lifespan while adhering to DS conditions in each iteration. EADDSA further incorporates an effective DS scheduling strategy to enhance the HWSN lifetime by establishing operational guidelines for each round, taking into account the estimated lifetimes and the designated number of working rounds for each DS.

Q*: Energy and delay-efficient dynamic queue management in TCP/IP virtualized data centers,"The emerging utilization of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Fog computing centers as an Internet virtual computing commodity is raising concerns over the energy consumptions of networked data centers for the support of delay-sensitive applications. In addition to the energy consumed by the servers, the energy wasted by the network devices that support TCP/IP reliable inter-Virtual Machines (VMs) connections is becoming a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose and develop a framework for the joint characterization and optimization of TCP/IP SaaS Fog data centers that utilize a bank of queues for increasing the fraction of the admitted workload. Our goal is two-fold: (i) we maximize the average workload admitted by the data center; and, (ii) we minimize the resulting networking-plus-computing average energy consumption. For this purpose, we exploit the Lyapunov stochastic optimization approach, in order to design and analyze an optimal (yet practical) online joint resource management framework, which dynamically performs: (i) admission control; (ii) dispatching of the admitted workload; (iii) flow control of the inter-VM TCP/IP connections; (iv) queue control; (v) up/down scaling of the processing frequencies of the instantiated VMs; and, (vi) adaptive joint consolidation of both physical servers and TCP/IP connections. The salient features of the resulting scheduler (e.g., the Q* scheduler) are that: (i) it admits distributed and scalable implementation; (ii) it provides deterministic bounds on the instantaneous queue backlogs; (iii) it avoids queue overflow phenomena; and, (iv) it effectively tracks the (possibly unpredictable) time-fluctuations of the input workload, in order to perform joint resource consolidation without requiring any a priori information and/or forecast of the input workload. Actual energy and delay performances of the proposed scheduler are numerically evaluated and compared against the corresponding ones of some competing and state-of-the-art schedulers, under: (i) Fast - Giga - 10Giga Ethernet switching technologies; (ii) various settings of the reconfiguration-consolidation costs; and, (iii) synthetic, as well as real-world workloads. The experimental results support the conclusion that the proposed scheduler can achieve over 30% energy savings.",Not About Sufficiency

Segment routing based energy aware routing for software defined data center,"Despite the fact that most of the data centers are software-defined, the multifaceted network architecture and increase in network traffic make data centers to suffer from overhead. Multipath TCP supports multiple paths for a single routing session and ensures proper utilization of bandwidth over all available links. As rise in number of nodes in data center is frequent and drastic, scalability issue limits the performance of many existing techniques. Segment Routing is vibrant in reducing scalability disputes and routing overhead. Segment routing approach combined with MPTCP traffic result in efficient routing approach. The downfall of the link capacity due to drastic incoming traffic remains as a major concern in data center network which enforces preventing link energy depletion due to high network traffic. Our proposed work, segment routing based energy aware routing approach for software defined data center aims to achieve throughput maximization through preserving link residual capacity and proper utilization of links. As well, our approach shows a decrease in length of segment label stack with respect to maximum segment label depth. Analysis is done by comparing the executions of other existing approaches in a single-controller environment with our energy-aware routing approach in a distributed environment. Distributed controller setup prevents network from single point of failure.

Platform-based task assignment for social manufacturing (PBTA4SM): State-of-the-art review and future directions,"Mass individualization is calling for a more sustainable manufacturing paradigm which can address the paradoxes of diversity, complexity, and affordability. Social Manufacturing (SM) represents a democratized servitization trend trying to reshape the traditional production relationship between consumers and manufacturers. To achieve the SM visions, new operational mechanisms for SM should be constructed to overcome the challenges of information sharing, accuracy, efficiency, security, sovereignty, etc. The survey found that task assignment (TA) is one of the foundational mechanisms for the implementation of regular autonomous manufacturing systems, as well as the role of TA is further amplified for distributed collaborative environments. Therefore, inspired by the relevant research of management science, Platform-based Task Assignment (PBTA) is proposed to distinguish and conceptualize this different research topic. In SM platforms, the diverse capacities and resources can be shared, so that knowing ""who can do” and “select whom to do"" is more important than knowing ""how to do"". Furthermore, the studies on TA for SM present a difference from the previous studies on TA in manufacturing. From a perspective of supply-demand mapping, PBTA illustrates the foundational operational mechanism for SM attracting many researchers’ attention from different fields. Meanwhile, research on PBTA is also required for the platform practices in the era of digital, shared, and platform economy. Given the academic importance and practical value, this survey carefully selects 250 valuable research articles relevant to PBTA for SM. A novel workflow model and knowledge framework, namely PBTA4SM, is proposed to identify and organize the critical issues and challenges. This study shows the state-of-the-art research advancement of PBTA including task design considerations, modelling methods, typical engineering problems, algorithms, decision patterns, key activities, and governance mechanisms.

Analyzing and evaluating supplier carbon footprints in supply networks,"Green purchasing in green supply chain management (GSCM) literature plays an essential role in achieving carbon neutrality by seeking to eliminate CO2 emissions. Single organizations would, however, not aim at such a goal if it is to their economic detriment. GSCM research streams highlight that the successful implementation of environmental considerations leads to better economic performance in the long term. Therefore, this paper aims to identify and analyze suppliers that exhibit both environmental and economic success, indicating an effective and efficient realization of their sustainability measures. Given the long-term horizon of the research problem, we differentiate from previous microeconomic research by taking a macro perspective on sustainable supplier analysis, which investigates macroeconomic indicators focusing on firms' revenues. The above-described economic and environmental efficiency is analyzed in a multiple case study using sustainability reports from 66 OEM suppliers as well as data on their revenues and ratings on their carbon pollution measured by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). First, a text mining inspired quantitative sustainable SWOT analysis is performed to evaluate the long-term strategy of organizations. A subsequent data envelopment analysis aims to identify efficient suppliers and causes for their efficiency. The overall results not only outline sustainable suppliers but also give insights into suppliers that may become sustainable in the future. We further show that large organizations struggle with meeting environmental expectations, whereas low-to-medium-sized suppliers tend to be more economically and environmentally efficient..

Consideration of digitalization for the purpose of resource efficiency in a learning factory,"Product diversity is increasing as a result of changing consumer behavior and diversification in global markets. For manufacturing companies, this development means an increase in the complexity of the required production systems and all company processes involved. Digitalization can make a decisive contribution to mastering this complexity and also offers a number of approaches to conserve resources and avoid waste at all levels of the organization. Simulations in the product development can help to optimize the material usage. The simulation of logistics and production processes helps to avoid waste in the material flow. The increasing use of low-cost sensors enables comprehensive data to be obtained on material movements and energy consumption. These data can be evaluated via big data analyses in order to develop approaches for the control and regulation of material flows and energy consumption. The visualization of data in energy management systems brings transparency, which shows new approaches for optimization. In order to improve one’s own competitiveness through digitalization a strategic approach is required. Several models and tools are available for the development of a company-wide strategy for digitalization. The Lower Saxony Learning Factory for Resource Efficiency (“NiFaR“) has analyzed models and tools to use them for suitable applications in the production environment of the Factory.

Electric vehicles and rooftop solar energy: Consumption values influencing decisions and barriers to co-adoption in the United States,"This study investigates household decisions regarding adoption of solar panels and plug-in electric vehicles in the United States (CA, CO, FL, MA, MN, TX, VA). Although the adoption of each technology is well-documented, the dynamics of their co-adoption have been understudied. This study uses Theory of Consumption Values to investigate co-adoption decisions. Employing qualitative interviews with co-adopters and single technology adopters, this research uncovers underlying motivations and challenges associated with co-adoption. The study reveals that co-adoption is primarily driven by a blend of functional, emotional, social, epistemic, and conditional values. Key findings indicate that direct connections between the adoption of electric vehicles and solar (conditional value) are uncommon. Instead, many co-adoption decisions are made independently, guided by overlapping consumption values. The study also identifies challenges to co-adoption, including cost, lack of knowledge, and perceived technology incompatibilities. These insights contribute to the broader understanding of complementarity in sustainable technology adoption by households. They also highlight the need for approaches that address identified barriers and facilitate the transition of single adopters to co-adopters.",Not About Sufficiency
Proactive and data-centric Internet of Things-based fog computing architecture for effective policing in smart cities,"Smart surveillance is crucial for improving citizen security and ensuring a sustainable environment for routine tasks, particularly within intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, it can be costly and burden taxpayers. The lack of public interaction makes it difficult for police to arrest and conduct investigations. Additionally, incidents increase due to similar patterns, making smart surveillance essential for reporting and addressing these issues. Smart devices such as sensors or actuators installed on the roads and within vehicles are critical components of any smart surveillance and ITS framework. This integration enhances system agility and facilitates proactive rather than reactive responses. It empowers security agencies to plan more effectively and respond swiftly during emergencies. The incorporation of cloud computing capabilities transforms traditional surveillance and ITS operations. Employing the Internet of Things (IoT) with edge or cloud computing extensions, such as fog computing, modernizes the management of security gadgets for Field Forces. This study investigates a smart surveillance fog-enabled approach to reduce response times for aiding agencies within ITS. By optimizing individual journeys through an RFID-based passing system, incidents are reported promptly to the nearest field force, enhancing overall ITS efficiency. The proactive approach improves resource consumption (energy, CPU, and network usage) compared to traditional reactive methods. The fog-enabled experiments demonstrated a CPU efficiency of approximately 95.76%, significantly outperforming the Cloud-only deployment, achieving a maximum average efficiency of 92.12%. Experimental evaluations in a simulation environment demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional approaches, marking a substantial advancement in IoT-aided ITS.",Not About Sufficiency

Consumption behavior of consumers in the circular economic system plays an important role in mitigating environmental degradation and resource depletion, driving economic opportunities globally, promoting local job creation and engender energy independence. However, the shift to the new economic model requires the collaboration of all stakeholders. Humankind has exploited the earth' natural resources with our relentless demands on the ecosystem, which now exceeds nature's regenerative capacity. This paper explores the consumer attitudes and behaviors toward the notion of the circular economy through the implementation of different innovative business models in different parts of Europe.

iMCU: A 28-nm Digital In-Memory Computing-Based Microcontroller Unit for TinyML,"Tiny machine learning (TinyML) envisions executing a deep neural network (DNN)-based inference on an edge device for improving battery life, latency, security, and privacy. Toward this vision, recent microcontroller units (MCUs) integrate in-memory computing (IMC) hardware to leverage its high energy efficiency and throughput in vector–matrix multiplication (VMM). However, those existing works require large IMC hardware, severely increasing the area overhead. In addition, most existing works use analog–mixed-signal (AMS) IMC hardware, exhibiting limited robustness over process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Finally, none can support a practical software development framework such as TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLite-micro). Due to these limitations, those MCUs did not present the performance for the standard benchmark MLPerf-Tiny, which makes it difficult to evaluate them against the state-of-the-art neural (not necessarily IMC-based) MCUs. In this article, we design a new IMC-based MCU, titled iMCU, for TinyML to address those challenges. In the design process, we: 1) define the optimal set of acceleration targets and 2) devise an area-efficient computation flow that requires the least amount of IMC hardware yet still provides a significant acceleration. In addition, we develop: 1) state-of-the-art digital IMC macros and 2) create the accelerator based on the macros, which can support the proposed computation flow in a fully pipelined manner. Combining those innovations, we prototyped the iMCU in a 28-nm CMOS.

The study adopted a semi-systematic review of extant literature on land restoration from academic journals, reports, and newsletters from 2000 to 2023. The results show a preponderance of participatory approaches, and use of Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK) for land restoration activities in dryland communities in Africa, whereas science-based methods are scarce. Most restoration practices involved biological, surveillance, mechanical, water conservation, climate-smart agriculture, soil fertility restoration strategies and income-generating techniques, but advocacy measures were low. Various restoration projects in Africa, have yielded substantial benefits, including regeneration of vegetation, improved nutrition and income generation among community groups, and benefits vary according to the strategy adopted and the context of project implementation. However, lack of funding, an insecure land tenure system, as well as poor coordination and monitoring of projects constitute huge barriers to land restoration efforts in Africa. We conclude that people-centered projects, social incentives, and income generating ventures are drivers of sustainable land restoration practices in Africa, and more policies and programme implementation are required in the aspect of land restoration advocacy campaigns.",Not About Sufficiency
Enhancing Energy Efficiency and Sustainability with Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids for Energy Transition,"The transition to a lower-carbon energy system across Europe brings numerous opportunities and challenges, necessitating advancements in sustainable and eco-friendly energy solutions. This study examines the design and operation of distribution networks and microgrids, particularly emphasizing the integration of hybrid AC/DC distribution systems. The primary goals of this integration are to enhance overall system performance and reduce operating expenses. Utilizing DIgSILENT Power Factory software, the research simulates a microgrid at the FOSS Research Center for Sustainable Energy at the University of Cyprus, incorporating real load and PV generation data. In order to reduce the amount of energy imported from the main grid, this approach evaluates various combinations of AC and DC loads, power production units, and energy storage solutions. The results show that the most optimal structure, with 65% DC loads and 35% AC loads, maximizes efficiency as well as minimizes running expenses. The analysis highlights a notable decrease in imported energy, which dropped from 60.3 kWh/day at full AC loads to 51.6 kWh/day at the optimal DC ratio. Finally, the design and implementation of effective, sustainable energy systems that are in line with changing European energy policy and technology breakthroughs will be significantly impacted by these outcomes.",Not About Sufficiency
Revolutionizing Healthcare Supply Chains With a Blockchain Framework for NFT-Based Product Certification and Inventory Management,"The proposed framework leverages Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to revolutionize supply chain management by ensuring product authenticity. Each product document stored in a repository is minted as an NFT. The NFT is a digital twin of the product's certification, containing metadata for tracking its origin, authenticity, and key details. When a buyer verifies the product's authenticity, the NFT is burned as a final step, ensuring that the product cannot be re-certified without a new issuance. This framework creates a transparent, tamper-proof, and decentralized system to enhance trust and accountability in the supply chain. By integrating the Ethereum-based Pure Chain network and smart contracts, this solution benefits from high availability, immutability, and the ability to automate key processes. The system verified and retrieved the base URI of a designated product identity (ID) whose NFT was stored in a GitHub repository. A vulnerability check of the smart contract codes with solidcheck.io shows that the smart contracts are 84 % secured with no serious security threats, as all considerations were made in the contract code design.",Not About Sufficiency
Artificial intelligence applied to conceptual design. A review of its use in architecture,"Conceptual architectural design is a complex process that draws on past experience and creativity to generate new designs. The application of artificial intelligence to this process should not be oriented toward finding a solution in a defined search space since the design requirements are not yet well defined in the conceptual stage. Instead, this process should be considered as an exploration of the requirements, as well as of possible solutions to meet those requirements. This work offers a tour of major research projects that apply artificial intelligence solutions to architectural conceptual design. We examine several approaches, but most of the work focuses on the use of evolutionary computing to perform these tasks. We note a marked increase in the number of papers in recent years, especially since 2015. Most employ evolutionary computing techniques, including cellular automata. Most initial approaches were oriented toward finding innovative and creative forms, while the latest research focuses on optimizing architectural form.",Not About Sufficiency
Unusual suspects - visualizing unusual relationships of complex social phenomena with climate change,"Information visualization is a powerful tool to communicate complex social/political/environmental phenomena. In spite of that, the complexity of these phenomena and the data involved can result in complex visualization or simplification of the visuals and a consequent data loss. To tackle this topic, we designed an interactive visualization to facilitate the understanding and awareness of the interdependencies and consequences of a complex social/political contemporary phenomenon, such as the war ravaging Ukraine. To this end, we engaged the public through a visualization that presents the interdependencies between the Ukrainian war and climate change in terms of environment, food and raw materials produced and exported, people (refugees and displaced), and support (military, humanitarian, and economic) provided to Ukraine. We evaluated our prototype and found that our visualization increased the users’ awareness of war-affected aspects that directly or indirectly influence climate change, especially for food and people dimensions.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy saving potential of passive radiative cool coating in high-rise data center with neighboring infrastructure,"To coordinate with the evolution of I&T, it is indicated to enhance the number of data center (DC) worldwide, which involves enormous cooling demand that may lead to energy wastage if the facility is not constructed energy-efficiently, impeding decarbonization. Passive radiative cooler (PRC) have exhibited their energy-saving capability in many studies. Being a windowless building, DC has extensive coverage area for PRC comparing to other buildings that require outdoor visual access. The power-saving potential of a dual-layer daytime radiative cooling paint (DDRCC) in a high-rise DC was investigated at multi-building scale using a self-created site model under Hong Kong's humid subtropical climate. Besides the roof, which has been the target PRC-employed surface in previous studies, this work deployed DDRCC on roof and vertical façade of the DC, attaining optimal saving of 652–821 kW and cooling power of 23.4–29.5 W/m2, demonstrating its practicability in high-rise building. DDRCC accomplished cooling power of 2.5–48.0 W/m2 in scenarios with various configuration of PRC-utilized envelope. Additionally, for the site studied, the cooling power of DDRCC enhanced with aspect ratio when the height of adjacent buildings was comparable to the DC.

Research on energy saving potentials using pure and zeotropic refrigerants in data center cooling systems,"Zeotropic refrigerants possess the characteristic of temperature glide during phase-change process, making them suitable for temperature matching between cold and hot sources and reducing total temperature differences. In this manuscript, the applicability of two commonly used refrigerants, zeotropic refrigerant R407C and pure refrigerant R134a in data center cooling systems are investigated. Firstly, the heat transfer and flow characteristics of R407C and R134a are studied to obtain boiling heat transfer empirical correlations. Secondly, a data center cooling model is established, and modeling calculations are conducted based on experimental results. Finally, the influence of refrigerants on the energy saving effect are calculated based on the model. Experimental results demonstrate that R134a exhibits a 48.3% higher boiling heat transfer coefficient compared to R407C at heat flux 16500 W/m2. However, when considering a data center cooling system, using R407C as working fluid shows the advantage of temperature matching as heat transfer area increases. Based on modeling results, at large heat transfer area, the annual cooling load factor using R407C at low mass flow rate is 0.5% lower than that of using R134a at low mass flow rate, and 22.5% lower than that of using R134a at large mass flow rate for typical climate city Harbin.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon dioxide emissions and mitigation in China's hydrogen energy supply chain: Insights for sustainability and policy development,"The research investigates CO2 emissions in conjunction with mitigating strategies all throughout the hydrogen energy supply chain to support policies and sustainable frameworks. Focusing on combining wind and solar power into hydrogen generation, the study evaluates carbon absorption and reduction using a simulation-based network model. To reduce lifetime CO2 emissions, key mitigating techniques under analysis are maximizing the mix of renewable energy sources, attaining grid parity for affordable hydrogen generation, and using green supplier selection criteria. Panel data from China enabled researchers to better grasp how policy involvement and value chain participation might help to lower carbon footprints between 2015 and 2024. With an ideal renewable energy balance of 49% wind and 51% solar, the results show that when the country reached grid parity solar energy became the main hydrogen source. Still, lower renewable reliance required a greater 60% solar share.

Health burden and costs attributable to the carbon footprint of the health sector in the European Union,"Background The healthcare sector has an environmental impact of around 4.6% of global CO2 emissions, contributing to aggravating the climate crisis. However, the impact of the health sector’s emissions on human health is not regularly assessed. We aim to estimate the health burden and associated costs of the health sector’s carbon footprint within the European Union (EU). Methods We calculated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and associated costs based on human health damage factors (DALYs/kg-CO2e) by considering four scenarios. Three scenarios for shared socioeconomic pathways (S1 – high growth, S2 − baseline, and S3 − low growth) represented variations of global society, demographics, and economics until 2100. A fourth scenario (S4) considered the current EU’s 55% reduction goal of greenhouse gas emissions. The healthcare sector’s emissions per capita (in CO2-equivalent) in 2019 were extracted from the Lancet Countdown, and population data were retrieved from Eurostat for the same year. Results In the EU, 365,047 DALYs (95%CI: 194,692–535,403) are expected to be caused by the health sector’s emissions at baseline (S2). In an S1 scenario, the burden would slightly decrease to 316,374 DALYs (95%CI: 170,355–462,393), whereas a S3 scenario would increase 486,730 DALYs (95%CI: 243,365–681,422). If EU’s carbon goals are met, the burden could be substantially reduced to 164,271 DALYs (95%CI: 87,611–240,931). Costs can amount to 25.6 billion euros, when considering DALYs monetisation. Conclusion CO2 emissions from the health sector are expected to significantly impact human health. Therefore, it is important to ensure that EU climate policies for public buildings are in line with the Paris Agreement, increase funding for climate mitigation programs within the healthcare sector, and review clinical practices at the local level.",Not About Sufficiency
Development of modular air containment system: Thermal performance optimization of row-based cooling for high-density data centers,"Modular air containment (MAC) prototype was developed for optimal row-based cooling system for high-density data centers. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the thermal performance and compare the cooling provisioning of different configurations of row-based cooling system to find the optimum placement of in-row CRAC units. Techno-optimal estimations were performed considering different in-row CRAC placements and aisle layouts. A matrix combination was analyzed based on total 2592 cases that can be implemented. By the whole optimization process of in-row cooler placement, we can achieve the best solution with the statically balanced cooling provisioning with a margin of error of 0.2%. The cooled air from in-row CRAC units was supplied with almost no heat loss in the air distribution paths to each server. Numerical simulations confirmed that the cold-hot-cold (C–H–C) aisle layout can improve the minimum 9% of heat balance for the provisioned CRACs compared to the hot-cold-hot (H–C–H) aisle layout. Temperature distributions, air streamlines and net cooling usages showed that the C–H–C aisle layout has better thermal performance and cooling provisioning especially for the row-based cooling. The C–H–C aisle layout is more proper than the H–C–H aisle layout for achieving the desired cooling efficiency.",Not About Sufficiency
Development of an adaptive artificial neural network model and optimal control algorithm for a data center cyber–physical system,"This study aimed to develop an adaptive artificial neural network model (AAM) for the prediction of the rack inlet temperature and cooling system energy, and the optimal control algorithm for cooling system of a containment-type data center. A cyber-physical system (CPS) framework, that incorporated the AAM and control algorithm, was also proposed for the precise control of the data center cooling system. To develop the AAM model and control algorithm, mathematical modeling of a reference physical model was conducted, and training data were acquired from this model. The performance of the proposed AAM and control algorithm was then compared with that of a non-adaptive ANN model (NAAM) in terms of prediction accuracy and control stability. The analysis results indicated that the optimal control algorithm with the AAM exhibited superior prediction accuracy and control stability than the algorithm with the NAAM. In particular, for the AAM-based algorithm under conditions representing a novel data center environment, the root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of variation of the RMSE (CV(RMSE)) for the predicted and actual values were 0.22 °C and 1.02%, respectively, for the inlet rack temperature and 0.19 kW and 0.76% for the cooling system energy. The control was also stable, with an MAE of 0.08 °C and a maximum error of 1.17 °C. Based on this analysis, a CPS-based control strategy incorporating an ANN-based optimal control algorithm is expected to be an effective energy efficiency solution for existing data center without changing IT equipment or cooling systems.",Not About Sufficiency
Chapter Fourteen - Application of artificial intelligence (AI) in aquaculture/fisheries: Microbial disease identification and diagnosis,"Aquaculture increases the global economy by enhancing the food security, as well as providing employment, and boost the growth of developing countries. Aquaculture industries are now playing a great important role in the generation of approximately 265$ billion USD annually, that contributes significantly to the economy of the world. Currently one of the most severe risks to aquaculture's economic success is disease, which is well-acknowledged. A wide variety of infectious organisms, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and metazoan parasites, causes lethal microbial infectious diseases in fish. Among all organisms, bacteria are to blame for the overwhelming prevalence of infectious illnesses in fish kept in closed quarters. Moreover, the effectiveness and development of the aquaculture system depend on the early diagnosis of illnesses. Whereas it is an area of computer science that gives us intelligent machines that could learn to mimic the cognitive processes of living creatures and make decisions based on their acquired experiences.

Optimizing the performance of vehicular delay tolerant networks using multi-objective PSO and artificial intelligence,"Vehicular delay tolerant network (VDTN) technology uses vehicles on the road as moving nodes to deliver data from source to destination using several intermediate nodes. Efficient data dissemination in VDTN is a difficult problem due to existing trade-offs between several metric variables such as delivery ratio, delay, and overhead ratio. Inclusion of important social network parameters (like community, social strength, trust, friendship, and selfishness) in computation of forwarding probability may help to improve the performance of a routing algorithm. However, different tuning of these parameters results in different outcomes for the metric variables. A proper balancing of these parameters may result in an optimized outcome solving the trade-off between the metric variables. Nonetheless, dependency of the variables on a number of social network parameters and their mutual trade-offs makes this a non-trivial optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to optimize these trade-offs using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). The proposed approach provides a set of pareto-optimal solutions also known as non-dominating solutions. Further, based on the requirements of a target application scenario, a specific optimal solution out of the pareto-optimal solution set is delivered using artificial intelligence (AI) technique. The proposed methodology is simulated in a VDTN scenario using the opportunistic network environment (ONE) simulator and Matlab. Furthermore, based on the experimental results, an exhaustive analysis is provided about how the metric variables are affected by the involvement of the social-based parameters. The capabilities of the proposed approach are validated using a statistical comparative analysis of the results. In future, the outcome of the study may play a helpful role to decide the priorities of the network parameters while designing new data dissemination algorithms for VDTN.",Not About Sufficiency

Understanding accountability in algorithmic supply chains,"Academic and policy proposals on algorithmic accountability often seek to understand algorithmic systems in their socio-technical context, recognising that they are produced by ‘many hands’. Increasingly, however, algorithmic systems are also produced, deployed, and used within a supply chain comprising multiple actors tied together by flows of data between them. In such cases, it is the working together of an algorithmic supply chain of different actors who contribute to the production, deployment, use, and functionality that drives systems and produces particular outcomes. We argue that algorithmic accountability discussions must consider supply chains and the difficult implications they raise for the governance and accountability of algorithmic systems. In doing so, we explore algorithmic supply chains, locating them in their broader technical and political economic context and identifying some key features that should be understood in future work on algorithmic governance and accountability (particularly regarding general purpose AI services). To highlight ways forward and areas warranting attention, we further discuss some implications raised by supply chains: challenges for allocating accountability stemming from distributed responsibility for systems between actors, limited visibility due to the accountability horizon, service models of use and liability, and cross-border supply chains and regulatory arbitrage.",Not About Sufficiency

Through bibliometric and factorial analyses of the conceptual structure of the publications indexed in Scopus, we provided a brief overview of the scientific trends, impacts, and barriers. The results indicated that research on the intersection between the three themes is still in its early stages. The CE promotes networks of urban resources for their recovery and reuse for nutritional, water, and energy purposes in urban agriculture. Urban agriculture has been proposed as a nature-based solution where CE can play a vital role in enhancing the ecosystem services it provides. Although CE has not been investigated as a transversal system in the productive cycle of urban agriculture, we identified assessments of the reuse of agricultural resources. Composting, hydroponics, and vertical agriculture are the urban agriculture techniques that have been most closely associated with CE through strategies such as the use of recycled fertilizers, the incorporation of renewable sources, and the establishment of industrial symbiosis processes. Moreover, urban metabolism and life cycle assessment are crucial tools for material and energy flows. In conclusion, the synergy between CE and urban agriculture can trigger regeneration processes that transform cities in a sustainable way. Efforts toward holistic and measurable approaches to the multiple sustainable benefits generated by this synergy for cities are needed.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards Sustainable Development Based on University Microgrids,"Electricity is indeed a fundamental element of contemporary society, and the transition towards ensuring clean and affordable electrical energy is one of the present challenges. This transition has proved to progress slowly, primarily due to the challenges associated with integrating renewable distributed energy resources (DERs). For instance, weather changes can dramatically impact the amount of peak power supplied on any given day. Microgrids are a promising concept that can help address these challenges, and many studies can be found in the literature that focus on implementing these complex systems. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding the specific subject of using the infrastructure of universities as a proof-of-concept. This paper aims to help fill this gap by reporting the case study of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), in Brazil. The paper summarizes the current research in the local microgrid of UNICAMP, and shows its potential to boost sustainable development by decarbonizing universities, as a practical contribution beyond their educational value. The main components of the system are described, and the presented numerical results show how at least 33% of the campus’s monthly electricity consumption can be reduced. This proves that real-world microgrids can have a positive impact, not only on greenhouse gas emissions reduction but also on the overall system efficiency.",Not About Sufficiency

Building-related electric vehicle charging behaviors and energy consumption patterns: An urban-scale analysis,"Understanding electric vehicle (EV) charging behavior and energy consumption patterns is fundamental to support the transportation electrification trend. We analyzed a dataset of 2,385,173 charging sessions from 2,719 chargers across 158 stations in Beijing, China. First, the charging sessions of alternating-current slow chargers (ACSCs) are mainly affected by parking behavior related to adjacent buildings; conversely, the charging sessions of direct-current fast chargers (DCFCs) cater to urgent charging demands. Second, adjacent building type and public accessibility significantly impact a station’s charging power profile. Public station profiles can be quantified by combining private and independent station profiles. Third, the impact of charger rated power on utilization rate varies by station type. The charger utilization rate increases with its rated power at independent and commercial stations, but decreases at workplace and residential stations.

Sustainable orthopaedics: the needs and challenges,"Climate change is undoubtedly a global threat, with extreme weather events, air pollution, and food insecurity disproportionately impacting low-income countries. The healthcare sector, whilst responsible for 4.4% of global net carbon emissions, has been slow in addressing its environmental footprint. This article explores the needs and challenges to achieve sustainable orthopaedic surgery. Orthopaedic surgery continues to create a large carbon footprint, primarily through the use of single-use consumables and energy-intensive operating theatres. While efforts to reduce environmental harm have primarily targeted changes within the operating theatre, a comprehensive approach must consider the entire surgical pathway. The principles of reduce, reuse and recycle are paramount. Reducing surgical caseload and advancing digital healthcare afford opportunities to streamline patient interactions, reduce travel emissions and improve efficiency. Furthermore, reevaluating routine practices, such as preoperative investigations and postoperative care, can minimize unnecessary resource consumption. Improving the sustainability of orthopaedics will bring conflicting clinical, financial and environmental challenges. However, with increasing awareness among healthcare professionals and support from it's professional bodies, there is growing momentum toward sustainable orthopaedic surgery. Transitioning to sustainable orthopaedic surgery neccesitates a broad approach encompassing prevention, optimization, and streamlining of the surgical pathway. Addressing environmental concerns alongside clinical outcomes is imperative for the future of orthopaedic surgery.",Not About Sufficiency

"Co-combustion, life-cycle circularity, and artificial intelligence-based multi-objective optimization of two plastics and textile dyeing sludge","Given the globally abundant availability of waste plastics and the negative environmental impacts of textile dyeing sludge (TDS), their co-combustion can effectively enhance the circular economies, energy recovery, and environmental pollution control. The (co-)combustion performances, gas emissions, and ashes of TDS and two plastics of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were quantified and characterized. The increased blend ratio of PP and PE improved the ignition, burnout, and comprehensive combustion indices. The two plastics interacted with TDS significantly in the range of 200–600 ℃. TDS pre-ignited the combustion of the plastics which in turn promoted the combustion of TDS. The co-combustions released more CO2 but less CH4, C-H, and CO as CO2 was less persistent than the others in the atmosphere. The Ca-based minerals in the plastics enhanced S-fixation and reduced SO2 emission. The activation energy of the co-combustion fell from 126.78 to 111.85 kJ/mol and 133.71–79.91 kJ/mol when the PE and PP additions rose from 10% to 50%, respectively. The co-combustion reaction mechanism was best described by the model of f(α) = (1-α)n. The reaction order was reduced with the additions of the plastics. The co-combustion operation interactions were optimized via an artificial neural network so as to jointly meet the multiple objectives of maximum energy production and minimum emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
"How supply chain disruptions, renewable energy consumption, and eco-innovation mitigate environmental degradation? A path towards sustainable development in France","The load capacity factor is crucial for France's economic development regarding green energy, supply chain, and digital innovation by enabling the effective utilization of resources, minimizing adverse effects on the environment, and enhancing economic growth. This study has introduced a novel model to examine the impact of supply chain disruptions, renewable energy consumption, eco-innovation, energy tax, human capital, and economic growth on the load capacity factor (LF) of France's economy throughout 1994–2021 by employing the Quantile-on-Quantile Kernel-Based Regularized Least Squares (QQKRLS) and Quantile Causality Analysis. The QQKRLS findings depict that supply chain disruptions and human capital are strongly positively correlated with the LF for moderate to high quantiles, highlighting the importance of operations and human capital. The change in renewable energy consumption reveals an unsystematic pattern and turns negative at higher quantiles, implying sustainability problems. Eco-innovation is positive at lower quantile levels of the LF, and energy tax influence is inversely related to similar levels of LF. An increase in economic growth is associated with the load capacity factor at some selected quantiles, thereby asserting the advantages of some operations capacity. Quantile causality test findings show the top causality at the mid-quantile, implying that LF affects its mid-level most with a decreasing impact on the higher level. It must also be realized that these factors have varying effects depending on which operational situation is being considered.

Multi-objective explainable smart dispatch for integrated energy system based on an explainable MO-RL method,"With the rapid development of renewable energy penetration and the transition to high-efficiency, low-carbon-footprint energy systems, renewable-based heat-electricity integrated energy systems (RHE-IES) have become a viable method. The dispatch and operation scheduling of the RHE-IES is more complex than before because a well-operated RHE-IES should be economically favorable, environmentally friendly, and feasible with respect to security constraints. However, it is not easy to balance these trade-offs with uncertainties. In this work, a multi-objective hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (H-DRL) method is proposed to address the dispatch of RHE-IES, and it is also explainable due to the design of the algorithmic structure, the decoupling of rewards, and the analysis of feature importance. First, the dispatch and operation scheduling problem of the RHE-IES is formulated considering economic, environmental, and security constraints and is converted to a Markov decision process. Second, a novel H-DRL method is proposed with a multi-critic, single-actor structure, where each objective is handled by a designated deep critic network with decoupled rewards, and the action value functions of different objectives are hierarchically optimized by the actor network. H-DRL can be trained in a comprehensive environment offline and provide fast online decisions considering the uncertainties of renewable generation. Third, a shapley additive explanations method is carried out utilizing the explainable nature of the H-DRL structure and the loss function design. The simulation results and case studies show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of balancing the tradeoffs of different objectives, overcoming uncertainties and enhancing AI interpretability.",Not About Sufficiency

Hence, in tandem with this position, the paper examines the role of Nigerian universities in combating climate change in their institutions and host communities. In a bid to actualize this objective, we have critically examined the activities of selected schools who have come up with one initiative or the other as a stop-gap measure for tackling the rampaging menace of climate change. The core objective of this paper therefore is to examine the performance level of these programmes while identifying areas for improvement. The paper is qualitatively driven and draws from secondary sources of data such as book chapters, journal articles, policy briefs, conference articles among others. We observed that paucity of sufficient budgetary allocations to help these institutions achieve their objective is a major challenge to their climate change reduction agenda. Hence, we recommend that special funding be granted to such universities irrespective of their ownership structure.The paper addresses the issue of applied sciences by engendering a paradigm shift from the laboratory to the field through promoting inclusive participation of universities in combating climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable Biomass Feedstock Selection for Hydrogen Production in Africa,"It is becoming more widely acknowledged that hydrogen is a promising energy source that can help us move towards a low-carbon, sustainable future. With its wealth of biomass resources, Africa offers a special chance to realise this hydrogen production potential. Using the Aspen Plus process simulation tool, this study explores the viability and sustainability of using biomass feedstock for hydrogen production. The abundance of biomass resources in Africa presents a significant opportunity to both meet energy needs and cut greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. Meeting the growing need for hydrogen as a clean energy source and actively assisting in the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable future are the main goals of this research. When combined with the water gas shift reaction, biomass gasification is the process used to extract hydrogen gas from biomass. Incorporating the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) maximises the output of hydrogen. A scaling factor might be used to achieve the desired product output, although the initial biomass input flow rate was set at 1000 tonnes year. Prior to the scaling factor being applied, the reaction produced an annual mass flow rate of 94.888 tonnes. With a specified ratio of 3:1 between steam and biomass, the gasifier only used 9.9% of the steam. The production process was greatly improved by the water-gas shift reactor, which increased the annual production of hydrogen from 94.888 tonnes to 115.53 tonnes. In line with international efforts to shift to greener energy sources and fight climate change, this research significantly advances the generation of green hydrogen in Africa.",Not About Sufficiency

Enhancing the mechanical and thermal insulation properties of clay-based construction materials with neutral carbon footprint through the use of Doum fibers,"The construction industry is currently experiencing robust global growth. With the advancement of technology, real estate development is evolving through the adoption of new strategies. The present study aims to identify the optimal formulation for unfired bricks made from clay and Doum fibers sourced from the Taounate region in Morocco. To achieve this, six brick samples were produced with varying amounts of Doum fibers (0 %, 1 %, 5 %, 7 %, 10 %, and 12 %), and their performance was assessed through tests for bulk density, linear shrinkage, compressive strength, and thermal conductivity. The results indicate that the resulting bricks are lightweight, with a bulk density not exceeding 1.75 g/cm3, in accordance with the NM EN 772-16 standard. Furthermore, there was a notable reduction in linear shrinkage, reaching up to 80 %. The reference brick without fiber additions exhibited a shrinkage of 5.86 %, whereas the brick containing a high fiber content of 12 % demonstrated a linear shrinkage of 1.12 %. The strength of the brick decreases with increasing fiber content, but the thermal insulation properties improve significantly. Considering these variations, the optimal enhancement in thermal and mechanical performance was determined to be 41.5 % in terms of compressive strength and thermal conductivity, corresponding to a 10 % inclusion of Doum fibers. The optimal brick is classified as EB6 according to the German standard DIN 18945 (2013–08), with a thermal conductivity of 0.31 W/m.K and a compressive strength of 8.26 MPa, rendering it suitable for use in earth construction. This study also concludes that the production cost for the optimal brick is half that of the conventional bricks available in the building materials market. This holds promising implications for the future of harnessing local natural resources in the field of eco-construction, as it positively impacts the economy and environment of the region.",Not About Sufficiency
"Carbon capture, utilization and storage in buildings: Analysis of performance, social acceptance, policy measures, and the role of artificial intelligence","Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is emerging as a promising solution to mitigate global CO2 emissions from the industrial and energy sectors. This review delves into the prospects of CCUS technologies for application in buildings, highlighting their benefits and challenges, and examining their economic and environmental impacts. A case study is also provided to shed light on the impact of integrating direct air capture (DAC) into buildings on their energy bills and indoor air quality. The study emphasizes that DAC is a promising carbon capture technology in buildings, with a levelized cost of CO2 capture using DAC in the range of 56–2499 and 262–535 $/tCO2 for solid- and liquid-based DAC, respectively. As for the utilization of CO2 captured within buildings, microalgae cultivation and construction materials manufacturing are the most researched pathways. In contrast, transporting captured CO2 is currently focused on the industrial sector, dictating the need for implementing cost-effective approaches for connecting urban areas to the planned industrial CO2 transport infrastructure when CO2 geological storage is targeted. Although the CO2 transport and storage approaches remain technically feasible, solutions based on local handling of CO2, such as microalgae cultivation, plants, or its use as a feedstock for the production of locally oriented products, offer more realistic strategies that demand further exploration. Finally, the social acceptance aspects, the effect of policy measures, and the role of artificial intelligence in enhancing the widespread adaptation of these strategies from conventional industrial decarbonization purposes to building contexts are explored and discussed.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy consumption and carbon footprint of 3D printing in pharmaceutical manufacture,"Achieving carbon neutrality is seen as an important goal in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, as carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Many countries, cities and organizations have set targets to become carbon neutral. The pharmaceutical sector is no exception, being a major contributor of carbon emissions (emitting approximately 55% more than the automotive sector for instance) and hence is in need of strategies to reduce its environmental impact. Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an advanced pharmaceutical fabrication technology that has the potential to replace traditional manufacturing tools. Being a new technology, the environmental impact of 3D printed medicines has not been investigated, which is a barrier to its uptake by the pharmaceutical industry. Here, the energy consumption (and carbon emission) of 3D printers is considered, focusing on technologies that have successfully been demonstrated to produce solid dosage forms. The energy consumption of 6 benchtop 3D printers was measured during standby mode and printing. On standby, energy consumption ranged from 0.03 to 0.17 kWh. The energy required for producing 10 printlets ranged from 0.06 to 3.08 kWh, with printers using high temperatures consuming more energy. Carbon emissions ranged between 11.60 and 112.16 g CO2 (eq) per 10 printlets, comparable with traditional tableting. Further analyses revealed that decreasing printing temperature was found to reduce the energy demand considerably, suggesting that developing formulations that are printable at lower temperatures can reduce CO2 emissions. The study delivers key initial insights into the environmental impact of a potentially transformative manufacturing technology and provides encouraging results in demonstrating that 3D printing can deliver quality medicines without being environmentally detrimental.",Not About Sufficiency
A new frontier in understanding the dynamics of environmental sustainability in the context of finance and low carbon energy investment: Evidence from artificial intelligence and Fourier approach,"Nuclear and renewable (low-carbon) energy research and development is crucial for a sustainable future, transitioning away from fossil fuels. However, adequate financial sources are imperative to stimulate this transition. Financial institutions, particularly banking institutions, play a critical role in fulfilling the financial needs for green energy transition. This study investigates the effects of banking sector development, low-carbon energy investments, economic growth, and trade openness on environmental sustainability. Notably, novel Fourier asymmetric ARDL and artificial intelligence-based neural network methods are used for empirical analysis. The Fourier approach captures nonlinearities in the banking sector development and environment relationship. It is found that the negative shocks of banking sector development and economic growth reduce environmental sustainability. However, the positive effects of low-carbon energy investments and trade openness on environmental quality offer a promising path toward a more sustainable future. The Japanese government should accelerate low-carbon energy investments to accelerate the transition from fossil energy to green energy sources. This transition holds the potential to significantly improve Japan's environmental sustainability and contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7. In addition, since the decline of the banking sector's development in Japan undermines environmental sustainability, financial planning should be implemented to progress this sector.",Not About Sufficiency

Artificial intelligence with attention based BiLSTM for energy storage system in hybrid renewable energy sources,"Hybrid renewable energy sources with energy storage systems (ESS) are becoming more prevalent in offering remote consumers with efficient, affordable, and dependable energy alternatives to traditional systems. The ESS is essential for the integration of hybrid RES in order to balance the supply of power with demand. Simultaneously, the price fluctuations and intermittent nature of RES led to the invention of ESS for RES. To do this, the recently established deep learning (DL) models can be utilized to optimize the ESS for RES for maximum performance. With this purpose in mind, this study presents an optimal attention-based bidirectional long and short-term memory (OABLSTM-ESS) technique for energy storage systems utilizing renewable energy sources. By resolving the optimization problem, the described OABLSTM-ESS technique attempts to minimize electricity costs while achieving productivity requirements. In addition, an attention based BiLSTM (ABLSTM) method has been created to take advantage of the inherent benefits of anticipated future processes. Moreover, the improved coyote optimization algorithm (ICOA) is used to best select the ABLSTM model's hyperparameters. The ICOA is created by merging the COA with the hill climbing (HC) idea, which helps to search for and improve the learning strategy while determining the candidate solutions for the COA. A vast array of simulation analyses are implemented to assure the improved performance of the OABLSTM-ESS approach.

Governing Jevons’ Paradox: Policies and systemic alternatives to avoid the rebound effect,"In this article we lay the foundations for a new approach for Jevons Paradox and rebound effects, based on how it is triggered (origin) and how it expands (expansion), and from it, explore the potential of different ways to minimize or offset rebounds from resources productivity and conservation. We conceptualize different key aspects to understand and reframe rebound effects. On the “origin” side, we introduce the key concept of “resource-efficient paths”, to show how productivity is a changing and complex issue, affected by the interaction of all other resources that produce goods or services, as well as behavior. This is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the existence of rebound effects. On the “expansion” side we introduce the notion of systemic insatiability as key in the expansion and consolidation of rebounds through socioeconomic systems, and sufficient condition for the existence of rebound effects. Moreover, we analyze how inequality can exacerbate insatiability. With this framework in mind, we examine two main positions to find solutions: In the first, under our current socioeconomic, cultural, and institutional structures, we analyze different means of public policy intervention: resources pricing, cap-and-trade systems, regulation, and voluntary actions. The second position implies tackling systemic changes.

Energy Efficiency and Sustainability Initiatives in the Semiconductor Industry,"Semiconductor industry is foundational to the digital age as it drives the production of essential electronic devices. However, it faces the challenge of substantial electricity consumption. This paper investigates the energy footprint of semiconductor manufacturing processes. Previous studies indicate that semiconductor fabrication units (fabs) have significant electricity consumption and often rely on nonrenewable energy sources. Many of the advanced processes in its manufacturing require higher energy inputs, where clean-room maintenance and material usage contribute significantly to consumption. Despite many efforts, electricity usage trends show an upward trajectory, indicating growing operations and technological advancements. This research analyzes the energy distribution within the fab as well as discusses the measures that can improve the consumption patterns. We discuss how the measures that can be taken for balancing growth with sustainability. Addressing the challenge requires investments in research for renewable energy adoption, and smart energy management systems. Innovations in equipment, cooling systems, and recycling practices are some of the avenues for reducing energy consumption. Therefore, urgent action is important to minimize this industry’s environmental impact while meeting the rising demand for semiconductor products.

"Urban metabolism, sustainability and energy transition in cities: A comprehensive review","This research article conducts a comprehensive literature review on the concept of urban metabolism (UM), with a special focus on the transition from a linear to a circular model. In the context of climate change, increasing urbanisation, and resource depletion, cities are recognised as playing a crucial role in environmental sustainability. A bibliometric analysis of scientific literature shows an increasing interest in circular UM as a comprehensive approach to managing energy and material flows in urban settings. This article aims to further explore the transition from a linear to a circular model by reviewing the evolution of the urban metabolism concept, its key components, and relevant case studies from cities that have successfully implemented circular strategies. By identifying barriers and challenges cities face in adopting circular practices within their urban metabolism, the article proposes recommendations to overcome these obstacles. Furthermore, it examines the interrelationships between circular UM and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in terms of sustainable urban planning and energy transition. However, important challenges remain, such as the lack of standardised and accessible data that hinder comparisons between cities and their evolution. Finally, future lines of research are proposed that focus on the integration of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and neural networks, as well as the development of circular urban models that can tangibly measure their impact on climate change.

Roles of ohmic heating to achieve sustainable development goals in the food industry: From reduced energy consumption and resource optimization to innovative production pathways with reduced carbon footprint,"Background The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations set targets to address global social, economic, and environmental issues. The food industry is crucial to achieving SDGs due to its impact on hunger, health, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. Conventional food processing falls short of these goals, necessitating alternative technologies, such as ohmic heating, a key technology capable of driving the food industry in a sustainable direction. Scope and approach This review aims to explain various aspects attained from the application of ohmic heating correlated with the SDGs. Key findings and conclusion Literature analysis shows that ohmic heating could significantly contribute to SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 13 (climate action), among other goals. These could be achieved because of the ohmic process's capability to increase the production yield (e.g., pectin by 8.9%; essential oil by 51.2%) and shelf-life (e.g., pasteurized milk by 1.7 times), produce healthier and more nutritious products (e.g., dried quince with 2 times phenolics), reduce food waste through valorization (e.g., transforming lemon peel to pectin and essential oil), enhance production infrastructure due to improved energy efficiency (e.g., 72.8% in evaporation process). Unique insights into ohmic heating's mechanistic principles, scalability challenges, and integration with other approaches (e.g., renewable energy systems and artificial intelligence) are presented. The review identifies critical research gaps and proposes a future research roadmap to improve its industrial applicability and expand its practical role in achieving SDGs.",Not About Sufficiency
"Investigating the nexus of energy consumption, economic growth and carbon emissions in selected african countries","The study is focused on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7, 8, and 13. At the nexus of energy consumption, economic growth, and carbon emissions, we investigated the interactive effect of energy consumption and economic growth on carbon emissions for seventeen selected African countries using static panel estimation techniques using annual data from 2000 to 2017. The result shows that an increase in energy consumption positively affects economic growth and negatively affects carbon emissions. However, the impact of energy consumption on economic growth is greater than its adverse environmental effect. We found that economic growth (due to the energy transition in Africa) reduces or dampens the negative effect of energy usage on the environment (indirectly, mitigating carbon emissions). A notable implication of our finding is that the transition to renewable energy is moderating the adverse effects of increasing energy consumption and economic growth on the environment. So, in applying the energy intensity theory to sub-Saharan Africa, a modification is proposed: carbon emissions are directly proportional to the amount of fossil fuel energy consumed per unit of output. We recommend the prioritization of economic growth and productive use of energy towards effectively reducing the negative impact of energy consumption on the environment. Future studies could consider increasing the number of countries, and, if data is available, an artificial intelligence experiment could be undertaken to check the reliability of previous results. We also suggest that future studies consider investigating the persistence of emissions using energy and growth as key independent and moderating variables.",Not About Sufficiency

Dry labs and digitalization are closely and intricately linked in the minerals industry. This paper focuses on the instrumentation and infrastructure that are required for accelerating digital transformation initiatives in the minerals sector. Specifically, we are interested in the ability of current and emerging instrumentation, sensors and infrastructure to capture relevant information, generate and transport high-quality data. We provide an essential examination of existing literature and an understanding of the 21st century minerals industry. Critical analysis of the literature and review of the current configuration of the minerals industry revealed similar data management and infrastructure needs for all segments of the minerals industry. There are, however, differences in the tools and equipment used at different stages of the mineral value chain. As demand for data-driven approaches grows, and as data resulting from each segment of the minerals industry continues to increase in abundance, diversity and dimensionality, the tools that manage and utilize such data should evolve in a way that is more transdisciplinary (e.g., data management, artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science). Ideally, data should be managed in a dry lab environment, but minerals industry data is currently and historically disaggregated.

DCube: A family of network structures for containerized data centers using dual-port servers,"A fundamental goal of datacenter networking is to efficiently interconnect a large number of servers in a cost-effective way. Inspired by the commodity servers in today’s data centers that come with dual-port, we consider how to design low-cost, robust, and symmetrical network structures for containerized data centers with dual-port servers and low-end switches. In this paper, we propose a family of such network structure called a DCube, including H-DCube and M-DCube. The DCube consists of one or multiple interconnected sub-networks, each of which is a compound graph made by interconnecting a certain number of basic building blocks by means of a hypercube-like graph. More precisely, the H-DCube and M-DCube utilize the hypercube and 1-möbius cube, respectively, while the M-DCube achieves a considerably higher aggregate bottleneck throughput compared to H-DCube. Mathematical analysis and simulation results show that the DCube exhibits graceful performance degradation as the failure rate of server or switch increases. Moreover, the DCube significantly reduces the required wires and switches compared to the BCube and fat-tree. In addition, the DCube achieves a higher speedup than the BCube does for the one-to-several traffic patterns.

Dynamic adaptive encoder-decoder deep learning networks for multivariate time series forecasting of building energy consumption,"Accurate energy consumption prediction models can bring tremendous benefits to building energy efficiency, where the use of data-driven models allows models to be trained based on historical data and to obtain better prediction performance. However, a severe problem has been overlooked where the dynamic spatiotemporal dependence among buildings is often not considered. To settle this issue, this study proposes an asymmetric encoder-decoder learning framework where the spatial relationships and time-series features between multiple buildings are extracted by a convolutional neural network and a gated recurrent neural network to form new input data in the encoder. The decoder then makes predictions based on the input data with an attention mechanism. The model is trained and tested with energy consumption data from 10 different buildings at a university in China. The results show that our proposed model maintains high accuracy using small datasets while predicting different types of buildings, achieving an average R2 of 0.964. Additionally, the accuracy loss in multi-step forecasting is considerably ameliorated by maintaining an average R2 of 0.915 predicting 3 steps ahead of time. Benefiting from the asymmetric encoder-decoder structure, the proposed algorithm resolves the problem of accuracy loss using deep learning in a small dataset and multi-step time series forecasting.

Study on equipment sustainable development based on resource constraint and equipment resource-ability design,"Resource constraint is something that restricts the development of things due to resource shortages and environmental damage. The development of equipment also faces the resource constraint seriously. For example, the fossil energy and traditional metal resources will run out in a limited period and the activities in equipment life cycle bears inescapable responsibility to environmental pollution. Some issues those lead to equipment non-sustainable development are exposed in the rigorous situation of resource constraint. First, almost all the main equipment use oil as energy and that is irrational energy consumption structure because it is highly dependent on the fossil energy which will run out sooner or later. Second, there is massive consumption of all types of materials in equipment construction, but a lot of waste equipment do not be reused or disposed appropriately resulted in substantial waste of resources. Third, it will have a lot of waste emissions in all sectors of equipment life cycle such as manufacturing, storage, using, maintenance and waste disposal, resulted in serious environmental pollution. The mean of equipment sustainable development based on resource constraint is that the development of equipment can break through the bottleneck of resource constraint and achieve harmony with the resources and environment. The fundamental approach to achieve that goal is to implement the equipment resource-ability design. The resource-ability is a kind of design attributes of equipment, and it can be defined like this: the capabilities of alleviating resource shortage and environmental hazards, promoting resource economization and environment-friendly, on the basis of meeting every military demand. The main idea of equipment resource-ability design is that: take the resource using and environmental impacting into equipment design, and make sure the equipment born with resource-conserving and environment-friendly genes, in order to promote the coordination of equipment, resource and environment, and to advance equipment sustainable development.

Intelligent building control systems for thermal comfort and energy-efficiency: A systematic review of artificial intelligence-assisted techniques,"Building operations represent a significant percentage of the total primary energy consumed in most countries due to the proliferation of Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) installations in response to the growing demand for improved thermal comfort. Reducing the associated energy consumption while maintaining comfortable conditions in buildings are conflicting objectives and represent a typical optimization problem that requires intelligent system design. Over the last decade, different methodologies based on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been deployed to find the sweet spot between energy use in HVAC systems and suitable indoor comfort levels to the occupants. This paper performs a comprehensive and an in-depth systematic review of AI-based techniques used for building control systems by assessing the outputs of these techniques, and their implementations in the reviewed works, as well as investigating their abilities to improve the energy-efficiency, while maintaining thermal comfort conditions. This enables a holistic view of (1) the complexities of delivering thermal comfort to users inside buildings in an energy-efficient way, and (2) the associated bibliographic material to assist researchers and experts in the field in tackling such a challenge. Among the 20 AI tools developed for both energy consumption and comfort control, functions such as identification and recognition patterns, optimization, predictive control. Based on the findings of this work, the application of AI technology in building control is a promising area of research and still an ongoing, i.e., the performance of AI-based control is not yet completely satisfactory. This is mainly due in part to the fact that these algorithms usually need a large amount of high-quality real-world data, which is lacking in the building or, more precisely, the energy sector. Based on the current study, from 1993 to 2020, the application of AI techniques and personalized comfort models has enabled energy savings on average between 21.81 and 44.36%, and comfort improvement on average between 21.67 and 85.77%. Finally, this paper discusses the challenges faced in the use of AI for energy productivity and comfort improvement, and opens main future directions in relation with AI-based building control systems for human comfort and energy-efficiency management.",Not About Sufficiency
A comprehensive review of neurotransmitter modulation via artificial intelligence: A new frontier in personalized neurobiochemistry,"The deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing neuropharmacology and drug development, allowing the modulation of neurotransmitter systems at the personal level. This review focuses on the neuropharmacology and regulation of neurotransmitters using predictive modeling, closed-loop neuromodulation, and precision drug design. The fusion of AI with applications such as machine learning, deep-learning, and even computational modeling allows for the real-time tracking and enhancement of biological processes within the body. An exemplary application of AI is the use of DeepMind's AlphaFold to design new GABA reuptake inhibitors for epilepsy and anxiety. Likewise, Benevolent AI and IBM Watson have fast-tracked drug repositioning for neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, we identified new serotonin reuptake inhibitors for depression through AI screening. In addition, the application of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) settings using AI for patients with Parkinson's disease and for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) using reinforcement learning-based transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) leads to better treatment. This review highlights other challenges including algorithm bias, ethical concerns, and limited clinical validation. Their proposal to incorporate AI with optogenetics, CRISPR, neuroprosthesis, and other advanced technologies fosters further exploration and refinement of precision neurotherapeutic approaches. By bridging computational neuroscience with clinical applications, AI has the potential to revolutionize neuropharmacology and improve patient-specific treatment strategies. We addressed critical challenges, such as algorithmic bias and ethical concerns, by proposing bias auditing, diverse datasets, explainable AI, and regulatory frameworks as practical solutions to ensure equitable and transparent AI applications in neurotransmitter modulation.",Not About Sufficiency

The strategic anticipation of energy consumption trends holds pivotal importance in steering efficient energy use and curtailing the release of carbon emissions. In this comprehensive study, we proffer a novel approach, leveraging two-time series models, namely VAR (Vector Auto regression) and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), to meticulously dissect data gleaned from a smart industry context. The study's focal objective is the forecast of both energy consumption patterns and CO2 emissions, thereby illuminating the prowess of time series models in this predictive endeavor. As the crux of our investigation, we embarked on a comparative analysis of the efficacy inherent in these models. Our findings emphatically underscore the commendable predictive capacity of the ARIMA model in delineating energy consumption forecasts. Remarkably, the optimal configuration for the ARIMA model was determined as (p=1, d=1, q=0), delineating its reliance on a single antecedent value of the dependent variable and a singular differencing operation for precise forecasting. The ARIMA model further distinguished itself by manifesting a trifecta of diminutive metrics: Minimal Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Such trifling metrics underscore the model's adeptness in extrapolating forthcoming energy consumption patterns with commendable accuracy. The discerning residual analysis fortified our model's credibility, as it showcased the random dispersion of errors, a testament to the model's prowess in encapsulating all pertinent data intricacies. our study underscores the instrumental role of time series models, specifically ARIMA, in proficiently prognosticating energy consumption trends.

Experimental investigation of a data-centre cooling system using a new single-phase immersion/liquid technique,"This paper presents an experimental investigation conducted on a new single-phase immersion/liquid-cooling technique developed at the OVHcloud laboratory, combining a direct-to-chip water-cooling system with passive single-immersion cooling technology. The experimental setup tested the impact of three dielectric fluids (S5X, SmartCoolant and ThermaSafe R), the effect of the water circuit configuration, and the server power/profile. Results suggest that the system cooling demand depends on the fluid's viscosity. As the viscosity increased from 4.6 to 9.8 mPa s, the cooling performance decreased by approximately 6%. Moreover, all the IT server profiles were validated at various water inlet temperatures and flow rates. The energy performance of the proposed technique and the liquid-cooling system previously used by OVHcloud was compared at a 600 kW data centre (DC). The proposed technique showed a reduction in the DC electrical power consumption by at least 20.7% compared to the liquid-cooling system. Finally, the cooling performance of the air- and liquid-cooled systems and the proposed solution was compared computationally at the server level.

Potential of solar photovoltaics and waste heat utilization in cold climate data centers. Case study: Finland and northern Japan,"As countries worldwide seek to reach net zero emissions within the coming decades, data center sustainability measures are becoming increasingly important as these facilities consume substantial amounts of electricity to support globally expanding digital infrastructure. Yet, local renewable energy production and waste heat utilization are still rarely used in data centers, even though recent high electricity prices have considerably increased the economic value of self-generation and energy efficiency investments. The benefits and cost-effectiveness of data center sustainability measures have also not yet been thoroughly researched in cold-climate regions, where the data center industry is currently growing rapidly. Thus, this paper assesses how solar photovoltaics (PV) and waste heat utilization can effectively be integrated into different cold climate data centers, with a case study analyzing data centers in Finland and northern Japan. The modelled results indicate that solar PV systems can cost-effectively be used to provide renewable electricity to data centers in both Finland and northern Japan, with electricity prices having the largest influence on economic performance. The use of larger external PV systems is shown to be cost-effective at the higher electricity prices seen in 2022, whereas smaller rooftop PV systems and grid electricity provide more economic benefits at 2019 price levels. Selling surplus PV electricity to the grid and using waste heat for district heating is also shown to be effective in data centers located in Finland, whereas battery storage and snow melting are better suited to utilize surplus PV electricity and data center waste heat in northern Japan.",Not About Sufficiency

A Multiobjective Optimisation Approach for Sustainable Resource Consumption and Production in Food-Energy-Water Nexus,"People need food, energy and water for survival and prosperity. However, it is a challenge to meet the demand for these necessities because urbanization and climate change impacts are destroying food, energy and water systems. Resource optimization in one sector can undermine security in another due to competition for the same resources.

However most of these approaches focus on either maximizing resource production or minimizing resource consumption in the FEW Nexus. Maximizing production and minimizing consumption of resources simultaneously are two conflicting objectives that have not been well addressed by existing multiobjective optimization approaches. Therefore, it is difficult for these approaches to recognize feedback and cascading effects occurring in the FEW Nexus due to the interdependencies of the food, energy and water.

Performance evaluation of hybrid optical switch architecture for data center networks,"In response to the need for high bandwidth and power efficient data center interconnection networks, different interconnects have been proposed based on the optical technology used: micro-electromechanical system (MEMS), optical cross connects (OXCs), arrayed waveguide grating routers (AWGRs) and semiconductor optical amplifier (SOAs). MEMS switches are based on mature technology, have low insertion loss and cross-talk, and are data rate independent. They are also the most scalable and the cheapest class of optical switches. However, the reconfiguration time of these switches is of the order of tens of milliseconds while fast optical switches have switching time in the range of a few nanoseconds. Fast optical switches can be based on AWGRs in conjunction with tunable wavelength converters or tunable lasers or they are based on SOAs in broadcast-and-select architecture. In this paper, we propose an optical interconnect architecture for the large scale data centers. The proposed interconnect: Hybrid Optical Switch Architecture (HOSA) is a hybrid design that features slow and fast optical switches. The hybrid design leverages strengths of both types of optical switches. To reduce complexity, we employ a single stage core topology that can be easily scaled up (in capacity) and scaled out (in the number of racks) without requiring major re-cabling and network reconfiguration. We investigate the scalability of the HOSA and show that by using a single stage core topology, it can be scaled to a hundreds of thousands of servers. We also investigate a trade-off between cost and power consumption of our design by comparing it with other well-known interconnects by using analytical modelling. We demonstrate power efficiency as compared to other conventional interconnects on account of upfront CAPEX but the additional CAPEX incurred in deploying our solution instead of traditional architecture is mitigated to some extent by reduced OPEX, due to its greater energy efficiency.

European Green Deal is the latest European action plan to mitigate climate change and introduce sustainable development by policymakers. The environmental impact of companies is very important to meet future sustainability. One of the basic steps in the analysis of the environmental profile of the company is the identification of hot spots by using the carbon footprint methodology. The workflow and the tool for the carbon footprint methodology implementation were developed for the case of strategic planning for a medium-sized company following the standardized methodology given by the GHG Protocol. Relevant emission sources within the hot spots are identified and analyzed. The sensitivity analysis for different pre-defined scenarios is made to meet the company's mid and long-term strategic goals. Results show that the main contributors to the overall carbon footprint are purchased electricity, purchased heat, and combustion of fuels in company-owned/controlled vehicles. GHG emissions from purchased electricity and heat heavily depend on emission factors of electricity and heat sources. Also, changes in electricity and heat supply sources have a significant impact on GHG emissions.",Not About Sufficiency

An Approach to Operationalise Resiliency towards Sustainable Futures,"There is abundant discourse on resilience and sustainability, however, the ongoing challenge remains how to operationalize resiliency towards achieving the inextricably interwoven (i) precepts of circular economy, with (ii) the imperatives of sustainability, and (iii) the human-centered ideals of the era of Society 5.0. Consequent upon increasing concerns for unprecedented and adverse effects of climate change, paradoxically, a significant proportion of extant literature and discourse on resiliency tends to focus on the vulnerabilities of commercial, environmental, governance, industrial and societal systems to stressors inherent within natural hazards. Unwittingly, the convention emphasizes protection from the unprecedented effects of climate change stressors, even though global, national, physical, regional and sectoral delineations of these systems are also susceptible to other volatile, uncertain, ambiguous and complex (VUCA) stressors arising from the interactions and tensions between commercial, governance, industrial and societal endeavour. The content of this paper includes discourse on the classification of VUCA events into four domains, as well as the description of a generic, logically consistent, and coherent framework for operationalizing resiliency towards sustainable futures.",Not About Sufficiency
High energy consuming enterprises participate in wind power consumption optimization scheduling strategy,"Due to the limited peak load capacity of the power grid, it is difficult to absorb wind power, and enterprises with high energy consumption have special characteristics of electricity consumption. On this basis, the countermeasures for energy-intensive enterprises in the power system to participate in wind power consumption are studied. Through reasonable pricing mechanism and peak-valley load limitation, the daily electricity load of high-energy enterprises is dynamically adjusted to achieve balanced wind power generation and reduce the peak-valley difference of the power grid. According to the calculation example, compared with the conventional peaking mode, the active intervention of high energy consuming enterprises can not only improve the utilization rate of wind power generation, reduce the peak load of the grid, but also save the power cost through subsidies.",Not About Sufficiency

Regenerative Braking in Electric-Bicycles with Supercapacitors for Sustainable Transport,"The transportation industry, followed by the energy sector, emits the highest amount of carbon, which negatively impacts the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and slows down the 2050 Net-Zero target. In the UK, 78% of every household owns at least one car, thus worsening the carbon footprint statistics, including the health risks associated with the frequent use of cars. Braking of such vehicles loses the kinetic energy environment. Sustainable transport, such as cycling on pedal bicycles, can be strenuous, leading to exhaustion, fainting, accidents, or deaths. Electric- powered bicycles (or E-bikes) can mitigate these problems as the users can engage in moderate exercise void of the risks above. However, E-bikes expend the energy stored in batteries and may not suffice for distant travel. Regenerative electric braking (REB) in E-bikes can store the would-have-lost braking energy in supercapacitors to extend the travel range, battery life and efficiency. Our experimental study shows a 4.14% net gain in energy efficiency when supercapacitors are used with REB. On top of that, we show that a lightweight, low-volume REB system could be constructed at a low cost, showing that future E-bikes with a similar system could be financially viable.",Not About Sufficiency

Build competitive advantage through the integration of sustainable supply chains,"Sustainability and corporate citizenship is a social ideal and a business necessity. Being sustainable is now a source of competitive advantage and a matter of corporate survival rather than a costly burden. Now many companies look on sustainability as a top-line priority. However, satisfying profit and sound corporate sustainability behavior will go unfulfilled unless orderly supply chains literally and sustainably ""deliver the goods"". Achieving genuine sustainability is the result of making supply chains more sustainable. Since typically 50 percent of a product's value, and often upward of 70 percent, is derived from suppliers, claims of corporate sustainability are likely just empty promises without the support from the whole supply chain. Companies and consumers realize that customers do not just buy products, they also buy the whole supply chain that delivers the products. We organize our key views in four parts. At first, after a brief introduction, we discuss the reason of building sustainable supply chains, and the relation between a sustainable firm and sustainable supply chains. Then, we described the characteristics of sustainable supply chain management, including devising a sustainable strategy, retooling the organization, managing supplier relations and monitoring and enforcing performance.

Two-phase liquid-immersion data center cooling system: Experimental performance and thermoeconomic analysis,"The liquid-cooling data center (DC) systems have been becoming important for the rapidly developing high-performance processors since the traditional air-cooled DC systems cannot efficiently manage them due to high heat dissipation rates. Two-phase liquid-immersion cooling is one of the promising direct liquid-cooled DC systems, but its system-scale thermal management performance has not been investigated in detail yet. This study performs the system-scale thermal management of a two-phase liquid-immersion cooling DC system under six different real-time and dynamic operation loads in the range of 3.43-9.17 kW to see the thermodynamic and thermoeconomic performances. The system includes the DC server tank, circulation pump, and dry tower. Results show that the best coefficient of performance (COP) and power usage effectiveness (PUE) values are seen at the highest operation load with 6.67 and 1.15 while the minimum COP and the highest PUE are seen at the lowest operation load with 2.5 and 1.4, respectively. In the component-based assessments, the dry tower is found as the most dominant component according to the exergy destruction ratio analysis, energy costing, and carbon-related costs. The exergy efficiency varies between 8.0% and 18.9% for different operation loads, and the operating temperatures have a crucial impact on the exergetic performances. The thermoeconomic analysis deduces that the levelized product cost is roundly 1.14 S$ · h-1 which means the exergy-related terms (e.g. destruction and loss) increase the costing trends 3.25 times as high compared to the traditional energy-based economic calculations.",Not About Sufficiency
"Optimal control framework for cost-effective, intelligent, renewable energy-driven communities in Norway, enhanced by ANN and grey wolf method","The present work introduces a novel yet smart energy system to decarbonize the energy mix, provide cost-effective green energy, and help to achieve sustainable energy production/storage/usage. Smart hydronic units and multiple controllers are the backbone of this idea, which aims to monitor energy conversion among components, the grid, and users through an innovative rule-based framework. This clever integration results in smaller components, bidirectional grid connection, and increased penetration of renewable energy sources into the local energy network. The system is driven by photovoltaic thermal panels and a biomass heater integrated with a heat pump and internal combustion engine. The TRNSYS-MATLAB framework evaluates the system's practicality from all aspects. Multi-objective optimization based on the grey wolf approach equipped with artificial intelligence is added to find the most optimal state. Compared to the conventional system in Norway (hydropower + wind), the proposed smart integration achieves up to 55 % and 5.4 % reduction in energy costs and emission index. In particular, the carbon emission index is lowered to 36.3 g/kWh, and the energy cost is decreased to 38.4 $/MWh. Also, the parametric analysis indicates a conflictive change among key metrics when altering a variable, necessitating the multi-objective optimization to achieve a balancing trade-off. The optimization reduces the emission index, investment cost, and energy cost by about 1.8 g/kWh (5 %), 156,000 $/year (2.5 %), and 1.5 $/MWh (4 %) while improving the efficiency by about 1.7 % compared to the design condition. The suggested system generates 17,830 MW/year of clean energy and can mitigate carbon dioxide emissions by 552,000 kg per year compared to the Norwegian energy mix.",Not About Sufficiency
Utilization aware and network I/O intensive virtual machine placement policies for cloud data center,"High-performance computing in the cloud environment uses ample virtual resources, which in turn require physical infrastructures provided by cloud service providers (CSPs). Naturally, CSPs would like to place virtual machines (VM) in a cost-effective way satisfying the resource requirement of the VMs and the capacity constraints of the hosts. Such consideration has led to the well known virtual machine placement (VMP) problem. In this paper, we consider a variant of the VMP, taking into account the communication among the VMs. We introduce the concept of Virtual Cluster, made up of VMs communicating among themselves. It is desirable to place the VMs of a cluster close to each other and thus reduce the communication cost. The objective for the Virtual Cluster Placement (VCP) problem is to reduce the communication cost. For this, we have to consider the network topology of the data center. In this paper, we have proposed some heuristics for both kinds of placement problems (VMP as well as VCP) and given Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations. We have also presented algorithms based on Semidefinite Programming (SDP) and meta-heuristic based on Genetic Algorithms. We have compared the performance of proposed heuristics with other existing works and the optimal solutions obtained from ILPs.",Not About Sufficiency

Assessing the compressive strength of eco-friendly concrete made with rice husk ash: A hybrid artificial intelligence-aided technique,"Providing an eco-friendly replacement for cement in cementitious materials mitigates not only its consumption but also the environmental effects such as extraction of natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from its production. In light of this, the utilization of rice husk as a by-product of rice fields in the form of rice husk ash (RHA) as a partial substitute for cement, in addition to solving the problem of its disposal due to its silica content and high pozzolanic reaction, has been considered in the construction of sustainable concretes. This study seeks to move from the traditional laboratory-based methods for the examination of compressive strength (fc′) of concretes containing RHA towards artificial intelligence-based techniques by developing a novel hybrid model by integrating biogeography-based optimization (BBO) technique with artificial neural network (ANN). Besides, the performance of the hybrid ANN-BBO model was assessed with the single ANN model. To this end, the models were developed on an extensive dataset including 1276 data records collected from the literature. The efficiency of the models was evaluated by performance criteria and error histogram, and also cross-validation was utilized to avoid overfitting problems and generalize the models. Results demonstrated that the hybrid ANN-BBO model outperformed the single ANN model with high accuracy and minimum error values. Error histograms revealed that over 90 % of errors in the ANN-BBO model occurred in the range (−4 MPa, 4 MPa], while this range for the ANN model fell within (−6 MPa, 6 MPa]. Analyzing the influence of input parameters showed that more than 70 % of the contribution rate in the fc′ of RHA concrete belonged to four influential parameters of specimen age, cement, rice husk ash, and water, respectively. Eventually, to validate the proposed ANN-BBO model, a comparison was made with recent studies, in which the performance criteria revealed that the proposed model based on a more extensive dataset outperformed the models in previous studies.",Not About Sufficiency
"Distribution grid electrical performance and emission analysis of combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP)-photovoltaic (PV)-based data center and residential customers","As the number of data centers is increasing worldwide, there are concerns about their growing electricity demand on power grids and its impact on the environment. These concerns can be mitigated at the urban scale by utilizing the waste heat generated by data centers and multi-energy hub integration. Using Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power (CCHP) and Photovoltaic (PV) systems within a data center, in combination with district energy network connections, can create energy interactions with residential customers in a multi-energy hub. However, connecting large energy consumers and distributed energy systems to the electrical distribution grid presents challenges due to the conventional design of the power grid with unidirectional electricity flow. There is a lack of understanding about the grid impact of data centers with multi-energy systems regarding electrical performance parameters, energy demand, and emissions. To address these open issues, we developed an hourly energy interaction model that includes a CCHP-PV-based data center and residential customers. In addition, the CCHP-PV-based data center was operated with a cost-optimized energy scheduling. We conducted six case studies to distinguish the specific effects of CCHP, PV, and district energy network connections. The model takes into account hourly outdoor temperatures, energy prices, and varying energy demands to capture the seasonal impact on electrical performance parameters and energy results. From an energy and environmental perspective, CCHP-PV systems can eliminate the data center's electricity demand from the grid, reduce residential energy demand, and decrease carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. This cleaner production and energy exchange further support the United Nations Sustainable Development goals. The experimental results showed a 43% reduction in power loss in the distribution grid and helped the data center's main electrical bus and residential bus against the voltage drop phenomenon. The CCHP-PV-based data center with district heating and cooling connection reduced the peak hour electricity demand on the grid by 39% and annual electricity consumption from the grid by 66%. Furthermore, Greenhouse Gas Protocols (GHG) Scope-2 emissions associated with the data center's grid electricity consumption and only residential electricity consumption were reduced by 77% and 36%, respectively.",Not About Sufficiency

Existing technologies and scientific advancements to decarbonize shipping by retrofitting,"The maritime industry is transporting about 90 % of world commerce, contributing to the global greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. Increasing pressure on the sector to reduce its carbon footprint requires developing specialized energy-efficient technologies and studying their compatibility with modern safety and sustainability expectations of the waterborne sector. This research supports the United Nations sustainable development goals SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy) and 13 (Climate Action), and reviews available technologies for shipping decarbonization through design for retrofitting. Promising research areas to improve the energy efficiency of ships could focus on design concepts and methodologies, fluid dynamics, and artificial intelligence.

The global building sector is one of the primary contributors to carbon emissions, yet the economic implications of energetic building characteristics of residential buildings remain elusive. This study addresses the intersection of building energy performance, market valuation, and carbon emissions reduction by introducing a novel cluster-based eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodology to uncover the financial impact of energetic building features on property valuation. We combine Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) and property transaction data within the UK and apply two sophisticated machine learning models: XGBoost and CatBoost. To this end, we use hierarchical BIRCH clustering to identify subgroups within our comprehensive dataset and leverage SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and Partial Dependency Plots (PDP) to reveal nuanced insights into the financial contribution of energetic building characteristics to property valuation. This research contributes to the academic discourse by introducing a cluster-based XAI approach for analyzing energy-related financial incentives in the building sector. Our results suggest that energy-efficient building features lead to significant financial benefits outside of London. The cluster-based approach reveals that carbon emissions are predominantly relevant for medium to large buildings outside of London but have a reversed financial effect within the capital. For larger residential buildings, we find a tendency for high running costs for energy (e.g., lighting costs) to be well reflected in transaction prices. The presented findings underscore the potential economic benefits for targeted energy efficiency improvements and illuminate the pathway towards a low-carbon society by addressing inherent uncertainties surrounding the economic viability of energetic investments, thus fostering informed decision-making and sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating variable renewable energy and diverse flexibilities: Supplying carbon-free energy from a wind turbine to a data center,"Variable renewable energy sources (VREs) have experienced steady global growth. The discontinuation of feed-in tariffs (FIT) for new projects in Japan has necessitated the exploration of alternative revenue certainty mechanisms for VREs. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) for supplying carbon-free energy (CFE) have emerged as a promising business model. This study provides a practical framework for integrating diverse flexibilities, encompassing renewable energy curtailment, battery energy storage systems (BESS), and time-shifting demand response (TSDR) for PPAs. To accommodate the unique characteristics of each type of flexibility, the suggested framework consists of sequential optimization problems that incrementally incorporate flexibility to achieve feasible solutions with minimal flexibility. A simulation-based assessment was conducted using a case study involving the provision of the CFE from an onshore wind turbine to a nearby data center. The synergistic relationships between these flexibilities were examined through simulations. The findings highlight that setting a target for BESS's charge state and leveraging the TSDR are key factors in reducing the required capacity of the BESS. For wind developers, this reduction corresponds to a 7.3% decrease in the initial cost.

Consequently, their power consumption has raised concerns about energy sustainability and environmental impacts. Large-scale, on-site renewable energy could help reduce data centers’ carbon footprint; however, wind and solar power alone cannot provide an uninterrupted power supply to computer servers due to their natural variability.

Building Energy Consumption Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach with Feature Selection,"Building energy management system is required to achieve sustainable energy in the context of global environmental and climate change challenges. Energy consumption prediction is a typical procedure used to manage the energy consumption in buildings.

Energy cost optimization of globally distributed Internet Data Centers by copula-based multidimensional correlation modeling,"The high operating costs of Internet Data Centers (IDC) are a major challenge for their owners worldwide. Therefore, more attention has recently been paid to the energy and cost management of IDCs. This paper investigates the optimal operational strategy for minimizing the electricity costs of a group of globally distributed IDCs in different locations under various day-ahead electricity markets, and each is equipped with a high-performance energy storage system. For this goal, optimal workload dispatching and optimal energy management of the storage units of all IDCs are simultaneously perused by the proposed problem. The system is modeled regarding power balancing constraints, battery costs, and quality of service (QoS). For more practical results, a penalty function is also considered when QoS constraints are not perfectly met, and the impact of the batteries’ depth of discharge on the cost of energy storage is also modeled. Moreover, the cross-correlations between the traffic of IDCs are also considered by the multidimensional copula function. The proposed energy cost optimization is linearized for increasing the accuracy of convergence. The results show that not only the power consumption pattern of the IDCs is significantly improved, but also the cost of power consumption is reduced by 34%.

Is waste heat recovery a promising avenue for the Carnot battery? Techno-economic optimisation of an electric booster-assisted Carnot battery integrated into different data centres,"The transition to intermittent renewable energies will necessitate the integration of storage. An interesting technology is the Carnot battery (CB), a novel power-to-heat-to-power system, capable of harnessing waste energy streams. While initial studies have indicated that, under ideal conditions, CB can be competitive with conventional technologies such as chemical batteries, their economic viability in real-world applications remains uncertain. To fill this gap, this work explores the techno-economic potential of electric booster-assisted CB integrated within data centres. Motivation for this case study is the recovery of waste heat, leading to an improved electrical storage efficiency. To maximise the energy self-sufficiency and the internal rate of return, we have applied multi-criteria optimisation to the system design, under three different thermal integration scenarios and for two sets of climatic conditions, using a thermodynamic model and time series from a real data centre. Our analyses suggest that current projections for electricity prices and CB costs yield payback periods exceeding a decade, but that these could fall below ten years if the CB capital costs were halved. Furthermore, it turns out that the choice of optimum charging system (i.e. right balance between heat pump and electrical heater) is contingent on the heat source temperature and availability. For higher temperatures (e.g. 60 °C), heat pumps emerge as the financially most attractive option, thanks to their superior coefficient of performance, whereas for lower temperatures (< 25 °C), resistive heaters are preferable. Results also show that when the aim is to increase the energy self-sufficiency, there exist an efficiency/charging capacity trade-off, which causes a dilemma for the system design. On the one hand, heat pumps are vital to increase the efficiency of the CB, but on the other hand, as the amount of thermal energy available at its source is limited by the data centre operations, electrical boosters are indispensable to increase the charging capacity. To soften this dilemma and enhance the techno-economic performance of thermally integrated CB, future research should explore more efficient booster configurations, such as dual heat source heat pumps.",Not About Sufficiency
Modeling and control of a hydrogen-based green data center,"Data centers consume a large amount of energy, contributing to CO2 emissions, global warming, and resulting in significant electricity cost. To address these concerns, an increasing number of companies have considered building green data centers. The most abundant energy resource is solar; it is now a key player in the global energy transformation. Tidal energy has also received particular attention recently. The predictable characteristic of the resource makes the kinetic energy of tidal current an extremely competitive power resource compared to other commonly used renewable energies. For this purpose, a hybrid Tidal/Photovoltaic system is used for powering an MW scale green data center on a remote island. Green data centers are mainly dependent on renewable energies, which have intermittent nature and require a storage system capable of ensuring sustainable energy feeding. The proposed system consists of an MW scale proton exchange membrane electrolyzer and fuel cell. This system is associated with the LiFePO4 battery to cover the fast-electrical dynamics. In this paper, the system modeling is presented along with an initial proposal of control and energy management system to align the data center energy consumption with the renewable energy generated while respecting the different system constraints. The model is implemented in Matlab/Simulink platform where the simulation results exhibit the system performance under different operation conditions.",Not About Sufficiency
Achieving energy savings through artificial-intelligence-assisted fault detection and diagnosis: Case study on refrigeration systems,"This study developed an innovative auto-scale transfer learning (ASTL) technology for artificial intelligence (AI) assisted fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). Openly available data on water chiller faults, namely the RP-1043 data set, were used to train the developed ASTL system. The data of water chillers were then transferred to refrigeration systems for FDD. AI-assisted FDD was conducted with an internet of things (IoT) system to complete a case study on 100 refrigeration systems located in 39 different places. The power of these refrigeration systems ranged from 1/4 to 10 hp, and the froze products such as fresh foods, pickled foods, dairy products, and meat products. The practical case studies conducted in this research indicates that energy savings can be achieved by conducting AI-assisted FDD for refrigeration systems. The energy savings for equipment with a power of 1/4–10 hp were 13.43%–26.83%. The application of AI-assisted FDD in refrigeration systems resulted in higher energy conservation than did its application in HVAC systems. In addition, AI-assisted FDD effectively reduced the transportation costs and personnel costs required for equipment maintenance, and the annual cost of the AI platform and the installation cost of the IoT system had the total return of 40.92%.",Not About Sufficiency
"A Comprehensive, Valid, and Reliable Tool to Assess the Degree of Responsibility of Digital Health Solutions That Operate With or Without Artificial Intelligence: 3-Phase Mixed Methods Study","Background Clinicians’ scope of responsibilities is being steadily transformed by digital health solutions that operate with or without artificial intelligence (DAI solutions). Most tools developed to foster ethical practices lack rigor and do not concurrently capture the health, social, economic, and environmental issues that such solutions raise. Objective To support clinical leadership in this field, we aimed to develop a comprehensive, valid, and reliable tool that measures the responsibility of DAI solutions by adapting the multidimensional and already validated Responsible Innovation in Health Tool. Methods We conducted a 3-phase mixed methods study. Relying on a scoping review of available tools, phase 1 (concept mapping) led to a preliminary version of the Responsible DAI solutions Assessment Tool. In phase 2, an international 2-round e-Delphi expert panel rated on a 5-level scale the importance, clarity, and appropriateness of the tool’s components. In phase 3, a total of 2 raters independently applied the revised tool to a sample of DAI solutions (n=25), interrater reliability was measured, and final minor changes were made to the tool. Results The mapping process identified a comprehensive set of responsibility premises, screening criteria, and assessment attributes specific to DAI solutions. e-Delphi experts critically assessed these new components and provided comments to increase content validity (n=293), and after round 2, consensus was reached on 85% (22/26) of the items surveyed. Interrater agreement was substantial for a subcriterion and almost perfect for all other criteria and assessment attributes. Conclusions The Responsible DAI solutions Assessment Tool offers a comprehensive, valid, and reliable means of assessing the degree of responsibility of DAI solutions in health. As regulation remains limited, this forward-looking tool has the potential to change practice toward more equitable as well as economically and environmentally sustainable digital health care.",Not About Sufficiency

Power and performance management for parallel computations in clouds and data centers,"We address scheduling independent and precedence constrained parallel tasks on multiple homogeneous processors in a data center with dynamically variable voltage and speed as combinatorial optimization problems. We consider the problem of minimizing schedule length with energy consumption constraint and the problem of minimizing energy consumption with schedule length constraint on multiple processors. Our approach is to use level-by-level scheduling algorithms to deal with precedence constraints. We use a simple system partitioning and processor allocation scheme, which always schedules as many parallel tasks as possible for simultaneous execution. We use two heuristic algorithms for scheduling independent parallel tasks in the same level, i.e., SIMPLE and GREEDY. We adopt a two-level energy/time/power allocation scheme, namely, optimal energy/time allocation among levels of tasks and equal power supply to tasks in the same level. Our approach results in significant performance improvement compared with previous algorithms in scheduling independent and precedence constrained parallel tasks.",Not About Sufficiency
"An application of extenics, spatial factors, and natural resource market in China: The role of artificial intelligence and geopolitical risk","Scientific breakthroughs in recent years have earned widespread recognition. The significance of extenics has become so vital that the discipline is continuously evolving. Additionally, with the deployment of extenics and other innovations, the countries are now more connected and spatially reliant, influencing the global economy. The current study aims to investigate the role of extenics (measured by artificial intelligence (AI)) and spatial factors (measured by geopolitical risk (GPR)) in affecting the natural resources market (NRM). The analysis is performed on the Chinese economy data range from 1985 to 2022. The empirical assessment is carried out by using the unit root tests (Augmented Dickey fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) test), the non-linearity test (BDS test), and the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model. The NARDL results show an asymmetric relationship between AI, GPR, and NRM in both the short run (SR) and long run (LR). A positive (negative) shock to AI, according to the findings, lowers (raises) natural resource rent and hence improves the natural resource market. Similarly, a positive (negative) shock to the GPR increases (decreases) natural resource rent and allows for the exploitation of the natural resource market. The study suggests that in addition to concentrating on extenics applications, the Chinese government needs to strengthen and reform its strategies to regulate spatial impacts to optimize its natural resource market.",Not About Sufficiency
A Survey of General Ontologies for the Cross-Industry Domain of Circular Economy,"Circular Economy has the goal to reduce value loss and avoid waste by extending the life span of materials and products, including circulating materials or product parts before they become waste. Circular economy models (e.g., circular value networks) are typically complex and networked, involving different cross-industry domains. In the context of a circular value network, multiple actors, such as suppliers, manufacturers, recyclers, and product end-users, may be involved. In addition, there may be various flows of resources, energy, information and value throughout the network. This means that we face the challenge that the data and information from cross-industry domains in a circular economy model are not built on common ground, and as a result are difficult to understand and use for both humans and machines. Using ontologies to represent domain knowledge can enable actors and stakeholders from different industries in the circular economy to communicate using a common language. The knowledge domains involved include circular economy, sustainability, materials, products, manufacturing, and logistics. The objective of this paper is to investigate the landscape of current ontologies for these domains. This will enable us to in the future explore what existing knowledge can be adapted or used to develop ontologies for circular value networks.",Not About Sufficiency
Bioplastic derived from corn stover: Life cycle assessment and artificial intelligence-based analysis of uncertainty and variability,"Exploring feasible and renewable alternatives to reduce dependency on traditional fossil-based plastics is critical for sustainable development. These alternatives can be produced from biomass, which may have large uncertainties and variabilities in the feedstock composition and system parameters. This study develops a modeling framework that integrates cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) with a rigorous process model and artificial intelligence (AI) models to conduct uncertainty and variability analyses, which are highly time-consuming to conduct using only the process model. This modeling framework examines polylactic acid (PLA) produced from corn stover in the U.S. An analysis of uncertainty and variability was conducted by performing a Monte Carlo simulation to show the detailed result distributions. Our Monte Carlo simulation results show that the mean life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 1 kg PLA is 4.3 kgCO2eq (P5–P95 4.1–4.4) for composting PLA with natural gas combusted for the biorefinery, 3.7 kgCO2eq (P5–P95 3.4–3.9) for incinerating PLA for electricity with natural gas combusted for the biorefinery, and 1.9 kgCO2eq (P5–P95 1.6–2.1) for incinerating PLA for electricity with wood pellets combusted for the biorefinery. Tradeoffs for different environmental impact categories were identified. Based on feedstock composition variations, two AI models were trained: random forest and artificial neural networks.

The optimal thermal management study of a next-generation data center,"This study adopts the computational fluid dynamics software−ANSYS FLUENT to predict the airflow and temperature distribution in a next-generation overhead downward flow (ODF)-type data center (DC). The study's primary objective is to minimize the entropy generation rate of the heat exchanger (HX) used in the ODF system in order to achieve energy savings. The ANSYS DesignXplorer optimization tool is employed to find the optimal design point with the smallest entropy generation rate of the HX. The predicted total exergy destruction of the DC at the optimal design point shows that the proposed A1-grade DC defined by ASHRAE TC 9.9 can save energy effectively. Moreover, the predicted power usage effectiveness (PUE) is lower than the average PUE reported in 2020 and all of the thermal performance metrics fall within the range of ideal conditions. The numerical results show that two approaches can effectively save energy in the ODF-type DC: one is to suitably increase the air-supply temperature; and the other is to suitably increase the temperature difference between the air-supply and return ports. Moreover, the separation of cold and hot aisles can effectively avoid the mixing of cold and hot airflows, resulting in an insignificant exergy destruction in the airspace.",Not About Sufficiency

Reducing traffic burstiness for MPTCP in data center networks,"Modern industrial and data center networks adopt multipath TCP (MPTCP) to achieve low communication latency. To make full use of multiple paths, MPTCP divides one TCP connection into multiple subflows. Due to the connection-level ACK blocking, however, MPTCP suffers from the traffic burstiness, which leads to large queueing delay, frequent packet drops, and even TCP timeout. To mitigate the traffic burstiness caused by ACK blocking, we propose MPTCP-RB (Multipath TCP with Reduced Burstiness), which interleaves consecutive packets across multiple subflows, instead of assigning consecutive packets to individual subflows. MPTCP-RB is implemented as a loadable Linux kernel module, working on any traditional MPTCP-based schemes without any other modifications on existing network stacks. The testbed and NS2 experiments show that, MPTCP-RB reduces the average flow completion time by up to 91% compared with the state-of-the-art MPTCP-based schemes.",Not About Sufficiency
Fintech and aluminium: Strategic enablers of climate change mitigation and sustainable mineral policy,"In the context of increasingly frequent extreme weather events, exploring the role of financial technology (FT) and aluminum (AL) in reducing carbon emissions (CE) is of great significance to promote the low-carbon economy transformation.

Specifically, the widespread use of AL in zero-carbon buildings, automotive lightweight and renewable energy technologies highlight its effectiveness in decreasing energy consumption and enhancing environmental quality. Besides, the development of FT reduces unnecessary resource consumption and CE by simplifying payment methods and improving financial service efficiency. Moreover, the indirect effects of FT on CE are examined by considering the role of renewable energy (RE). The results show that FT has both positive and negative effects on CE. The positive impact means that FT can stimulate investors to increase investment in the RE industry and reduce carbon pollution.

Improving Resource and Energy Efficiency for Cloud 3D through Excessive Rendering Reduction,"The rise of cloud gaming makes interactive 3D applications an emerging type of data center workload. However, the excessive rendering in current cloud 3D systems leads to large gaps between the cloud and client frame rates (FPS, frames per second), thus wasting resources and power. Although FPS regulation can remove excessive rendering, due to the highly-varying frame processing time and the use of rendering delays, existing cloud FPS regulation solutions have low FPS and slow motion-to-photon (MtP) latency, causing violations of Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.In this paper, we present a novel cloud FPS regulation solution, called OnDemand Rendering (ODR). ODR employs multi-buffering, dynamic rendering delay/acceleration, and input processing prioritization to reduce excessive rendering and ensure QoS satisfaction. ODR was evaluated in our private cloud and Google cloud. Evaluation results showed that ODR effectively removed excessive rendering, thus improving DRAM performance by 19% and reducing power usage by 16% over no FPS regulation. Better memory efficiency also allowed ODR to increase client FPS by 5.5%. Moreover, ODR reduced average MtP latency by more than 92% and outperformed existing FPS regulations. More importantly, ODR's high FPS and low latency make it feasible to deploy 3D applications to conventional public clouds.",Not About Sufficiency

FedDetect: A Novel Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework for Energy Theft Detection in Smart Grid,"In smart grids, a major challenge is how to effectively utilize consumers’ energy consumption data while preserving security and privacy. In this article, we tackle this challenging issue and focus on energy theft detection, which is very important for smart grids. Specifically, we note that most existing energy theft detection schemes are centralized, which may be unscalable, and more importantly, may be very difficult to protect data privacy. To address this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection, namely, FedDetect. In our framework, we consider a federated learning system that consists of a data center (DC), a control center (CC), and multiple detection stations. In this system, each detection station (DTS) can only observe data from local consumers, which can use a local differential privacy (LDP) scheme to process their data to preserve privacy. To facilitate the training of the model, we design a secure protocol so that detection stations can send encrypted training parameters to the CC and the DC, which then use homomorphic encryption to calculate the aggregated parameters and return updated model parameters to detection stations. In our study, we prove the security of the proposed protocol with solid security analysis. To detect energy theft, we design a deep learning model based on the state-of-the-art temporal convolutional network (TCN). Finally, we conduct extensive data-driven experiments using a real-energy consumption data set. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed federated learning framework can achieve high accuracy of detection with a smaller computation overhead.",Not About Sufficiency

Reproducible Builds (R-Bs) provide a strong foundation to build defenses for arbitrary attacks against build systems by ensuring that given the same source code, build environment, and build instructions, bitwise-identical artifacts are created. Unfortunately, much of the software industry believes R-Bs are too far out of reach for most projects. The goal of this paper is to help identify a path for R-Bs to become a commonplace property.To this end, we conducted a series of 24 semi-structured expert interviews with participants from the Reproducible-Builds.org project, finding that self-effective work by highly motivated developers and collaborative communication with upstream projects are key contributors to R-Bs. We identified a range of motivations that can encourage open source developers to strive for R-Bs, including indicators of quality, security benefits, and more efficient caching of artifacts. We also identify experiences that help and hinder adoption, which often revolves around communication with upstream projects. We conclude with recommendations on how to better integrate R-Bs with the efforts of the open source and free software community.",Not About Sufficiency

"Energize sustainability: EnSAF for sustainability aware, software intensive energy management systems","Context: India’s coal use for electricity jumped 13% in 2021–22. Energy management systems (EnMS) are seen as a solution, but only sustainable EnMS can have a discernable impact on the carbon footprint and the Return On Investment (ROI). Objective: Designing a software-intensive sustainable energy management system requires considering technical, environmental, social, and economic factors. This helps evaluate an EnMS’s overall impact and improve its design. We proposed EnSAF for efficient utilization of the energy incurred for the design of sustainability-aware EnMSs. Method: In this work, EnMSs in diverse use cases were selected and analyzed in terms of technical, social, environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainability in collaboration with various stakeholders. The set of application-specific design concerns and Quality Attributes (QAs) were addressed by the Sustainability Assessment Framework (SAF) toolkit. The resultant SAF instances of each EnMS, derived through the analysis and discussion with the stakeholders, were then analyzed to advocate the DMs and SQ model for generic EnMSs. Results: This study demonstrated the following outcomes (i) technical concerns dominate the existing EnMSs (ii) integration of renewable energy resources reduces dependency to the main power grid and nurtures a sustainable environment by diminishing carbon footprint, and minimizing payback time, in the economic dimension; (iii) extant definitions of quality attributes need significant scrutiny and updates apropos of objectives of EnMSs Conclusion: The SAF toolkit was found to be deficient in the representation of relevant design concerns and quality attributes concomitant with sustainable EnMS. Prevailing DMs are inept to factor in stakeholder’s concerns, as the model is ill-equipped to account for spatio-temporal representation of QAs. Pursuant to the insights from the 4 SAF instances, a generic framework, EnSAF, is proposed to tackle the relevant concerns apropos of EnMS sustainability.

Development and comparison of reduced-order models for CO2-enhanced oil recovery predictions,"CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) has been a mature and promising technology since the 1970s, offering a dual solution for energy production and carbon sequestration. Recent advances in reduced-order models (ROMs) using empirical analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools handle complex data efficiently. However, existing ROMs for CO2-EOR often lack validation due to data confidentiality or are too case-specific for broader application. This paper introduces a framework to close these gaps, enabling the development and consistent comparison of generalized ROMs for CO2-EOR with carbon capture and storage (CCS), even with traditional tools. A synthesis dataset (∼3000 runs) was established to develop ROMs, which were validated using field data from both EOR and CCS perspectives. Three key findings are revealed. First, normalizing outputs with respect to CO2 utilization illustrated a direct relationship between CCS and EOR. Second, generalized statistics-based ROMs reduced input complexity and validated field data but predicted fewer outputs. Machine learning-based ROMs predicted more outputs, supporting field operational decision-makings. Last, ROMs were particularly suitable for early-stage, large-scale CO2-EOR assessments. This study extended the boundaries of developing generalized ROMs for CO2-EOR and identified pros and cons across modeling approaches, contributing to net-zero goals and advancing sustainable and affordable energy future.",Not About Sufficiency
In-line characterisation of continuous phase conductivity in slurry flows using artificial intelligence tomography,"Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) can be applied to monitor a variety of mineral and chemical processes including: velocity measurements in drilling cuttings and hydrocyclone operations. Hydraulic conveying systems rely upon the knowledge of slurry density to ensure efficient transportation of the solids. Typically, density measurements exploit the attenuation of gamma ray photons which poses complex safety, operational and regulatory concerns with Electrical Impedance Tomography affording a non-nuclear alternative to traditional approaches. To optimise the accuracy of this non-nuclear density measurement, the electrical conductivity of the aqueous phase in a multi-component slurry, is required. Whilst conductivity probes are sufficiently accurate, there are often drawbacks and limitations due to installation restrictions, as it is difficult to separate aqueous and solid phases in real-time. Electrical Impedance Fingerprinting (EIF), is a novel measurement technique which characterises formulation properties, in-situ, based upon electrical impedance sensing and artificial intelligence algorithms. This paper outlines the development of EIF and its application to monitor aqueous phase conductivity in multi-component slurries, containing sands and clays. EIF accurately predicts this conductivity with high accuracy and a root-mean squared error of 0.055 mS cm−1. This development ensures accurate non-nuclear density measurements (<5%) are obtained across an extended aqueous electrical conductivity range of 1.5–70 mS cm−1. This encompasses the majority of target hydraulic conveying systems in mining operations.

"Security, QoS and energy aware optimization of cloud-edge data centers using game theory and homomorphic encryption: Modeling and formal verification","Privacy and efficient data processing are crucial research areas in the field of outsourcing computing. Thus, the contribution of the paper is twofold. First of all, we develop a secure offloading technique that can process data while preserving privacy. Although RSA and Paillier cryptosystems are highly beneficial for mathematical operations on basic encrypted data due to their homomorphic properties, images are processed using permutation-ordered binary (POB) and Shamir's secret sharing (SSS). Second, a non-cooperative game theory model was formulated to examine the interactions between service providers, characterizing each edge as an M/M/1 system with an infinite queue. Through formal verification using rigorous mathematical reasoning, the suggested strategies for task offloading and resource allocation are shown to be effective in terms of security, quality of service (QoS), and energy consumption. The best-response dynamics approach is used to calculate the final strategy for each participant and assess how fairly resources are allocated. Finally, the potential of our approach is demonstrated numerically, revealing a faster convergence towards attaining Nash equilibrium in a duopoly cloud-edge data center market, granted that the necessary and sufficient conditions are met.",Not About Sufficiency

Artificial intelligence -driven insights into bisphenol A removal using synthesized carbon nanotubes,"Water quality nowadays, under climate change, has become a risk and challenging problem to save water from deterioration. Advanced solutions such as nanomaterials and artificial intelligence for simulation have become some of the best and essential solutions. Therefore, this study assessed the artificial intelligence models' accuracy in simulating the elimination of Bisphenol A (BPA) using synthesized carbon nanotubes (CNTs). We concluded that the pseudo-second-order model's (R2) correlation coefficient is (0.999) significantly higher than the other models. Because the findings between the Model and Actual Values are so accurate, the adsorption of BPA on CNT could be modeled using the pseudo-second-order model, qe = 144.928(mg/g) and K2 = 0.0016. The correlation coefficient of Pseudo-First-Order model's (R2) is (0.825) qe = 27.107(mg/g) and K1 = 0.0161, and the Intraparticle diffusion model's (R2) is (0.821),qe = 151.98(mg/g) and Kd = 2.4. The Langmuir model performed the best in isothermal experiments, with correlation coefficients of R2 = 0.9441, qm = 181.81, and RL = 0.0375. Based on the information provided, we may conclude that the Langmuir model accounts for more BPA adsorption than the other models.

Energy-intensive indoor cultivation drives the cannabis industry’s expanding carbon footprint,"Summary While the local environmental harms of cultivating cannabis outdoors receive considerable attention, those from indoor cultivation are often overlooked. Windowless plant factories and high-tech greenhouses are vastly more energy intensive than open-field cultivation, conventional buildings, and some industries. With US cannabis production more than doubling over the past decade to ∼24 kt/year, the lack of greenhouse gas emissions inventories creates a serious information vacuum. This life cycle assessment finds industry-wide emissions of ∼44 Mt CO2e/year (half from legal producers), equaling those of ∼10 million cars or ∼6 million homes. The underlying 595 PJ/year energy consumption ($11 billion/year) is on par with that of all other crop production, four times that of the pharmaceutical and medicine or beverage and tobacco industries, one-third that of data centers, and half again greater than that of cryptocurrency mining. National legalization alone would achieve only modest reductions, but it could enable more potent policies; the most promising avenue could reduce emissions by up to 76% by shifting more cultivation outdoors.",Not About Sufficiency

Carbon footprint effects of shifting from flights to night trains for Swedish tourism,"Changes in travel behaviour are needed to tackle the climate impact associated with long-distance flights, including a switch to sustainable transport modes. In this paper, we analyse scenarios of carbon footprint reduction associated with a switch from flights to night trains for holidays in Europe for the case of Sweden, including outbound, inbound and domestic tourism. We use a prospective lifecycle assessment framework combined with results from a stated preference experiment to determine the impact of future mode shift behaviours. Our results indicate that a mode shift could be triggered by progressive night train policies resulting in (i) fewer transfers and (ii) price levels similar to those of flights. The shifts from flights to night trains could result in 9% lower cumulative carbon footprint in relation to a baseline travel demand scenario for the period 2025–2050.

Enhancing energy performance assessment and labeling in buildings: A review of BIM-based approaches,"Buildings are central to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, energy labeling programs, intended to encourage sustainable practices, often encounter challenges such as data inaccuracies, manual processes, and discrepancies between estimated and actual energy consumption. This study examines how Building Information Modeling (BIM) can contribute to improving the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of energy labeling, addressing existing gaps in current practices. Through a systematic literature review, the research compiles insights from recent studies that demonstrate BIM's potential to centralize and automate building data, reduce errors in energy assessments, and facilitate integration with Building Energy Modeling (BEM) tools for more consistent simulations. The findings indicate that BIM-based methods, including model generation techniques, multi-objective optimization, and digital twin applications, help mitigate the performance gap by enabling data updates, improving interoperability, and offering better occupant behavior modeling. Nevertheless, several challenges remain, such as ensuring data quality, enhancing open data standards, and refining tools to accommodate evolving energy systems. A key novelty of this review lies in synthesizing a broad range of BIM-driven approaches into a cohesive perspective on how energy labeling can be modernized and enriched. By proposing future research paths that further integrate these BIM-based solutions, this study underscores BIM's capacity to streamline labeling processes through advanced analytics and automation, ultimately supporting more informed retrofits, regulatory compliance, and sustainable design strategies. In summary, the review suggests that BIM can enhance current labeling methodologies and contribute to broader sustainability goals in the built environment.",Not About Sufficiency

Establish many governance initiatives through the need to improve organizational performance, quality of service, the ability to implement and adapt to change. Cities in general and their historical centres in, particular have faced many problems, pressures, the worst aspects of energy shortages, and the provision of services and infrastructure in the world. Nonrenewable energy is one of the most important problems that always threaten societies, making it one of the most important international concerns and the Millennium Development Goals. Most countries seek to protect their historic cities and centres through conservation policies, laws, and institutions responsible for the preservation of heritage and affected communities. Some succeeded in dealing with these pressures and managed to solve the internal problems (partial or quantitative) to reach the advanced stages of preserving the cultural heritage, while other countries do not have the ability to set their goals. Therefore, there is a difference between the countries of the world in the possibility of identifying appropriate strategies for the renewal and development of historical centres as protected areas, while at the same time able to integrate with other modern cities and meet the needs of development and sustainable energy of their peoples.

Setting and Solving Problems of Sustainable Development Management of Regional Economy Objects,"A practical solution to the problem of socioeconomic and environmental development at the regional level requires the development of theory and methods of managing objects in the long period of time (over 20 years). A feature of economic objects with a long operating time is the passage of various stages of the life cycle for which control laws may vary.In this paper the problem of managing objects of the regional economy is considered from the standpoint of managing natural-industrial macrosystems defined as open, multilevel, nonlinear, deterministic-stochastic structures with delayed signal in control and communication channel. These include infrastructural socio-economic facilities such as energy, transport, information, medical, utilities and other systems. To work with them a methodology consisting of eight information blocks is proposed. One of blocks contains a formalized description of control tasks implemented at various stages of the object's life cycle.

Exploring Implication of Renewable Energy Transition on the Cost of Electricity and Green House Gases Emission in East African Countries,"East Africa’s electrification is at odds with United Nations goals to provide clean modern energy for all by 2030 despite possessing a vast potential for Renewable energy (RE). The increasing demand for energy coupled with continuous reliance on non-renewable energy resources as the least-cost power generation option contributes highly to climate change. This study aims to explore the implication of RE transition on the cost of electricity generation and greenhouse gas emission. The study applied a scenario capacity expansion model (System Planning Test) to investigate the implication of changing penetration level of RE from the reference least-cost solution in existing policy documents on the overall costs of building and operating an electrical system and the derived carbon dioxide emission level. The results showed that the relationship between RE and the electricity system cost is nonlinear. This implies that small changes in the level of renewable penetration relative to the least-cost solution result in small changes in the system costs while large deviation leads to large changes in the system costs. The higher levels of RE deployment lead to high reduction of carbon dioxide but with higher overall system costs. While lower levels of RE leads to higher carbon dioxide emission levels at lower system costs. Thus evaluating the trade-off between emission saving and system cost, shows that cost of avoiding emissions is incremental to RE deployment and declines as RE is curtailed. Thus initiatives to promote RE growth in order to meet the Sustainable Development Goals have been proposed.",Not About Sufficiency

Hybrid Management System for Sustainable Development of Objects of the Regional Economy,"Management of the sustainable development of regional infrastructure systems (IS) over time intervals of more than 20 years is one of the fundamental scientific problems of modern management theory. In this paper, such control objects, designed to serve the population with resources, goods and services, are considered on the universal scientific platform of natural-industrial systems (NIS), which are purposeful and developing organizations. The meaning of NIS management is associated with ensuring the movement of IS towards sustainable development goals (SDG), characterized by a set of social, economic and environmental factors (indicators) that are important for the life of not only present, but also future generations of citizens.

PV ratio for deep renovation,"The building sector plays a crucial role in decarbonization, energy transition, and sustainable development strategies, accounting for 40% of global energy consumption and 37% of emissions. Efforts to improve energy efficiency in buildings have been made through standards like the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) in the European Union, resulting in a significant increase in energy-efficient buildings. However, the challenge lies in retrofitting existing buildings, which constitute the majority of the EU building stock and have a slow renewal rate. The EU Renovation Wave strategy aims to accelerate energy renovations in over 35 million buildings. The upcoming review of the EPBD sets the goal of transforming existing buildings into zero-emission structures, emphasizing the exploitation of renewable energy sources. Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems are recognized for their versatility and reliability and can contribute significantly to energy efficiency policies. However, the actual availability of exploitable surface area for the integration of PV panels in buildings poses a feasibility challenge. This study provides a rough assessment of the potential for BIPV integration in existing buildings, focusing on residential structures. The findings suggest that, according to EPBD new recast, BIPV systems can cover the primary energy consumption of buildings ranging from 1 to 1.5 floors, depending on the climatic zone. However, deep energy retrofit interventions can further enhance energy efficiency, surpassing regulatory requirements.

New Energy Consumption Capacity Evaluation Method for Isolated Industrial Park Considering Flexible Load Regulation Ability,"In the context of the global energy transition, China is promoting the synergistic integration of energy sources, grids, loads and storage through national strategic policies. This paper examines the challenges of integrating volatile new energy sources, such as wind and solar, into the grids of isolated industrial parks (IIPs). It proposes a model to assess and optimize the consumption capacity of these resources to balance energy production with grid demand effectively. Initially, a “resource-power” conversion model is developed to simulate the potential output of wind and solar installations, given the absence of direct connectivity to the grid in newly established IIPs. Then, with the optimization objective of minimizing the overall cost of isolated grid operation, the new energy consumption capacity of IIPs is evaluated, taking into account the actual operating constraints of thermal power units, the maximum new energy consumption that can be technically achieved, and the regulation potential of flexible load participation response to mitigate the impacts caused by fluctuations in new energy sources. Finally, based on the analysis of the actual operation data of the IIPs, the simulation results show that the IIP can be guided by adjusting the installed capacity parameters for planning the installed size of wind and solar in the IIP before connecting to wind and PV. Moreover, fully exploiting flexible load regulation ability can effectively improve the IIP's wind power consumption capacity, which can provide theoretical guidance for optimizing the IIP's scheduling and promoting new energy consumption.",Not About Sufficiency

Seagull optimization algorithm based multi-objective VM placement in edge-cloud data centers,"Edge-Cloud Datacenters (ECDCs) have been massively exploited by the owners of technology and industrial centers to satisfy the user demand. At the same time, the amount of energy used by these data centers is considerable. To address this challenge, Virtual Machine (VM) placement of the ECDCs plays an important role; therefore, assigning VM properly to physical machines (PM) can significantly decrease the amount of energy consumption. The applied assigning technique simultaneously must consider additional objectives involving traffic and power usage of the network elements, which makes it a challenging problem. This paper proposes a multi-objective VM placement approach in edge-cloud data centers, which uses Seagull optimization to optimize power and network traffic together. In this strategy, the network traffic among PMs is reduced by concentrating the communications of VMs on the same PMs to reduce the amount of transferred data through the network and reduce the PMs’ power consumption by consolidating VMs to fewer PMs, which consumes less energy. We evaluate with simulations in CloudSim and test two different network topologies, VL2 (Virtual Layer 2) and three-tier, to validate that the proposed approach can effectively reduce traffic and power consumption in ECDCs.

Explaining deep learning-based anomaly detection in energy consumption data by focusing on contextually relevant data,"Detecting anomalies in energy consumption data is crucial for identifying energy waste, equipment malfunction, and overall, for ensuring efficient energy management. Machine learning, and specifically deep learning approaches, have been greatly successful in anomaly detection; however, they are black-box approaches that do not provide transparency or explanations. SHAP and its variants have been proposed to explain these models, but they suffer from high computational complexity (SHAP) or instability and inconsistency (e.g., Kernel SHAP). To address these challenges, this paper proposes an explainability approach for anomalies in energy consumption data that focuses on context-relevant information. The proposed approach leverages existing explainability techniques, focusing on SHAP variants, together with global feature importance and weighted cosine similarity to select background dataset based on the context of each anomaly point. By focusing on the context and most relevant features, this approach mitigates the instability of explainability algorithms.

There are also concerns about frauds exploiting security vulnerabilities in smart metering systems on a large scale, e.g., making smart meters provide false metering data to the service providers. From a macro perspective, the smart grids, including the smart metering systems and devices can be attacked to bring down the whole grid or at least some parts of the grid, which is a concern of national security. This paper focuses on the security and privacy aspects of the smart metering systems. Potential attackers, security threats and attacks on smart metering systems are listed and the security approaches to address the security issues are presented. A security by design approach for secure smart metering is discussed in the paper. The major results of a security by design approach for smart metering systems developed in the project, entitled “Trusted Computing Engineering for Resource Constraint Embedded Systems Applications”, funded by the European commission, are summarized in the end.",Not About Sufficiency

"Chronologically-Ordered Quantitative Global Targets for the Energy-Emissions-Climate Nexus, from 2021 to 2050","This work aims to organize selected global targets set by the two international organizations: IEA (International Energy Agency) and IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency), to form pathways for stopping the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, and for reaching a condition of net-zero CO2 emissions through accelerating the transition to clean-energy consumption, thereby decelerating the rate of climate change. In achieving this aim, three energy-emissions-climate (EEC) outlook scenarios are discussed and selected targets from them are listed here after being grouped chronologically, from 2021 to 2050. The majority of these targets (54 total) belong to the years 2030 (23 targets) and 2050 (16 targets). However, the years 2021, 2025, 2035, 2040, and 2045 have one or more targets as well. The outlook scenarios considered here are: (1) Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) of IEA, (2) Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) of IEA, and (3) 1.5°C Scenario by IRENA. The IEA-NZE and IRENA-1.5°C scenarios both imply limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5°C, and reaching global net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The IEA-SDS scenario is less strict, allowing a slightly-higher global temperature increase of 1.65°C and having a later deadline of 2070 for reaching global net-zero CO2 emissions.",Not About Sufficiency

A Lightweight and Energy Efficient Secrecy Outage Probability-based Friendly Jamming,"Third parties and legitimate entities can reach and process users' private data through most wireless networks. However, attackers such as intruders and eavesdroppers may also try to exploit this property in communication. Hence, wireless networks are intrinsically more vulnerable to threats, unlike their wired alternatives. Cryptographic techniques are the conventional approaches to deal with that weakness. Nevertheless, they still need to meet the requirements of contemporary technologies, including IoT nodes with energy and processing power constraints. In that respect, friendly jamming (FJ) is one of the encouraging countermeasures to overcome the mentioned susceptibility since it has an energy-efficient and computation-friendly nature. However, that promising approach brings another challenge, applicability. Although various models exist against this issue, a lightweight scheme compliant with novel technologies is needed. Hence, we propose a more straightforward FJ model evaluated on cellular network-based simulations in this study. Moreover, introducing a lightweight secrecy outage probability definition increases robustness and energy efficiency.",Not About Sufficiency

Review of Biomass as a Renewable Energy for Sustainable Environment,"Nations around the world are confronting an increasing demand for renewable energy as the global population continues to rise at a rapid rate. Recognizing the importance of averting climate change, renewable energy options must be not only effective but also sustainable. This study reviews biomass's potential as a renewable energy source, emphasizing on its role in tackling environmental pollution and waste management issues. Biomass is a product of the plant, produced through photosynthesis using sunlight for the conversion of water and carbon dioxide into a composite mix of organic matter such as hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, fats, starch, etc. The review dives at a wide range of biomass feedstocks, such as Examples of biomass are energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass), food crops and crop residue during processing (corn cobs, sugar cane, rice husk, wheat straw, bagasse), horticulture (yard waste), wood or forest residues (dead trees, branches, and tree stumps), animal farming (manure, rich in nitrogen and phosphorous sewage plant), municipal solid waste (paper, grass clippings, food scraps, clothes, furniture, product packaging), etc. It emphasizes how biomass provides a good chance to utilize feedstocks and farm wastes that would otherwise contribute to pollution in the environment. Biomass helps limit the production of greenhouse gases by turning these biomass resources into biofuels such as biodiesel, biomethane, and biochar which can be used as sources of energy. The importance of biomass as a renewable energy option, not only in terms of its potential to create Biofuel but also in terms of its role in minimizing environmental pollution caused by feedstock and farm waste will be duly reviewed. The study further reviews the relevance of long-term biomass usage for environmental and economic viability.

Nigeria’s Fossil Fuel Energy Consumption-GDP Relation and its Effect on National HDI:2005-2022,"The correlation between energy usage and economic growth is widely acknowledged. The placement within the dynamics of Nigeria's economic growth and fossil fuel usage is evaluated in this paper. Retrieved and processed data from reliable databases, such as ""Our World in Data"" and THE WORLD BANK, covering the years 2005 to 2022, were used to analyze the following: percentage of total primary energy consumption (fossil fuel), percentage of consumption per capita, percentage of total Gross Domestic Product (GDP), percentage of GDP per capita, and overall Human Development Index (HDI). The results showed fluctuations in GDP growth rates in tandem with stable energy consumption, a continuous reliance on fossil fuels in the face of a slow but steady rise in the HDI, and economic difficulties in certain years in spite of stable energy consumption. In contrast to predictions, the country's HDI, which has been rising steadily over time, was mostly unaffected by the non-linear link between GDP and fossil fuel usage. The study also showed variations in Adjusted Net Savings, indicating the unpredictability of the country's energy sector in the face of political and economic unpredictability. Notwithstanding these obstacles, the HDI showed a slow but noticeable improvement, suggesting that the income and savings Nigeria's petroleum resources provide to its population are not very beneficial.

Artificial intelligence-based prediction of strengths of slag-ash-based geopolymer concrete using deep neural networks,"The construction and building industry, one of the greatest emitters of greenhouse gases, is under tremendous pressure because of the growing concern about global climate change and its detrimental effects on societies. Given the environmental problems connected to cement production, geopolymer concrete has become a viable alternative. In addition, if the concrete strength results failed to meet the specified strength after being cast, modifications are impossible. Thus, it is particularly desirable to predict strength prior to casting concrete. This study presents the first effort in applying deep neural networks (DNN) of AI techniques to predict the mechanical strengths (GGBFS) of geopolymer concrete (GPC) produced from corncob ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag. The mixes were activated with 12–16 M of alkali solutions at ambiently cured conditions for 7–90 days. Following that, back propagation learning algorithms were created for forecasting the concrete strengths based on concrete mix proportions. The mechanical strengths estimated by the DNN were verified by laboratory testing results. Results revealed that GGBFS, mix grade, curing days, and alkali precursor are variables that govern the mechanical strengths of the GGBFS-CCA-GPC. Forecasting the mechanical properties of GPC produced using DNN shows that the relationship between the input and output arguments could be most accurately predicted by a 10–20–20–20-1 network topology, evident by approximately 99% correlation coefficient between the actual and predictive values for compressive and flexural strengths. However, the 10–17–17–17-1 network architecture showed the best DNN for predicting split tensile strength, with a 97% correlation coefficient between the actual and projected values. This study demonstrated that the DNN techniques are efficient in predicting the mechanical strengths of GPC based on the mix proportions.

Implementation of HCA to find the Displaced People in High Disaster Location with the support of Wireless Networks,"First off, both those uprooted by war and natural calamities go through extremely comparable human experiences. For instance, those who are relocated due to both flooding and warfare frequently lose family members, go through family division, lose their things, and suffer from stress and sadness. They both require support and protection. They misplace crucial papers, which prevents them from using public services. They lose property, and it can be years (or never) before they are paid for it. Vulnerable people suffer more during armed conflicts and natural calamities. For instance, 3–4 women pass away for every adult male who drowns in a flood worldwide.Children who have been uprooted due to a natural catastrophe or armed conflict are frequently more open to being enlisted in the military forces. Discrimination against vulnerable populations in the provision of aid is also common. Food is often given to strong, healthy males before it is given to children or people with disabilities in many of the camps where people who have been displaced by violence dwell, at least at first. Additionally, African-American neighborhoods, immigrants, and the elderly in New Orleans were disproportionately affected by Hurricane Katrina.Unfair access to aid, discrimination in aid delivery, forced relocation, sexual and gender-based violence, loss of documentation, enlisting children in the armed forces, unsafe or involuntary return or resettlement, and problems with property restitution are among the issues that people affected by the effects of natural disasters frequently face. These share characteristics with the issues faced by those who have been displaced by hostilities.Displacement is a common occurrence that reflects how vulnerable individuals are to dangers everywhere.

Dynamic Slice-Based Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation for UWSNs,"Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) are integral to marine exploration yet confront significant security concerns. In contrast to terrestrial WSNs, underwater acoustic channels are characterized by their constrained bandwidth, considerable propagation delays, and a higher bit error rate. These factors facilitate adversaries’ ability to intercept network transmissions and acquire sensitive data. Furthermore, the constraints of energy resources in UWSNs pose additional challenges in harmonizing privacy preservation with energy conservation. This study introduces a novel Privacy-Preserving Data Fusion Algorithm (DSPDA) tailored for UWSNs. The DSPDA circumvents the shortcomings of conventional privacy algorithms by employing dynamic sharding to minimize transmission demands and augment data fusion precision, which adjusts the size of data shards relative to nodal distances, thereby safeguarding confidentiality. Furthermore, it enhances network-wide energy optimization by aligning the energy consumption of cluster heads with their respective child nodes, thus averting disproportionate energy depletion and potential network dysfunction. Our simulation results demonstrate that the DSPDA algorithm notably diminishes communication overhead by approximately 37% in comparison to the SMART algorithm and delivers a further 20% efficiency improvement over the EEHA algorithm.",Not About Sufficiency

A Multicriteria Decision Analysis to Selection of Low-carbon Emitting Technologies under Joint Crediting Mechanism for Thailand's Carbon Neutrality 2050,"To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, Parties to the Paris Agreement agree to keep a global temperature rise well below 2-degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels within this century and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5-degrees Celsius. Thailand ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016 and pledged its first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Subsequently, Thailand's updated NDC 2022 intends to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30 percent from the projected business-as-usual (BAU) level by 2030. The level of contribution could increase up to 40 percent, subject to adequate and enhanced access to technology development and transfer, financial resources, and capacity building support of 40% emissions reduction in 2030 compared to its BAU. Presently, Thailand increases its ability to deal with the impacts of climate change and makes the updated NDC consistent with a low GHG emissions and climate-resilient pathways of the Paris Agreement. To reach the ambitious goals, appropriate mobilization and provision of financial resources need to be put in place. The Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) is an important initiative that facilitates collaboration between Japan and partner countries including Thailand to address GHG emissions reduction thru low-emission technologies. The JCM serves as a bridge for global climate action, promoting sustainable development while addressing climate challenges. The bilateral co-operation of JCM between Thailand and Japan was effective since October 13, 2015, and will be ended by December 2030. The JCM credits used to achieved Japan's NDC are based on the proportion of shared investments in the JCM projects. Japan may share the JCM investment as high as 50 percent.

Prediction of window opening behavior and its impact on HVAC energy consumption at a residential dormitory using Deep Neural Network,"Individuals globally spend about 88–92% of their entire time in the indoor environment. The implementation of regularly scheduled systems operation is common in many commercial and residential building types. Occupant Behavior (OB) is highly stochastic, making it difficult to depict the human factor using simple schedules. In the present work, window-opening tendencies were found to be highest in summer and transition seasons and lowest during winter. The Air Changes per Hour (ACH) value obtained from blower door testing was compared with the average ACH value obtained from the mass balance equation. These ACH values were imported to the EnergyPlus model. A three-hidden layered deep neural network was developed to predict the window's state at 16 residential dorms. The data was collected from August 2021 to May 2022 to train and test the DNN models. 48 windows’ operations were measured during this timeframe and 48 DNN models were created with an average accuracy of 96.71% and an average True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.9136. Bedroom windows were found to be more time-dependent than living room windows. Incorporating time components into the bedroom window opening models can increase the TPR by 0 to 6%. The models were then integrated into the Energy Plus simulation engine using the newly introduced Python API to simulate the total HVAC energy consumption during the occupied heating season of 2021–2022. The DNN coupled model predicts 16,350 kWh energy is lost through windows from eight homes in an occupied heating season.",Not About Sufficiency
Modelling the enablers of food supply chain for reduction in carbon footprint,"Reducing carbon footprints has become a pertinent global issue. The creation of carbon footprints is germane in the food supply chain owing to food-wastage. Food is a valuable commodity that not only quickly transforms to waste but also adversely impacts the environment. It leads to loss of labour hours, futile resources, unfed lives, lost profits and an increase in environmental hazards. With this backdrop, the present study aims to identify the key enablers which are crucial in diminishing the inefficiencies across the entire food supply chain. Interpretive structural modelling and matrix of cross-impact multiplications applied to classification techniques are used to understand the interdependence of the shortlisted enablers. The study provides holistic and practical insights to the stakeholders for improving the effectiveness of their firms by level partitioning the enablers as ‘givens’ (regulations and governance), ‘means’ (technology, financial implication, perishability, logistics and traceability) and ‘ends’ (inventory management, storage, collaboration, trust, hygiene, packaging and information sharing). The research findings will facilitate the strategic decision making regarding the reduction in the wastage of food thereby diminishing the level of carbon footprint creation. Apart from providing significant implications for the policymakers, the results also add the theoretical implications in the extant literature.",Not About Sufficiency

While traditionally used as a fertilizer or buried underground, incorporating this material into concrete production not only reduces cement usage and addresses environmental concerns but also enhances the mechanical properties of concrete. This research aims to investigate the predictive capabilities of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, including radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR), for estimating the compressive strength of concrete containing sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA). A dataset comprising 1819 data points from previous studies was collected, consisting of three main groups: 340 data of concrete with SCBA, 459 data of concrete without SCMs, and 1020 concrete data incorporating other supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs). The dataset was utilised in three different ways to evaluate the influence of data on model performance. Firstly, models were trained solely on SCBA data (Group A); subsequently, SCBA data was combined with concrete data without any SCMs (Group B); finally, the entire dataset was utilised (Group C). Statistical analysis revealed that the SVR model trained on SCBA data and the RBFNN model trained on group B data demonstrated the best results and accuracy. However, further refinement of the concrete without SCMs data in group B led to improved model performance, surpassing even that of the SVR model trained on group A data.",Not About Sufficiency

The heavy reliance of both developed and developing economies on mineral resource management (MRM) is an important aspect of the debate.Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-based financial management (FM) have transformed the day-to-day operations and management prospects of ecological resources. The present research examines the relationship between AI-based FMand MRM.The study has been done for the economy of the United States of America (USA) and the time ranges from the year 1980–2020.Firstly, the stationarity of the variables are checked using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF),Phillips-Perron (PP)and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) tests.The findings reveal that all the variables follow I(1). The BDS testing is employed for checking the non-linearity among the variables under consideration. The results verify the presence of nonlinearity. Then, the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach is used to find the asymmetric effect of FM on mineral resource rent(MRR). The findings provide evidence of an asymmetric relationship between FM and MRR. Such that the positive shock of FM is negatively related to MRR while a negative shock is positively related to MRR. Based on findings, the study suggests that the USA economy must redesign its mineral resource strategy to establish AI-based financial systems for improving MRM by assuring worker safety and efficiency in the mining industry, resulting in long-term growth.",Not About Sufficiency

Artificial intelligence-aided endoscopic in-line particle size analysis during the pellet layering process,"In this study, an artificial intelligence-based machine vision system was developed for in-line particle size analysis during the pellet layering process. Drug-layered pellets were produced by coating microcrystalline cellulose cores with an ibuprofen-containing layering liquid until the target drug content was achieved. Drug content increases with pellet size; therefore, particle size monitoring can ensure product safety and quality. The direct imaging system, consisting of a rigid endoscope, a light source, and a high-speed camera, provides real-time information about pellet size and layer uniformity, enabling timely intervention in the case of out-of-spec products. A convolutional neural network-based instance segmentation algorithm was employed to detect particles in focus, ensuring that pellet size could be accurately determined despite the dense flow of the particles. After training the model, the performance of the developed system was assessed by analysing the particle size distribution of pellet cores with variable sizes within the 250–850 μm size range. The endoscopic system was tested in-line at a larger scale during the drug layering of inert pellet cores. The particle size data acquired in real time with the endoscopic imaging system corresponded with the reference methods, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed machine vision-based method as a process analytical technology tool for in-line process monitoring.",Not About Sufficiency

A blockchain-based inventory system with lot size-dependent lead times and uncertain carbon footprints,"Securing visibility and dependable information from stakeholders poses a significant challenge for companies engaged in supply chain management. Timely and accurate information exchange is crucial for assessing factors such as carbon emissions and consumer demand. This paper explores the impact of digital and carbon reduction technologies on supply chain decisions, incorporating fuzzy logic and blockchain technology for enhanced decision-making. We specifically focus on a single buyer ordering from a vendor, where faulty items are promptly returned upon inspection. The lead time for the initial delivery includes both production and non-productive time, while successive deliveries only entail transportation time. The research employs intuitionistic triangular fuzzy numbers to represent all carbon factors and integrates blockchain technology to improve demand forecasting. The purpose is to determine the optimal strategies to minimize the carbon and joint total cost of the system. A solution methodology has been proposed for determining optimal strategies, illustrated through a numerical example. The optimal decisions are compared, both with and without blockchain, to validate the proposed model. The findings suggest that blockchain has a substantial impact on both optimal decision-making and the results of carbon reduction efforts. Sensitivity analysis reveals that a blockchain-based supply chain is both time- and cost-efficient, reduces costs and errors in data information, and efficiently shortens lead time in the network.",Not About Sufficiency

GLA-STDeepLab: SAR Enhancing Glacier and Ice Shelf Front Detection Using Swin-TransDeepLab With Global–Local Attention,"The understanding of glacier and ice shelf front changes is of paramount importance in analyzing their material balance and their significant contributions to global sea-level variations. Recently, the increasing availability of remote sensing images has provided ample data support for calving front detection. By combining massive amounts of data, deep learning techniques have demonstrated great potential in front extraction, as they can automatically generate task-specific features. In this study, in contrast to the traditional framework based on a pure convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, we propose a novel calving front detection network, global–local attention Swin-transformer-based DeepLabv3+ (GLA-STDeepLab), by incorporating the Swin-transformer module into DeepLabv3+ to enhance the modeling capability of long-range contextual dependencies. We also introduce global–local attention (GLA) mechanisms into the module, striving to foster interactions between the corresponding coarse and fine-grained feature maps. Through extensive experimentation on a diverse and challenging synthetic aperture radar (SAR) database, CaFFe, our network is shown to surpass the current state-of-the-art methods, achieving results with an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.94 and a mean distance error (MDE) of 473 ± 34 m.

Spatial variation of building energy consumption in Egypt based on high-resolution typical meteorological year data,"Building energy consumption is a crucial aspect of the construction industry, as it significantly impacts operational costs and environmental sustainability. This study investigates the spatial variations of cooling energy consumption in Egypt, enabling the identification of regions vulnerable to high energy demands. To this end, we utilize high-resolution typical meteorological year (TMY) data developed from the reanalysis ERA5 dataset. EnergyPlus was employed to simulate a small office building for 535 grid points representing populous regions in Egypt. The Sandia method was utilized to generate TMY data for the last 30 years (1991–2020). The results reveal that the demand for cooling energy in the southern regions could be almost 136 % higher than in the northern regions of Egypt. The temporal patterns reveal the adverse influence of climate change on the average cooling energy consumption, with the peak values in July and August. The deviation between the TMY-based and long-term energy consumption showed a good agreement in different grids, with R2 greater than 0.9 in all grids and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) ranging between 12 and 32.2 %. Furthermore, the paired t-test results show no significant difference between energy consumption derived from TMY data and long-term data across 95% of the studied grid points in Egypt, indicating that TMY data effectively represents long-term energy consumption trends.

Conducted in Vellore, India, it compares plain tubes (case 1) with grooved tubes (cases 2 and 3) using water and glycol-water mixtures. Results show that grooved tubes significantly improved efficiency, particularly with glycol-water mixtures. Efficiency increased by up to 12 % in transient flow conditions and by 8 %–20 % across various flow rates compared to plain tubes. A 5 % increase in solar radiation led to a 7 % rise in effectiveness. Heat removal factors ranged from 0.66 to 0.69 for water and 0.76–0.78 for glycol-water. Case 2 exhibited the highest efficiency under transient flow, while case 1 had the lowest under laminar flow conditions.

Artificial intelligence-enabled probabilistic load demand scheduling with dynamic pricing involving renewable resource,"Residential demand response is one of the key enabling technologies which plays an important role in managing the load demand of prosumers. However, the load scheduling problem becomes quite challenging due to the involvement of dynamic parameters and renewable energy resources. This work has proposed a bi-level load scheduling mechanism with dynamic electricity pricing integrated with renewable energy and storage system to overcome this problem. The first level involves the formulation of load scheduling and optimization problems as optimal stopping problems with the objective of energy consumption and delay cost minimization. This problem involved the real-time electricity pricing signal, customers load scheduling priority, machine learning (ML) based forecasted load demand, and renewable & storage unit profiles, which is solved using mathematical programming with branch-and-cut & branch-and-bound algorithms. Since the first-level optimization problem is formulated as a stopping problem, the optimal time slots are obtained using a one-step lookahead rule to schedule the load with the ability to handle the uncertainties. The second level is used to further model the load scheduling problem through the dynamic electricity pricing signal. The cost minimization objective function is then solved using the genetic algorithm (GA), where the input parameters are obtained from the first-level optimization solution. Furthermore, the impact of load prioritization in terms of time factor and electricity price is also modeled to allow the end-users to control their load. Analytical and simulation results are conducted using solar-home electricity data, Ausgrid, AUS to validate the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model can handle uncertainties involved in the load scheduling process along with a cost-effective solution in terms of cost and discomfort reduction.

Modeling energy consumption in next-generation wireless access-over-WDM networks with hybrid power sources,"Energy consumption is now one of the most important issues for network carriers, since the majority of the energy needed for their operation is consumed in the wireless access and optical transport networks. The continuous growth in the wireless customers and traffic volumes and the consequent energy demand on modern carriers’ broadband infrastructures require reconsidering their energy efficiency, by starting from the formulation of new, more complete and representative network models that should become the foundations for modern energy-aware control plane architectures. Accordingly, this work presents a novel comprehensive energy model for next-generation wireless access-over-optical-transport networks characterized by hybrid power systems (i.e., multiple dynamically available power sources). The objective is to identify the energy-related information that need to be handled at the control plane layer to support energy-aware networking practices. Such information can be made available to suitable energy-aware routing and wavelength assignment algorithms that may exploit them to optimize the overall network energy-consumption and reducing the associated carbon footprint.

Passive two-phase cooling of air circuit breakers in data center power distribution systems,"This work presents an experimental investigation of a two-phase looped thermosyphon design for cooling Air Circuit Breakers (ACBs) in switchgear used in data center power distribution systems. The FC72 charged thermosyphon is comprised of a bespoke evaporator that is fixed tightly to the copper adaptor of the ACB. Dielectric tubing connects the evaporator to a remote naturally aspirated and thin form factor condenser. Since both the working fluid and the connection tubing are dielectric, the thermosyphon provides electrical isolation between the ACB and the remote heat sink. The condenser is a thin serpentine channel with surface extensions and is cooled by natural convection and radiation to the ambient environment. Benchtop thermal performance tests were performed for increasing load power for two scenarios: for the stand-alone looped thermosyphon and for the case where copper bus bars are also fixed to the ACB adapter. For 60 W thermal power dissipation, a nominal operational condition, the thermal resistance of the looped thermosyphon system was determined to be 0.55 K/W without bus bars attached. With bus bars attached, this decreases to 0.42 K/W which results in a breaker to ambient temperature rise of about 25 K, which is significantly lower than operational limits of 85 K temperature rise. In-situ tests were then performed on a live ACB system carrying a 2000 A load and showed that the looped thermosyphon system was capable of decreasing the ambient temperature rise by 26 K, which is significant. The low thermal resistance of this passive cooling technology opens the opportunity for increased electrical service per breaker and/or a significant reduction in the volume of copper bus bars used with associated cost reduction of ACB technologies.",Not About Sufficiency
Deep learning based image classification for embedded devices: A systematic review,"Deep learning models are widely employed to solve complex problems in different areas, particularly for image classification, because of their high performance in pattern recognition tasks. The demand for image classification extends beyond traditional computing environments and often requires deployment of embedded and low-cost devices in real-world scenarios to meet low-latency applications and user requirements. Embedding deep learning in low-cost devices is challenging due to their constrained resources, whereas deep learning models require many resources. In the literature, there are different approaches to make this embedding viable, such as reducing model complexity or improve system efficiency. Understanding these particularities is essential for proposing new low-cost model-embedding methods.

Non-invasive cyber-physical system for data center management,"We present a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) designed to improve the efficiency of Cloud Data Centers.

Starting from the empirical characterization of the energy harvesting module, we determine the amount of energy that can be harvested from a CPU heat dissipation while performing different tasks. We then analyze the amount of energy required to supply the low power sensors or to actuate the cooling fan. The CPS exploits a software simulator of the network of smart heat-sinks to predict the status of the devices. The simulator works in conjunction with a management algorithm used to administrate the cloud infrastructure and the network of smart heat-sinks for pursuing global objectives, i.e., maximizing the power efficiency of the data center, while keeping the wireless sensing network alive.

A Framework for Understanding Circular Economy Monitoring: Insights from the Automotive Industry,"The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have paved the way toward a more sustainable future. The 2019 EU Green Deal and the 2020 EU Circular Economy Action Plan [1] introduce laws and regulations to facilitate and encourage the transition towards sustainability and a circular economy (CE). For the implementation of these regulatory measures, public authorities face the challenge to gain access to relevant business data for compliance monitoring. Digital infrastructures and access to business data (sources) such as the material composition of products are useful for compliance monitoring, however CE-relevant data is spread across multiple platforms of the supply chain partners and across multiple supply chains. Therefore, digital infrastructures and information-sharing arrangements need to be developed to create visibility and traceability for monitoring the circular economy flows. In this paper, we use a conceptual framework with four dimensions (context, actors, public value, and digital infrastructures) to analyze key actors and potential data of value they hold in their digital infrastructures to explore options for data-sharing solutions. By focusing predominantly on the actor dimension, we analyze a case study in the automotive industry, taking the perspective of two focal Dutch governmental actors: Customs and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management. In our analysis, we also show how this actor dimension is linked to the other dimensions: context, public value, and digital infrastructures.

Border Crossing and Circular Economy Monitoring in a Global Context: Challenges and Opportunities,"Circular economy (CE) and sustainability are high on the political agenda of governments nationally and internationally. We see different regulatory developments where governments aim to put stricter rules and requirements towards businesses to ensure the transition toward a more circular and sustainable future. The use of digital infrastructures, including transparency systems and digital product passports is starting to play a vital role in supporting governments in their CE monitoring efforts. Yet there are challenges to be overcome. Many government procedures are set up in laying out very detailed requirements about what one government agency can do in a singular phase of the circular process (e.g., customs performing specific checks at the border) or a single Member State (e.g., organizing Extended Producer Responsibility in a specific country). While these efforts are valuable building stones towards CE monitoring, they are fragmented, and blank spots in CE monitoring occur when borders are crossed, and another country needs to take over the CE monitoring tasks. As for circularity, even if many efforts are spent by a single government agency or a single country, all these efforts may be in vain if the proper CE monitoring of the next step is not secured. While earlier research identified this problem, there is still limited understanding of the problem itself and directions to address it systematically. In this paper, following up on earlier research and with insights gained from an EU project on CE monitoring, we shed further light on the problem. More specifically we conceptualize CE monitoring by putting the CE flows at the center and exploring deficiencies for governments and businesses to safeguard the monitoring of CE flows. We examine two routes that can be followed to ensure continued CE monitoring when borders are crossed, namely the government route, as well as the business route (enabled by traceability systems and in-control mechanisms of businesses). We discuss the need for a global governance layer that can facilitate both routes and propose further directions to advance CE monitoring by taking a global perspective.",Not About Sufficiency

The building sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) consumes about 75% of total electrical energy. KSA has experienced an unprecedented energy consumption in the last decade. This is due to the country’s rapid population growth and urbanization, which in turn put more pressures on the kingdom’s natural resources. However, KSA is committed to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies to achieve the goals of sustainability development, as part of its Vision 2030. This paper therefore explores various green building solutions, especially in hot-arid regions, with the aim of reaching ZEB, and at the same time minimizing potential adverse environmental impacts. In order to verify proposed solutions, energy simulation software (Integrated Environmental Solution-IES) is used, along with reviews of related work. The major finding of this paper reveals that several green building concepts are crucial to the design and operation of a building in hot dry region, including thermal mass; daylight; natural ventilation; cavity wall; double-glazing and solar panels (PV). Bear in mind that the operation of a building has to be powered by a Building Management System (BMS). This paper also proposes an auxiliary holistic framework that explains how green practices such as Zero Energy Buildings (ZEBs) can be achievable in Saudi Arabia with no harm to its local environment.",Not About Sufficiency
Is the Whole lesser than its Parts? Breaking an Aggregation based Privacy aware Metering Algorithm,"Smart metering is a mechanism through which fine-grained electricity usage data of consumers is collected periodically in a smart grid. However, a growing concern in this regard is that the leakage of consumers' consumption data may reveal their daily life patterns as the state-of-the-art metering strategies lack adequate security and privacy measures. Many proposed solutions have demonstrated how the aggregated metering information can be transformed to obscure individual consumption patterns without affecting the intended semantics of smart grid operations. In this paper, we expose a complete break of such an existing privacy preserving metering scheme [10] by determining individual consumption patterns efficiently, thus compromising its privacy guarantees. The underlying methodol-ogy of this scheme allows us to - i) retrieve the lower bounds of the privacy parameters and ii) establish a relationship between the privacy preserved output readings and the initial input readings. Subsequently, we present a rigorous experimental validation of our proposed attacking methodology using real-life dataset to highlight its efficacy. In summary, the present paper queries: Is the Whole lesser than its Parts? for such privacy aware metering algorithms which attempt to reduce the information leakage of aggregated consumption patterns of the individuals.",Not About Sufficiency
A review of the legislative landscape and refrigeration market for introducing an energy efficiency standards and labeling program for refrigeration appliances in Uganda,"Uganda's poor grid connectivity and high utility prices have forced its users to reduce appliance usage to save energy costs. In such a scenario, energy efficiency programs can greatly help end users to lower energy bills while increasing energy usage in appliances. The authors are providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD), Uganda, on the design of energy efficiency standards and labeling programs for residential refrigeration products in Uganda. Refrigeration appears to be the largest source of residential energy consumption in Uganda (~200 Gigawatt-hours per year) (GWh/year), which represents about 28% of the electricity consumption in the residential sector. Existing opportunities for energy efficiency in refrigerators can reduce per-unit energy use by as much as 60% in developing countries with unregulated markets dominated by inefficient refrigerators. The improved energy efficiency of refrigeration also contributes to achieving the United Nations sustainable development goals such as Climate Action and Access to Affordable and Clean Energy, which have been adopted by Uganda. The authors discuss the steps for creating a database of models sold in Uganda to estimate the baseline energy consumption of this equipment. They also present a literature review of the existing legal framework and administrative and enforcement capacities in Uganda and its neighboring countries, Rwanda and Kenya. Lessons learned from the neighboring countries will be used to address challenges in Uganda's existing legislative and administrative capabilities and to publish and enforce standards. The paper concludes by highlighting the role of these aspects in designing energy efficiency standards for residential refrigeration products in Uganda",Not About Sufficiency
Adoption of energy consumption in urban mobility considering digital carbon footprint: A two-phase interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy dominance methodology,"Interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets play a significant role in modelling decision-making problems with incomplete information more accurately than intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Various decision-making methods have been introduced for the different classes IFSs. In this study, we aim to introduce a novel two-phase interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy dominance method which suits the decision-making problems modelled under the IVFFS environment well and study its applications in the adoption of energy consumption in Urban mobility considering digital carbon footprint. The proposed method considers the importance and performance of one alternative with respect to all others, which is not the case with many available decision-making algorithms introduced in the literature. Transportation is one of the most significant sources of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Numerous potential remedies are proposed to reduce the quantity of GHG generated by transportation activities, including regulatory measures and public transit digitalization initiatives. Decision-makers, however, should consider the digital carbon footprint of such projects. This study proposes three alternatives for reducing GHG emissions from transportation activities: incremental adoption of digital technologies to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gases, disruptive digitalization technologies in urban mobility, and redesign of urban mobility using regulatory approaches and economic instruments. The proposed novel two-phase interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy dominance method will be utilized to rank these alternative projects in order of advantage. First, the problem is converted into a multi-criterion group decision-making problem. Then a novel two-phase interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy dominance method is designed and developed to rank the alternatives. The importance and advantage of the proposed two-phase method over other existing methods are discussed by using sensitivity and comparative analysis. The results indicate that rethinking urban mobility through governmental policies and economic tools is the least advantageous choice, while incremental adoption of digital technologies is the most advantageous.",Not About Sufficiency

Moreover, economic globalization insignificantly impacts clean energy consumption. On the contrary, financial development in OECD countries significantly leads to a decrease in the consumption of clean energy because renewable energy projects are long-term and more expensive than non-renewable energy generation projects. This paper further discovers that the majority of the governance measures significantly and positively moderate the connection of environmental regulations with clean energy consumption. Consequently, constructive governance measures facilitate the effective implementation of environmental regulations in OECD countries eventually increasing the consumption of clean energy instead of non-renewable energy. To reduce GHG emissions in the environment, the government should encourage the usage of clean energy in their respective countries. Therefore, policymakers promote the practice of clean energy consumption through stringent environmental regulations and effective governance measures.",Not About Sufficiency

Monitoring Power Data: A first step towards a unified energy efficiency evaluation toolset for HPC data centers,"The energy consumption of High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, which are the key technology for many modern computation-intensive applications, is rapidly increasing in parallel with their performance improvements. This increase leads HPC data centers to focus on three major challenges: the reduction of overall environmental impacts, which is driven by policy makers; the reduction of operating costs, which are increasing due to rising system density and electrical energy costs; and the 20 MW power consumption boundary for Exascale computing systems, which represent the next thousandfold increase in computing capability beyond the currently existing petascale systems. Energy efficiency improvements will play a major part in addressing these challenges. This paper presents a toolset, called Power Data Aggregation Monitor (PowerDAM), which collects and evaluates data from all aspects of the HPC data center (e.g. environmental information, site infrastructure, information technology systems, resource management systems, and applications). The aim of PowerDAM is not to improve the HPC data center's energy efficiency, but is to collect energy relevant data for analysis without which energy efficiency improvements would be non-trivial and incomplete. Thus, PowerDAM represents a first step towards a truly unified energy efficiency evaluation toolset needed for improving the overall energy efficiency of HPC data centers.",Not About Sufficiency

Optimizing Nile Tilapia growth and production costs in earthen ponds using multi-objective adaptive artificial intelligence systems,"The rising global demand for Nile tilapia necessitates innovative production strategies to address food security challenges and drive economic growth in aquaculture. Optimizing tilapia yields, especially in earthen ponds, is crucial but often hindered by inefficiencies like overfeeding and suboptimal stocking densities, escalating costs and environmental concerns. Traditional aquaculture approaches frequently fail to balance operational expenditures, environmental sustainability, and fish health due to an overreliance on single-factor analyses, overlooking the complex interplay between multiple variables.

Can new metrics be validated to reduce computer supply chain GHG emissions among end users?,"The research objective is to create a mechanism that generates a valid 'sustainability' metric to enable prospective buyers to confidently identify low carbon footprint computers. The necessity is based upon the hypothesis that current product carbon footprint reports for computers are incomparable between brands. While the inconsistency of use-phase emissions has been addressed in prior associated research, supply chain emissions remain an issue. This is due to multiple scope 3 life cycle assessment methodologies being used by manufacturers that produce differing results even when applied to the same device. To test the theory and generate an alternative approach, the research analyses 244 notebook carbon footprint reports to show inconsistencies caused by five different methodologies. Based on the findings, an alternative approach to comparing supply chain impact is proposed that enables comparison between results. The new metric first generates an average scope 3 carbon footprint baseline value by device type (e.g. notebook). This is then reduced by specific values depending upon actions undertaken by manufacturers when calculating their original carbon footprint report. This includes deductions to the baseline value achieved by including high percentages of production and transport primary data, plus the availability and affordability of offerings that will extend device useful life spans to drive demand displacement. This includes warranty duration and cost plus ease of repair. The research finds that current methodologies create a range of inconsistency of +106% when used to calculate the carbon footprint of the same device and +142% when calculating similar device types. Therefore, the hypothesis of scope 3 emissions being incomparable is validated. Comparatively, the newly proposed mechanism shows a reduced range of inconsistency of 18% when demonstrated. As such, it is recommended that the new approach be applied to the latest version of the world's leading computer eco-label certification, TCO Certified version 10, in 2024. Doing so will enable organisations to confidently select low carbon footprint devices on a global scale and therefore meaningfully support the United Nations sustainable development goals of responsible consumption and production and ultimately climate action.",Not About Sufficiency

Hardware-in-the-loop Towards Frequency Regulation Service by HVACs with Real-time Digital Simulator,"The carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals bring a rapid expansion of renewable energies, such as photovoltaic power and wind power. However, the output power of renewable energies is intermittent which may bring frequency deviation problems. The regulation ability of traditional generators may be insufficient to handle the frequency deviations since the great scale of renewable energies is replacing traditional power generators. With the development of communication technologies, demand response acquires more attention. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are suitable for demand response because they occupy a large portion of energy consumption and have huge regulation potential. Moreover, HVAC systems’ power consumption is flexible and adjustable by using the thermal storage feature of the buildings. When turning off the air conditioner or adjusting the set temperature, customers’ comfortable indoor temperatures can be maintained. However, considering the complexity and large scale of the power system, most previous studies on HVACs’ frequency regulation are verified only by simulation tools, e.g., MATLAB and Simulink. This study investigates the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) towards frequency regulation service by HVACs with RTDS. The HIL platform is implemented in the case of frequency regulation in a high photovoltaic power penetrated campus grid. The scenario is designed with a building thermal model based on the quantized architecture characteristic parameter which is considered the part of HVAC operation model.",Not About Sufficiency
Examining the Potential of Micro-Aerial Vehicles for Tree Inspections as Climate Change Education Tools,"Our research objective is to examine the impact of aerial tree inspections with micro-aerial vehicles (in short: micro drones) on students' climate education. Climate change threatens the health and survival of trees and forests. Aerial tree inspections represent an important climate change education approach to explain the urgency of climate change adaptation and climate solutions to draw down greenhouse gases. They are also useful tools to appreciate the technical components of micro drones such as external proximity sensors for obstacle avoidance, the fully enclosed propulsion system that allows flight inside dense jungle canopy or the macro-focused high-definition video feed with onboard 10W illumination so that dark areas can be inspected. With such a system, arborists no longer need to manually climb and scale trees. Our research goal is to examine the impact of climate education with micro-aerial vehicles for tree inspections on achieving important learning outcomes such as catalyzing students' climate change awareness and action. We regard micro drones as quality climate change teaching & learning tools that can improve students' engagement with climate change and increase their capacity to adapt to climate change by enhancing sustainability-related competencies and motivating them towards more pro-environmental, carbon offsetting behavior in the context of climate action.",Not About Sufficiency

Integrating circular economy and life cycle assessment strategies in climate-resilient buildings: An artificial intelligence approach to enhance thermal comfort and minimize CO2 emissions in Iran,"Climate change is a significant threat to humanity and must be addressed in building design. This study introduces a novel framework that integrates Circular Economy (CE) principles into the design of residential buildings, addressing not only operational energy but also embodied carbon emissions, material reuse, and end-of-life strategies. By extending the focus beyond operational performance, it bridges the gap between lifecycle sustainability and architectural design, offering actionable insights for achieving environmentally and economically efficient buildings. This study investigates the integration of circular economy (CE) principles to enhance thermal comfort and reduce CO2 equivalent emissions in residential buildings in Iran from 2021 to 2022. A multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN) was developed and validated using performance metrics, including mean square error (MSE) and the coefficient of correlation (R), achieving high accuracy with MSE = 0.39e−2 MWh and R values of 0.9974, 0.99854, and 0.99886 for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Using Grasshopper software with Ladybug and Honeybee plugins, four residential building plans were simulated, and the best design solution (BS) demonstrated an 8 %–12 % increase in PMV and a 21 %–26 % reduction in thermal load across different zones compared to the worst solution (WS).

Artificial intelligence assisted technoeconomic optimization scenarios of hybrid energy systems for water management of an isolated community,"Water is an essential resource demanded worldwide and it is quite debatable owing to the economic, political, and energy characteristics of any region. Off-grid water filtration plants are an alternative for communities where transportation of freshwater becomes a real challenge due to a lack of infrastructure for the water potabilization processes. For such potable water filtration plants, hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) can be a viable solution to meet their energy demand meanwhile providing a sustainable water solution. The main contribution of this work is the unique methodology, which starts with a sizing procedure of various hybrid energy systems using a commercial software “Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER)” and spreadsheet algorithms, followed by a “Non-dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)” based multiobjective optimization. Single-objective optimization scenarios contain photovoltaic installation capacity, wind turbines, diesel generators, and battery energy storage systems including Pb-acid (Lead-acid), Li-ion (Lithium-ion), and AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) technologies as design variables to maximize the cost of electricity or net-present-cost. Multiobjective optimization also involved environmental (CO2 emissions i.e. carbon dioxide emissions) and water cost indices as an additional packet to single-objective optimization scenarios. Afterward, a multicriteria decision-making tool using “The Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” is applied on the Pareto front to attain the final optimization results. The analysis is further explored in depth by generating digital twins (surrogate or meta model) of HRES data using artificial intelligence techniques (artificial neural network and group-method-of-data-handling). Furthermore, calculus and statistical sensitivity analysis assist in the identification of the significant variables in the design procedure. In summary, the technical contribution of this work can be divided into two sections. The first one is the design of a hybrid energy system for the water management of an isolated community of the indigenous Mayan region of Yucatan, Mexico, which has never been considered before. Secondly, the technical contribution is related to the usage of environmental emissions as an objective function, which is not considered in the traditional design of hybrid energy systems by the software HOMER. Environmental emission as an objective function is not considered while designing a hybrid energy system in commerical softwares like HOMER, in fact, HOMER provides a list of environmental impacts but it is a secondary outcome as a result of technoeconomic optimization. Analysis of results between HOMER pro and spreadsheet has shown conformity, reporting that the optimal case consists of a photovoltaic system, diesel generator, and Li-ion technology of battery storage with capacities of ∼17 kW, ∼5kW, and 44–48 kWh, respectively, corresponding to a net present cost ranging from 70,000 United States Dollars (USD) to 79,000 USD and a cost of electricity ranging from 0.205 to 0.229 USD/kWh. The achievements obtained with multiobjective optimization indicate that the cost of electricity and net present cost can be further reduced by 0.86 % and 0.73 %, respectively, at a decrement of only 0.4% of the renewable fraction as compared to the single objective optimization scenario. It is concluded that multiobjective optimization provides an add-in feature to HOMER by using environmental emissions as an objective function. The design procedure and adapted methodology can be useful to promote sustainable development in the statewide context and can provide a scientific justification to national energy policymakers.",Not About Sufficiency
Digital twin models for optimization and global projection of building-integrated solar chimney,"Current research on solar chimneys has focused on developing regression-based empirical models, which might not be correct enough compared to the soft computing tools i.e., techniques of artificial intelligence. Current research has also published the search algorithm-based single-objective optimization of solar chimneys, whereas the latest genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimization can be more useful for decision-making purposes. Current research has also not focused on the macro or global impact of the usage of solar chimneys in context with the energy, economic, environmental, social, and political framework of the world. This research fills these gaps by the development of a digital twin model of the solar chimney using a multivariate regression model based on the least square method and an artificial intelligence (AI) method based on multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) and their comparison. A multiobjective optimization study along with the application of Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to optimize the geometric dimensions of the solar chimney considering four different climatic zones using an elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to maximize the number of air changes per hour, energy efficiency, and specific environmental influence. The results have shown that the statistical performance indicators like the coefficient of regression, etc., are higher for the MLP-ANN technique as compared to the multivariate regression method, thus, the AI technique is preferred. Comparison of optimization results with the base case condition has shown that the number of air changes can be improved between ∼71% and 87%. The global projection has demonstrated that the integration of solar chimneys in low-income countries with high air-conditioners installation rates must be necessary. It is also recommended to use solar chimneys in high-income countries for the renovation of the existing built environment to decrease the energy intensity of the building sector.",Not About Sufficiency

Towards identifying policies for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7, 9, and 13, energy end-use efficiency issues within one hundred (100) manufacturing SMEs were empirically analyzed. Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) technique was used to select the firms based on recent framing of enterprises by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN). The study utilized structured questionnaires and interviews to capture cross-sectional data. The research identified some enablers of energy end-use efficiency in the companies. Factors identified equipment/appliance selection, capital and financial incentives, information and technical capacity, management commitment, smart manufacturing, and government policy or legislation. Contrary to the view in existing studies, the outcome of the study shows a strong awareness of energy end-use efficiency among 93.81% of the sampled firms. We recommend the roles of relevant stakeholders and some strategic measures essential for the improvement of energy end-use efficiency in SMEs towards decarbonizing the industrial sector and achieving sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency

Oil and gas in the ocean-international environmental law and policy,"The aim of this paper is to analyze the current international regulation of exploration and exploitation of gas and oil in the ocean in order to provide legal recommendations to preserve marine biodiversity and to prevent climate change in oceans. Offshore oil and gas exploration has been increasing worldwide in the last years and is taking place in deeper waters and extreme environments. Impacts on the environment include, impact on fish stocks and mammals during seismic surveys, emissions through gas flaring, operative pollution derived from daily activity such as discharge of substances and accidental pollution. From the environmental point of view, the ""offshore"" oil and gas exploration and exploitation may be divided into two stages. First, the stage previous to the installation of the structures that I will denominate ‘preventive-precautionary stage’, where the security aspects and all the preventive-precautionary tools introduced by Environmental law as environmental impact assessment, monitoring, participation of citizens shall be applied in order to avoid environmental damage. If environmental law tools are not appropriately applied during this stage, the second stage, liability and reparation for environmental damage will follow. The essential results show that there is no international convention in force regarding the issue; however, there have been several attempts to achieve this objective. Two accidents, the first one a blow-out occurred in 2009 on the Montara well situated in the Australian EEZ which affected the cost of Indonesia and the other one in 2010, in the Deepwater Horizon highlighted again the need of a sustainable regulation of the topic. In 2012 the Comité Maritime International (CMI) constituted again a Sub-Group of study of the topic and in 2013, after the request of the Indonesian delegation the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed to analyze the topic. IMO conclusion was that there is no need for an international agreement, but that bilateral or regional agreements shall be reached. As there is no global convention devoted to the subject, I will study the United Nations Law Convention on the Law of the Sea (‘UNCLOS, 1982’) applicable provisions and several maritime and environmental international conventions in force in order to determine if they are applicable to offshore structures; namely, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (‘UNFCC, 1992’) and the Convention on Biological Biodiversity (‘CBD, 1982’). In relation to this Convention, we I will also study the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, specially target 11. As regards maritime conventions, I will analyze among others, the Protocol Relating to the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (including Annexes, Final Act and 1973 International Convention) (‘MARPOL 73/78’), the 1996 Protocol to the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matters (‘LC 1972 and LC PROT 1996’), the 1992 Protocol to Amend the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (‘CLC 1992’), the 1990 International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation (‘OPRC 1990’), the 2001 International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (‘Bunkers Convention’), the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (‘Hong Kong Convention’) and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (‘SOLAS 1974’). I will also study applicable regional agreements such as the Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution resulting from Exploration and Exploitation of the Continental Shelf and the Seabed and its Subsoil (‘Offshore Protocol’) to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean (‘Barcelona Convention’) and private agreements, such as Offshore Pollution Liability Agreement (‘OPOL’). Moreover, I will analyze soft law instruments such as Rio Declaration, Agenda 21, and Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 14. I conclude that enacting an international convention regarding the topic negotiated with the support of IMO, UNEP and IUCN is a priority in spite of opinions on the contrary in order to mark uniformity and based in UNCLOS Sections 194 (1) and 205 (8). A strong global political will is necessary in order to achieve this aim. This international convention shall cover both fixed and mobile structures and not only compensation issues, but also application of the precautionary principle. Meanwhile, exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in the ocean is regulated by different conventions and soft law, one of its application for instance is that the relevant coastal states shall apply for ""Areas-to-be-Avoided"", Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSA) and Special Areas (SA) to identify no-go zones and discharge restrictions.",Not About Sufficiency
Capstone: Mobility Modeling on Smartphones to Achieve Privacy by Design,"Sharing location traces with context-aware service providers has privacy implications. Location-privacy preserving mechanisms, such as obfuscation, anonymization and cryptographic primitives, have been shown to have impractical utility/privacy tradeoff. Another solution for enhancing user privacy is to minimize data sharing by executing the tasks conventionally carried out at the service providers' end on the users' smartphones. Although the data volume shared with the untrusted entities is significantly reduced, executing computationally demanding server-side tasks on resource-constrained smartphones is often impracticable. To this end, we propose a novel perspective on lowering the computational complexity by treating spatiotemporal trajectories as space-time signals. Lowering the data dimensionality facilitates offloading the computational tasks onto the digital-signal processors and the usage of the non-blocking signal-processing pipelines. While focusing on the task of user mobility modeling, we achieve the following results in comparison to the state of the art techniques: (i) mobility models with precision and recall greater than 80%, (ii) reduction in computational complexity by a factor of 2.5, and (iii) reduction in power consumption by a factor of 0.5.

The current paper introduces the integrated framework of nano-engineered materials that comprises nano-silica, graphene oxide (GO), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) along with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods in the predictive modeling and optimization of high-performance concrete (HPC). The Machine Learning (ML) models consisting of Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) were implemented to predict compressive and tensile strengths, elastic modulus, and durability metrics such as chloride penetration and sulfate resistance sets. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS), improved model interpretability and performance sets. Optimization of mix designs was carried out using bio-inspired algorithms, namely Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to balance mechanical performance, material efficiency, and environmental sustainability. The results suggest strength improvement up to 15% and durability up to 30% while reducing cement content and associated carbon emissions.

How occupant positioning systems can be applied to help historic residences manage energy consumption: A case study in China,"Historic residences often suffer from low energy efficiency due to inadequate management and obsolete infrastructure. To ensure these buildings operate in an environmentally friendly manner, intelligent energy control and management are necessary. Accurate indoor user positioning is fundamental to realizing occupant-centric controls. However, historic dwellings, with architectural heritage preservation requirements and diverse operational modes, present multiple challenges in terms of occupant monitoring and energy management. This research proposes a BLE positioning system based on the SAE-CNN algorithm to realize the analysis and prediction of occupant locations in a cost-effective and minimally-intrusive manner.

Moreover, the power usage effectiveness (PUE) of SPIC systems decreases by 20.8 % and 17.6 % compared to forced air cooling and water cooling plate solutions, respectively. The dynamic viscosity of oil coolants has the greatest impact on the SPIC performance. Moreover, high-viscosity silicone oil increases the flow resistance of SPIC systems and weakens the convective heat transfer capability between the coolant and components. By ensuring safe operation, increasing the inlet temperature of oil coolants reduces flow resistance losses and enhances heat transfer capacity.

Improving Data Center Energy Efficiency Using a Cyber-physical Systems Approach: Integration of Building Information Modeling and Wireless Sensor Networks,"The increase in data center operating costs is driving innovation to improve their energy efficiency. Previous research has investigated computational and physical control intervention strategies to alleviate the competition between energy consumption and thermal performance in data center operation. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing a cyber-physical systems (CPS) approach to innovatively integrate building information modeling (BIM) and wireless sensor networks (WSN). In the proposed framework, wireless sensors are deployed strategically to monitor thermal performance parameters in response to runtime server load distribution.

The approach employs adaptive boosting to enhance decision tree regression (DTR) and support vector regression (SVR), resulting in a robust predictive framework. The models used key material features, including fly ash concentration, fine and coarse aggregates, superplasticizer, curing temperature, and alkali activator levels. These features were tested across three configurations (Combo-1, Combo-2, Combo-3) to determine optimal predictor combinations, with Combo-3 consistently yielding the highest predictive accuracy. The performance of the developed models was assessed based on standard metric indicators like mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual CO2-FP. Results demonstrated that the Adaboost-DTR model with Combo-3 configuration achieved the best performance metrics during testing (CC = 0.9665; NSE = 0.9343), outperforming both standalone and other ensemble models. The findings underscore the value of feature selection and boosting techniques in accurately estimating CO2 emissions for sustainable construction applications.

Incremental Benefits of Green Building Energy Efficiency Model Based on Apriori Algorithm,"China is a major energy consumer, accounting for 21.5% of the world’s total energy consumption. Therefore, building an energy-saving society is an inevitable development direction. In the “13th Five Year Plan” development goals, China clearly proposed the “green” development concept, with addressing climate change, environmental change, and green sustainable development as the core for research. The construction industry is an industry with high energy consumption, consistent with the national development goals, and advocating “developing green buildings” has become a hot topic and inevitable trend. Previously, in the study of cost effectiveness of green buildings, attention has been paid to the research and application of relevant general specifications and standards, and corresponding green building technologies. More attention has been paid to cost effectiveness evaluation methods. Among the “four savings and one environmental protection” proposed by green buildings, the incremental cost of energy conservation accounted for approximately 47%. However, there are few studies on the direct economic benefits of energy conservation, especially the lack of direct economic accounting and analysis of the increased costs and benefits, making it difficult to fully demonstrate the economic feasibility of green buildings. Therefore, many relevant objects such as governments, developers, and consumers cannot have an objective and accurate understanding of green buildings, which to some extent hinders the development, utilization, and promotion of green buildings in China in the future.

Bandwidth-aware energy efficient flow scheduling with SDN in data center networks,"Nowadays the energy consumption has become one of the most urgent issues for Data center networks. For general network devices, the power is constant and independent from the actual transfer rate. Therefore the network devices are energy efficient when they are in full workload. The flow scheduling methods based on the exclusive routing can reduce the network energy consumption, as the exclusive routing paths can fully utilize all their links. However, these methods will no longer guarantee the energy efficiency of switches, as they handle flows in priority order by greedily choosing the path of available links instantaneously. In a previous work we proposed an extreme case of flow scheduling based on both link and switch utilization. Herein we consider general scenarios in data center networks and propose a novel energy efficient flow scheduling and routing algorithm in SDN. This method minimizes the overall energy for data center traffic in time dimension, and increases the utilization of switches and meet the flow requirements such as deadline.

As a national pilot zone for ecological conservation and the free trade zone with a tropical coastal climate in China, Hainan is expected to present distinctive patterns in the ecoenvironment evolution. In this article, with multisource remote-sensing observations, we generated the long-term remote-sensing ecological index to interpret the spatiotemporal patterns and mechanisms for the diurnal and seasonal ecoenvironment, to detect the interaction between the urbanization and ecoenvironment, and to evaluate the development status of EEQ in Hainan. The results showed contrasting evolution of EEQ in the diurnal cycle, especially in the dry season.

On the other hand, the deterioration of nighttime EEQ was mainly driven by heat, explaining a 44% decline. Climate factors had a more significant impact on the evolution of EEQ compared with human activities’ factors.

"Building-information-modeling enabled life cycle assessment, a case study on carbon footprint accounting for a residential building in China","Building Information Modeling (BIM) is regarded as a potential vehicle to tremendously improve the information flow throughout the life cycle of a building. The integration of BIM and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has potential to reduce the time for life cycle inventory, and at the same time, substantially improve the representativeness of the LCA results for the specific building design. The latter merit is not trivial. For instance, due to time limit, most building LCA studies estimate the building materials and fuels consumed in construction phase quite roughly, which excludes the choices on a wide range of construction techniques, materials, specialties and machines, no need to mention the energy consumption in operation phase, which is usually estimated in an even bolder manner. The roughness of the LCA practice undermines its credibility and hinders its application as a decision supporting tool for low carbon design. Currently, China's Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector is undergoing a smart transformation, steered by the increased use of BIM. This paper presents a BIM-enabled LCA method and illustrates how the method can be used to facilitate the low carbon design under the circumstance of the smart AEC transition in China. A case study on carbon footprint accounting for a residential building is conducted. In this study, various software tools and data sources are combined to enhance the data flow and interoperability between BIM models and LCA models. BIM tools are used to create the BIM model, calculate the inputs (materials, construction machines, energies, water and so on) of on-site construction process and simulate the energy consumption of building operation. The eBalance, a China's local LCA software tool is applied to build the LCA model. The Chinese Life Cycle Database is used as the main data source (72.73%) to calculate the carbon footprint of the given building while the Ecoinvent database and European Life Cycle Database act as supplementary. The results show that the carbon footprint of the building is 2993 kg CO2eq/m2. The operation phase contributes to 69% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, while the building material production contributes to 24%. Concrete is the most used building material, which accounts for 82% of mass but contributes to only 44% of the material related GHG emission. Although steel and aluminum account for only 2.6% and 1.4% of mass, they contribute to 28% and 17% GHG emission, respectively. Through BIM-enable LCA modeling, the potential life cycle environmental performance of the buildings can be assessed in detail. This makes the LCA not only more accessible but also more credible for the AEC professionals to use it as a guide for the low carbon design of buildings.",Not About Sufficiency

On the algorithm side, ECoMS system proposes a featherlight edge-based computer vision framework for vehicle detection, tracking, and features selection process in a real-time manner.

The transesterification process was modeled using artificial intelligence approach viz. artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) while optimization of the operating variables (temperature, catalyst loading, time and molar ratio) was performed by interfacing the developed models with ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. The closeness of coefficient of determination (R2) to unity and low mean square error (MSE) indicated that the methanolysis of UCO was adequately described by the developed models with ANFIS model (R2 = 0.9997 and MSE = 0.1271) superior to ANN model (R2 = 0.9953 and MSE = 2.0762). The highest UCOME yield of 99.45 ± 0.51 wt% was achieved with ANFIS-ACO under the condition; reaction temperature (72.97 °C), methanol/UCO molar ratio (7.14:1), reaction time (131.97 min) and catalyst dosage (5.39 wt%). The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that all the operating variables influence UCOME yield, and none could be discarded. The CaO-Zel-800 catalyst was reused for five consecutive reaction cycles, and its activity only decreased by about 12%.",Not About Sufficiency
Random projection data perturbation based privacy protection in WSNs,"Wireless sensor networks are responsible for sensing, gathering and processing the information of the objects in the network coverage area. Basic data fusion technology generally does not provide data privacy protection mechanism, and the privacy protection mechanism in health care, military reconnaissance, smart home and other areas of the application is usually indispensable.

Multitiered Reversible Data Privacy Protection Scheme for IoT Based on Compression Sensing and Digital Watermarking,"Privacy preservation and low-cost data processing have become two critical issues in the era of Internet of Things (IoT) due to the widespread deployment of lightweight smart surveillance and sensors. In this article, we propose a multitiered reversible data privacy preservation system based on compressive sensing (CS) and watermarking. The system anonymizes the region of interest (ROI) using an obfuscation matrix while compressing and encrypting the entire document. CS provides the first-tier encryption for data documents, and the obfuscation matrix provides the second-tier encryption for sensitive parts of data documents. The system offers a multitiered privacy protection scheme where restricted-authorized users can only access nonsensitive data while fully authorized users can access the entire document. To implement the reversible elimination of the obfuscation matrix, two watermark embedding methodologies are proposed in the CS domain in order. In both methods, the watermark generated by the obfuscation matrix is embedded in the encrypted CS measurement values, with the first methodology concentrating on the optimal data reconstruction quality and the second methodology working to balance storage space and data restoration quality. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed methodologies over other conventional reversible data privacy preservation schemes.",Not About Sufficiency

Optimal thermal management on server cooling system to achieve minimal energy consumption based on air-cooled chiller,"In recent years, with the development of data centers toward high heat flux density, traditional air-cooled has gradually failed to meet the cooling requirements. So the liquid cooling for data centers is an important area for future development, and current research focuses on developing efficient heat sink structures or constructing energy-saving cold source schemes. However, to-date, there has been no integration of these two facets and consequently current results are limited by a lack of comprehensive analysis of the entire cooling system. Consequently, liquid cooling for data centers was developed in this study, and a comprehensive thermal management performance analysis was conducted, including a heat sink and cold source. A minimum energy consumption analysis was performed to determine an optimal thermal management strategy by constructing a 4.8 kW data center cooling system, containing 400 W for each chip, with the aid of TRNSYS software. Taking 70 °C as the safe temperature for the chips, the power consumption of pumps and an air-cooled chiller were explored by analyzing the internal relationships between server inlet temperature, chiller supply water temperature, ambient temperature, and rates of water flow; and optimal thermal management was achieved.

New energy consumption optimization algorithm and model analysisbased on demand-side response,"With the serious threat of global climate change and the increasing demand for sustainable energy sources, the renewable and clean nature of new energy sources (such as wind and solar energy) has attracted widespread attention. However, the instability and unpredictability of new energy sources pose a significant challenge to the operation and planning of the power system. In this study, a new energy consumption optimization algorithm and model based on demand side response is proposed to realize the efficient consumption of sustainable energy and the stable operation of power system. In this study, a power system model includes traditional generating sets, wind power and solar power station. Then, demand side response is introduced as a key flexibility resource to adjust power demand to achieve more efficient consumption of new energy. The availability of the demand-side response is monitored and controlled through smart meters and smart home devices, enabling the power system to respond more flexibly to new energy fluctuations. In order to realize optimal consumption, this study proposes a multi-objective optimization algorithm to maximize the utilization of new energy, minimize the operating cost of the power system and ensure the stability of the power system. The algorithm takes into account the spatial-temporal characteristics of new energy and the potential of demand side response, and optimizes the operation of the power system through collaborative dispatching. This study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and model through simulation experiments on real power system datasets. The results show that the new energy absorption strategy based on demand-side response can not only significantly reduce carbon emissions, but also reduce the operating cost of the power system and improve the reliability of the system.",Not About Sufficiency
Affordable phosphor-converted LEDs with specific light quality facilitate the tobacco seedling growth with low energy consumption in Industrial Seedling Raising,"Industrial Seedling Raising (ISR) is increasingly becoming an important part of Modern Agriculture because of its efficient utilization of land, water, and fertilizer as well as its advantages of being not easily affected by the weather. However, the high cost and high energy consumption of light sources for plant growth is limiting the popularization of ISR technology. Phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes (pc-LEDs) make use of relatively affordable red phosphor and blue light chips, providing an adjustable spectrum to optimize plant growth. To identify the energy-saving light quality of pc-LEDs, we investigated the effects of a variety of light qualities on the growth of tobacco seedlings. Y3Al5O12:Ce3+, CaAlSiN3:Eu2+, KAl11O17:Eu2+ phosphors were combined with the blue light chip according to different proportions to produce the following light sources: CK (white light), T1 (blue light), T2 (red light), T3 (red: blue light ratio = 1:4), T4 (red: blue light ratio = 4:1). The tobacco variety Xiangyan7 grown continuously under T1, T2, T3, and T4 significantly increased the leaf area, stem length, biomass, root area and main root length compared with those grown under white light. Among the five kinds of light qualities tested, T4 treatment exerted the best effect on leaf development and biomass increase, while T2 exerted the best effect on stem elongation. The cytological analysis demonstrated that the promotion of the cell size and cell number of leaf epidermal cells by T1-T4 might contribute to the leaf expansion. Further analysis at the molecular level suggested that the light quality affected the RNA levels of the genes involved in cell division and expansion. When tobacco seedlings reached the same biomass, T1-T4 light sources saved 71%, 86%, 80% and 89% of electric energy respectively compared with white light. Therefore, the application of specific pc-LEDs not only reduces the cost of light source production, but also saves energy consumption, offering great potential for ISR technology to cut costs and increase efficiency.",Not About Sufficiency

Specifically, digital transformation has the potential to indirectly increase HEC by consumption upgrade and internet development mechanisms. The heterogeneity analysis reveals that the impact of digital transformation on HEC varies significantly across different household and regional. High-income, low skilled, rural areas, as well as households in areas with higher levels of development and marketization, are more likely to be affected by the digital revolution in production and consumption, which will inevitably lead to an increase in HEC.

Sustainable Fuelwood Production In Kenya: Potential Role of Community Forest Associations,"Sustainable Development Goal 7 emphasizes the need for affordable and sustainable modern energy. Wood-fuel is not a significant part of debates surrounding this goal despite its importance as a major energy source in developing countries. Policies concentrate on alternative sources of fuels, but these are often expensive to a majority of the populations in developing countries. This is coupled in some areas with charcoal bans as well as tough restrictions on wood fuel harvest in forests. This disproportionately affects the poor segment of the community who are not able to afford alternative sources of energy. More attention should be focused on biomass fuels such as wood fuel to make them renewable sources. This can be done through community-based forest management. The Plantation Establishment and Livelihood Improvement Scheme (PELIS) in Kenya is practiced through Participatory Forest Management (PFM) where forest adjacent communities are allocated forest land for three years where they grow trees and food crops. This scheme can be utilized for sustainable charcoal production by setting aside a piece of the land for growing trees suitable for charcoal production. This would provide the communities with viable sources of energy as well as income through the sale of wood fuel. There is potential in utilizing existing community-based management institutions to implement sustainable wood fuel production strategies.

Urban Mining: Applying Digital Twins for Sustainable Product Cascade Use,"Due to the ever-increasing consumption of resources, various materials and raw materials have become increasingly scarce and consequently expensive. At the same time, energy demand has dramatically increased in global mining operations also intensifying economic pressure. Surprisingly, the recapturing of important raw materials at the end of the product life cycle through recycling is still insufficiently implemented in the supply chain. Recycling is not only a sink for unwanted materials it can become an urban mine. This is especially relevant in Europe, where in comparison to other continents primary raw material mining of bulk materials is rather low. In a situation of scarcity, the exact planning of raw material and material flows for the following months (and sometimes years) has become ever more vital to ensure their timely and sufficient availability for production. A missing piece is the necessary transfer of production information (like bill of materials, BOM) to the recycler because information is typically kept inside the production supply chain. Digital technologies such as Digital Twins can help provide this information to the End-of-Life (EoL) stakeholders (recycling industry) as a means to increase the potential of circular economy. This paper establishes urban mining as an important concept of life cycle management in the circular economy.

We can imagine the total carbon footprint if we extend this to all the other numerous electronic gadgets we use. With the increasing volume of e-waste, the chances of these toxic non-biodegradable elements polluting the environment are astronomical. This problem is being addressed by various nations and laws to regulate the waste have been passed in recent years. The Indian Government has placed E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules in 2011 which forms a part of the Environment Protection Act to ensure coherent disposal of e-waste. However, a rather large percentage of e-waste in India is still not regulated and it runs vastly by unorganized sectors. We provide a solution to the above problem by proposing an efficient e-waste management technique by using blockchain in the 5G scenario. Our solution keeps track of the e-waste generated and we provide an incentive-based system where users are encouraged to channelize their e-waste through government regulated agencies which efficiently dispose of them in an environment-friendly manner. We propose a public-private partnership (PPP) model for implementing this, which can generate thousands of jobs by organizing this unregulated sector with huge underlying potential.",About Sufficiency

In order to determine the number of energy consumption pattern clusters, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) model was utilized in conjunction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The determination of clustering levels for each structure was executed by utilizing K-means in conjunction with a Genetic algorithm (GA). This approach enabled the identification of optimal clustering levels for the given structures, thereby facilitating effective analysis and interpretation of the data. The GA was specifically employed to determine the optimal centroid points for each cluster, thus optimizing the performance of the fitting model. Cluster analysis pattern extraction has made determining which buildings consume the most energy easier. As intelligent models for predicting energy usage, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and CNNs paired with a GA have also been used. The application of a GA to modify multiple settings of a CNN was conducted at this stage. The CNN model using a GA shows the method that was used provides higher accuracy and standard error compared to the conventional approach. It achieves a 94.01% accuracy on the training dataset and a 93.74% accuracy on the validation dataset with an error rate of 0.24 and 0.26 respectively. On the training dataset, the accuracy is 89.03% with a standard error of 0.3, whereas on the validation dataset, the accuracy is 88.91% with a 0.33 standard error. This research can help policymakers in the energy sector make better decisions regarding the timing of energy supply and demand for public buildings.",About Sufficiency
Toward Digital twin for sustainable manufacturing: A data-driven approach for energy consumption behavior model generation,"Traditional manufacturing systems face a major transition challenge toward intelligent and sustainable manufacturing systems. Energy-efficient manufacturing has become one of the main focuses of this transition because of the high and critical consumption of energy for the production of many industrial sectors. To this aim, modeling Energy Consumption (EC) behavior is a primary step to monitor and reduce consumption. However, it requires a deep understanding of the system’s kinematic and dynamic behaviors. Hence, creating a model from scratch can be challenging, which may result in a model that does not correctly represent the real system. With the advancement of digital technologies, it is now possible to collect and analyze data from manufacturing systems in real-time. This opens the door to the possibility of modeling the energy consumption behavior of different machine states based on a data-driven approach and keeping the current energy consumption under control and monitored using real-time data from the equipment. Prior research has been conducted in the literature incorporating EC modeling into a Digital Twin (DT). However, the addressed issue remains an open challenge due to its complexity. The proposed methodology solves the lack of literature by proposing a methodology that makes the EC modeling within the reach of any researcher or practitioner in the field. The current paper proposes a data-driven methodology for integrating the EC model into Digital Twins. The methodology is based on measurements to identify different segments and sub-states of EC of production equipment, using techniques such as segmentation and regression. It relies on power absorption measurement of industrial equipment to generate EC related-parameters to be fed into the DT model to monitor the current operating condition of the physical system. This work contributes to the DT-based sustainable transition by allowing to monitor and quantitatively measure those parameters which could be controlled to reduce EC. A case study on an industrial robot is used to validate and assess the performance of the approach in a laboratory environment.",About Sufficiency

A systematic and critical review on effective utilization of artificial intelligence for bio-diesel production techniques,"Since industrial development and globalization of the world, fossil fuels remain a major source of energy for almost all sectors of life. Fossil fuels, without doubt, play a vital role in the development of today’s world. However, there are increasing reservations about the consumption of fossil fuels due to their detrimental impact on our ecosystem. In recent decades, biodiesel has attracted much attention as a promising replacement for fossil fuel-based diesel, especially in the transportation sector. Biodiesel is a non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and carbon-free fuel that can be made from any kind of vegetable oil or fat.

Forecasting the Efficacy of E-Waste Management System Using Fourier Series Approach Towards Environmental Sustainability,"The rising volume of waste generated by electrical and electronic equipment is a significant global environmental concern. The effective management of electronic waste (e-waste) is now a crucial issue for socio-economic and environmental sustainability. This study aims to develop a predictive model using the Fourier series method to estimate the daily per capita production of electronic and solid waste. The study area was divided into three categories: administrative and office buildings, classroom buildings, and student lounges. Each category included four specific floors where bins were placed for data collection. The bins were emptied in the mornings on thirty consecutive weekdays over four weeks, and the waste was quantified using suitable equipment for analysis. The bins were serviced in the mornings on thirty consecutive weekdays over four weeks, and the waste amounts were measured using appropriate equipment to provide data for analysis. The results indicate a positive trend in the e-waste data for office, laboratory, lecture, and lounge rooms concerning the time and e-waste office data. However, the stationary assumption is not met, and a negative trend is observed. It is anticipated that e-waste from the lounge room will increase over the next 5 days, as evidenced by the rising blue curve. Model 1, applied to forecast e-waste for office rooms, predicts a decreasing trend in e-waste following the initial 30-day data. Model 2, using only one lag variable, suggests a constant trend for e-waste from the lecture room, with consistent forecasts for the next 5 days. Model 3, also utilizing a single lag variable, shows nearly constant observed data for e-waste in the laboratory room, indicating that the expected quantity of e-waste from the laboratory will remain unchanged. Finally, Model 4, with only one lag variable, predicts an increase in e-waste from the lounge room over the following 5 days, as indicated by the rising blue curve. Initiating waste reduction is often considered a rational initial step in establishing sustainable solid waste management practices. Reducing the quantity of waste that needs to be collected and disposed of is essential. Sanitation officers are advised to adopt the following strategies to decrease the per capita production of solid waste and enhance its disposal methods.",About Sufficiency

Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant applications and potentials in the area of edge computing. State of the art literature on edge computing domain is included in the survey to guide readers towards the current trends and future opportunities in the area of edge computing.",About Sufficiency
From digitalization to renewable energy: How the tech-energy connection drives the green energy in belt and road countries,"Sustainable economic development is the need of the current era which is not possible without the environment friendly energy consumption. Digitalization which is the major part of economic life also has a major role in determining the level of clean energy in an economy. Therefore, this study investigates the nonlinear relationship between digitalization and renewable energy consumption with particular focus on the role of human capital as a moderating factor. This study has developed a panel of the countries that are part of the One Belt One Road project from 1996 to 2019. The results of augmented system GMM show that, initially, digitalization adversely effects the renewable energy consumption, however; after specific threshold value, the impact of digitalization convert from adverse to beneficial for the renewable energy development. This study also shows that human that capital moderates the relationship between digitalization and renewable energy in a positive way showing a good human capital helps countries to early ending the negative impact of digitalization on renewable energy.

"Distributed (green) data centers: A new concept for energy, computing, and telecommunications","We introduce a new conceptual approach to green data centers through the use of multiple, distributed networked data centers that are co-located with renewable energy. While green data centers are a well-established objective, conventional approaches have focused on either high efficiencies and/or the use of renewable energy. This model extends and innovates both approaches with three key design aspects. First, it emphasizes the use of many small, geographically distributed mini data centers. Second, such data centers can operate with the option of being dislocated from the electrical grid via a mini-grid, or behind the meter. Third, the approach enhances the use of renewable energy via the ability to transfer computing load from one mini data center to another as renewable supply or market contexts dictate. This paper introduces the conceptual approach, outlines the research broadly, and examines potential technical, economic, and policy constraints for the establishment of this approach on a broad scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of this model for the developing world, particularly in areas without substantial electricity transmission infrastructure.",About Sufficiency
Towards artificial intelligence-based reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the telecommunications industry,"This paper presents the assessment and management of emissions of pollutant gases at telecommunication base stations (BSs) due to the operations of diesel generators. A model combining the source testing method with an artificial neural network (ANN) technique and the Internet of Things (IoT) system is proposed in this paper. The actual concentration of gases and particles like carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter in the atmosphere due to the operation of base stations in Abuja, Nigeria is studied. The results show that measured emission of CO2 gas was the highest; ranging from 1976 to 4498 ppm at the BS sites and exceeding the normal outdoor level and maximum permissible safety level. Generally, all gases and particles measured at the generator sites exceeded the acceptable limit, thereby exposing workers at these BSs to health hazards. Measured emissions for NO2 at locations away from the BS sites surpassed the set limits, which highlights the need for cleaner sources of energy to power the BSs especially given the toxicity of this gas. Furthermore, about 48% of the measured data for SO2 gas exceeded the recommended limit. The values measured for PM2.5 and PM10 also exceed the recommended 150 µg/m3 limit, thereby posing health risks to the site workers and residents in the neighbourhood. The ANN technique is employed to analyse the data and ensure that future emissions from base stations can be predicted with a degree of accuracy, and to assess the factors that affect these emissions. The result shows that the proposed ANN model efficiently predicted the emissions of the pollutant gases with an overall correlation coefficient value of 0.93719, thus making it a good fit in forecasting. An IoT-based system is also proposed as a solution to reduce these greenhouse gases.",About Sufficiency
How Viable are Energy Savings in Smart Homes? A Call to Embrace Rebound Effects in Sustainable HCI,"As part of global climate action, digital technologies are seen as a key enabler of energy efficiency savings. A popular application domain for this work is smart homes. There is a risk, however, that these efficiency gains result in rebound effects, which reduce or even overcompensate the savings. Rebound effects are well-established in economics, but it is less clear whether they also inform smart energy research in other disciplines. In this paper, we ask: to what extent have rebound effects and their underlying mechanisms been considered in computing, HCI and smart home research? To answer this, we conducted a literature mapping drawing on four scientific databases and a SIGCHI corpus. Our results reveal limited consideration of rebound effects and significant opportunities for HCI to advance this topic. We conclude with a taxonomy of actions for HCI to address rebound effects and help determine the viability of energy efficiency projects.",About Sufficiency
Making the most of digital social innovation: An exploration into success factors,"Digital social innovation (DSI) is an emerging phenomenon that leverages digital technologies to address societal challenges. With the growing interest of customers, employees, and investors in societal challenges, as well as the availability and affordability of digital technologies, DSI gains importance for organisations to achieve long-term success.

Carbon-Neutralized Joint User Association and Base Station Switching for Green Cellular Networks,"Mitigating climate change and its impacts is one of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) required by United Nations for an urgent action. Increasing carbon emissions due to human activities is the root cause to climate change. Telecommunication networks that provide service connectivity to mobile users contribute great amount of carbon emissions by consuming lots of non-renewable energy sources. Beyond the improvement on energy efficiency, to reduce the carbon footprint, telecom operators are increasing their adoption of renewable energy (e.g., wind power). The high variability of renewable energy in time and location; however, creates difficulties for operators when utilizing renewables for the reduction of carbon emissions. In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous network consisted of one macro base station (MBS) and multiple small base stations (SBSs) where each base station (BS) is powered by both of renewable and non-renewable energy. Different from the prior works that target on the total power consumption, we propose a novel scheme to minimize the carbon footprint of networks by dynamically switching the ON/OFF modes of SBSs and adjusting the association between users and BSs to access renewables as much as possible. Our numerical analysis shows that the proposed scheme significantly reduces up to 86% of the non-renewable energy consumption compared to two representative baselines.",About Sufficiency

The data centers as a resource-intensive industry, perturbates the energy and spatial systems where established. Currently, municipalities as the main entities responsible for local resource management, often lack the power and/or determination to plan spatial and energy aspects cohesively. Consequently, municipalities encounter resource management issues when planning for data center locations; high resource demand (water, electricity, land) and high resource waste (excess heat). This research aims to support urban planners, municipal energy companies, politicians, and other relevant decision-makers, in developing municipal energy and spatial systems that account for data centers' resource demand as well as using their resources produced in the form of excess heat for the community's benefit. This study compares energy and spatial aspects in relevant data center locations in Stockholm and Luleå municipalities from an urban planning perspective.

Machine learning for real-time green carbon dioxide tracking in refinery processes,"The global increase in greenhouse gas emissions presents an urgent environmental challenge, demanding innovative strategies for emission reduction and a fundamental shift in energy consumption practices. Co-processing biogenic feedstocks, such as used cooking oils and biocrudes derived from forest and agricultural residues, within existing oil refineries has been demonstrated as a cost-effective, scalable approach to producing low-carbon fuels, quickly helping the oil refiners to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions, leveraging the existing infrastructures. Despite its potential, monitoring the ”green” CO2 emissions originating from biogenic feedstocks during co-processing remains challenging. The molecular structure of biogenic components becomes indistinguishable from fossil-based molecules, necessitating costly, labor-intensive, and time-consuming sample collection and testing procedures, often involving isotope carbon analysis. This work proposes a new approach by applying artificial intelligence to model green CO2 emissions in real-time. By analyzing over 102,000 samples of industrial data from a commercial FCC unit, a robust machine learning framework is developed to provide continuous, cost-effective, and accurate green CO2 monitoring. The methodology encompasses a comparative analysis of ten input analysis techniques and five regression models to model emissions, achieving an average error margin of just 2.66% compared to traditional laboratory measurements.

Computation offloading in Edge Computing environments using Artificial Intelligence techniques,"Edge Computing (EC) is a recent architectural paradigm that brings computation close to end-users with the aim of reducing latency and bandwidth bottlenecks, which 5G technologies are committed to further reduce, while also achieving higher reliability. EC enables computation offloading from end devices to edge nodes. Deciding whether a task should be offloaded, or not, is not trivial. Moreover, deciding when and where to offload a task makes things even harder and making inadequate or off-time decisions can undermine the EC approach. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, such as Machine Learning (ML), have been used to help EC systems cope with this problem. AI promises accurate decisions, higher adaptability and portability, thus diminishing the cost of decision-making and the probability of error.

Using a literature review based on keywords’ clusters analysis, this study explores how I4.0 can support both implementation and decision-making in the CE 10Rs, providing a practical guide for businesses and supporting a broader shift towards sustainable business models. The results show that IoT, Big Data, and Digital Twins effectively support Rs related to smarter product use and manufacturing processes. Additive Manufacturing, Augmented/Virtual Reality, and Cognitive Twins are crucial in extending the lifespan of products or components. IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and human-robot collaboration can improve recycling practices and material recovery. The study reveals that while ’Reduce’ and ’Recycle’ dominate the literature, integrating I4.0 technologies with lesser-explored strategies like ’Reuse,’ ’Repurpose,’ ’Refurbish,’ and ’Remanufacture’ offers significant potential for future research. It also stresses the need to assess the energy and environmental impacts of I4.0 technologies themselves in the CE context.",About Sufficiency

Chapter 14 - Beyond artificial intelligence ethics: exploring empathetic ethical outcomes for artificial intelligence,"This chapter will focus on the area of human emotion as the field of emotional AI or empathic AI is emerging and creating new possibilities—and ethical issues. Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into multiple spheres of everyday life and is quickly proving capable of affecting how we live, work and play in the world—with sometimes severe differences in usage, acceptance, legalities, and ethical practices both between countries and within countries. These discrepancies and ethical debates are only going to become more complex. Intelligence is no longer unique to the human species, therefore challenging the definition of what it means to be human. Our chapter uses three cases studies to illustrate how empathy is germane to intimacy, planetary survival, and recognition. Apart from the need to find the right amount and approach of empathy within AI systems to mitigate detrimental emotional effects on humans, there should also be an approach to bring empathy across all AI technologies, irrespective of having Emotional AI (EAI) as a focal point. In addition, there is reason to believe that adding empathy as an extra layer of ethics into official guidelines is not only necessary but desirable, ensuring that the increase of standardization and generalization in the AI field does not invalidate individuality. A lack of empathy could be considered as unethical in itself, so the ongoing developments in the field of empathy and AI and the link between both is to be welcomed.",About Sufficiency
Energy-saving self-configuring networked data centers,"In this paper, we develop the optimal minimum-energy scheduler for the dynamic online joint allocation of the task sizes, computing rates, communication rates and communication powers in virtualized Networked Data Centers (NetDCs) that operates under hard per-job delay-constraints. The referred NetDC’s infrastructure is composed by multiple frequency-scalable Virtual Machines (VMs), that are interconnected by a bandwidth and power-limited switched Local Area Network (LAN). Due to the nonlinear power-vs.-communication rate relationship, the resulting Computing-Communication Optimization Problem (CCOP) is inherently nonconvex. In order to analytically compute the exact solution of the CCOP, we develop a solving approach that relies on the following two main steps: (i) we prove that the CCOP retains a loosely coupled structure, that allows us to perform the lossless decomposition of the CCOP into the cascade of two simpler sub-problems; and, (ii) we prove that the coupling between the aforementioned sub-problems is provided by a (scalar) constraint, that is linear in the offered workload. The resulting optimal scheduler is amenable of scalable and distributed online implementation and its analytical characterization is in closed-form. After numerically testing its actual performance under randomly time-varying synthetically generated and real-world measured workload traces, we compare the obtained performance with the corresponding ones of some state-of-the-art static and sequential schedulers.",About Sufficiency
Unrevealing the nexus between digital sustainability and corporate digital responsibility: A dual-track systematic literature review towards a framework of corporate digital sustainability,"This study investigates the interconnectedness of Digital Sustainability (DS) and Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR), through a dual-track systematic literature review, analyzing 202 scholarly works from Web of Science and Scopus.

A classification framework for generative artificial intelligence for social good,"Many policy makers and corporate leaders are adjusting their strategies to harness the power of GenAI. There are numerous debates on how GenAI would fundamentally change existing business models. However, there is not much discussion on roles of generative AI in the domain of social good. Broader views covering potential opportunities of GenAI to enable diverse initiatives in the social good space are largely missing. We intend to reduce the gap by developing a classification framework that should allow researchers gauge the potential impact of GenAI for social good initiatives. Through case analysis, we assess how value-added abilities of GenAI may influence various social good initiatives. We adopt/develop two loosely connected classification frameworks that are grounded in task-technology fit (TTF) theory. Subsequently, we investigate how our analyses of GenAI initiatives utilizing different dimensions of these two frameworks may be synthesized to provide appropriate explanation for potential success of GenAI for social good.

Reducing Energy Consumption in Electronic Component Manufacturing through Large Neighborhood Search,"Amidst the ongoing climate crisis, there is a pressing need to reduce energy consumption - especially in industrial settings, as recognized by the United Nations Sustainability Goals (in particular, 9 and 12). To mitigate energy usage in production, strategically grouping compatible jobs and processing them together in batches, as captured by batch scheduling problems, is often beneficial. The Oven Scheduling Problem (OSP), is an NP-hard real-world parallel batch scheduling problem that arises in the electronic component industry. The goal of the OSP is to schedule jobs on ovens while minimizing total oven operating time, job tardiness, and setup costs. To reduce oven runtime, compatible jobs can be processed simultaneously in batches. The schedule must respect oven eligibility and availability, job release dates, setup times between batches, and oven capacity constraints.We propose and fine-tune a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm that uses three different destroy operators and a repair operator based on an exact method (a Constraint Programming model).

Towards greener data centers with storage class memory,"Studies have shown that much of today’s data centers are over-provisioned and underutilized. Over-provisioning cannot be avoided as these centers must anticipate peak load with bursty behavior. Under-utilization, to date, has also been unavoidable as systems always had to be ready for that sudden burst of requests that loom just around the corner.

Transition towards carbon neutrality: Forecasting Hong Kong's buildings carbon footprint by 2050 using a machine learning approach,"Hong Kong has planned to achieve zero-carbon emissions before 2050. Hong Kong's building sector is responsible for approximately 60 % of carbon emissions, while its evolutionary trajectories and neutrality pathway remain unclear. To this end, we adopt the STIRPAT model and machine learning approach to identify the most relevant factors and determine their historical correlation with building energy consumption. Then, the out-of-sample prediction is conducted to explore the energy pathway and carbon footprint towards 2050 in the Hong Kong building sector under various assumptions and scenarios. The predicted results suggest that electricity consumption and carbon emissions will continue to increase following current trends. In a moderate scenario, if 2.2 % and 1.6 % of residential and commercial buildings are replaced annually with 2.75 % better energy-performance construction, their electricity consumption is likely to reach 30 %–40 % and 20 %–30 % from the 2015 level as the HK2050 required.

Does the lack of energy resilience a serious problem at the forefront of policy analysts? Role of supply chain digitalization and environmental law in OECD countries,"Energy efficiency improvements leading to cleaner output have recently emerged as a hot topic in sustainable development research. At this time, OECD nations are not generating enough money to guarantee that energy efficiency measures can be purchased. Artificial intelligence (AI) is causing a revolution in optimizing energy efficiency by allowing for sophisticated analysis and management of energy systems. Thus, in this stage of digital economic growth, energy resilience might be impacted by the fast development of AI technology, the energy internet, and other emerging forms of the network economy. This study aims to analyze the effects of digitalization in the supply chain, artificial intelligence, and finance on energy resilience (ENR) in seventeen OECD countries by using panel data from 2006 to 2021. Three dynamic panel data models are employed: one-step difference GMM, one-step system GMM, and two-step system GMM. The findings show that population growth and tax environmental regulations decrease energy resilience in OECD countries. On the other hand, digitalization of the supply chain, advancements in finance, and AI have increased energy resilience. Moreover, the study uses SQR and panel quantile regression (PQR) tests to ensure that the dynamic panel model is robust. Based on the findings, significant policy implications are proposed to enhance energy quality in OECD nations.

Pioneering Eco-Efficiency in Cloud Computing: The Carbon-Conscious Federated Reinforcement Learning (CCFRL) Approach,"In response to the growing emphasis on sustainability in federated learning (FL), this research introduces a dynamic, dual-objective optimization framework called carbon-conscious federated reinforcement learning (CCFRL). By leveraging reinforcement learning (RL), CCFRL continuously adapts client allocation and resource usage in real time, optimizing both carbon efficiency and model performance. Unlike static or greedy methods that prioritize short-term carbon constraints, existing approaches often suffer from either degrading model performance by excluding high-quality, energy-intensive clients or failing to adequately balance carbon emissions with long-term efficiency. CCFRL addresses these limitations by taking a more sustainable method, balancing immediate resource needs with long-term sustainability, and ensuring that energy consumption and carbon emissions are minimized without compromising model quality, even with nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) and large-scale datasets. We overcome the shortcomings of existing methods by integrating advanced state representations, adaptive exploration and exploitation transitions, and stagnating detection using t-tests to better manage real-world data heterogeneity and complex, nonlinear datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCFRL significantly reduces both energy consumption and carbon emissions while maintaining or enhancing performance. With up to a 61.78% improvement in energy conservation and a 64.23% reduction in carbon emissions, CCFRL proves the viability of aligning resource management with sustainability goals, paving the way for a more environmentally responsible future in cloud computing.",About Sufficiency

"COP28 roadmap: Do ICT, education, and renewable energy consumption matter for environmental quality? Quantile evidence for emerging economies","Renewable energy consumption (REC) is not the only potent tool that can ameliorate the difficulties associated with rising CO2 emissions and ecological distortions. Besides, the role of ICT penetration and education on environmental quality cannot be overshadowed by their contributions to economic growth and improved human well-being. This study scrutinizes the effects of ICT, education, and REC on the ecological footprint (EF) and CO2 emissions in the IMF-selected emerging economies. The study utilizes three variables for the ICT index, computed through principal component analysis. The augmented mean group estimator results suggest that ICT, education, and REC reduce the EF, whereas FDI contributes significantly to environmental degradation. On the flip side, ICT reduces CO2 emissions and EF in both the medium and upper quantiles. It suggests that ICT penetration heals the environment and that a higher level of ICT consumption could be a panacea for sustainable development in emerging economies. The causality results show evidence of a feedback causality between economic growth, REC, and CO2 emissions. However, a unidirectional causality flows from economic growth and FDI to EF. Finally, to maximize the benefits associated with the positive effects of REC and ICT on environmental betterment, several renewable energy and ICT policies have been mentioned and discussed.",About Sufficiency

While acknowledging the potential sustainability benefits of a green digital transformation, we challenge perceptions of a virtual and dematerialised industry often reinforced through the cloud metaphor. Using the planetary boundary (PB) framework, we go beyond conventional assessments of carbon emissions during a data centre's operational state to train AI and explore their multiple impacts on different Earth systems throughout the entire hardware lifecycle. For each stage of AI's hardware lifecycle, it is necessary to ascertain whether the environmental impacts associated with that stage can be quantified in a manner that allows for comparison with the control variables defined in the PB framework. In a second phase of the study, we examine the geographical distribution of individual lifecycle stages in order to assess the relative vulnerability of countries to the environmental harms associated with AI development stages. By mapping the lifecycle stages around the world, it becomes evident that the extraction, manufacturing, and disposal of AI hardware have a significant detrimental impact on the environment and populations in the Global South (the Majority World), while the benefits of AI development and use are largely concentrated in the West (the Minority World). Our findings underscore the need to scrutinize the benefits and costs associated with AI.

"Cross-quantile risk assessment: The interplay of crude oil, artificial intelligence, clean tech, and other markets","This paper explores the interconnections among oil, artificial intelligence (AI), clean technology, and traditional markets. We apply a novel generalized quantile-on-quantile connectedness method that assesses variable cross-quantile interdependencies, analyzing data from 2018 to 2023. Our study provides a detailed examination of risk transmission dynamics between oil, AI, clean technology, and major markets including equity, debt, and currency. Our findings indicate that tail risk spillovers are more pronounced than median quantiles. In contrast, the analysis shows negative spillovers across these tails in markets for U.S. government debt, the U.S. dollar, and gold. The dynamic risk transmission analysis reveals that while the stock and AI markets generally act as net transmitters of risk across all quantiles, the crude oil and USD index markets consistently receive net risk spillovers, particularly in the right tail of the distribution. Our results suggest that, on average, AI, and clean technology markets, along with the stock markets, are more likely to transfer risk spillovers compared to debt, currency, or other commodity markets. This positions the USD and crude oil as potential buffers against extreme risk transmissions emanating from the AI and clean technology sectors. This study highlights the complex risk dynamics and the pivotal role of oil in the interplay between emerging technologies and traditional financial markets.",About Sufficiency
Strategically constructed narratives on artificial intelligence: What stories are told in governmental artificial intelligence policies?,"What stories are told in national artificial intelligence (AI) policies? Combining the novel technique of structural topic modeling (STM) and qualitative narrative analysis, this paper examines the policy narratives in 33 countries’ AI policies. We uncover six common narratives that are dominating the political agenda concerning AI. Our findings show that the policy narratives' saliences vary across time and countries. We make several contributions. First, our narratives describe well-grounded, supportable conceptions of AI among governments, and show that AI is still a fairly novel, multilayered, and controversial phenomenon. Building on the premise that human sensemaking is best represented and supported by narration, we address the applied rhetoric of governments to either minimize the risks or exalt the opportunities of AI. Second, we uncover the four prominent roles governments seek to take concerning AI implementation: enabler, leader, regulator, and/or user. Third, we make a methodological contribution toward data-driven, computationally-intensive theory development. Our methodological approach and the identified narratives present key starting points for further research.",About Sufficiency
Road map for research on responsible artificial intelligence for development (AI4D) in African countries: The case study of agriculture,"Summary Individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds are increasingly engaging in research and development in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).

How could the United Nations Global Digital Compact prevent cultural imposition and hermeneutical injustice?,"Summary As the geopolitical superpowers race to regulate the digital realm, their divergent rights-centered, market-driven, and social-control-based approaches require a global compact on digital regulation. If diverse regulatory jurisdictions remain, forms of domination entailed by cultural imposition and hermeneutical injustice related to AI legislation and AI systems will follow. We argue for consensual regulation on shared substantive issues, accompanied by proper standardization and coordination. Failure to attain consensus will fragment global digital regulation, enable regulatory capture by authoritarian powers or bad corporate actors, and deepen the historical geopolitical power asymmetries between the global South and the global North. To prevent an unjust regulatory landscape where the global South’s cultural and hermeneutic resources are absent, two principles for the Global Digital Compact to counter these prospective harms are proposed and discussed: (1) “recognitive consensus on key substantive benefits and harms” and (2) “procedural consensus on global coordination and essential standards.”",About Sufficiency

In order to reduce the energy consumption of data center caused by cooling system, research on the water-cooled heat sinks used to cool chips has become increasingly important with the steep increase in the heat flux density of data centers. To explore the effect of different water-cooled heat sinks on cooling system performance, a server water-cooled system for the server cabinet was built, and the chip heat dissipation performance, optimal thermal management, and system energy consumption were simulated by equipping a cooling tower and two types of fin-type water-cooled heat sinks (A-type and B-type).

Experimental evaluation of direct-to-chip cold plate liquid cooling for high-heat-density data centers,"Owing to the dramatic increase in IT power density and energy consumption, the data center (DC) sector has started adopting thermally- and energy-efficient liquid cooling methods. This study examines a single-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling approach for three high-heat-density racks, utilizing two liquid-to-air (L2A) cooled coolant distribution units (CDUs) and a combined total heat load of 128 kW. An experimental setup was developed to test different types of CDUs, cooling loops, and thermal testing vehicles (TTVs) for different operating conditions. IR images and the collected data were used to investigate the effect of air recirculation between cold and hot aisle containments on the CDU’s performance and stability of supply air temperature (SAT). Three different types of cooling loops (X, Y, and Z) were characterized thermally and hydraulically. Results show that Type Y has the lowest cold plate thermal resistance and pressure drop, among others. In a later test that included a single rack at a heat load of 53 kW and a single CDU, the heat capture ratio for fluid was found to be 94%. Experiments show that using blanking panels on the back of the racks limits hot air recirculation and maintains a steady SAT in the cold aisle. Finally, the CDU performance was evaluated at a high heat load for the three racks at 128 kW, and the average cooling capacity of the units is 58.6 kW, and the effectiveness values for CDU 1 and CDU 2 are 0.83 and 0.82, respectively.",About Sufficiency
"Artificial intelligence based anomaly detection of energy consumption in buildings: A review, current trends and new perspectives","Enormous amounts of data are being produced everyday by sub-meters and smart sensors installed in residential buildings.

"Digital economy, financial development and energy transition in Africa: Exploring for synergies and nonlinearities","The transition to sustainable energy for all is a crucial aspect of the sustainable development goals, particularly Goal 7, which underscores the need for clean and affordable energy. This requires the development of digital infrastructure and a strong financial system. As a result, this study contributes to knowledge by exploring the synergies and nonlinear effects of the digital economy and financial development on renewable energy, which remains underexplored. To this effect, this study recruits the dynamic panel threshold and the generalised method of moments estimations to evaluate the linear, synergies and nonlinearities among these factors using a panel of forty-seven African countries. The key empirical results are stated as follows: (1) renewable energy is positively impacted by the digital economy; (2) the impact of the digital economy on renewable energy is moderated by financial development. This suggests that to ensure the propelling effect of the digital economy on renewable energy, there is a need for a stable and robust financial system; and (3) the study further found nonlinear effects of the digital economy and financial development on renewable energy, which takes a U-shaped relationship, implying that low level of digitalisation and financial development may hinder the transition to renewable energy, while high levels of these factors are essential to expedite the transition to a more sustainable energy system. Hence, African countries must embrace digitalisation and commit significant financial resources to developing their digital infrastructure to facilitate the achievement of the net zero agenda.",About Sufficiency

Applications of blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies for enabling prosumers in smart grids: A review,"Governments’ net zero emission target aims at increasing the share of renewable energy sources as well as influencing the behaviours of consumers to support the cost-effective balancing of energy supply and demand. These will be achieved by the advanced information and control infrastructures of smart grids which allow the interoperability among various stakeholders. Under this circumstance, increasing number of consumers produce, store, and consume energy, giving them a new role of prosumers. The integration of prosumers and accommodation of incurred bidirectional flows of energy and information rely on two key factors: flexible structures of energy markets and intelligent operations of power systems. The blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) are innovative technologies to fulfil these two factors, by which the blockchain provides decentralised trading platforms for energy markets and the AI supports the optimal operational control of power systems. This paper attempts to address how to incorporate the blockchain and AI in the smart grids for facilitating prosumers to participate in energy markets. To achieve this objective, first, this paper reviews how policy designs price carbon emissions caused by the fossil-fuel based generation so as to facilitate the integration of prosumers with renewable energy sources.

Generative spatial artificial intelligence for sustainable smart cities: A pioneering large flow model for urban digital twin,"Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",About Sufficiency
An electricity price and energy-efficient workflow scheduling in geographically distributed cloud data centers,"The cloud computing platform has become a favorable destination for running cloud workflow applications. However, they are primarily complicated and require intensive computing. Task scheduling in cloud environments, when formulated as an optimization problem, is proven to be NP-hard. Thus, efficient task scheduling plays a decisive role in minimizing energy costs. Electricity prices fluctuate depending on the vending company, time, and location. Therefore, optimizing energy costs has become a serious issue that one must consider when building workflow applications scheduling across geographically distributed cloud data centers (GD-CDCs). To tackle this issue, we have suggested a dual optimization approach called electricity price and energy-efficient (EPEE) workflow scheduling algorithm that simultaneously considers energy efficiency and fluctuating electricity prices across GD-CDCs, aims to reach the minimum electricity costs of workflow applications under the deadline constraints. This novel integration of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) with energy and electricity price optimization is unique compared to existing methods. Moreover, our EPEE approach, which includes task prioritization, deadline partitioning, data center selection based on energy efficiency and price diversity, and dynamic task scheduling, provides a comprehensive solution that significantly reduces electricity costs and enhances resource utilization. In addition, the inclusion of both generated and original data transmission times further differentiates our approach, offering a more realistic and practical solution for cloud service providers (CSPs). The experimental results reveal that the EPEE model produces better success rates to meet task deadlines, maximize resource utilization, cost and energy efficiencies in comparison to adapted state-of-the-art algorithms for similar problems.",About Sufficiency

Technology choice for sustainable development,"At the heart of the concept of sustainable development is the concern that human interactions with the environment are becoming, or have already become, impossible to maintain in the long run. Eventually, these interactions could lead to an inability of the global biosphere to provide essential amenities and services for further human development. Thus, sustainable development is first a concern about environmental degradation, at least as understood by most observers in the industrial world. We adopt the Brundtland Report definition of sustainable development, and also recognize that in this terminology, development clearly represents more than material consumption and economic growth. It includes, among other things, education, cultural and social activity, health, justice, peace, and security. One of the critical elements of sustainable development lies in understanding the role that technological innovation plays in this process. Recognizing that technology is a critical ingredient in the sustainable development recipe, we devise an operational knowledge based tool that can help determine which technologies are best suited to the needs of a sustainable society.

Re-Envisioning the Role of a User in Sustainable Computing,"As more and more computing technologies become pervasive in our daily lives, more and more e-waste is generated.

Exploring these alternatives is essential for transitioning toward a more sustainable future in computing. To this end, we argue that the envisioned roles we attribute to users during user-centered design should encompass much more. In addition to the role of the “user of a device,” we can design for user roles such as maintainers, repairers, and recyclers of interactive devices. We discuss this design shift through examples of two interactive systems we built to explore altering the role of the traditional “user” to that of caretaker and recycler.

"Reliability, availability, and life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis of combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) integration to data centers considering electricity and cooling supplies","The utilization of digital technology is increasing rapidly and it is causing a growth in the number of data centers around the world. Data centers provide essential services, making them known as mission-critical. Like other mission-critical facilities, data centers often use reliability and availability analysis to evaluate the level of safety of their operations. Reliable electricity and cooling supplies are vital for the data center’s operation, and almost all data centers rely on the power grid to feed their electrical and cooling systems. However, the power grid is considered an unreliable source, and power grid fragility is a raising concern among data center operators. An alternative to the power grid is a sustainable combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system, which can supply continuous electricity and cooling to a data center while providing local energy generation, energy cost saving, and emission benefits. To understand the impact of a CCHP integration on the reliability and availability of a grid-fed data center, an up-to-date electrical topology design and reliability block diagram models were created that take into account both electricity and cooling supplies. The results showed that the overall system reliability of a grid-fed data center increased from 49.23% to 74.62% with a CCHP integration. In terms of availability, a grid-fed data center with 2N redundant topology achieved the industry-accepted high availability level of 0.99999, also known as 5-nines. Moreover, the use of CCHP at the grid-fed data center increased the availability from 5-nines to 7-nines for the overall system. Thus, CCHP integration to a grid-fed data center provided higher reliability and availability for the overall system for even 2N redundant topology data centers. Moreover, based on the life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis, integrating CCHP systems into data centers has a promising outcome. However, when conducting an LCC analysis, we recommend considering the realistic cost of downtime along with the reliability-related exposure to properly assess the viability of alternative energy systems by data center investors and operators.",About Sufficiency

The AI-environment paradox: Unraveling the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption on pro-environmental behavior through work overload and self-efficacy in AI learning,"This study examines the complex relationships among artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in organizations, employee work overload, and pro-environmental behavior at work (PEBW), while examining the moderating role of self-efficacy in AI learning. Drawing on several theories, we developed and tested a moderated mediation model utilizing a 3-wave time-lagged survey of 416 employees from diverse South Korean corporations. Our findings reveal that the link between AI adoption and PEBW is fully mediated by work overload, with AI adoption positively influencing work overload, which in turn negatively affects PEBW. Importantly, self-efficacy in AI learning moderates the AI adoption-work overload link, such that the positive influence is weaker for members with higher levels of self-efficacy. These results highlight the unintended consequences of AI adoption on environmental behaviors and underscore the significance of individual differences in shaping responses to technological change. The current research contributes to the literature by elucidating the mechanisms through which AI adoption influences PEBW and by identifying factors that can mitigate potential negative effects. The findings offer meaningful perspectives for organizations aiming to balance technological advancement with environmental sustainability goals, emphasizing the need for strategies that enhance members’ self-efficacy in AI learning and manage workload effectively.

IT and the Quality and Efficiency of Mental Health Care in a Time of COVID-19: Case Study of Mental Health Providers in England,"Background In England, COVID-19 has significantly affected mental health care and tested the resilience of health care providers. In many areas, the increased use of IT has enabled traditional modes of service delivery to be supported or even replaced by remote forms of provision. Objective This study aimed to assess the use and impact of IT, in remote service provision, on the quality and efficiency of mental health care during the pandemic. We drew on sociotechnical systems theory as a conceptual framework to help structure the gathering, analysis, and interpretation of data. Methods We conducted a national scoping survey that involved documentary analysis and semistructured interviews with 6 national stakeholders and case studies of 4 purposefully selected mental health providers in England involving interviews with 53 staff members. Results Following the outbreak of COVID-19, mental health providers rapidly adjusted their traditional forms of service delivery, switching to digital and telephone consultations for most services. The informants provided nuanced perspectives on the impact on the quality and efficiency of remote service delivery during the pandemic. Notably, it has allowed providers to attend to as many patients as possible in the face of COVID-19 restrictions, to the convenience of both patients and staff. Among its negative effects are concerns about the unsuitability of remote consultation for some people with mental health conditions and the potential to widen the digital divide and exacerbate existing inequalities. Sociotechnical systems theory was found to be a suitable framework for understanding the range of systemic and sociotechnical factors that influence the use of technology in mental health care delivery in times of crisis and normalcy. Conclusions Although the use of IT has boosted mental health care delivery during the pandemic, it has had mixed effects on quality and efficiency. In general, patients have benefited from the convenience of remote consultation when face-to-face contact was impossible. In contrast, patient choice was often compromised, and patient experience and outcomes might have been affected for some people with mental health conditions for which remote consultation is less suitable. However, the full impact of IT on the quality and efficiency of mental health care provision along with the systemic and sociotechnical determinants requires more sustained and longitudinal research.",About Sufficiency

Will artificial intelligence make energy cleaner? Evidence of nonlinearity,"Energy plays a vital part in stimulating economic progress, and the shift towards a cleaner energy system is highly significant for ensuring the sustainable development of the economy. China's energy structure urgently needs to be transitioned. The fast advancement and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) has provided a new and important tool for promoting the transition of energy structure. So, what is the relationship between the application of artificial intelligence and the transition of the energy structure? This research introduces artificial intelligence into the energy sector, focusing on the relationship between artificial intelligence and energy transition. Since nonlinear models are better able to study the complex effects and phase differences of artificial intelligence. Using China's provincial panel data spanning from 2006 to 2019, this study employs nonlinear modeling to explore the stage differences in the process of AI in facilitating energy structure transformation. This paper derives the following findings based on empirical research. First, there is a U-shaped relationship between artificial intelligence and the transition of energy structure. Specifically, before the inflection point, the initial application of artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence may adversely impact energy transition. When the inflection point is passed, AI will help facilitate the energy transition. Second, the U-shaped relationship between AI and energy transition is more pronounced in coastal and non-resource-based regions. Third, energy intensity, government investment in science and technology, and informatization will moderate the U-shaped relationship between artificial intelligence and energy transition, changing the steepness of the original U-shaped relationship and even reversing it. Hence, it is imperative to effectively utilize the technological benefits of artificial intelligence through the development patterns and distinctive features of different regions, thereby facilitating the smooth transition of the energy structure.",About Sufficiency

To systematically investigate the impacts of the application of artificial intelligence in the workforce on household energy consumption in China, empirical analysis is conducted using data from the China General Social Survey (CGSS) from May to September 2022. The findings are as follows: (1) AI significantly reduces household energy consumption. Controlling other factors constant, for a one-standard-deviation increase in the impact of AI, household energy consumption drops by an average of 10.751%. Robustness and endogeneity tests, including dealing with missing values, using different energy consumption and AI indicators, as well as applying instrumental variable method, placebo test and penalized regressions, confirm this conclusion. (2) Mechanism analysis shows that AI reduces energy consumption by lowering household income and increasing their financial fragility. (3) AI's impacts on different types of energy consumption are heterogeneous. Its negative effects are mainly observed in the significant reduction of electricity and gas consumption. Furthermore, it increases the probability of using solid fuels such as honeycomb coal, coal lumps, traditional biomass, etc., thereby increasing the reliance on low-grade energy resources and raising the risk of energy poverty. (4) AI has greater negative effects on those who do not have access to energy subsidies and households with poor energy security and stability, lower income and inadequate social security. Besides, its impacts on regions with higher levels of technological development are more prominent. (5) Feasible pathways to mitigate the adverse effects of AI are explored. It is found that improving labor protection can help alleviate its adverse consequences on energy consumption. This paper provides evidence on the impacts of technological disruption from a demand-based perspective. It highlights the need for better policies on energy, social security, income distribution and labor protection to weaken AI's effects on household energy consumption and prevent them from falling into energy poverty.",About Sufficiency

Affording digital transformation: The role of industrial Internet platform in traditional manufacturing enterprises digital transformation,"This study aims to investigate the role of industrial Internet platform in facilitating the digital transformation of traditional manufacturing enterprises. While prior research has predominantly focused on industrial Internet platform enterprises, there is a noticeable dearth of research concerning traditional manufacturing enterprises lacking the resources to establish such platforms. To address this research gap, we conduct an exploratory case study and propose an affordances upgrade model that elucidates the digital business transformation process of these manufacturing enterprises leveraging industrial Internet platforms. The research findings can be summarized from two key perspectives. Firstly, the industrial Internet platform offers valuable technical support and potential opportunities for manufacturing enterprises to achieve digital business transformation through three distinct affordances: consonance, resonance, and adaptation. These affordances enable enterprises to align their operations with the capabilities and possibilities provided by the platform, thus facilitating their digital transformation. Secondly, to effectively harness these affordances, enterprises must strategically leverage the platform's technical services and systems in their production and operational practices. Through the accumulation of practical experiences, enterprises gradually transition their production modes from experience institutionalization and standardization to a state of refinement. The dynamic leapfrogging process of digital transformation in traditional manufacturing enterprises, facilitated by the industrial Internet platform, is reflected in the realization of these three affordances and their underlying resource capabilities. This research significantly contributes to the field by expanding the scope of inquiry to encompass traditional manufacturing enterprises and presenting a stage model for their digital transformation utilizing industrial Internet platform.",About Sufficiency
An empirical study on the response of the energy market to the shock from the artificial intelligence industry,"This paper makes the first attempt to look at the response of the energy market to the shock from the AI industry and the role of AI in the energy market risk spillover network. The innovation of the paper lies in adopting a quantile-based and time-varying framework in the empirical analysis. This enables us to reveal the cross-quantile and lead-lag correlations between AI and the energy market. We find that an extreme negative shock from AI tends to correspond to an extreme downward movement in crude oil, gasoline, gas oil, and clean energy markets and the shock response dissipates after 66 days. Meanwhile, the cross-quantile correlations are subject to structural changes once the extreme events arrive. As for the total spillover effect of the energy market, it increases by 5.34 % after AI is considered as a source of uncertainty in the risk spillover network dominated by the crude oil market. Thus, the shock from AI challenges the stability of the energy market. A close relationship between the AI industry and the clean energy market is also identified. We contribute to studying the relationship between the AI industry and the energy market from the perspective of the risk connectedness between the two fields.",About Sufficiency

Amid the intensifying challenges of global climate change and environmental degradation, the role of e-commerce in addressing broader issues such as air pollution has become increasingly significant. The pursuit of sustainable development goals places higher expectations on e-commerce platforms to enhance business ecosystems and contribute to air quality governance. The establishment of National E-commerce Demonstration Cities is a key policy initiative in China aimed at encouraging the healthy and rapid development of e-commerce. This paper seeks to evaluate the air purification effects of this policy initiative. To this end, we use data from 279 cities in China spanning the years 2005–2021 and employ a multi-period Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to examine the air purification effects and underlying mechanisms of e-commerce development. The findings reveal that the National E-commerce Demonstration City policy has significantly reduced air pollution. E-commerce development contributes to air purification by facilitating industrial structure upgrading and reducing energy consumption intensity. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the air purification effects of e-commerce are stronger in eastern and western regions of China, as well as in areas characterized by lower levels of marketization, logistics capacity, and urban consumption. Further analysis suggests that the air purification effects are more pronounced in regions with relatively moderate levels of air pollution. Finally, we provide policy recommendations and strategies for leveraging e-commerce development to effectively improve air quality in the future.",About Sufficiency
Carbon footprint of residents' online consumption in China,"Although China boasts the largest online consumption market, there has been no prior case study addressing the carbon footprint of online consumption. The rapid expansion of online consumption has posed a challenge to China's carbon neutrality pledge. This paper aims to fill this crucial gap by conducting a pioneering study based on survey data collected from 6000 households. To achieve this goal, this study has combined provincial Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) tables with residents' online consumption calculated by the Non-Linear Optimization model, and applied the Environmental Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) model to calculate the carbon footprint of residents' online consumption. Result indicated that the average carbon footprint of residents' online consumption was 0.46 tCO2e in 2016, accounting for 12.30% of the total consumption carbon footprint. Notably, high-emission regions include Beijing-Tianjin, Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai, and Hubei. Moreover, the dominant sources of the online consumption carbon footprint were electricity, food, clothing, and beauty products. Furthermore, we found that the carbon footprint of online consumption tends to increase with income, with differential income elasticities observed for various products and income groups. We also quantified the average expenditure-based life-cycle carbon coefficient for parcel delivery (0.22 kgCO2e/yuan) and conducted two scenario analyses to assess its impact. From a policy perspective, our research on measuring the carbon footprint of residents' online consumption can provide valuable insights for designing future policies and decisions related to e-commerce and key sectors along the supply chains.

Digital inclusive finance and energy transition towards carbon neutrality: Evidence from Chinese firms,"Given the ongoing digitalization process in financial sector, the interaction between the energy transition and digital inclusive finance (DIF) can potentially affect the decarbonization process towards carbon neutrality. This paper utilizes an unbalanced panel data of Chinese firms spanning from 2011 to 2015 to estimate the impact of DIF on firms' low carbon energy transition with a fixed-effect model. The findings reveal that the development of DIF has a significantly negative effect on firms' consumption of fossil fuels. These findings remain robust even after employing a series of robustness tests and implementing an instrumental variable approach to address potential endogeneity concerns. Investigations of the underlying mechanism reveal that DIF primarily promotes the energy transition by increasing firms' investment in information and communications technology (ICT) and green technologies. Moreover, DIF plays a particularly significant role in promoting the energy transition of non-state-owned firms, small firms, non-energy-intensive firms, and firms in the eastern region. This paper suggests leveraging the positive role of DIF in the energy transition of firms, especially by encouraging firms to invest in sustainable technologies to accelerate their energy transition. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for coordinated development of DIF in different regions and addresses the imbalance in firms' energy transition across these regions.",About Sufficiency

A participatory impact assessment of digital agriculture: A Bayesian network-based case study in Germany,"CONTEXT The transition to digital agriculture is likely to lead to systemic changes that will affect production, consumption, governance, and the wider environment of agricultural systems. Nevertheless, the absence of sufficient evidence and ambiguities in perspectives create an ongoing lack of clarity regarding the potential impacts of digital agriculture. Therefore, to discern potential impacts while addressing system complexities, uncertainties, as well as normative aspects associated with this transition, future-oriented and participatory assessments are needed that actively involve diverse knowledge and values of affected stakeholders. OBJECTIVE This research aims to explore the impacts and processes of agricultural digitalization according to stakeholders. The objectives are to identify key areas of impact that digital agriculture is likely to influence, identify and explore the causal pathways linking digital agriculture to impacts, and quantitatively examine the uncertainties of stakeholder perceptions associated with these impacts and causal pathways. METHODS Through a participatory modelling procedure, diverse stakeholders from the German region of Brandenburg constructed a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). The BBN facilitated the identification of the main impacts of digital agriculture and allowed for the modelling of uncertainties associated with these impacts. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Stakeholders perceived several socioeconomic advantages of digitalization, particularly in terms of bolstering economic stability through improved risk management and enhanced resource use efficiency, validating existing claims in the literature. The perception seems to be influenced by highly variable yields and market uncertainties, as well as shortages in labour in the region. On the other hand, there was significant uncertainty among stakeholders concerning landscape diversification and its impact on biodiversity. This uncertainty arises from the potential profitability of cultivating marginal land under heightened digitalization-induced efficiency, posing a risk of diminishing natural habitat and landscape heterogeneity. Local historical trends toward landscape simplification as result of technology-driven efficiency improvements may be a cause for this perception. SIGNIFICANCE This study contributes to a growing body of future-oriented research assessing the impacts of digital agriculture through engaging stakeholder knowledge and values. While there is theoretical potential for digitalization to enhance biodiversity, realizing such positive impacts is improbable without improved communication and policy incentives, given the historical trend of efficiency-driven pathways. This study introduces a novel approach to assessing the impacts of agricultural digitalization through the application of a participatory Bayesian belief network.",About Sufficiency

Environmental footprint of GenAI – Changing technological future or planet climate?,"The beginnings of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), led by Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), not only change the behaviour of digital media ecosystem users but also increase the energy consumption of enterprises working with GenAI, which presents them with a fundamental challenge in the era of climate change. This study aims to examine the relationships between the selected aspects of the use of GenAI tools and the environmental perception and behaviour of their users to understand the population's current environmental attitudes towards environmental risks and environmental sustainability. The survey was conducted in October 2024 on a sample of 1,268 respondents of the Czech Republic population. To process the data set, a logistic regression analysis, chi-squared test, Akaike information criterion, and Bayesian information criterion are employed. The results show that the more often people use GenAI tools, the more distant they consider the effects of climate change in time. The low frequency of use of ChatGPT may influence a higher willingness to change popular GenAI tools that are not maintained by environmentally friendly data centres. The frequency of ChatGPT use influences individuals’ perception of the importance of climate-change solving. The more frequently the respondents use artificial intelligence (AI) systems, they less perceive climate change as important. The low frequency of ChatGPT usage is associated with lower willingness to change email provider, transfer own data, leave social networks, stop using a favourite streaming platform and stop using a favourite GenAI platform. The respondents’ attitudes show a visible behavioural change. Internal personal motivation and self-confidence in learning, interest in career and self-confidence when using AI, the behavioural aspects, and the cognitive aspects are altered considerably. Based on the outcomes of the population survey, the study concludes that the issue of environmental friendliness of AI tools should become part of AI literacy that could strengthen population's willingness to use more energy-efficient GenAI platforms.

Privacy and Security Evaluation of Amazon Echo Voice Assistant,"The number of devices connected to the Internet across the world is above eight billion according to IoT Analytics statistics. There has been a 56% increase after 2016 and is estimated to keep increasing in the subsequent years. Considering the expansive reach of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart homes, it has transformed how people interact with technology and has generated a debate on subjects such as integrity and privacy. Even though there are many reports reviewing the Amazon Echo dot (which is a device used to control smart home via verbal commands), a few of which have literature review supporting. This study aims to examine Echo Dot (second generation), one of Amazon's most popular IoT devices, by conducting a behavioural evaluation as well as a security and privacy analysis. Moreover, certain relevant security and privacy threats will be examined. Echo Dot's behaviour was analysed to ensure an effective analysis as per the network traffic rate (bandwidth), while its consumption of power was monitored over three days in various circumstances such as normal, silent, and noisy days. These behaviours were then compared to determine any abnormal behaviour. The study also subjected the device to two types of attacks which are sound-based attack and network-based attack. It was observed that the behaviour of the device in silent and normal modes was as per the expectations, whereas in a noisy environment, it consumed more power and had a higher number of transmitted packets compared to the average ideal mode. It should be noted that a major advantage of the Echo Dot is that the majority of the logic takes place on the Amazon cloud servers behind the scenes. The study's analysis showed that the device offers less satisfactory security and privacy. It is estimated that though sound-based attacks have potential, further understanding regarding the system's inner workings is necessary. It was found that the device persevered against the network-based attack and encrypted all packets, and thus, it was not easy to obtain information from them. Moreover, it was ensured that this study was scalable and could be implemented for other smart home or VAs IoT devices for identifying security or privacy issues.",About Sufficiency

Evaluating Barriers to the Adoption of Delivery Drones in Rural Healthcare Supply Chains: Preparing the Healthcare System for the Future,"Emerging technologies, such as delivery drones have enormous potential to revolutionize the rural healthcare supply chain (RHSC) and assist the countries in achieving sustainable development goal 3: good health and well-being. The advantages of delivery drones include faster delivery, high responsiveness, and a lack of dependence on road infrastructure. Given these advantages, prior literature on drone delivery has extensively explored their applicability in last-mile delivery from the e-commerce or retailer's perspective. However, their applicability in RHSC from an academic as well as practical perspective is still at a nascent stage. The present study fills this gap by examining the barriers inhibiting the adoption of delivery drones in RHSC using the Grey Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique. The results suggest that “lack of government regulations” is the most critical barrier. The study findings indicate that seven barriers are causal, and six are the effect barriers. “Limited load carrying capacity,” “low flight range,” and “difficulty in flying in adverse weather conditions” are the most prominent cause barriers. Moreover, “lack of skilled manpower,” “limited accuracy of navigation system,” and “lack of leadership commitment” are the most prominent effect barriers. We also perform sensitivity analysis to prove the robustness of the study output.

Synergies and Conflicts: Evaluating AI and 5G Technologies Role in Saudi Arabia’s Drought Management Strategy,"Water scarcity across the world and specifically in Saudi Arabia is exacerbated by climatic conditions such as desalinated resources, limited rainfall, reliance on ground water and arid climate. For addressing this issue, governments around the globe have implemented numerous measures leveraging advanced technology like AI and 5G for developed drought management systems. This paper aims to evaluate the synergies and conflicts of Saudi Arabi’s national policies with those of international standards (agreements, conventions and SDGs). The methodology of this paper is based on qualitative content analysis of Saudi Arabia’s policies (Mission 2030, National Innovation Plan and National Water Management Strategy 2030) with those of international agreements (Paris Agreement, UN Convention for combatting desertification & GPAI framework) and SDGs (6, 9, and 13). Python tools and libraries (pandas, nltk, sklearn, OpenPyXL and Networkx) are used for data processing, keyword extraction, themes identification, results extraction and their representation. The intersection of extracted themes has provided results that Mission 2030 and drought management strategy of KSA perfectly aligns with all the selected international agreements and SDGs. However, National Water Strategy 2030 merely aligns with UN Convention and SDG 6. On the other hand, National Innovation Plan of KSA overlaps with the themes of UN Convention, GPAI, SDG 13 and SDG 6 in a perfect manner. The analysis has shed clear light on the KSA’s policies alignment with international standards forecasting the Mission 2030 and drought management strategy in it. Even though the National Water Strategy aligns with merely two standards, it could be a limitation due to limited data set, thematic levels and keyword extraction instead of full text document analysis.

Economics and Equity of Large Language Models: Health Care Perspective,"Large language models (LLMs) continue to exhibit noteworthy capabilities across a spectrum of areas, including emerging proficiencies across the health care continuum. Successful LLM implementation and adoption depend on digital readiness, modern infrastructure, a trained workforce, privacy, and an ethical regulatory landscape. These factors can vary significantly across health care ecosystems, dictating the choice of a particular LLM implementation pathway. This perspective discusses 3 LLM implementation pathways—training from scratch pathway (TSP), fine-tuned pathway (FTP), and out-of-the-box pathway (OBP)—as potential onboarding points for health systems while facilitating equitable adoption. The choice of a particular pathway is governed by needs as well as affordability. Therefore, the risks, benefits, and economics of these pathways across 4 major cloud service providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle) are presented. While cost comparisons, such as on-demand and spot pricing across the cloud service providers for the 3 pathways, are presented for completeness, the usefulness of managed services and cloud enterprise tools is elucidated. Managed services can complement the traditional workforce and expertise, while enterprise tools, such as federated learning, can overcome sample size challenges when implementing LLMs using health care data. Of the 3 pathways, TSP is expected to be the most resource-intensive regarding infrastructure and workforce while providing maximum customization, enhanced transparency, and performance. Because TSP trains the LLM using enterprise health care data, it is expected to harness the digital signatures of the population served by the health care system with the potential to impact outcomes. The use of pretrained models in FTP is a limitation. It may impact its performance because the training data used in the pretrained model may have hidden bias and may not necessarily be health care–related. However, FTP provides a balance between customization, cost, and performance. While OBP can be rapidly deployed, it provides minimal customization and transparency without guaranteeing long-term availability. OBP may also present challenges in interfacing seamlessly with downstream applications in health care settings with variations in pricing and use over time. Lack of customization in OBP can significantly limit its ability to impact outcomes. Finally, potential applications of LLMs in health care, including conversational artificial intelligence, chatbots, summarization, and machine translation, are highlighted. While the 3 implementation pathways discussed in this perspective have the potential to facilitate equitable adoption and democratization of LLMs, transitions between them may be necessary as the needs of health systems evolve. Understanding the economics and trade-offs of these onboarding pathways can guide their strategic adoption and demonstrate value while impacting health care outcomes favorably.",About Sufficiency

"Pathways to sustainable transportation in G-20 countries: Unveiling the role of green technology, green energy, green finance and digital economy using panel data and machine learning analyses","Achieving sustainability has become a global priority, with environmental sustainability gaining significant attention from policymakers due to its critical importance. While numerous studies have empirically examined the relationship between CO2 emissions and green initiatives, they often overlook sectoral differences. Since different sectors contribute unequally to carbon emissions, the environmental effectiveness of green solutions may vary across sectors. This study addresses this research gap by focusing on the transport sector, a major contributor to global CO2 emissions. This study investigates the role of green technology, green energy, green finance, digital economy, economic growth, and urbanization on transport sector CO2 emissions in G-20 economies from 2002 to 2022. Using panel quantile regression, the results reveal that green energy and economic growth reduce transport emissions in lower quantiles; while green energy, green finance, and urbanization enhance environmental quality in upper quantiles. However, green technology is associated with higher transport emissions across all quantiles. Moreover, we employ a simple regression tree model, a machine learning approach, to identify which countries are winners and losers in terms of predicted transport emissions. Our results predict a 13.72 % increase in transport emissions across G-20 nations, with Japan, Australia, Saudi Arabia, the United States, Argentina, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, France, Brazil, India, and Italy among the most affected.

The Adoption of Big Data Concepts for Sustainable Practices Implementation in the Construction Industry,"The global construction business is on a point of a paradigm shift. The exponential growth of digital technologies, the increasing impacts of climate change, impending Brexit and looming social and environmental pressures are driving change to the construction industry. Increasingly policies press for the adoption of sustainability and construction organisations are realising that small sustainable impacts are no longer enough. Therefore, measurement is one of the keys to the implementation of sustainable construction strategies. Advances in data gathering, computing power and connectivity mean that construction organisations have more information and data than ever before. Collecting, analysing and understanding those large volumes of available data, known as Big Data, about how an organisation operates sustainably leads to knowledge that can improve decision making, refine goals and focus efforts. However, when it comes to sustainability the great thing about big data is that it is unlocking the ability of businesses to understand and act on what is typically their biggest sustainable (i.e. economic, social and environmental) impacts - the ones outside their control. Measuring and understanding how doing business really does affect the natural world will open new opportunities for bringing sustainability inside an organisation: creating change, cutting costs and boosting long-term profitability in a resource-constrained world. Still, there are issues and challenges around gathering sustainability-related data, as well as in analysing and interpreting of data points. Therefore, the aim of this research is to explore the barriers to adopting big data related to sustainable strategies. The relationship between Policy Making, Big Data and sustainability is still in early stages, but already several applications can be mention to the environment, health and construction, such as biodiversity loss monitoring, pollution zones Identification, endangered species location, smart energy management, cost reduction or investment assessment. In the same way, barriers and opportunities were identified, for instance: the lack of financial resources and business case, skills and training, unequal opportunity and security and disclosure issues among the barriers, and partnership, emerging and accessible technology, personalization of the environment among the opportunities. Finally, the biggest challenge presented by the implementation of Big Data is concept standardization, since there are many areas in which one way or another is making use of this technology without being recognized as such. In the same way, the greatest asset that represents the use of Big Data for sustainability is the identification of the future causes and consequences of climate change and its subsequent prevention or mitigation in time.",About Sufficiency
An updated investigation about climate-change hazards that might impact electric infrastructures,"Climate change will affect all types of infrastructure, including energy system. Rising temperatures, increased flood risk and other potential hazards will threaten the reliable and efficient energy supply with potentially large economic and social impacts. To strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards for the Italian electric sector, several adaptation and mitigation actions are to be implemented. In order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts and vulnerabilities, some updated climate change scenarios have been elaborated over Italy on the basis of high-resolution climate models provided by the EU-funded Project Euro-CORDEX with horizontal resolution of 0.11°(~ 12 km) under the Representative Concentration Pathway RCP 8.5. The climate change scenarios have been characterized at seasonal scale, by comparing the current climate (1971–2000) with projections at short (FUT1=2021-2050), medium (2041–2070) and long (FUT2=2071-2100) terms. Without mitigation actions, the more significant results highlight a warming of about 2°C in the next decades, 3°C in the mid of the century, and more than 5°C in the last thirty-years period. Moreover a precipitation decrease is expected, with significant reduction in the summer ranging in between 10 and 20 % in the first half of the century, until 50 % at the end of it. Hot days and coastal floods show the most dramatic rise, but the risks of inland flooding will depend on both the season and the Italian region. Wet-snow events are projected to decrease considerably in the areas nowadays affected by these phenomena, whereas they are likely to increase significantly over Alps, kept free of wet-snow until now. Larger uncertainties characterize the Central and Northern Apennines where the signal is almost absent and no useful information can be inferred for these areas.",About Sufficiency

BlockPPA: Blockchain-Assisted Privacy-Preserving Authentication for Cross-Domain Electric Vehicle Charging,"Electric vehicles (EVs) bring convenience to public transport while having the potential to increase energy efficiency. With the rapid growth of the number of EVs, cross-domain charging will become a strong demand. Despite massive research on EV charging, existing schemes can hardly meet the security requirements of privacy protection and access control for cross-domain scenarios. Meanwhile, centralized methods bring the single point of failure and data modification.

Data-driven approach for measuring and curbing Green House Gases (GHG) Emissions in the Supply Chain of India,"Global warming has caused significant negative consequences for developing countries like India. The carbon market was considered as an effective solution for curbing Green House Gases (GHG) emissions, which is considered as the primary reason for global warming. Carbon market was established in the Kyoto protocol among developed economies and later extended to developing economies through the Paris Agreement. The international carbon market did not return satisfactory results. However, the Chinese domestic carbon market returned good results motivating the Indian government to create a strategy, policy, and plan for the Indian domestic carbon market. Through a strategic conceptual framework, this research has tried to establish a hypothetical theory that success of carbon market in the supply chain of India would require data-driven approach to measuring and curbing GHG emissions caused by the polluting entities. Data-driven approach helps in policy making and actions based on actual measurements instead of speculations. The strategic conceptual framework shows interfacing between the domains of Indian carbon credits policy and the data-driven approach through two government-sponsored and controlled systems: a market exchange and a blockchain. Other components proposed are an accounting system of carbon credits on big data systems and entity-specific cloud-hosted data systems supported by Artificial Intelligence. This research proposed that carbon credits should not be traded as an alternative to implementing technologies and innovations for GHG emissions, and should not have expiry dates. The model may perform better than the European model as it is based on the top-down approach (based on China), adopts Industry 4.0 technologies, active measurements and accounting, smart contracts, and data-driven enforcements.

As expected, AFV adoption in DACs (12.96%) is lower than non-DACs (15.30%). More public charging stations strongly correlate with AFV adoption in DACs. Tech-oriented households in DACs are more likely to adopt AFVs compared with non-DACs. The findings also point to the significant effects of home charging facilities while adopting AFVs in DACs. The XAI results emphasize the importance of socio-economic factors in AFV adoption programs and provide insights into decision-making in DACs. This research contributes to the literature on AFV adoption and suggests opportunities for improvements in DACs transitioning to AFVs.

Due to intermittent nature of renewable energy and fluctuating grid energy price, advanced data centers often deploy distributed UPS systems with high efficiency, scalability, and reliability. In this study, we investigate the problem of energy management for data centers with renewable resources and energy storages. We propose an interface-backbone layer framework designed unified energy efficiency management system called REDUX, which properly allocate fluctuating renewable energy, UPS battery energy storage or grid power with dynamic price aiming to minimize the long-term electricity bill for the data center. With prediction of renewable energy supply, categorization of grid power price level and energy storage in the UPS devices, REDUX orchestrates workload distribution with heuristic algorithms which act as renewable energy smoothing, UPS device control, and high level control strategies, and make back-fills or defer decisions for the non-urgent jobs.

The role of data centres in the future Danish energy system,"Data centres (DCs) are expected to satisfy the rising demand for internet services. Denmark alone is expected to host several large-scale DCs, whose demand for electricity in 2040 may reach 33% of 2017 national electricity consumption. Understanding the operation and interactions of DCs with energy systems is key to understanding their impacts on installed capacities, costs and emissions. The present paper makes three contributions in this regard. First, we introduce a thermodynamic model that relates the power consumption of DCs to their production of excess heat (EH). Second, the results are scaled up to represent DCs in a national energy-system model for the analysis of different scenarios. Third, scenarios are generated and analysed to quantify the impact of DCs on the Danish energy system until 2050. The results show that DCs might have significant impacts on Denmark’s power and district heating (DH) sectors. First, the power demand from DCs translates into an additional 3–6 GW of offshore wind capacity. Second, EH from DCs is beneficial to the whole energy system, the entire quantity of EH being utilized in four out of five scenarios.

A number of features could greatly enhance and quicken the circular economy. Artificial intelligence (AI) and eco-investment are two of the most important ones. The primary objective of this article is to assess the impact of artificial intelligence and eco-investment on the development of circular economy in the context of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) - 12. The authors designed a panel regression model to ascertain the influence on CE. In this model, CE is the dependent variable, whereas AI and eco-investment are the independent variables. Over a ten-year period, data and information from 27 EU member states were employed in the modelling. The strong results demonstrate that, albeit having a lesser impact than eco-investment, AI has a substantial impact on CE. The model created exhibits flexibility that permits the estimation of distinct equations for any country under consideration. One crucial finding is that there are slow processes that may take many years to complete in order to meet deadlines and require a substantial sum of money. One more point of attention is the replacement that occurs between the two independent variables. Up to a certain point, it is feasible to replace one variable with another while accounting for unique features of every country.

The effect of digital technology on residential and non-residential carbon emission,"This paper provides a comprehensive examination of the effects of digital technology on residential and non-residential CO2 emissions in 277 Chinese cities from 2010 to 2019. The study estimates energy-based carbon emissions (calculated by bottom-up approach) and net carbon emissions (calculated by top-down approach) simultaneously, offering a holistic view. Mediating, moderation, and threshold regression models are employed to uncover the influencing mechanisms. The findings, which have practical implications, reveal that digital technology has a dual effect: it promotes residential CO2 emissions but inhibits non-residential CO2 emissions. This effect is consistent for both energy-based and net carbon emissions. The overall correlation with energy-based carbon emissions is negative, while the relationship between digital technology and total net CO2 emissions is weakly positive. Specifically, digital technology intensifies residential CO2 emissions by influencing individuals’ behaviors such as consumption, employment, and education. It also indirectly affects non-residential CO2 emissions by promoting economic growth, influencing economic structure, and promoting foreign investment. In detail, the study verifies the inverted U-shape relationship between economic growth and carbon emission and the pollution halo hypothesis.

Proposal for an e-waste management system for the United States,"Quantities of end-of-life electronics (or e-waste) around the world keep growing. More than 1.36 million metric tons of e-waste were discarded in the U.S. in 2005, mainly in landfills, and e-waste is projected to grow in future years. This paper explores issues relating to planning future e-waste regulation and management systems in the U.S. It begins by reviewing the existing U.S. recycling systems to establish the importance of developing public responses. The paper then discusses what specific conditions are expected to influence the acceptability and implementation domestically. A key consideration is the cultural imperative in the U.S. for market-driven solutions that enable competition. Given this context, a solution is proposed that is designed to ensure a proper end-of-life management while at the same time establishing a competitive market for reuse and recycling services. The solution, termed e-market for returned deposit, begins with a deposit paid by consumers to sellers at the time of purchase, electronically registered and tracked via a radio-frequency identification device (RFID) placed on the product. At end-of-life, consumers consult an Internet-enabled market in which firms compete to receive the deposit by offering consumers variable degrees of return on the deposit. After collection of the computer by the selected firm, the cyberinfrastructure utilizes the RFID to transfer the deposit to the winning firm when recycled.

A novel Approach for Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation in Smart Grid,"Over the last few years, the rapid development of smart grids and the deployment of smart metering infrastructures on a much larger scale have raised a crucial privacy concern related to the collection of real-time energy consumption data.

Carbon footprint calculation in telecommunications companies – The importance and relevance of scope 3 greenhouse gases emissions,"Energy efficiency measures and climate policies are closely related to strategic concerns of companies, and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become an important indicator of energy efficiency measures. This paper discusses the application aspects of organizational carbon footprint (CF) for telecommunications companies. In order to better understand the structure of overall (direct and indirect) GHG emission, the model for calculating the organizational CF was established for the case of a telecom operator in its initial stages of carbon policy. In order to understand the importance of scope 3 categories in the overall CF, calculated results were compared to CF results reported by three other European telecommunications operators. The results for a particular case based on Slovenian operator revealed that the largest contributor to GHG emissions is the consumption of purchased electricity. The employees’ commute to and from work, the use of company-owned vehicles, and heating represent the next major sources of GHG emissions. It was shown that the most contributive upstream scope 3 aspects are similar for various European telecommunication operators and that exclusion of some categories along the supply chain may give a distorted image of organizational CF. However, the comparative analysis revealed that using only the company's own-recorded in-house data can be far from sufficient to make conclusions which GHG emissions scope contributes the highest share to the overall organizational CF of telecommunications companies. In this context, this paper reveals new findings on the relevance of CF determination for telecommunications companies as a guideline for reconsidering their energy efficiency and sustainability plans.",About Sufficiency

Life cycle inventory and carbon footprint assessment of wireless ICT networks for six demographic areas,"The aim of this work is to quantify, assess, and identify hotspots in the environmental sustainability of newly constructed ICT networks designed to provide internet access (4 G LTE mobile technology) to regions still lacking this service. The analysis has been carried out on six demographic areas, from high-density urban and peri‑urban to remote rural, using ISO 14,040. A Dynamic Inventory Model (DIM) relating demographic/connectivity features with foreground material and energy inventories was validated using real data from Peru. The results showed carbon footprints between 81 and 103 kg CO2 eq./subscription/year, equivalent to 1.35 – 1.73 kg CO2 eq./Gb. Most of this (between 68 and 86%) correspond to end user devices, primarily in the form of embodied emissions. Operational emissions account for about one-third of the total and derive primarily from the electricity consumed by end user devices, and to a lower extent by access networks and data centers. Linear correlations were observed between operational - embodied carbon emissions and the number of subscribers. This trend was overturned in very small ICT networks designed to serve sparsely populated rural areas, due to higher energy consumption and carbon emissions per functional unit generated by access and IP network components.

"Sustainable Development of Information Systems Using SysML, FAS and DOL","The use of product families can improve the efficiency of product development as opposed to develop a single-product by reusing existing artefacts and optimizing variability, which leads to a saving of resources and is therefore a sustainable approach. To extend new variants of an already modelled product via the approach of a product family the challenge is to merge the product models, so that the same and varying parts in the model are semantically correct identified and mapped to each other. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for sustainable development of product families using the Distributed Ontology Language (DOL), Functional Architectures for Systems (FAS), and Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The proposed approach integrates the idea of DOL to represent an ontology of sustainability criteria and to map them to the functional architecture of a product family. FAS is used to model the functional architecture of the product family, while the FAS ontology is used to formalize the functional architecture and provide a standardized vocabulary and set of rules for modelling the functional aspects of the product family. SysML is used to model the product family. The proposed method is demonstrated through a case study of developing a sustainable product family of vacuum cleaner robots. The results show that the proposed method can help to identify opportunities for reducing environ-mental impact and improving social responsibility in the product family design while ensuring that functional requirements and design constraints are met semantically correct.",About Sufficiency

Supply Chain in the Context of 5G Technology Security and Legal Aspects,"The 5G networks will be governed by laws on supply chain cybersecurity since they are crucial for the digital transformation of the economy and societies [1]. Numerous European documents emphasize cyber vulnerabilities in the supply chain and call on Member States to pass legislation allowing suppliers to be risk-assessed. According to the EU Toolbox, these analyses should consider technical and non- technical concerns, such as the supplier's dependency on foreign nations [2]. Many countries have yet to implement legislation in this area, and the proposed law establishing a national cybersecurity system still lacks provisions for identifying high- risk vendors. The primary factor evaluated in the risk assessment will be a threat to national security. These criteria must be explained, and they may become more so in the future due to the specifics of the processes (restricted right to participate in proceedings, limited access to information).

Digitalization and CO2 emissions: Dynamics under R&D and technology innovation regimes,"New digital technologies help to curtail those that are carbon intensive but are accompanied by CO2 emissions due to their own energy demand. Whether digitalization relates to increased or decreased carbon emissions may depend on the sophistication of an economy's research and development (R&D) output. This study explores the R&D-induced regime transition that governs the relationship between digitalization and CO2 emissions. The study seeks evidence of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis and tests it with a panel smooth transition regression (PSTR). Employing this estimator with two R&D output regimes makes it possible to account for year- and country-varying effects of digitalization, human capital, and country income level on CO2 emission. The research covers 55 high- and middle-income economies from 1996 to 2019. The paper finds that the transition process is driven by R&D output level – measured in technology patents per country inhabitants. The findings support the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis and confirm that CO2 emissions have an inverted U-shaped relationship with digitalization and income level. This nonlinear relationship transitions smoothly in the exogenous R&D output level. The digitalization indicator in the lower R&D regime has a significant point estimate of 0.07; in the higher regime, the estimate is −0.14. The R&D output threshold at which the transition function switches between the two regimes corresponds to a level of 39.9 technology patents per million inhabitants.",About Sufficiency

Hitherto, the role of its technical and infrastructural composition that drives carbon footprint from an ecological perspective is rarely discussed in the literature. Here, we use machine learning and econometric techniques to analyze the past, present, and future changes in Bitcoin's carbon footprint with daily data spanning July 18, 2010 to December 04, 2021. We document technical drivers, decomposition effects, causal nexus, and implications of the Bitcoin blockchain's increasing energy and carbon footprint. We show that Bitcoin's technical drivers could have potential impacts on Bitcoin's carbon footprint, and subsequently, global climate change. For example, the network's hashrate increases mining difficulty––thereby increasing Bitcoin's energy consumption and subsequently, carbon footprint. We observed a direct association between the marginal effect of block size and transaction count––implying that a higher block size improves transaction efficiency and then reduces Bitcoin's energy and carbon footprint. Besides, low mining difficulty increases market capitalization whereas increasing mining difficulty reduces bitcoin mining profit in the long run. This infers the reward for mining Bitcoin has a diminishing return in the long term. Thus, the adoption of advanced hardware for Bitcoin mining will spur energy and carbon intensity, yet will have a low return on investment.

This study addresses this research gap through descriptive, hierarchical cluster and non-parametric analyses (Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman rank correlations) of the use of DTs for circular economy and sustainability management based on data collected in a structured telephone survey with 132 sustainability managers and CEOs of Austrian manufacturing companies. The paper shows for the first time the degree and stage of implementation of four key enabling DTs for a sustainable circular economy and 31 specific applications of those DTs across eight different industries. Of the four DTs, Internet of Things (IoT) technology is most widely implemented, followed by big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology. However, their use in sustainability management is still very limited and is currently mainly in pilot phases. Of the 31 applications surveyed, IoT technology is most frequently used for collecting data from production processes, AI for predictive maintenance, big data analytics for demand forecasting, and blockchain technology for tracking product origins. Statistically significant differences were found in the degree of digitalization, in general, and for sustainability management between industries and company sizes. A strong positive correlation between the implementation of digital technologies in general and their use in a sustainability management context indicates synergies and spillover effects. The findings may help to tailor context-specific and purpose-driven strategies that selectively leverage the benefits of different DTs and supporting sustainability management effectively. Further research may identify scalable best practices, optimal enabling conditions, and environmental and social outcomes.",About Sufficiency

Enhancing Digital Autonomy in Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading: A Blockchain and Predictive Analytics Approach,"Distributed power generation from renewable energy sources is rapidly expanding and is serving as a clean energy alternative to fossil fuel-based energy sources, which pose significant environmental and health hazards. However, individuals still lack access to electricity and experience unreliable power supplies and services as demand increases. Energy distribution is still centralized, resulting in various challenges for users and contributing to disparities in energy distribution among individuals. To address these challenges, the predictive analytics approach and blockchain are employed together, while maintaining digital control and privacy for all participants in the decentralised energy trading system. The users can utilize their own historical energy consumption data to predict their own future energy requirements for the next period. Also, the prosumers (who both produce and consume energy) can predict their renewable energy generation. After analysing their consumption and generations users can use smart contracts to schedule and transfer energies over the blockchain network. This system guarantees transparency and security in energy trading between utility providers, prosumers, and consumers. The blockchain and smart contracts enables energy to be distributed fairly and automatically. This decentralization ensures digital autonomy within the energy trading system by enabling users to set their trading preferences, control their energy resources and data independently. This system with blockhain in energy trading builds trust among the participants. This proposed energy trading system is evaluated using a real world energy consumption and generation time series dataset of residential households. The proposed models for prediction are developed using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The results of both the models are compared using performance metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE).

Twin transitions across enterprises: Do digital technologies and sustainability go together?,"This paper examines linkages between digitalisation and information and communication technology (ICT)-related environmental sustainability business practices. Using a unified modelling framework and firm-level data from Ireland over 2020–2022, it provides novel evidence on complementarities between the use of digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) and the propensity of firms to adopt ICT-related environmental sustainability measures. The results indicate that the adoption of ICT-related sustainability measures has been uneven across groups of firms, sectors, and regions. The descriptive evidence shows that the most adopted measures are disposing of or recycling ICT equipment while the least adopted measures are measures to reduce the energy consumption of ICT equipment. The estimation results indicate that digitalisation is associated with a higher propensity of firms to adopt ICT-related sustainability practices over and above other firm characteristics such as firm size, employing ICT specialists, and investing in intangible assets. Firms using AI are more likely to adopt ICT-related sustainability practices. Taken together, the results of this paper suggest that targeted policy measures to incentivize more firms, in particular small and medium-sized, to adopt digital technologies and ICT-related environmental sustainability measures, could foster the twin digital and green transitions.",About Sufficiency

All other assumptions, such as building envelope, lighting, HVAC efficiencies and schedules, were based on the minimal requirements of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 at various vintages. We introduced a novel concept of supply and return air approach temperatures to capture the essential effects of non-uniform airflow and temperature distribution in data centers. The approach temperatures were pre-computed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for various configurations of ITE loads and airflow containment management in data centers. A new feature was developed in EnergyPlus to implement the approach temperature method. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the use of the data center models. The two data center models cover all U.S. climate zones and can be used to evaluate energy saving measures for data centers, as well as to support development of data center energy efficiency codes and standards.",About Sufficiency

Unsupervised machine learning techniques for energy consumption tariff design,"Dealing with electricity demand fluctuations throughout peak and off-peak periods is challenging for electricity companies. During peak demand times, the grid should be able to match the high consumer needs. Conversely, minimal usage during off-peak periods leads to underutilization of generation capacity. This imbalance challenges utilities to ensure sufficient capacity and devise fair pricing models. The Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing model has emerged as a viable solution in many countries, encouraging consumers to shift their energy consumption from expensive peak hours to more affordable off-peak periods. To this end, this paper proposes unsupervised machine learning methods for designing ToU tariffs using only energy consumption time series data. Additionally, a new metric is introduced to evaluate the adaptability of the ToU methods to fluctuations in energy consumption.

A Multi-task Model for Emotion and Offensive Aided Stance Detection of Climate Change Tweets,"In this work, we address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action by focusing on identifying public attitudes toward climate change on social media platforms such as Twitter. Climate change is threatening the health of the planet and humanity. Public engagement is critical to address climate change. However, climate change conversations on Twitter tend to polarize beliefs, leading to misinformation and fake news that influence public attitudes, often dividing them into climate change believers and deniers. Our paper proposes an approach to classify the attitude of climate change tweets (believe/deny/ambiguous) to identify denier statements on Twitter. Most existing approaches for detecting stances and classifying climate change tweets either overlook deniers’ tweets or do not have a suitable architecture. The relevant literature suggests that emotions and higher levels of toxicity are prevalent in climate change Twitter conversations, leading to a delay in appropriate climate action. Therefore, our work focuses on learning stance detection (main task) while exploiting the auxiliary tasks of recognizing emotions and offensive utterances. We propose a multimodal multitasking framework MEMOCLiC that captures the input data using different embedding techniques and attention frameworks, and then incorporates the learned emotional and offensive expressions to obtain an overall representation of the features relevant to the stance of the input tweet. Extensive experiments conducted on a novel curated climate change dataset and two benchmark stance detection datasets (SemEval-2016 and ClimateStance-2022) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",About Sufficiency

However, little is known about how individuals from under-resourced communities and low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds, can practically leverage maker practices to design technology, creating value for themselves or their communities. To investigate this, we collaborated with an e-waste recycling centre, involving 24 participants (staff and low-SES volunteers) in two participatory maker workshop activities. Participants were provided with a generative e-waste toolkit, through which they repurposed e-waste materials and developed novel technology prototypes that created value from their perspectives and agendas. Our findings unpack three factors that influenced their making: balancing personal and community needs; incorporating convenience and productivity; and re-thinking sustainability and connection; and discuss strategies for scaffolding participation and engagement of under-resourced communities in making using an e-waste generative toolkit to democratize technology design.",About Sufficiency

Towards an energy-efficient Data Center Network based on deep reinforcement learning,"Data Center Network (DCN) plays a crucial role in orchestrating the physical or virtual resources in data centers to meet the requirements of Internet of Things and Cloud Computing. The energy efficiency should be seriously considered for DCNs with large-scale switch devices which support numerous realtime network flow demands, especially for enormous flow demands from IoT devices. Typically, the network energy conservation can be achieved by optimizing routing and flow scheduling with energy awareness, targeting at powering off as many idle and low-loaded network devices as possible. For energy efficiency objective, in this paper we address a combinatorial optimization problem, named Multi-Commodity Flow (MCF) problem which optimizes the bandwidth allocation and routing to reduce the energy consumption. We propose a framework which has the lookahead ability of predicting flow demands in DCNs to dynamically feed the MCF problem as inputs. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is exploited for flow demand prediction in DCNs and a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is tailored for solving the MCF problem.

Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) and AI-driven edge–cloud services can address challenges such as early disease detection, system performance, data management and environmental sustainability in cloud-centric healthcare environments. To address these challenges, we propose HealthAIoT, a new architecture that utilises AIoT with cloud computing services to create a smart healthcare system. In our current implementation, HealthAIoT assesses the risk of developing diabetes mellitus in healthy individuals based on their personal health metrics and medical history; however, the proposed framework is fundamentally designed to be disease-agnostic and can be extended to incorporate detection and monitoring for other diseases. The HealthAIoT architecture consists of two main modules: a diabetes predictor and a cloud scheduler. The diabetes prediction module and cloud scheduler both utilise Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models. The cloud scheduler manages health-related data and application requests from IoT devices, optimising resource utilisation and minimising the environmental impact of cloud services. The performance of the HealthAIoT framework is tested using the realistic testbed CloudAIBus. Experimental results demonstrate that the MLP-based diabetes predictor achieves 78.30% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.7719 on unseen patient data while cloud scheduler achieves 93.6% accuracy. Further, system performance is evaluated using metrics including energy consumption, carbon-free energy usage, cost, execution time, and latency.

This study addresses a significant gap in the literature by examining the relationship among electricity digitalization, supply chain digitalization, energy intensity, environment-related technologies, globalization, and economic growth on consumption-based CO2 emissions in the E7 nations from 1995 to 2023. Based on the Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MMQR), Bootstrap Quantile Regression (BSQR), and pairwise Dimitrescu causality tests, this study provides new findings on the drivers of CO2 emissions in these countries. The findings of the MMQR reveal that electricity digitalization, supply chain digitalization, energy intensity, and economic growth enhance CO2 emissions. Conversely, the results demonstrate that developing environment-related technology and globalization decreases CO2 emissions. It implies that even though digitalization, energy intensity, and economic growth may lead to emission intensification, there is evidence that it should reduce emission intensification through technological advancement, embracing green technologies and focusing intensely on environmental sustainability. Additionally, BSQR produced results similar to those of MMQR. The efficiencies highlighted in this study serve as important signals for policymakers.

The influence of carbon perception on sustainable behaviors: Tailoring sustainability strategies based on individuals' levels of openness to green technology adoption,"Global concerns over rising carbon emissions emphasize the critical role of individual actions in mitigating climate change. Technology provides a powerful means to support sustainable behavior, offering tools that help individuals monitor, manage, and reduce their carbon footprints effectively. This study extends the value-belief-norm theory to examine how perceived carbon impact influences sustainable behavior, focusing on how openness to green technology adoption (traditionalists versus technology enthusiasts) moderates this relationship. We explore both direct and indirect pathways from perceived carbon impact to sustainable behavior, with environmental awareness and intention to adopt green technology as key mediators. Using multigroup structural equation modeling, data from 542 users of a carbon footprint platform in Thailand were analyzed. Results reveal distinct pathways: traditionalists rely on an indirect route where perceived carbon impact promotes sustainable behavior through enhanced environmental awareness and intention, while technology enthusiasts display a direct link between perceived carbon impact and sustainable behavior. Despite these differences, the overall effect of perceived carbon impact on sustainable behavior remains similar across groups. These findings underscore the need for targeted sustainability interventions.

When Does Saving Power Save the Planet?,"The computing industry accounts for 2% of the world's emissions. Power-efficient computing is a frequent topic of research, but saving power does not always save the environment. Jevons' paradox states that resource savings from increases in efficiency will be more than compensated for by increased demand by a process called rebound — making these ineffective ways to decrease emissions.This is not the case for all applications within computing: applications whose demand is inelastic with respect to power consumption can have reduced power consumption. We analyze several large fields within computer science, including ML, the Internet and IoT, and provide directions on where power efficiency savings will help reduce carbon emissions.We present the economic tools needed to decide whether power-efficiency improvements are likely to result in reduced or increased emissions.

Tracks to tech equity: How high-speed rail bridges the digital divide within cities? Prefecture-level evidence from China,"As a cross-regional infrastructure and major public project, high-speed rail (HSR) can significantly impact regional economic development, but few studies focus on its effects on intra-regional inequality. This study takes the opening of HSR stations as a quasi-natural experiment and employs a staggered difference-in-differences (DID) model to empirically examine the characteristics and mechanisms of HSR's impact on intra-city digital inequality. The results show that: (1) The opening of HSR stations reduces digital inequality within a city, mainly because it significantly enhances the digital development level of disadvantaged counties compared to advantaged ones. (2) Mechanism analysis indicates that HSR reduces the digital divide by stimulating innovation equilibrium, financial equilibrium, and local fiscal revenue equilibrium effects within a city. (3) Heterogeneity analysis shows that HSR significantly impacts internal digital inequality only in high-slope, economically underdeveloped, and peripheral areas. (4) Spatial tests reveal that HSR also helps reduce digital inequality within neighboring cities. This study not only enriches the theoretical understanding of the economic effects of HSR development but also provides policy insights on how regions can eliminate digital inequality and close intra-regional digital divides.",About Sufficiency

Embracing the new era: Artificial intelligence and its multifaceted impact on the hospitality industry,"The hospitality industry stands at the cusp of a revolutionary transformation spurred by the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This paper explores the challenges and opportunities associated with AI integration in an arena historically reliant on the nuances of the human touch. The research illuminates the potential for AI to redefine facets of the hospitality experience, from augmenting customer interactions to refining service delivery and catalysing economic growth. It examines the potential for AI to infuse the hospitality industry with unprecedented levels of efficiency and personalised service while also addressing the complexities introduced by this digital evolution. The pivot towards AI is not without its impediments. Technological constraints, such as the significant investment required for the deployment of AI and the compatibility with existing systems, pose substantial barriers. Cultural resistance emerges from a workforce accustomed to traditional service norms, and ethical dilemmas surface over customer data use and machine-based interactions' impersonal nature. This research delineates these impediments, offering a panoramic view of the intricate dynamics. In dissecting the nuances of AI adoption, the study first harnesses a comprehensive literature review to pinpoint the pivotal factors at play. These variables are then intricately modelled through Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) analysis, which unravels the interdependencies and assigns a hierarchy based on driving and dependence power. This modelling facilitates a structured understanding of the challenges, setting the stage for strategic intervention. Validation of the TISM model ensues through MICMAC analysis, further refining the categorisation of factors by their level of influence. This dual-analytical paradigm affords a granular perspective on the factors that govern AI adoption, laying the groundwork for strategic solutions that are both nuanced and actionable. The results of the analyses reveal that while AI possesses the potential to disrupt the hospitality sector positively, its implementation requires a subtle approach that mitigates the identified challenges. In the wake of this analytical journey, the paper culminates with strategic recommendations designed to steer industry stakeholders through the AI adoption process. These recommendations stress the importance of a balanced approach that harnesses the strengths of AI to complement and enhance the human elements intrinsic to hospitality. This includes investing in employee training to work alongside AI tools, adopting transparent data practices to maintain customer trust, and fostering an organisational culture that embraces technological innovation while valuing human engagement.",About Sufficiency

Assessing the effects of digitalization on the amenity of clean energy supply chains: Policy insights from OECD countries,"The integration of digital solutions into existing energy infrastructure is crucial for enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of energy systems. However, successful integration requires careful planning and implementation. Digitalization also brings efficiency, flexibility, and reliability to an energy system, which requires a strong supply chain mechanism. This paper seeks to analyze the effect of energy system digitalization on the vulnerabilities of clean energy technology value chains in the OECD countries from 2000 to 2021, controlling for ecological footprint, renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy consumption, and economic performance. Digitalization of energy systems, renewable energy consumption and Non-renewable energy consumption are found to be inversely related to securing the supply chain. The secure supply chain of clean energy technology has a direct and positive relationship with the ecological footprint and energy system digitalization, renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy consumption and securing supply chains for clean energy technology are interrelated. Energy system digitalization supports clean energy technology supply chain resilience by positively correlated with renewable energy consumption but negatively correlated with non-renewable energy consumption.

Impact of Digitization and Artificial Intelligence on Carbon Emissions Considering Variable Interaction and Heterogeneity: An Interpretable Deep Learning Modeling Framework,"With growing attention on digitization and artificial intelligence (D&AI), interpreting their impact on urban carbon emissions has become critical. This study proposes an interpretable deep learning modeling framework considering variable feature interaction and heterogeneity to explore D&AI's carbon impacts. Random Forest (RF) is used to explore variable importance and optimize model parameters, followed by constructing a Decision Deep & Cross Feature-Transformation Network (DDCFTN) for high-fitting accuracy. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and causal inference are employed to interpret variable effects and heterogeneity. Using data from 275 Chinese cities (2000–2021), DDCFTN outperforms traditional statistical or machine learning models (RMSE=579.88, MAE=440.91, Radj2=0.994). Key findings include: 1) D&AI's contribution to carbon emissions is underestimated—interactive effects increase the carbon impact by 665.569%. 2) Staged interaction patterns are observed: Digitization initially suppresses AI-related emissions (-34.017% to -96.361%) but later enhances them (13.191% to 45.353%). 3) Asymmetrical interactions exist, with AI's impact on digitization's emissions peaking at just 0.119%, following an inverted U-shaped trend due to retro-regulation effects. 4) City characteristics (e.g., Location Conditions and Urban Scale) reshape the heterogeneity of D&AI emissions through chain reactions, acting as key antecedents.

How does smart artificial intelligence influence energy system resilience? Evidence from energy vulnerability assessments in G20 countries,"Energy system resilience has become an escalating concern amid global economic developments, worsening climate change impacts, and localized regional conflicts. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal tool for enhancing energy system resilience. This study delves into the association between AI and energy system resilience, investigating underlying mechanisms and heterogeneity using a fixed effects model applied to data from the Group of 20 (G20) economies. Energy system resilience can be characterized by a country's energy vulnerability. Our findings suggest that AI effectively mitigates energy vulnerability. Specifically, its impact is more pronounced in high carbon-emitting countries, while it plays a more limited role in highly developed economies. Conversely, in less economically developed countries, AI adoption may exacerbate energy vulnerability. Through mediation analysis, we validate the role of AI in fostering industrial structural transformation and upgrading. However, the direct impact of industrial structure on energy vulnerability was statistically insignificant, warranting further investigation. These results underscore AI's efficacy in reducing energy vulnerability and provide strategic insights for addressing global energy challenges and promoting sustainable development on a global scale.",About Sufficiency
Artificial intelligence and carbon emissions inequality: Evidence from industrial robot application,"To figure out equitable and inclusive strategy to mitigate inequality of carbon emissions, we investigate the solution to narrowing carbon inequality from the perspective of developing artificial intelligence by using the generalized method of moments model and employing a panel dataset from 74 countries during 2000–2019. The asymmetric impact of artificial intelligence on carbon inequality is also checked. In addition, we examine the moderating and mediating effects in the nexus between artificial intelligence and carbon inequality. We find that (1) artificial intelligence has a negative causal relationship with carbon inequality, which indicates that developing artificial intelligence is essential for narrowing carbon inequality. (2) With the increase of the quantile of carbon inequality, artificial intelligence exerts a more remarkable inhibiting effect on carbon inequality, which implies that when the level of carbon inequality is more severe, the implementation of artificial intelligence proves to be a more potent tool for narrowing the disparity of emissions. (3) With the help of climate finance, artificial intelligence becomes even more effective in reducing carbon inequality, verifying the synergistic effect of climate finance and artificial intelligence on carbon inequality eradication.

AI-driven Digital Circular Economy with Material and Energy Sustainability for Industry 4.0,"Circular Economy and Sustainability in Industry 4.0 Era are promoters for carbon neutrality transformation, while their interconnected nexus and specific roles in low-carbon transition have not been clearly revealed. Furthermore, an integrated circular economy framework with buildings, PVs, battery and EVs, with overlaps in renewable-driven operational stages has not been considered in lifecycle decarbonization. This study is to reveal the nexus between Circular Economy and Sustainability in Industry 4.0 Era. Operational modes and mechanism of Circular Economy in PVs, buildings, electric vehicle industries and batteries are specifically analysed, together with energy and carbon flow analysis and optimization. Roles of Circular Economy in Sustainability have been provided, through an integrated circular economy framework with buildings, PVs, battery and electric vehicles (EVs), considering the overlap in renewable-energy driven operational stages in lifecycle decarbonization.

Enhancing sustainability: Assessing the low-carbon impact of China's digital economy on residential carbon emissions,"The emission-reduction effects of the digital economy (DE) in the production sector have been extensively verified. Conversely, the impacts of the DE on consumption-side emission reduction remain a subject of debate and inconsistency. Hence, our study seeks to bridge this gap by evaluating the low-carbon footprint of the DE, drawing from micro-level data of Chinese residents. By employing the Consumer Lifestyle Approach (CLA) for measuring Residential Consumption Carbon Emissions (RCCE) and utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to gauge DE's development level, we reveal a counterintuitive finding: DE has resulted in an increase rather than a reduction in RCCE. These results are both statistically significant and robust, passing rigorous validity tests. The unanticipated outcome can be attributed to the DE's role in stimulating consumption expenditure through income and price effects. Furthermore, our research uncovers regional disparities in the impact of the DE on RCCE, primarily due to the presence of the digital divide. To mitigate this, we recommend targeted government interventions promoting green consumption practices, including awareness campaigns and eco-guidelines, to foster a sustainable consumption transition. These insights offer pivotal strategies for aligning the DE's progression with carbon reduction targets.",About Sufficiency
