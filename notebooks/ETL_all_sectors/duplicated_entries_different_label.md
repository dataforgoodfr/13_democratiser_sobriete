| Utilization of ecosystem services in future vision decision-making for climate-resilient cities                                                                              | In the face of uncertain future climate change, city policy decision-makers must choose strategies that promote climate-resilient development. Nature-based solutions (NbSs) are considered important for solving urban problems, such as carbon neutrality, improving human well-being, and enhancing biodiversity. This study aimed to examine the possibility of using ecosystem services in decision-making for the future scenarios of the city, considering land use change and climate change in combination. Representative ecosystem services of eco-friendly urban paradigms were selected, and ecosystem services and synergies were analyzed when (1) only land use change was considered, and (2) climate change (RCP 8.5) and land use change were both considered. The selected ecosystem services were analyzed using statistical and model-based methods (InVest, MaxEnt) applied to each characteristic and collectible data. The results revealed that food (rice and fishery production) was affected by land use change, recreation and leisure was affected by external activities and climate change. Carbon uptake was affected by both climate change and land use change. Regarding synergy, the amount of carbon uptake decreased by - 1.60% in BAU (S1) and increased by 24.39% in Smart Shrinkage City (S3); however, regarding recreation, the differences depended on the scenarios, such as an increase in S1 by 5.26% and an increase in S3 by 0.99%. We expect that land use change and ecosystem services can provide policymakers with quantitative information, and they can discuss priorities and alternatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

We expect that land use change and ecosystem services can provide policymakers with quantitative information, and they can discuss priorities and alternatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Ecology    |
| The hidden risk in China's cropland conversion from the perspective of slope                                                                                                 | Cropland conversion is a significant theme of the influence of human activities on ecological systems and global food security. Conventionally, cropland conversion in China has been deemed to match the dynamic balance of cropland resources well and to ensure food security for the whole country. However, local studies have presented some conflicting signs that call for an integrated analysis from a national viewpoint. In this paper, by considering the significance of slope in cropland-related natural and socioeconomic issues, we explore the slope features of China's cropland conversion during 2000-2015 and endeavor to identify some potential risks hidden in the process. High-resolution remotely sensed images, digital elevation model and spatial analytical methods are adopted to conduct the analysis. The results show that, the features of cropland conversion in diverse slope division areas are all distinct. Some risks indicated by these conversion features can be identified as follows: (1) unsuitable reclamation of cropland in flat areas causes ecological damage, (2) the invasion of sparsely populated construction land on cropland in steep areas has a dramatic impact on the local area, (3) excessive greening in Northwest and Northeast China, and insufficient greening in Southwest China are not healthy for regional sustainability, (4) cropland's upslope reclamation and downslope loss pose potential risks for food security. In the context of dynamic balance management and other related national policies, cropland conversion in China is not as optimistic as former surveys have indicated, and promoted measures should be elaborately adjusted based on local conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |

| The battle to achieve Sustainable Development Goal Two: The role of environmental sustainability and government institutions                                                 | The current period marked by addressing environmental sustainability challenges and the instability of government institutions has heightened the issue of food security, especially in developing countries as they work towards achieving Zero Hunger as highlighted in the Sustainable Development Goals. To assess the effect of environmental sustainability and government institutions on food security in West Africa with data from 1990 to 2021, two models have been deployed. The Generalized Method of Moments was deployed as the main model and while Two-Stage Least Squares was used as the robustness check. The findings of the study reveal that carbon emissions which represent environmental sustainability has no direct significant effect on food security, while government institutions has negative effect on food security. The study also reveals that income and urbanization promote food security, while renewable energy and population growth reduce food security. The findings of the study could be a reflection of the current political instability and attitude towards tackling carbon emissions mitigation in the region. Government institutions are encouraged to exercise authority without fear to implement policies that would encourage food security and restrict the use of high-emission technologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| The Road to Eliminating Energy Poverty: Does Renewable Energy Technology Innovation Work?                                                                                    | Under the constraint of carbon neutrality targets, the issue of energy poverty has garnered increasing concerns. This study aims to measure energy poverty and assess the impact of renewable energy technology innovation in 30 provinces across China. Furthermore, it calculates city-level energy poverty in 274 cities. By examining the influence of renewable energy technology innovation on energy poverty, this study proposes a new approach to accelerate energy transition and promote sustainable development. The regression results, which have undergone rigorous robustness and endogeneity tests, demonstrate that renewable energy technology innovation significantly alleviates energy poverty. Moreover, the treatment effect of policies is determined through the regression control method. Specifically, the cities of Zhangjiakou, Baotou, and Qiqihar are analyzed to provide targeted suggestions for China's energy development. The treatment effects of both provincial and city-level policies indicate that implementing renewable energy demonstration zones can effectively alleviate energy poverty.JEL Classification: Q48; O31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |
| The Road to Eliminating Energy Poverty: Does Renewable Energy Technology Innovation Work?                                                                                    | Under the constraint of carbon neutrality targets, the issue of energy poverty has garnered increasing concerns. This study aims to measure energy poverty and assess the impact of renewable energy technology innovation in 30 provinces across China. Furthermore, it calculates city-level energy poverty in 274 cities. By examining the influence of renewable energy technology innovation on energy poverty, this study proposes a new approach to accelerate energy transition and promote sustainable development. The regression results, which have undergone rigorous robustness and endogeneity tests, demonstrate that renewable energy technology innovation significantly alleviates energy poverty. Moreover, the treatment effect of policies is determined through the regression control method. Specifically, the cities of Zhangjiakou, Baotou, and Qiqihar are analyzed to provide targeted suggestions for China’s energy development. The treatment effects of both provincial and city-level policies indicate that implementing renewable energy demonstration zones can effectively alleviate energy poverty.JEL Classification: Q48; O31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |

| Strategies for greening the economy in three Nordic countries                                                                                                                | Green economy is a concept frequently used by governments and international institutions to promote sustainable transformations of the economy. In this study, we explore how the transition towards a green economy is being conceptualised in policy terms in the three Nordic countries Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Comparing these cases, we analyse strategic policy documents on green growth, circular economy, bioeconomy, low-carbon transitions, and sustainable development. While comprehensive national policy strategies on the green economy are lacking, the studied documents display policy approaches that reflect different aspects of a green economic transformations, such as low-carbon developments, promotion of environmental technology sectors, and enhanced circularity.

However, circular economy research has focused on the economic and environmental dimensions, with the social dimension receiving less attention. The aim of this study is, therefore, to establish the social impact of an adaptive reuse case with shared spaces. A supplementary aim is to test and adapt the general social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) framework to fit the built environment context. A qualitative single case study method is used.

Planners, designers, and clients can employ the revised framework to evaluate projects pre- and post-construction or demolition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |
| Social benefit cost analysis of ecosystem-based climate change adaptations: a community-level case study in Tanna Island, Vanuatu                                            | Small island developing states are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including more intense and frequent extreme weather, warming temperatures, coastal erosion, inundation, and coral bleaching. Locally-specific natural resource threats, associated with population growth and tourism, exacerbate these systemic risks, which are particularly acute where community well-being is subsistence-based and directly reliant on ecosystem services. Garden productivity is falling as the cropping/fallow cycle intensifies and culturally and there is loss of observance of traditional resource taboos, eroding the effectiveness of customary management. Ecosystem based adaptations (EbA) provide a fruitful range of interventions and are beginning to attract development funding. We undertook a social benefit cost analysis for a suite of interconnecting EbAs for Tanna in Vanuatu. We found that funds targeted at increasing the productivity of the gardens returns significant social benefit. This also reduces pressure on natural resource threats and can potentially be adopted by all households on Tanna. In addition, increasing the community's capacity to balance formal forest and reef conservation with customary management can provide small, but nevertheless important complimentary benefits.

Anthropogenic sources of environmental pollutants degrade the water resources while population expansion contributes to rising demand for non-renewable energy resources which further enhances the greenhouse gas emissions. Also, maintaining the food security/-safety is another challenge which needs to be addressed for securing 'planetary public health'. The sustainability programs, pragmatic studies, and strategies from regulatory/scientific institutions attempt to reduce the depletion of these resources and mitigate environmental challenges however, the individualistic approaches proves to be inadequate. Therefore, the present review emphasizes the use of Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus as a tool to combat environmental degradation, address climate action, and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this article, we investigate methodological paradigm and application of WEF Nexus in an inter-related framework through case studies on water resources, energy efficiency, urban food production, food waste reduction, cross-sectoral perspectives, and the circular economy. It has been widely observed that excessive exploitation of these resources influences the global food supply and demand, water availability, resilience in energy and socio-economic sector. Also, such perturbations in water, energy, and food sectors were found to be inextricably linked with climate change. The results further revealed that WEF nexus approach stimulates multilevel and inter-sectoral governance, thereby aiding to address the complexities and inefficiencies in achieving the SDGs. The prioritization of WEF Nexus strategy, especially under the event of COVID-19 can be a holistic approach to sustainably utilise natural resources to help achieve the environmental sustainability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| Rapid rise in urban sprawl: Global hotspots and trends since 1990                                                                                                            | Dispersed low-density development-"urban sprawl"-has many detrimental environmental, economic, and social consequences. Sprawl leads to higher greenhouse-gas emissions and poses an increasing threat to the long-term availability of many vital ecosystem services. Therefore, urban sprawl is in stark contradiction to the principles of sustainable land use and to the need for a sustainability transformation. This study presents the degree of urban sprawl on the planet at multiple spatial scales (continents, UN regions, countries, sub-national units, and a regular grid) for the period 1990-2014. Urban sprawl increased by 95% in 24 years, almost 4% per year, with built-up areas growing by almost 28 km(2) per day, or 1.16 km(2) per hour. The results demonstrate that Europe has been the most sprawled and also the most rapidly sprawling continent, by 51% since 1990. At the scale of UN regions, the highest relative increases in urban sprawl were observed in East Asia, Western Africa, and Southeast Asia. Urban sprawl per capita has been highest in Oceania and North America, exhibiting a minor decline since 1990, while it has been increasing rapidly in Europe, by almost 47% since 1990. The study revealed a strong relationship between urban sprawl and the level of human development as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI).

| Rapid rise in urban sprawl: Global hotspots and trends since 1990                                                                                                            | Dispersed low-density development-"urban sprawl"-has many detrimental environmental, economic, and social consequences. Sprawl leads to higher greenhouse-gas emissions and poses an increasing threat to the long-term availability of many vital ecosystem services. Therefore, urban sprawl is in stark contradiction to the principles of sustainable land use and to the need for a sustainability transformation. This study presents the degree of urban sprawl on the planet at multiple spatial scales (continents, UN regions, countries, sub-national units, and a regular grid) for the period 1990-2014. Urban sprawl increased by 95% in 24 years, almost 4% per year, with built-up areas growing by almost 28 km(2) per day, or 1.16 km(2) per hour. The results demonstrate that Europe has been the most sprawled and also the most rapidly sprawling continent, by 51% since 1990. At the scale of UN regions, the highest relative increases in urban sprawl were observed in East Asia, Western Africa, and Southeast Asia. Urban sprawl per capita has been highest in Oceania and North America, exhibiting a minor decline since 1990, while it has been increasing rapidly in Europe, by almost 47% since 1990. The study revealed a strong relationship between urban sprawl and the level of human development as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI).

| Prioritizing urban nature-based solutions to support scaling-out strategies: A case study in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria                                                      | Nature-based solutions (NbS) can synergistically improve human well-being and biodiversity in urban areas by enhancing ecosystem functions and services. Scaling out NbS, understood as the widespread application of NbS in multiple contexts, is an important policy ambition to increase the number of people and regions benefiting from NbS. However, designing scaling-out strategies requires considering critical aspects of the nexus between NbS and ecosystem services (ES) supply to yield large-scale benefits effectively. The aim of the study is twofold: (i) to simulate the stepwise implementation of multiple NbS and (ii) to quantify their cumulative impacts on ES supply and beneficiaries. The NbS implementation was guided by a method that prioritizes different NbS types in multiple sites, by combining spatial information on ES demand and land suitability with a qualitative description of ES supply by NbS type. The cumulative impacts were computed stepwise using GIS modeling. The study was conducted in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain), focusing on five types of NbS (urban forests, urban parks, community gardens, infiltration ponds), and five ES (runoff mitigation, stormwater treatment, soil erosion control, recreation, and food supply). Overall, 179 NbS were simulated in 130 sites distributed in the city. The findings showed an improvement in all services, albeit significant increments occurred only for certain services. We observed a non-linear relationship between NbS and impacts, including constant, positive, and negative trends. We discussed several factors that were determinants of impacts, providing insights on how to design scaling-out strategies from the biophysical perspective. Moreover, we reflected on the role of multifunctionality, social preferences, and economic feasibility as prioritization criteria for NbS. Finally, we addressed the imple-mentation of NbS scaling-out strategies from a broader perspective, deepening governance, economic and planning challenges, and potential actions for the case study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

It gives alternative views on population environment linkages. It explains poverty trap, market based harmony, and dual effect of poverty on the basis of a link between population growth and natural resource degradation. In addition, the paper also highlights social and political instability through population-poverty-environment spiral. It also presents empirical evidence on population-environment-poverty nexus in Pakistan. It also compares environmental sustainability index and human development index for selected Asian countries. The paper also gives scores for different components of environmental sustainability index for Pakistan and compares these with India. The paper concludes that the causal relationship between poverty and environment works in both directions, often through changes in GDP and population.

Population stress does not have any significant direct effect on all aspects of environmental status in Pakistan. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Governance |
| Opportunities and Strategies to Incorporate Ecosystem Services Knowledge and Decision Support Tools into Planning and Decision Making in Hawai'i                             | Incorporating ecosystem services into management decisions is a promising means to link conservation and human well-being. Nonetheless, planning and management in Hawai'i, a state with highly valued natural capital, has yet to broadly utilize an ecosystem service approach. We conducted a stakeholder assessment, based on semi-structured interviews, with terrestrial (n = 26) and marine (n = 27) natural resource managers across the State of Hawai'i to understand the current use of ecosystem services (ES) knowledge and decision support tools and whether, how, and under what contexts, further development would potentially be useful. We found that ES knowledge and tools customized to Hawai'i could be useful for communication and outreach, justifying management decisions, and spatial planning. Greater incorporation of this approach is clearly desired and has a strong potential to contribute to more sustainable decision making and planning in Hawai'i and other oceanic island systems. However, the unique biophysical, socio-economic, and cultural context of Hawai'i, and other island systems, will require substantial adaptation of existing ES tools. Based on our findings, we identified four key opportunities for the use of ES knowledge and tools in Hawai'i: (1) linking native forest protection to watershed health; (2) supporting sustainable agriculture; (3) facilitating ridge-to-reef management; and (4) supporting statewide terrestrial and marine spatial planning. Given the interest expressed by natural resource managers, we envision broad adoption of ES knowledge and decision support tools if knowledge and tools are tailored to the Hawaiian context and coupled with adequate outreach and training.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |

| Operationalising energy sufficiency for low-carbon built environments in urbanising India                                                                                    | India's urbanisation is considered the largest national urban transformation of the 21st century, with its trajectory having a decisive impact on carbon emissions globally. This study defines and operationalises the concept of energy sufficiency for the growth of Indian cities which is expected to be largely driven by low- and middle-income housing. It combines theoretical framing with quantitative assessment of test models to present an operational framework of energy sufficiency that can be implemented through urban planning regulations. Based on the global budgetary limit to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees C, a precautionary target of 1.0 tCO2 per capita per year is estimated as an energy sufficiency allowance for upcoming residential built environments. By optimising the average dwelling size, limiting the land-use intensity to low-rise (four storeys) and compact urban forms, and improving operational energy performance with adaptive thermal comfort, the carbon emissions from residential buildings can be sufficiently optimised to 0.84 tCO2 per capita per year. The integration of rooftop renewable energy can further reduce it to 0.56 tCO2. The co-benefits of the optimised costs of construction and operation make the case for economic feasibility and wider affordability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

Current trends towards high-rise and high-density residential development contribute significantly to the demand for embodied and operational energy. However, these remain unaccounted for in India’s action plan to meet its nationally determined contribution (NDC) to reduce emissions intensity. Energy sufficiency can be used as a guiding principle for urbanising contexts to limit both the embodied energy of new residential buildings and the associated operational energy demands. The proposed framework for sufficiency serves as a useful policy instrument, capable of being translated to actionable urban planning regulations. By demonstrating the potential of a ‘sufficient’ per capita carbon emissions budget for the growth and regeneration of residential buildings, this framework equips planners to set limits for the height and density of the built environment, fostering a low-carbon future aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).                                                                                                                                                                                      | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |

| Modeling expected air quality impacts of Oregon?s proposed expanded clean fuels program                                                                                      | The public health burden of traffic-related air pollution falls most heavily on the population living closest to major transportation corridors, which leads to exposure disparities between different socio-economic groups across the United States. The state of Oregon has adopted climate policies to reduce transportation fuel carbon intensity (CI). These climate policies have the potential co-benefit of reducing air pollution exposure disparities for different socio-economic groups. Here we analyze the emissions and air quality outcomes of three future year (2035) scenarios for transportation fuels in Oregon: (i) a Business as usual (BAU) scenario, (ii) a Clean Fuels Program (CFP) scenario that represents adoption and successful achievement of a proposed 25% reduction in carbon intensity in 2035; and (iii) a maximum ambition scenario (CFP MAX) that builds on the CFP scenario to achieve a 37% CI reduction by adopting low carbon fuels more aggressively, especially for heavy duty vehicles. Transportation emissions under all scenarios were estimated using the MOVES model for every county in Oregon. Detailed emissions with 4 km spatial resolution were then developed for each scenario by scaling the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) for the year 2017 based on the emissions derived from the MOVES analysis. Air quality in 2035 was simulated using the UCD/CIT chemical transport model that enables a detailed analysis of PM2.5 and PM0.1 components and sources. Exposure fields were analyzed using the BenMAP model to predict public health outcomes. Environmental justice analysis was conducted by race/ethnicity categories and income categories obtained from the American Community Survey (ACS). Results suggest that adoption of low-carbon transportation fuels will improve air quality in Oregon, yielding public health benefits equivalent to approximately $80M/yr. Adoption of low carbon transportation fuels will also reduce disparities in exposure to transportation-related air pollution between residents in different race/ethnicity categories by -14% in Portland and -20% in Salem. Adoption of low-carbon fuels reduces PM2.5 mass disparity by 10% in Salem, but does not have a significant effect in Portland, because on-road mobile sources contribute to less than 3% of the total PM2.5 mass disparity in this city. The analysis reveals that the spatial distribution of each race/ethnicity group in each city is the primary factor that determines the impact of low carbon fuel adoption on exposure disparity.                                               | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| Metropolitan fringes as strategic areas for urban resilience and sustainable transitions: Insights from Barcelona Metropolitan Area                                          | In an urbanized world, the challenges posed by climate change need to be met through innovative planning for cities and regions. Urban resilience demands that cities adopt new models centered on carbon neutrality, ecosystem services and biodiversity enhancement, circularity, and social inclusion. In light of the multiple interdependencies of metropolitan systems and the natural and territorial potentialities present on their fringes, this paper discusses the metropolitan fringes as strategic for urban resilience and sustainable transitions. By combining a mixed-method analysis of adaptation and urban plans with semi-structured interviews performed with key technicians, the analysis is focused on an inter-municipal fringe zone within the Barcelona Metropolitan Area - the Bes`os territory. Aiming to contribute to the discussions related to Territorial innovation for cities and regions, the paper offers a multi-scale perspective and illustrates innovative urban transformation strategies across scales. The results highlight that governance and multiple planning and participation instances together with technical and financial support are essential for consensus building in an incremental process. Furthermore, the planning strategies of the case study sought to integrate and enhance the green and blue infrastructures and transform consolidated urban areas with a focus on energy transition, sustainable mobility, circularity, and social inclusion. In conclusion, it is argued that resilience has a multi-scalar perspective within the metropolitan context and should be integrated with planning policies at different scales from a coordinated vision. Although adaptation and urban projects have a critical local element, a broader and more strategic vision is necessary, especially in metropolitan fringe areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

| Mapping the capacity of concave green land in mitigating urban pluvial floods and its beneficiaries                                                                          | Pluvial floods can exert significant pressure on urban sustainability and human wellbeing during rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization and exacerbated flooding have stimulated investigations of green land's role in mitigating urban flooding in China. The newly applied "Sponge City" plan considers the concave green land (CGL) as an effective tool in mitigating pluvial floods. However, its capacity and beneficiaries still need to be elucidated. This paper fills this research gap by integrating urban flood simulation, scenario analysis, and mitigation assessment in central Shanghai, China. It reveals that CGL could not only mitigate direct runoff and inundation, but also reduce population exposure and enhance community resilience. CGL with a depth of 0.10-0.20 m can mitigate direct runoffs by 23.63-98.35% and inundation extents by 26.09-82.41%, resulting in a slide of the exposed urban population by 0.40-1.04 million persons and the exposed elders by 0.04-0.12 million persons. Moreover, the effectiveness of CGL varies spatially implying for a sound spatial planning of CGLs and a potential combination with other flood mitigation measures. These findings could help cities particularly in developing countries to adapt to rising pluvial flooding through urban planning and nature-based flood mitigation measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

These findings could help cities particularly in developing countries to adapt to rising pluvial flooding through urban planning and nature-based flood mitigation measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Ecology    |
| Mapping the capacity of concave green land in mitigating urban pluvial floods and its beneficiaries                                                                          | Pluvial floods can exert significant pressure on urban sustainability and human wellbeing during rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization and exacerbated flooding have stimulated investigations of green land's role in mitigating urban flooding in China. The newly applied "Sponge City" plan considers the concave green land (CGL) as an effective tool in mitigating pluvial floods. However, its capacity and beneficiaries still need to be elucidated. This paper fills this research gap by integrating urban flood simulation, scenario analysis, and mitigation assessment in central Shanghai, China. It reveals that CGL could not only mitigate direct runoff and inundation, but also reduce population exposure and enhance community resilience. CGL with a depth of 0.10-0.20 m can mitigate direct runoffs by 23.63-98.35% and inundation extents by 26.09-82.41%, resulting in a slide of the exposed urban population by 0.40-1.04 million persons and the exposed elders by 0.04-0.12 million persons. Moreover, the effectiveness of CGL varies spatially implying for a sound spatial planning of CGLs and a potential combination with other flood mitigation measures. These findings could help cities particularly in developing countries to adapt to rising pluvial flooding through urban planning and nature-based flood mitigation measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |
| Land Stewardship and Development Behaviors Under an Ecological-Impact-Weighted Land Value Tax Scheme: A Proof-of-Concept Agent-Based Model                                   | Sprawling land development patterns have exacerbated ecological degradation, social fragmentation, and public health problems. Perverse incentives arise from the ability to privatize collectively created value in land rents and socialize ecological costs. Land value taxation (LVT) has been shown to encourage urban infill development by reducing or eliminating rent-seeking behavior in land markets. However, despite its purported benefits, this tax reform is value monistic in its definition of optimal land use and, therefore, does little to address the lack of non-market information to inform land use decisions. We propose an ecological-impact-weighted land value taxation policy (ELVT) which incorporates the ecological footprint of land use into one’s land value tax burden. We test both proposed policies (LVT and ELVT) relative to a “status quo” (SQ) property tax scheme, utilizing a conceptual spatially explicit agent-based model of land use behaviors and housing development. Our findings suggest that both tax interventions can increase the capital intensity and decrease the land intensity of housing development. Furthermore, both tax interventions can lead to a net profit loss for speculators and a decrease in the average housing unit price. The ELVT scheme is shown to significantly increase urban nature provisions and dampen the loss of ecological value across a region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| Impact of Land Use Changes on Ecosystem Services Supply: A Meta Analysis of the Italian Context                                                                              | Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are caused by several factors, including climate change, socio-demographic dynamics, human pressures and urban sprawl. These factors alter the structure and functionality of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem goods and services to society. The study of LULC changes is important for understanding the dynamics of relationships between environmental, social and economic components and for analyzing the factors affecting natural capital. Including ecosystem services (ES) in spatial planning tools and sectoral policies is useful for improving governance. In this paper, the impact of LULC changes on ES provision has been estimated. To this end, we carried out a literature review (Step 1) to select the biophysical and economic coefficients of ES supply by land cover classes and collect them in a database (Step 2). We subsequently aggregated the economic and biophysical coefficients by macro classes (Step 3) and, using the benefit transfer approach, we estimated the change in the supply of ESs concerning permanence and transition phenomena in Italy from 1990 to 2018 (Step 4). The transition phenomena analysis also allowed us to evaluate the consequences of urbanization and urban green space governance on ES supply. Indeed, these urban green spaces can help reduce risks to people’s health and safety and mitigate the effects induced by climate change. In total, approximately 800 coefficients (biophysical and economic) of ESs supplied by Corine Land Cover classes were acquired. The results show a reduction in the annual supply of ecosystem services of EUR 927 million (2022) caused by LULC changes between 1990 and 2018.

| Impact of Land Use Changes on Ecosystem Services Supply: A Meta Analysis of the Italian Context                                                                              | Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are caused by several factors, including climate change, socio-demographic dynamics, human pressures and urban sprawl. These factors alter the structure and functionality of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem goods and services to society. The study of LULC changes is important for understanding the dynamics of relationships between environmental, social and economic components and for analyzing the factors affecting natural capital. Including ecosystem services (ES) in spatial planning tools and sectoral policies is useful for improving governance. In this paper, the impact of LULC changes on ES provision has been estimated. To this end, we carried out a literature review (Step 1) to select the biophysical and economic coefficients of ES supply by land cover classes and collect them in a database (Step 2). We subsequently aggregated the economic and biophysical coefficients by macro classes (Step 3) and, using the benefit transfer approach, we estimated the change in the supply of ESs concerning permanence and transition phenomena in Italy from 1990 to 2018 (Step 4). The transition phenomena analysis also allowed us to evaluate the consequences of urbanization and urban green space governance on ES supply. Indeed, these urban green spaces can help reduce risks to people's health and safety and mitigate the effects induced by climate change. In total, approximately 800 coefficients (biophysical and economic) of ESs supplied by Corine Land Cover classes were acquired. The results show a reduction in the annual supply of ecosystem services of EUR 927 million (2022) caused by LULC changes between 1990 and 2018.

| Growth over resilience: how Canadian municipalities frame the challenge of reducing carbon emissions                                                                         | In response to anthropogenic climate change, many governments are adopting policies to reduce carbon emissions. In Canada, federal and provincial governments have implemented carbon pricing. One of the effects of putting a price on carbon is increasing the cost of using private vehicles, which may reduce mobility and increase the risk of social exclusion, especially in contexts where car dependence is high. In this article, we analyse how municipal governments in Canada frame the challenges of climate change and reducing emissions, and examine whether they link these challenges to issues of mobility and social exclusion. Focusing on policies from four of Canada's largest cities - Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Vancouver - we identify four main frames used in planning documents: "the Growing City", "If You Build It, They Will Come", "Better City for All", and "the Resilient City". The Growing City frame is used to support status quo urban development, with climate mitigation options (including sustainable travel modes) optionally included for more concerned residents. This is the dominant frame in Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg. Conversely, Vancouver uses the Resilient City frame to indicate that climate mitigation and adaption strategies are essential, and all citizens must be prepared for change. Vancouver presents changes to mobility as necessary for all, rather than an option for some. Social exclusion is not explicitly addressed in the frames, though it is presented as a reason to support building alternative transportation or more public spaces. Social exclusion receives little consideration as a potential consequence of climate mitigation policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

| Green gentrification & the luxury effect: uniting isolated ideas towards just cities for people & nature                                                                     | The growth of cities creates challenges to biodiversity and social justice. Researchers addressing these challenges often do so in silos; their efforts persistently separate justice for non-humans and humans. We analyze this separation through two concepts-luxury effect and green gentrification-that each explores urban greenspace and justice, but from different angles. The luxury effect implicitly targets justice for non-humans by exploring biodiversity in cities and finds that wealth explains the distribution of biodiversity. Green gentrification explicitly targets justice for humans by examining how new greenspaces affect people and finds that such greenspaces often displace vulnerable people. Using scientometric analyses, we show the disjunction between these concepts. We draw on socio-ecological justice concepts to suggest that disregarding relationships and conflicts among humans and non-humans in concepts does not eliminate them in practice, but stalls progress toward just cities. We urge scholars to simultaneously focus on justice for humans and non-humans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

| Green gentrification & the luxury effect: uniting isolated ideas towards just cities for people & nature                                                                     | The growth of cities creates challenges to biodiversity and social justice. Researchers addressing these challenges often do so in silos; their efforts persistently separate justice for non-humans and humans. We analyze this separation through two concepts-luxury effect and green gentrification-that each explores urban greenspace and justice, but from different angles. The luxury effect implicitly targets justice for non-humans by exploring biodiversity in cities and finds that wealth explains the distribution of biodiversity. Green gentrification explicitly targets justice for humans by examining how new greenspaces affect people and finds that such greenspaces often displace vulnerable people. Using scientometric analyses, we show the disjunction between these concepts. We draw on socio-ecological justice concepts to suggest that disregarding relationships and conflicts among humans and non-humans in concepts does not eliminate them in practice, but stalls progress toward just cities. We urge scholars to simultaneously focus on justice for humans and non-humans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |
| Evaluating equity and justice in low-carbon energy transitions                                                                                                               | A low-carbon energy transition is essential for mitigating climate change, but can also cause energy justice and equity impacts on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), low-income, and other frontline communities. Examples include exacerbating energy burden, inaccessibility and unaffordability of low-carbon energy and electric end-use technologies, property value loss and displacement from renewable energy siting, and unequal health benefits and employment losses from fossil fuel retirement. To avoid perpetuating historical and creating new injustices, an equitable and just energy transition will require careful planning and execution. To this end, measuring and evaluating the effects of existing and proposed programs and policies aimed at decarbonizing energy systems is critical. However, methods and metrics for evaluating equity effects vary across disciplines and transitions, making it challenging to identify effective evaluation strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the equity implications of low-carbon energy transitions and identifies key metrics that have been used across disciplines to quantify energy injustices and equity impacts. We focus on four key low-carbon energy transitions: (1) renewable energy deployment; (2) fossil fuel infrastructure retirement; (3) transportation electrification; and (4) residential building decarbonization. We classify energy justice and equity metrics into the dimensions of health, access, and livelihood, and construct an analytical framework that supports policymakers, planners and other stakeholders in identifying important equity considerations and quantitatively evaluating the effects of decarbonization initiatives. While our framework can serve as a starting point for evaluating justice and equity impacts of energy transitions, further work is needed to address the limitations of existing metrics and additional evaluation methods will be critical to effect energy transitions that are truly equitable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| Environmental Performance and SDGs: How Do Income Disparity, Urbanization, Resource Consumption, and Female Employers Affect the Ecological Footprint in Emerging Economies? | The significance of environmental deterioration as a pressing issue has led to its prominence in global discussions on strategies for prevention. It can be asserted that there exists a universal agreement that the enhancement of environmental quality is imperative for the promotion of sustainable development and societal well-being, especially in emerging economies. In this perspective, the present research uses panel data of the E7 economies from 1992 to 2021 to assess the effects of income disparity, urbanization, resources consumption (nonrenewable and renewable energy consumption), and women employers on ecological footprint. This study employs second-generation empirical techniques such as CIPS and CADF unit root tests, Westerlund bootstrap cointegration, and DFE/MG/PMG-ARDL models to check the relationships between the studied variables. The empirical findings of this study reveal that in the E7 countries, the ecological footprint is increased with an increased income disparity and nonrenewable energy consumption. On the other hand, urbanization, renewable energy consumption, and female employers help reduce the ecological footprint. Additionally, the results of the causality measure under the Dumitrescu and Hurlin test unveil bidirectional causality between all the independent variables except nonrenewable energy and ecological footprint. From the policy perspective, the selected countries must implement policies that promote equitable income distribution, planned urbanization to promote compact cities, efficient transportation systems, and green infrastructure, and provide opportunities for women to attain higher positions in organizations, particularly at the managerial and decision-making levels in order to address the adverse environmental consequences in emerging economies. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Governance |

| Do plans matter? A game-theoretic model for examining the logic and effects of land use planning                                                                             | Although state and local growth management programs vary widely, nearly all such programs include one common feature: they require local governments to plan. While there has been extensive research on the effects of growth management in general and on specific policy instruments to manage urban growth there has been little research on the effects of planning. In this paper we present a game-theoretic model of urban development in which a rational local government plans. The model illustrates how planning can serve to guide local government decision making, how land market participants might respond to local government plans, and how planning in a dynamic context can increase social welfare. By considering local government as a player who plans rather than as an external disturbance that might regulate, we can discover insights and frame hypotheses about the efficacy of planning that are not possible in other urban economic models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |
| Do plans matter? A game-theoretic model for examining the logic and effects of land use planning                                                                             | Although state and local growth management programs vary widely, nearly all such programs include one common feature: they require local governments to plan. While there has been extensive research on the effects of growth management in general and on specific policy instruments to manage urban growth there has been little research on the effects of planning. In this paper we present a game-theoretic model of urban development in which a rational local government plans. The model illustrates how planning can serve to guide local government decision making, how land market participants might respond to local government plans, and how planning in a dynamic context can increase social welfare.

| Digital twin-driven strategic demolition plan for circular asset management of bridge infrastructures                                                                        | Economic growth plays an important role in the rapid increase in construction of transportation and bridge infrastructures, which in turn causes enormous greenhouse gas emissions contributing directly to climate change. An innovative and effective method, so-called Building Information Modeling (BIM), to sustainably manage detailed lifecycle of infrastructures, has been recently adopted to revolutionise the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Its major function is to sustainably optimise all detailed stages of an infrastructure asset’s lifecycle. A three-dimensional architectural BIM incorporating three additional dimensions (time, cost, and carbon emissions) has then been created in this study to virtualise the whole lifecycle performance of bridge infrastructure through BIM data. For circular asset management, multi-scale details of assets and infrastructures are indispensable. On this ground, these information dimensions are highly critical to asset managers to assure not only public safety, but also sustainability over the whole lifecycle. It is thus critical to quantify carbon footprint in order to identify better alternative solutions for construction and maintenance, resulting in carbon neutrality and carbon credit. Our digital twin (DT), driven by the BIM, has embedded demolition scenarios whose lifecycle cost and carbon footprint can be quantified and optimized simultaneously. Our study is the first to also demonstrate circular end-of-life management through strategic demolition planning that enhances circular economy practice. This aspect is novel and has not been commonly adopted in practice. Our study reveals that the construction stage of the asset lifecycle for this study is the main contributor to carbon emissions and costs stemming from raw materials and their productions. This eventually leads to significant waste at the end of asset’s life, requiring strategic demolition plan to maximise reuse, repurpose, and recycle of materials, parts and components. Our innovative DT is capable of dealing with the cradle-to-cradle lifecycle management. Another co-benefit of using the BIM-based digital twin is to minimise streamlining design, re-work, mitigating risk, and real time processing of design changes in all stakeholders, reducing the effect on carbon emissions, costs, and time schedules. All dimensions (i.e. 6D) can be updated and re-calculated in real time when cross-linked with inspections and condition monitoring, generating real-time digital twin driven solutions. © The Author(s) 2025. | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |

| Community-led development and collective land tenure for environmental justice: the case of the Cano Martin Pena community land trust, Puerto Rico                           | Community-led land ownership can contribute to environmental justice in disaster-prone areas, particularly as it protects vulnerable communities from market-driven displacement often occurring after natural disasters. The article reviews literature linking the climate emergency with disaster resilience and collective land-based models. It brings into focus the case of the Cano Martin Pena communities in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where residents started a Community Land Trust (CLT) in Latin America and the Caribbean, resulting from an extensive process of community participation. We highlight the importance of this case as still one of the only CLT's in the Global South, a mechanism not yet sufficiently understood as a highly developed instrument for secure land tenure and adaptation to climate change in the Global South. We analyse the mechanisms by which the CLT's collective tenure model effectively ensures greater environmental justice - both regarding ongoing flooding issues, and specific extreme natural events such as hurricanes. Collective land ownership allows residents to remain in the area despite forces of gentrification and displacement after disasters induced by global warming.

| Community-led development and collective land tenure for environmental justice: the case of the Cano Martin Pena community land trust, Puerto Rico                           | Community-led land ownership can contribute to environmental justice in disaster-prone areas, particularly as it protects vulnerable communities from market-driven displacement often occurring after natural disasters. The article reviews literature linking the climate emergency with disaster resilience and collective land-based models. It brings into focus the case of the Cano Martin Pena communities in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where residents started a Community Land Trust (CLT) in Latin America and the Caribbean, resulting from an extensive process of community participation. We highlight the importance of this case as still one of the only CLT's in the Global South, a mechanism not yet sufficiently understood as a highly developed instrument for secure land tenure and adaptation to climate change in the Global South. We analyse the mechanisms by which the CLT's collective tenure model effectively ensures greater environmental justice - both regarding ongoing flooding issues, and specific extreme natural events such as hurricanes. Collective land ownership allows residents to remain in the area despite forces of gentrification and displacement after disasters induced by global warming. We conclude with a reflection on the need for similar land-based solutions, and summon public authorities to consider these as a route to effective environmental management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |
| Climate-Related Vulnerability Assessment Toward Disaster Risk Reduction: Insight from Pakistan                                                                               | Globally, climate-related disasters (CRDs) have become a common phenomenon in the last few decades, increasing vulnerability and causing disaster mortality. To manage disaster risk, the global Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction (SFDRR) provides a solid action plan for disaster risk reduction (DRR) considering all the dimensions of vulnerability. However, countries are still less receptive at the local level to adopting the SFDRR. Also, the global research community did not explore vulnerability features based on the Sendai Framework nor integrated such features with the four priorities of SFDRR. Based on the case of Pakistan, this study seeks to bridge the gap through three objectives. The first objective of the study is to identify the vulnerability features cited in the SFDRR. In addition, the research aims to develop a new vulnerability model by integrating SFDRR's four priorities. As a second objective, it is intended to develop a decision support framework for ranking and evaluating each of the SFDRR priority action areas under local conditions. A third objective is to assess the impact of climate-induced environmental, socioeconomic and political vulnerabilities on climate-driven mortality. To meet these three different objectives, the authors have adopted a multi-method approach by using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and binary logistic regression method (BLRM). Based on the assessment, the authors suggested some policy implications. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |

However, these are often fragmented or somewhat disconnected interventions that leave out vulnerable and subaltern groups like children, being also commonly based on strictly formatted designs, with more urban furniture than natural elements. In view of the need to make urban spaces healthier, safer, more resilient, and at the same time more child-friendly, in this Conceptual Analysis paper we build from the literature on Urban Green Spaces, Child-Friendly Cities and environments, and Children's Infrastructure to propose the concept of Children Green Infrastructure (CGI), and discuss its application to urban planning, foregrounding the need for fairer, more inclusive and participatory approaches. GGI derives from the Children Infrastructure concept but it puts at the center of the debate the idea of connecting children to nature where they live, learn and play. CGI is based on the assumption that nature should be transversal in urban planning processes, and that it must be perfectly integrated within urban infrastructures, ensuring access to all. Understanding children's needs and integrating their voices in urban planning and design processes are necessary conditions to moving forward to a fairer, more inclusive and truly collective urban project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

| COP28 roadmap: Do ICT, education, and renewable energy consumption matter for environmental quality? Quantile evidence for emerging economies                                | Renewable energy consumption (REC) is not the only potent tool that can ameliorate the difficulties associated with rising CO2 emissions and ecological distortions. Besides, the role of ICT penetration and education on environmental quality cannot be overshadowed by their contributions to economic growth and improved human well-being. This study scrutinizes the effects of ICT, education, and REC on the ecological footprint (EF) and CO2 emissions in the IMF-selected emerging economies. The study utilizes three variables for the ICT index, computed through principal component analysis. The augmented mean group estimator results suggest that ICT, education, and REC reduce the EF, whereas FDI contributes significantly to environmental degradation. On the flip side, ICT reduces CO2 emissions and EF in both the medium and upper quantiles. It suggests that ICT penetration heals the environment and that a higher level of ICT consumption could be a panacea for sustainable development in emerging economies. The causality results show evidence of a feedback causality between economic growth, REC, and CO2 emissions. However, a unidirectional causality flows from economic growth and FDI to EF. Finally, to maximize the benefits associated with the positive effects of REC and ICT on environmental betterment, several renewable energy and ICT policies have been mentioned and discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| Bioenergy and bioexergy analyses with artificial intelligence application on combustion of recycled hardwood and softwood wastes                                             | Novel biomass bioenergy-bioexergy analyses via thermogravimetry analysis and artificial intelligence are employed to evaluate the three biofuels from wood wastes (softwood-SW, hardwood-HW, and woods blend-WB). The chemical characterization of SW has the highest bioenergy (higher heating value - HHV: 18.84 MJ kg(- 1)) and bioexergy (specific chemical bioexergy - SCB: 19.65 MJ kg(- 1)) with the SCB/HHV ratio of wood waste as about 1.043-1.046. The high C-element has a significant influence on the HHV-SCB. The three distinct zones of wood waste combustion are identified: moisture evaporation (Zone I, up to 110 degrees C), combustion reaction - degradation of three major lignocellulosic components (hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin) at Zone II, 110-600 degrees C, and ash remains (Zone III, 600-800 degrees C). The ignition (D-ig = 0.01-0.04) and fuel reactivity (R-fuel = 3.82-6.97 %center dot min(- 1)center dot degrees C- 1) indexes are evaluated. The comprehensive combustion index (S-n:>5 x 10(-7)%(2) min(- 2 )degrees C- 3) suggests that wood waste has a better combustion performance than bituminous coal. The statistical evaluation presents that the highest HHV-SCB values are obtained by performing combustion for SW-250 mu m at 15 degrees C center dot min(- 1). The S/ N ratio and ANOVA results agree that the wood waste type and particle size denote the most influential parameters. The artificial neural network prediction shows an excellent result (R-2 = 1) with 1 hidden layer and 5 neuron configurations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not About Sufficiency | Nutrition        |

| Biochar: A Synthesis of Its Agronomic Impact beyond Carbon Sequestration                                                                                                     | Biochar has been heralded as an amendment to revitalize degraded soils, improve soil carbon sequestration, increase agronomic productivity, and enter into future carbon trading markets. However, scientific and economic technicalities may limit the ability of biochar to consistently deliver on these expectations. Past research has demonstrated that biochar is part of the black carbon continuum with variable properties due to the net result of production (e.g., feedstock and pyrolysis conditions) and postproduction factors (storage or activation). Therefore, biochar is not a single entity but rather spans a wide range of black carbon forms. Biochar is black carbon, but not all black carbon is biochar. Agronomic benefits arising from biochar additions to degraded soils have been emphasized, but negligible and negative agronomic effects have also been reported. Fifty percent of the reviewed studies reported yield increases after black carbon or biochar additions, with the remainder of the studies reporting alarming decreases to no significant differences. Hardwood biochar (black carbon) produced by traditional methods (kilns or soil pits) possessed the most consistent yield increases when added to soils. The universality of this conclusion requires further evaluation due to the highly skewed feedstock preferences within existing studies. With global population expanding while the amount of arable land remains limited, restoring soil quality to nonproductive soils could be key to meeting future global food production, food security, and energy supplies; biochar may play a role in this endeavor. Biochar economics are often marginally viable and are tightly tied to the assumed duration of agronomic benefits. Further research is needed to determine the conditions under which biochar can provide economic and agronomic benefits and to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for these benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |
| Biochar: A Synthesis of Its Agronomic Impact beyond Carbon Sequestration                                                                                                     | Biochar has been heralded as an amendment to revitalize degraded soils, improve soil carbon sequestration, increase agronomic productivity, and enter into future carbon trading markets. However, scientific and economic technicalities may limit the ability of biochar to consistently deliver on these expectations. Past research has demonstrated that biochar is part of the black carbon continuum with variable properties due to the net result of production (e.g., feedstock and pyrolysis conditions) and postproduction factors (storage or activation). Therefore, biochar is not a single entity but rather spans a wide range of black carbon forms. Biochar is black carbon, but not all black carbon is biochar. Agronomic benefits arising from biochar additions to degraded soils have been emphasized, but negligible and negative agronomic effects have also been reported. Fifty percent of the reviewed studies reported yield increases after black carbon or biochar additions, with the remainder of the studies reporting alarming decreases to no significant differences. Hardwood biochar (black carbon) produced by traditional methods (kilns or soil pits) possessed the most consistent yield increases when added to soils. The universality of this conclusion requires further evaluation due to the highly skewed feedstock preferences within existing studies. With global population expanding while the amount of arable land remains limited, restoring soil quality to nonproductive soils could be key to meeting future global food production, food security, and energy supplies; biochar may play a role in this endeavor. Biochar economics are often marginally viable and are tightly tied to the assumed duration of agronomic benefits. Further research is needed to determine the conditions under which biochar can provide economic and agronomic benefits and to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for these benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | About Sufficiency     | Nutrition        |
| Assessment of the Impact of Road Transport Change on the Security of the Urban Social Environment                                                                            | In the context of accelerating urbanisation, cities must ensure a viable economy, social well-being, and a healthy environment. Transport is one of the key conditions for economic development and meeting the needs of countries, regions, and cities. However, transport must meet not only the physiological but also the social needs of society, one of which is environmental security. Urban transport accounts for around 40% of CO2 emissions and 70% of other pollutants from road transport. Thus, one of the most difficult issues for any city to address when building bypasses is the growing number of cars in the city, traffic congestion, and the reduction of all greenhouse gas emissions. The documents adopted in July 2020 aim to revitalise the EU's economy by moving towards a green economy and sustainability. In addition to the systematic and comparative analysis of concepts published in the scientific literature, the article also presents an analysis of the concepts of the sustainable city and sustainable transport, as well as a study of the social impact of bypasses and the assessment of the security of the social environment in the Baltic capitals. The aim of the article is to assess the impact of the growing number of vehicles on the security of the city's social environment. Research results show that the number of pollutants and a direct dependence between the number of pollutants and the driving speed were established. Therefore, it needs to make investments in the transport sector: improving roads, the construction of bypasses, and the technical parameters of purchased cars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

Using indicators designed to measure a 'safe and just' development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2-6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships.

We address this gap by providing one of the first careful examinations of local conceptualizations of well-being in a conservation context, using mixed methods to examine the multidimensionality and heterogeneity of well-being conceptualizations across three sites in northern Cambodia. Each site faced different levels of conservation activities and development pressures, the latter being mainly linked to the degree of impact from economic land concessions.

We show that multifaceted values are attached to well-being components, highlighting the importance of subjective indicators and perceptions to capture fully the social changes and impacts of conservation in complex contexts.
