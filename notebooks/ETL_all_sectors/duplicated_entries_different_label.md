| Who Are Bicyclists? Why and How Much Are They Bicycling?                                                                                                                                                                | The factors influencing the decision to bicycle are explored and unraveled to inform the development of appropriate and effective strategies to increase bicycling and promote the health of individuals and of the environment. The data used in the analysis were drawn from a survey of Texas bicyclists, and the study includes a comprehensive explanatory analysis of bicyclists and their bicycling habits. Various econometric models are used to evaluate the determinants of bicyclists' perception for safety and quality issues and the frequency of bicycling for commute and noncommute purposes. The results of the study indicate that the perceptions of the quality of bicycle facilities and safety from traffic crashes show significant variation depending on bicyclists' demographic and work characteristics and bicycle amenities and facilities on the commute route and at the workplace. Bicyclist demographics (gender, age, education level, commute distance), household demographics (number of automobiles, number of bicycles, number of children), residential location and season, bicycle amenities at work (bicycle racks, showers), bicyclist perceptions of the overall quality of bicycle facilities, and bicycle-use characteristics affect commute and noncommute bicycling frequency. These study results can assist in the development of informed policies to increase commute and noncommute bicycling, and the results highlight the ongoing need for detailed surveys to understand bicycling behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

These study results can assist in the development of informed policies to increase commute and noncommute bicycling, and the results highlight the ongoing need for detailed surveys to understand bicycling behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

| Utilization of ecosystem services in future vision decision-making for climate-resilient cities                                                                                                                         | In the face of uncertain future climate change, city policy decision-makers must choose strategies that promote climate-resilient development. Nature-based solutions (NbSs) are considered important for solving urban problems, such as carbon neutrality, improving human well-being, and enhancing biodiversity. This study aimed to examine the possibility of using ecosystem services in decision-making for the future scenarios of the city, considering land use change and climate change in combination. Representative ecosystem services of eco-friendly urban paradigms were selected, and ecosystem services and synergies were analyzed when (1) only land use change was considered, and (2) climate change (RCP 8.5) and land use change were both considered. The selected ecosystem services were analyzed using statistical and model-based methods (InVest, MaxEnt) applied to each characteristic and collectible data. The results revealed that food (rice and fishery production) was affected by land use change, recreation and leisure was affected by external activities and climate change. Carbon uptake was affected by both climate change and land use change. Regarding synergy, the amount of carbon uptake decreased by - 1.60% in BAU (S1) and increased by 24.39% in Smart Shrinkage City (S3); however, regarding recreation, the differences depended on the scenarios, such as an increase in S1 by 5.26% and an increase in S3 by 0.99%. We expect that land use change and ecosystem services can provide policymakers with quantitative information, and they can discuss priorities and alternatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

Nature-based solutions (NbSs) are considered important for solving urban problems, such as carbon neutrality, improving human well-being, and enhancing biodiversity. This study aimed to examine the possibility of using ecosystem services in decision-making for the future scenarios of the city, considering land use change and climate change in combination. Representative ecosystem services of eco-friendly urban paradigms were selected, and ecosystem services and synergies were analyzed when (1) only land use change was considered, and (2) climate change (RCP 8.5) and land use change were both considered. The selected ecosystem services were analyzed using statistical and model-based methods (InVest, MaxEnt) applied to each characteristic and collectible data. The results revealed that food (rice and fishery production) was affected by land use change, recreation and leisure was affected by external activities and climate change. Carbon uptake was affected by both climate change and land use change. Regarding synergy, the amount of carbon uptake decreased by − 1.60% in BAU (S1) and increased by 24.39% in Smart Shrinkage City (S3); however, regarding recreation, the differences depended on the scenarios, such as an increase in S1 by 5.26% and an increase in S3 by 0.99%.

We expect that land use change and ecosystem services can provide policymakers with quantitative information, and they can discuss priorities and alternatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Ecology    |
| Using a real-world, project-based energy module to improve energy literacy among high school youth                                                                                                                      | A project-based energy module has been taught for five consecutive years in a high school environmental science class as part of an NSF GK-12 outreach program. The module brings students through an exploration of problems and potential solutions related to automotive transportation, a relevant topic for the average American teenager. Students investigate problems related to our current fossil fuel based transportation system including environmental impacts and limited fuel supplies, and explore potential solutions that include alternative modes of transportation and fuels as well as lifestyle changes. Changes in students' energy literacy, a broad term that includes a citizenship understanding of energy issues as well as attitude and behavioral aspects, have been assessed over the last three program years using a quasiexperimental, mixed methods approach that includes both quantitative and qualitative measures. The quantitative measure consists of a written Energy Literacy Survey that has been developed and validated as part of this research. Qualitative data, collected through a combination of questionnaires, focus group interviews, and classroom observations, add depth and understanding to the quantitative results. Analysis of the quantitative survey over three consecutive years indicates that students show significant improvement in energy-related knowledge (scores increased from 60% pre to 68% post), feelings of self-efficacy related to energy issues (71% pre to 75% post), and energy consumption behaviors/intentions (63% pre to 69% post). Similar gains reported by a comparison group, available for only one study year, indicate that students may be influenced by experiences outside the classroom and point to the need for additional data to clarify the results. When asked to self-assess their learning, 84% of the students said they learned a lot or a quite a bit about energy issues. Responses to open-ended questionnaire items indicate that the course increased (81% of the) students' awareness of the need to conserve energy; 54% indicated that they are more aware of the implications of their own energy use on the overall energy problems; 20% say they are more aware of, and troubled by, Americans' overconsumption of energy resources; and 60% reported positive changes in their energy consumption behaviors. These preliminary results suggest that the project-based curriculum is effective for promoting student learning, but the generally low knowledge scores indicate the need for continued efforts toward wider implementation of energy education programs. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

| Urban spatial structure and equity for urban services through the lens of accessibility                                                                                                                                 | Urban development, equity and sustainability cannot be concluded based on access to one type of urban service. This study goes beyond the usual approach of analysing a single type of urban service and provides a comprehensive overview of accessibility-related equity. A modified accessibility measure is used, which, in addition to travel time impedance, incorporates the aspect of connectivity of services with the transport infrastructure. This study evaluates mode-wise accessibility for jobs, schools, medical care units, hospitals, parks, supermarkets, and restaurants in Greater Mumbai. The spatial association and clustering of threshold-based accessibility are assessed using Global Moran's I. This reveals that the degree of spatial association and clustering is highest at 30 minutes travel time threshold for private mode and 45 mintues for public transport for urban services. The Gini index values indicate that spatial inequity is relatively higher for hospital services accessibility than other services. Social equity is assessed using the average accessibility ratio values for the urban services, which favours regions with moderate car ownership over low, indicating one of the undesirable urban development trends. This study helps understand the urban spatial structure and assesses the spatial and social inequities from the transportation/urban planning perspective. The developed decision framework can aid policymakers in prioritising the suggested measures effectively to address accessibility related inequities for different urban services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

The developed decision framework can aid policymakers in prioritising the suggested measures effectively to address accessibility related inequities for different urban services. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

Relationships between five urban form variables and walking in specific demographic subgroups are assessed using stratified logistic models and controlling for participant demographics. All five urban form and recreation measures were related to walking among whites, but only land use mix and access to recreation spaces were significantly related to walking in non-whites. There were more significant urban form physical activity associations in high-income than in low-income households. More urban form variables were related to walking in households with 3 or more cars than in households with no cars. Living in mixed use-areas and having access to recreational space were related to youth walking for transport in 11 of 13 population subgroups studied. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, we leverage a comprehensive data collection of bus, metro, and taxicab ridership from Shenzhen, China to unveil the spatio-temporal interplay between different mass transit modes. To achieve this goal, we develop a novel spectral clustering framework that imposes spatio-temporal similarities between mass transit mode usage in urban space and differentiates urban spaces associated with distinct ridership patterns of mass transit modes. Five resulting categories of urban spaces are identified and interpreted with auxiliary knowledge of the city's metro network and land-use functionality. In general, different categorized urban spaces are associated with different accessibility levels (such as high-, medium-, and low-ranked) and different urban functionalities (such as residential, commercial, leisure-dominant, and home-work balanced). The results indicate that different mass transit modes cooperate or compete based on demographic and socioeconomic attributes of the underlying urban environments. Our proposed analytical framework provides a novel and effective way to explore the mass transit system and the functional heterogeneity in cities. It demonstrates great potential for assisting policymakers and municipal managers in optimizing public transportation facility allocation and city-wide daily commuting distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Understanding the impact of built environment on metro ridership using open source in Shanghai                                                                                                                          | A growing body of research using the direct demand model has explored the impact of the built environment on transit ridership. However, empirical studies identified various significant factors in different cities with different datasets. This study adopts points-of-interest (POIs) data to identify the physical environmental factors affecting metro ridership in Shanghai. Independent variables in terms of the rail transit system, external connectivity, intermodal connection, and land use factors within 286 metro stations' catchment areas were selected. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to group POIs into 6 components for dimensionality reduction. The results from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis emphasize the dominating role of commercial land use and rail transit system factors, together with bus stops, tourist spots and healthcare factors, positively impact both weekday and weekend metro ridership; however, the effect of job-related land use is significant only on weekdays. Distinctively, the variable of intersection density is not positively associated with ridership as expected, revealing that street network measurements may not explain walking to rail transit in the citywide Shanghai context, so we suggest a new requirement: a multilevel-based walkability index in dense cities. The latter finding also implied that residences in central locations are less reliable than those in suburban locations. Finally, we conclude with strategies to encourage balanced trip demands other than simply increasing ridership, which has potential implications on urban planning and transit-oriented development (TOD) in China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

Finally, we conclude with strategies to encourage balanced trip demands other than simply increasing ridership, which has potential implications on urban planning and transit-oriented development (TOD) in China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Travel Mode Choice Prediction to Pursue Sustainable Transportation and Enhance Health Parameters Using R                                                                                                                | Travel mode choice (TMC) prediction, improving health parameters, and promoting sustainable transportation systems are crucial for urban planners and policymakers. Past studies show the influence of health on activities, while several studies use multitasking activities and physical activity intensity to study the association between time use and activity travel participation (TU and ATP) and health outcomes. Limited studies have been conducted on the use of transport modes as intermediate variables to study the influence of TU and ATP on health parameters. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate urban dependency on different transport modes used for daily activities and its influence on health parameters to promote a greener and healthier society and a sustainable transportation system. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used for transport mode classification, and multinominal logit models were used for regression using R programming. A total of five models were developed for motorized, non-motorized, public transport, physical, and social health to study the correlation between transport modes and health parameters. The statistical analysis results show that socio-demographic and economic variables have a strong association with TMC in which younger, male, workers and high-income households are more dependent on motorized transport. It was found that a unit rise in high-income causes a 4.5% positive increase in motorized transport, whereas it negatively influences non-motorized and public transport by 4.2% and 2.2%, respectively. These insights might be useful for formulating realistic plans to encourage individuals to use active transport that will promote sustainable transportation systems and a healthier society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Travel Characteristics of Urban Residents Based on Taxi Trajectories in China: Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wuhan                                                                                                   | With the advancement of urban modernization, more and more residents are flocking to large cities, leading to problems such as severe traffic congestion, uneven distribution of spatial resources, and deterioration of the urban environment. These challenges pose a serious threat to the coordinated development of cities. In order to better understand the travel behavior of metropolitan residents and provide valuable insights for urban planning, this study utilizes taxi trajectory data from the central areas of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wuhan. First, the relationship between daytime taxi drop-off points and urban amenities is explored using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Subsequently, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) techniques were applied to identify spatial differences in these urban drivers. The results show that commonalities emerge across the four cities in the interaction between external transport stops and commercial areas. In addition, the average daily travel patterns of residents in these four cities show a trend of "three peaks and three valleys", indicating the commonality of travel behavior. In summary, this study explores the travel characteristics of urban residents, which can help urban planners understand travel patterns more effectively. This is crucial for the strategic allocation of transport resources across regions, the promotion of sustainable urban transport, and the reduction in carbon emissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |
| Travel Characteristics of Urban Residents Based on Taxi Trajectories in China: Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wuhan                                                                                                   | With the advancement of urban modernization, more and more residents are flocking to large cities, leading to problems such as severe traffic congestion, uneven distribution of spatial resources, and deterioration of the urban environment. These challenges pose a serious threat to the coordinated development of cities. In order to better understand the travel behavior of metropolitan residents and provide valuable insights for urban planning, this study utilizes taxi trajectory data from the central areas of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wuhan. First, the relationship between daytime taxi drop-off points and urban amenities is explored using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Subsequently, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) techniques were applied to identify spatial differences in these urban drivers. The results show that commonalities emerge across the four cities in the interaction between external transport stops and commercial areas. In addition, the average daily travel patterns of residents in these four cities show a trend of “three peaks and three valleys”, indicating the commonality of travel behavior. In summary, this study explores the travel characteristics of urban residents, which can help urban planners understand travel patterns more effectively. This is crucial for the strategic allocation of transport resources across regions, the promotion of sustainable urban transport, and the reduction in carbon emissions. © 2024 by the authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Transition engineering of transport in megacities with case study on commuting in Beijing                                                                                                                               | Private automobiles have been wildly popular around the world and have transformed the concept of personal mobility for the affluent. However, automobile-oriented development patterns have demonstrably degraded the quality of the city environment. The economic burden of transport infrastructure asset management, plus air pollution, CO2 emissions and congestion are pressing issues for all cities. City planners struggle with the issues of growth in travel demand and the costs of providing traffic management, parking, policing, and emergency services. The future of personal vehicle mobility and goods movements are particularly challenging, and it is difficult to imagine what the sustainable solutions could be for these wicked problems of transport in megacities. This paper explores urban form, transport activity and quality of life in future cities through the emerging discipline, Transition Engineering. The main methodology is the Interdisciplinary Transition Innovation, Management and Engineering (InTIME) approach, the outcome of which are innovative shift projects that directly step down the negative factors and step up in the quality of life while maintaining the access to social and economic activities. One shift project in Beijing is a new "Work Unit Retrofit" property development enterprise. Integrated land use is a popular idea, but the shift projects in this research answer the questions of "how" the transition to the future city occurs. This research demonstrates the new Transition Engineering approach to sustainable city development that results in actionable property and infrastructure development with financial and social benefits that can be clearly communicated to all stakeholders.y                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

This research demonstrates the new Transition Engineering approach to sustainable city development that results in actionable property and infrastructure development with financial and social benefits that can be clearly communicated to all stakeholders.y                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Transit-Induced Gentrification or Vice Versa? A Study of Neighborhoods Around Light Rail Stations From 1970-2010                                                                                                        | Problem, research strategy, and findings In the 1990s, some cities across the United States invested significantly in expanding light rail transit (LRT) systems. As a result, transit-oriented development (TOD) near new stations became a desirable planning goal for local governments and lucrative to developers. In this study we examined evidence of gentrification in all LRT station areas before and after the opening of these new stations. We also tested the prevalence of gentrification in station areas specifically characterized as TODs. Longitudinal data across seven regions, from 1970 to 2010, demonstrated signs of gentrification in proximity to new stations compared with control areas. By 2000, the share of the White population grew near LRT stations, whereas the percentage of Black residents remained flat. From 1990 to 2010, we found signs of gentrification based on both demographic and economic indicators, including low-income populations. We also tested the relationship among built environment variables and a gentrification index, which revealed a positive correlation with walkability, density, and diversity variables. Our study did not include data to compare the differences in effectiveness between market-rate versus affordable housing, which should be part of future research. Takeaway for practice The results of this study should aid planners and policymakers in understanding the patterns of gentrification before and after the opening of LRT stations. Planners should be concerned with negative effects on Black and low-income residents well before LRT stations open. Our study provides evidence for the need to expand housing and job opportunities in a mixed-use environment as a critical strategy to reduce gentrification near LRT stations and in TODs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Towards shared space                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The streets and spaces that constitute the majority of our public realm play an increasingly important role in the economic and social foundations of towns and cities. Simultaneously, public dissatisfaction with the clutter and barriers associated with conventional traffic engineering is growing. There is also growing recognition of the links between health and the quality of the built environment. New approaches to reconciling the relationship between traffic and the public realm represent a significant challenge to long-standing assumptions underpinning the conventional segregation of traffic from civic space associated with established policy and practice. Often labelled 'shared space', such schemes raise important questions about risk and safety, the role of government in regulating and controlling behaviour and the conventional professional boundaries of urban designers and traffic engineers. A radical review of the role of government in regulating and controlling street design, combined with decisive changes in the organisational structure and processes employed by highway authorities is implied if the benefits for safety, traffic capacity, health and economic vitality from shared space are to be realised. This paper outlines the background and principles underpinning shared space, and describes some of the significant examples in the UK and mainland Europe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

Simultaneously, public dissatisfaction with the clutter and barriers associated with conventional traffic engineering is growing. There is also growing recognition of the links between health and the quality of the built environment. New approaches to reconciling the relationship between traffic and the public realm represent a significant challenge to long-standing assumptions underpinning the conventional segregation of traffic from civic space associated with established policy and practice. Often labelled 'shared space', such schemes raise important questions about risk and safety, the role of government in regulating and controlling behaviour and the conventional professional boundaries of urban designers and traffic engineers. A radical review of the role of government in regulating and controlling street design, combined with decisive changes in the organisational structure and processes employed by highway authorities is implied if the benefits for safety, traffic capacity, health and economic vitality from shared space are to be realised.

| Thinking about the construction of university town from the public bicycle travel of college students: A Chinese empirical study                                                                                        | At present, scholars have mostly discussed urban residents' public bicycle travel behaviour and the effect of built environment; however, relevant research on college students is insufficient, and a thinking path for the construction of university towns is lacking. On the basis of questionnaire survey and point-of-interest data and taking Xianlin University Town in Nanjing, China as an example, this paper focuses on the spatiotemporal characteristics of college students' public bicycle travel and the influencing factors of its built environment. Results of multiple logistic regression model show that (1) travel area is related to the campus layout and the number of surrounding commercial facilities, railway stations or bus stops. (2) Travel time period is related to the number of surrounding public facilities or bus stops. (3) Travel duration is related to the campus layout and the number of surrounding public facilities or bus stops. Finally, this paper proposes some suggestions from the aspects of space optimisation layout of public bicycle stations and vehicle space-time scheduling, campus internal space function adjustment and public service facility construction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| The relationship between regional compactness and regional innovation capacity (RIC): Empirical evidence from a national study                                                                                          | Innovation has become a key driver of economic growth, benefitting from knowledge production and technological advancements. Existing literature on the geography of innovation examines agglomeration economies, density, and the diversity of knowledge intensive firms, yet often overlooks the role of urban form. Generally, compact urban form, as opposed to sprawling regions, offers rich amenities, accessibility to public transit and a higher quality of places. Since such features attract educated millennial, the driving force behind knowledge based and innovation economy, compact regions could be conducive to the innovation capacity. This study builds on Metropolitan Compactness Index (MCI) and examines the relationship between regional compactness and Regional Innovation Capacity (RIC) in the US. Findings indicate that all three indicators of RIC the average number of patents, firm innovations, and the number of innovative small firms are positively associated with MCI, while their relationships were significant in two models. Policy implications suggest that sprawling regions could hinder the innovation capacity, while compact regions could remove the physical barriers to innovation generation through offering high quality places and accessibility to urban amenities. This could facilitate social interactions and enhance social capital, while minimizing poverty and segregation. Investment in compact urban forms, thus, deserves greater attention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

This research focusses on the dilemma between compact city and urban greenspace policies and their influence on actual land-use change in Amsterdam and Brussels. These cases are selected because of their similar urban growth yet diverse policy and governance contexts. We contend that comparing how urban policies try to address this dilemma can provide a deeper understanding of how policy strategies affect land-use change. The results show that densification indeed decreases the quantity (Amsterdam: -4.7% Brussels: -11.9%), average size (A: -3.1% B: -25.6%) and connectivity of urban greenspaces.

Observed land-use changes seem disconnected from purported urban greenspace policies, whereas urban development plans seem to dominate changes in greenspace quantity and form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| The living environment and intravillage activity-travel: A conceptual framework based on participant observation in Guangdong, China                                                                                    | We propose a conceptual framework for understanding the complex nature of the correlation between the living environment and intravillage activity-travel. Based on participant observations of 146 villages (2317 rural res-idents) in Guangdong, China, we find that the rural built environment is predominantly organised by the gemeinschaft cultural environment in which people locate their homes near ancestral halls to maintain the bonds with those who are identified as the Us and to separate themselves from the Other. Together with the impact of the social environment which brings about a dispersed distribution of household farmlands, the phenomenon of home-farmland separation is pervasive. Several transport-related issues are engendered from the rural living environment: (a) distorted time-space for other activities that improve rural residents' quality of life; (b) land abandonment due to unwillingness to travel; and (c) extreme social exclusivity in relation to the Other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

Several transport-related issues are engendered from the rural living environment: (a) distorted time-space for other activities that improve rural residents’ quality of life; (b) land abandonment due to unwillingness to travel; and (c) extreme social exclusivity in relation to the Other. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

| The impact of built environment on physical activity and subjective well-being of urban residents: A study of core cities in the Yangtze River Delta survey                                                             | ObjectiveIn cities with high population density in China, the impact of built environment on human health is rather complicated. Physical activities are an important factor in promoting people's health. This study is aimed to explore ways of enhancing the residents' intensity of physical activities and psychological health in a limited built environment. For this purpose, this study conducted research on 1875 residents from cities in the Yangtze River Delta in China to clarify the complicated correlations among the residents' physical activities, the multi-dimensional geographic environment characteristics, and subjective well-being. MethodsFirst, Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS-A), International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF), and Subjective Well-being Scale for Chinese Citizens (SWBS-CC) were used to measure built environment characteristics, intensity of physical activities, and subjective well-being. Second, the correlations among built environment, physical activities, and subjective well-being were analyzed, which reflected different effects of built environment characteristics on physical activities and subjective well-being. Third, physical activities were viewed as a mediating variable in SEM to analyze the influence mechanism of each built environment characteristic on the subjective well-being of residents. ResultResidents with different individual characteristics may have different levels of perception and usage of built environment. The intensity of physical activities has significant positive correlations with proximity to supporting facilities, accessibility of destinations, and public security, while no significant correlation with overall environmental aesthetics and street connectivity. The residents' subjective well-being has significant positive correlations with accessibility of destinations, overall environmental aesthetics, and public security, while no significant correlation with proximity to supporting facilities and street connectivity. Physical activities not only have a direct effect on subjective well-being, but also a mediating effect on the correlations between subjective well-being and built environment characteristics. ConclusionIn the future, more research could be conducted on the optimization of correlations between residential built environment characteristics and physical activities as well as subjective well-being, so as to gain a deeper understanding about the impact of residential built environment on people's physical and mental health.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| The impact of built environment on physical activity and subjective well-being of urban residents: A study of core cities in the Yangtze River Delta survey                                                             | ObjectiveIn cities with high population density in China, the impact of built environment on human health is rather complicated. Physical activities are an important factor in promoting people's health. This study is aimed to explore ways of enhancing the residents' intensity of physical activities and psychological health in a limited built environment. For this purpose, this study conducted research on 1875 residents from cities in the Yangtze River Delta in China to clarify the complicated correlations among the residents' physical activities, the multi-dimensional geographic environment characteristics, and subjective well-being. MethodsFirst, Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS-A), International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF), and Subjective Well-being Scale for Chinese Citizens (SWBS-CC) were used to measure built environment characteristics, intensity of physical activities, and subjective well-being. Second, the correlations among built environment, physical activities, and subjective well-being were analyzed, which reflected different effects of built environment characteristics on physical activities and subjective well-being. Third, physical activities were viewed as a mediating variable in SEM to analyze the influence mechanism of each built environment characteristic on the subjective well-being of residents. ResultResidents with different individual characteristics may have different levels of perception and usage of built environment. The intensity of physical activities has significant positive correlations with proximity to supporting facilities, accessibility of destinations, and public security, while no significant correlation with overall environmental aesthetics and street connectivity. The residents' subjective well-being has significant positive correlations with accessibility of destinations, overall environmental aesthetics, and public security, while no significant correlation with proximity to supporting facilities and street connectivity. Physical activities not only have a direct effect on subjective well-being, but also a mediating effect on the correlations between subjective well-being and built environment characteristics. ConclusionIn the future, more research could be conducted on the optimization of correlations between residential built environment characteristics and physical activities as well as subjective well-being, so as to gain a deeper understanding about the impact of residential built environment on people's physical and mental health.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| The hidden risk in China's cropland conversion from the perspective of slope                                                                                                                                            | Cropland conversion is a significant theme of the influence of human activities on ecological systems and global food security. Conventionally, cropland conversion in China has been deemed to match the dynamic balance of cropland resources well and to ensure food security for the whole country. However, local studies have presented some conflicting signs that call for an integrated analysis from a national viewpoint. In this paper, by considering the significance of slope in cropland-related natural and socioeconomic issues, we explore the slope features of China's cropland conversion during 2000-2015 and endeavor to identify some potential risks hidden in the process. High-resolution remotely sensed images, digital elevation model and spatial analytical methods are adopted to conduct the analysis. The results show that, the features of cropland conversion in diverse slope division areas are all distinct. Some risks indicated by these conversion features can be identified as follows: (1) unsuitable reclamation of cropland in flat areas causes ecological damage, (2) the invasion of sparsely populated construction land on cropland in steep areas has a dramatic impact on the local area, (3) excessive greening in Northwest and Northeast China, and insufficient greening in Southwest China are not healthy for regional sustainability, (4) cropland's upslope reclamation and downslope loss pose potential risks for food security. In the context of dynamic balance management and other related national policies, cropland conversion in China is not as optimistic as former surveys have indicated, and promoted measures should be elaborately adjusted based on local conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |

| The challenges of rising income on urban household carbon emission: do savings matter?                                                                                                                                  | As an essential household economic factor, household savings with increasing income affect household energy access. However, there is limited understanding of the household savings accumulation differs the impact of income on household energy and related CO2. Based on the panel data of 284 cities in China, a threshold regression model is constructed to investigate the non-linear effects of income on urban household carbon emissions at different saving levels. We found that the heterogeneity of residential savings substantially mattered the income effect on urban household carbon emission. Especially, low-saving households struggled to obtain clean energy, needed more government intervention to replace the fossil fuel system with a clean household energy system. By comparison, middle- and high-saving households could easily transit towards a clean energy system, including natural gas and electricity. Moreover, residential income strongly drives the rising household electricity and related CO2 at the upper-middle saving level. High-saving households showed high sensitivity to heating energy in northern China. In addition, an in-depth analysis of challenges faced by the energy consumption of Chinese urban households in coping with climate change is carried out, and policy recommendations in most undeveloped regions of China and other counties with high-carbon energy structures are put forward accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |
| The challenges of rising income on urban household carbon emission: do savings matter?                                                                                                                                  | As an essential household economic factor, household savings with increasing income affect household energy access. However, there is limited understanding of the household savings accumulation differs the impact of income on household energy and related CO2. Based on the panel data of 284 cities in China, a threshold regression model is constructed to investigate the non-linear effects of income on urban household carbon emissions at different saving levels. We found that the heterogeneity of residential savings substantially mattered the income effect on urban household carbon emission. Especially, low-saving households struggled to obtain clean energy, needed more government intervention to replace the fossil fuel system with a clean household energy system. By comparison, middle- and high-saving households could easily transit towards a clean energy system, including natural gas and electricity. Moreover, residential income strongly drives the rising household electricity and related CO2 at the upper-middle saving level. High-saving households showed high sensitivity to heating energy in northern China. In addition, an in-depth analysis of challenges faced by the energy consumption of Chinese urban households in coping with climate change is carried out, and policy recommendations in most undeveloped regions of China and other counties with high-carbon energy structures are put forward accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| The causal effect of private transport on life satisfaction among older adults and the mediation effect of social participation in China                                                                                | Private transport constitutes the prerequisite for the freedom of mobility and facilitates accessibility for activities of older adults. Abundant studies have been conducted on the association between car ownership and life satisfaction in Western countries where cars dominate private transport. However, as the most prevalent and conventional private transport in China, cars and e-bikes have not received adequate attention. Using 2015 and 2018 datasets from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, we apply the Propensity Score Matching–Difference in Differences to investigate how private transport influences the multi-dimensional life quality of older adults. Furthermore, we focus on the mediation effect of social participation on the above causal effect. Our findings reveal that car and e-bike ownership have a causal impact on older adults' life satisfaction, while the influence of e-bike ownership is multi-dimensional. The relationship between car ownership and life satisfaction is mediated by social participation regarding exercise and voluntary activities. However, the mediation effects of mahjong and exercise activities are statistically significant between e-bike ownership and the multi-dimensional life quality of older adults. Understanding the life quality of older adults related to private transport is essential for guiding travel mobility and the life quality of older adults in China. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Governance |

Understanding the life quality of older adults related to private transport is essential for guiding travel mobility and the life quality of older adults in China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| The built environment and trip chaining behaviour revisited: The joint effects of the modifiable areal unit problem and tour purpose                                                                                    | Empirical research that examines the built environment and travel behaviour has frequently found inconsistent results, which can be attributed to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) and to different treatments of travel purposes. This study considers these two important issues simultaneously in investigating the association between the built environment and travel behaviour in Beijing, China. Using tours as the analysis unit of travel, this study classifies three tour purposes: subsistence, maintenance and recreation, and identifies seven different spatial units to address the MAUP. Based on data from the 2010 Beijing Comprehensive Travel Survey, this study uses logistic regressions to estimate the primary tour mode and tour complexity. The results identify the ideal' unit at which the built environment has the greatest association with tours of specific purposes. Such results inform how urban planning and transportation policies can effectively influence travel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| The battle to achieve Sustainable Development Goal Two: The role of environmental sustainability and government institutions                                                                                            | The current period marked by addressing environmental sustainability challenges and the instability of government institutions has heightened the issue of food security, especially in developing countries as they work towards achieving Zero Hunger as highlighted in the Sustainable Development Goals. To assess the effect of environmental sustainability and government institutions on food security in West Africa with data from 1990 to 2021, two models have been deployed. The Generalized Method of Moments was deployed as the main model and while Two-Stage Least Squares was used as the robustness check. The findings of the study reveal that carbon emissions which represent environmental sustainability has no direct significant effect on food security, while government institutions has negative effect on food security. The study also reveals that income and urbanization promote food security, while renewable energy and population growth reduce food security. The findings of the study could be a reflection of the current political instability and attitude towards tackling carbon emissions mitigation in the region. Government institutions are encouraged to exercise authority without fear to implement policies that would encourage food security and restrict the use of high-emission technologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |
| The battle to achieve Sustainable Development Goal Two: The role of environmental sustainability and government institutions                                                                                            | The current period marked by addressing environmental sustainability challenges and the instability of government institutions has heightened the issue of food security, especially in developing countries as they work towards achieving Zero Hunger as highlighted in the Sustainable Development Goals. To assess the effect of environmental sustainability and government institutions on food security in West Africa with data from 1990 to 2021, two models have been deployed. The Generalized Method of Moments was deployed as the main model and while Two-Stage Least Squares was used as the robustness check. The findings of the study reveal that carbon emissions which represent environmental sustainability has no direct significant effect on food security, while government institutions has negative effect on food security. The study also reveals that income and urbanization promote food security, while renewable energy and population growth reduce food security. The findings of the study could be a reflection of the current political instability and attitude towards tackling carbon emissions mitigation in the region. Government institutions are encouraged to exercise authority without fear to implement policies that would encourage food security and restrict the use of high-emission technologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Governance |
| The acceptance of density: Conflicts of public and private interests in public debate on urban densification                                                                                                            | Urban densification is crucial for sustainable urban growth. Yet, its implementation often leads to local conflicts. To understand the interplay between private and public interests, we analysed media reports on densification policies and projects in Switzerland from 2009 and 2019, a period when Switzerland revised its Spatial Planning Act, limiting land take and promoting densification. Our results reveal a disconnect between private and public interests. Residents and other established stakeholders tend to dominate the public debate. Arguments in the face of impending building often reflect conflicting social values related to distributive justice, such as rising housing costs, loss of identity of place, and erosion of social cohesion. NIMBYism, the "Not In My Backyard" phenomenon, is insufficient to explain criticism or the rejection of urban densification measures. Other factors, such as ecological concerns, have gained impact. Moreover, our study highlights that the Swiss direct democratic instrument of popular initiatives tends to stimulate public debate and, thereby, has the potential to better bridge public interests with the effects of densification policies on residents and communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

Moreover, our study highlights that the Swiss direct democratic instrument of popular initiatives tends to stimulate public debate and, thereby, has the potential to better bridge public interests with the effects of densification policies on residents and communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

This study aims to measure energy poverty and assess the impact of renewable energy technology innovation in 30 provinces across China. Furthermore, it calculates city-level energy poverty in 274 cities. By examining the influence of renewable energy technology innovation on energy poverty, this study proposes a new approach to accelerate energy transition and promote sustainable development. The regression results, which have undergone rigorous robustness and endogeneity tests, demonstrate that renewable energy technology innovation significantly alleviates energy poverty. Moreover, the treatment effect of policies is determined through the regression control method. Specifically, the cities of Zhangjiakou, Baotou, and Qiqihar are analyzed to provide targeted suggestions for China's energy development. The treatment effects of both provincial and city-level policies indicate that implementing renewable energy demonstration zones can effectively alleviate energy poverty.JEL Classification: Q48; O31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |

| The Relationship between Walkability and Place Attachment and the Mediating Role of Neighborhood-Based Social Interaction                                                                                               | This study aims to provide insights in the relation between neighborhood walkability and place attachment and the mediating role of (satisfaction with) social interaction. Both objective and perceived walkability are tested. To analyze these relations, two structural equation models are estimated on data collected among 251 residents of different neighborhoods across the Netherlands. The results show that perceived neighborhood walkability is a stronger predictor of place attachment than objective walkability. Perceived walkability has both a positive direct effect on place attachment and an indirect effect, via neighborhood-based social interaction. Objective walkability only has a positive direct effect on place attachment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |
| The Relationship between Walkability and Place Attachment and the Mediating Role of Neighborhood-Based Social Interaction                                                                                               | This study aims to provide insights in the relation between neighborhood walkability and place attachment and the mediating role of (satisfaction with) social interaction. Both objective and perceived walkability are tested. To analyze these relations, two structural equation models are estimated on data collected among 251 residents of different neighborhoods across the Netherlands. The results show that perceived neighborhood walkability is a stronger predictor of place attachment than objective walkability. Perceived walkability has both a positive direct effect on place attachment and an indirect effect, via neighborhood-based social interaction. Objective walkability only has a positive direct effect on place attachment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| The Pleasure of Walking: An Innovative Methodology to Assess Appropriate Walkable Performance in Urban Areas to Support Transport Planning                                                                              | The Walking Suitability Index of the Territory-T-WSI is an innovative methodology to assess walkability. Unlike other methods and tools in this field designed to evaluate walkability on given origin-destination paths, T-WSI is conceived for area-wide assessments, typically at the neighborhood level. This can be achieved by visual surveys to collect data, which are easy to perform at street level, their further process via an algorithm, and their aggregation to assess the walking performance levels of the test area. The paper describes such methodology, which includes the development of 12 indicators associated with four main evaluation categories (Practicability, Safety, Urbanity and Appeal), and its application to a case study in a medium-size town in central Italy. Results are described and elaborated to highlight T-WSI's contribution to help decision makers in the urban governance process, typically in the fields of land use, mobility management and maintenance, coherently with the research objective to enlarge the potential of walkability methodologies thus far available up to area-level assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| The Pleasure of Walking: An Innovative Methodology to Assess Appropriate Walkable Performance in Urban Areas to Support Transport Planning                                                                              | The Walking Suitability Index of the Territory-T-WSI is an innovative methodology to assess walkability. Unlike other methods and tools in this field designed to evaluate walkability on given origin-destination paths, T-WSI is conceived for area-wide assessments, typically at the neighborhood level. This can be achieved by visual surveys to collect data, which are easy to perform at street level, their further process via an algorithm, and their aggregation to assess the walking performance levels of the test area. The paper describes such methodology, which includes the development of 12 indicators associated with four main evaluation categories (Practicability, Safety, Urbanity and Appeal), and its application to a case study in a medium-size town in central Italy.

| The Impact of Built Environment on Bike Commuting: Utilising Strava Bike Data and Geographically Weighted Models                                                                                                        | Active travel provides significant public health benefits including improving physical and mental health and air quality. Given the geography of congested roads, availability of required infrastructure and cost of transportation in cities, promoting active travel, including cycling, can be a good solution for commuting within built environments. Having a better understanding of the key drivers that may influence bike ridership can help with designing cities that accommodate cyclists' needs for healthier citizens. This paper examines the built environment features that may affect commuting cyclists. We respectively employ Ordinary Linear Square (OLS) regression and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) for 136 Intermediate Zones of the city of Glasgow, UK. The results of GWR show that the significant local variation in green areas suggests that even though the global regression showed a negative association between the greenness and commute cycling, over half of the IZ areas had a strong positive association with the green areas. Building height and Public Transport Availability Index show geographic patterns where the residuals are fairly stationary across the study area with some clusters of high residuals. Performance wise, the results from GWR provided an R-2 of 0.73 which was higher than OLS at 0.3. Our results can provide insights into how to use crowdsourced cycling data when there are spatially and temporally limited resources available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

Our results can provide insights into how to use crowdsourced cycling data when there are spatially and temporally limited resources available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

Understanding these influences is an important research topic, making it a central focus of this paper. This study aims to identify the factors responsible for promoting healthy mobility behavior. To address this comprehensively, a multidisciplinary empirical survey was developed based on the "Triad"-a model consisting of the built environment, mobility(-behavior), and public health. In addition to the evaluation of socio-demographic factors and activity radius mapping, statistical analyses like multiple linear regression were used. These statistical analyses allow the assessment of the impact of various independent variables on the promotion of healthy mobility behavior within urban settings. The multiple regression shows that the satisfaction with the accessibility of public transport and the sense of safety as a cyclist contribute to explaining the variation of healthy mobility. Furthermore, the satisfaction with walking in the neighborhood and the inhalation of exhaust fumes while walking also seem to have an impact. The results show the link between the Triad and make it clear that mobility planning and urban planning must take a more integrated approach to promote health and simultaneously protect the climate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

| The Correlation between Urban Form and Carbon Emissions: A Bibliometric and Literature Review                                                                                                                           | Urban carbon emissions contribute significantly to global warming, but various factors impact these emissions. This study focuses on the correlation between urban form and carbon emissions. Urban form is an entity that can be directly manipulated and optimized by disciplines such as architecture, urban design, and urban planning. The improvement of urban form, particularly at the meso-micro scale, is relatively rapid and affordable compared to other carbon-related factors, such as macro-industry or energy structure. Therefore, conducting a study on the correlation between urban form and carbon emissions is crucial, and the findings will provide direct scientific support for low-carbon city planning. The paper combines bibliometric analysis with a literature review. First, we explore research hotspots and trends using bibliometric analysis. Second, we organize the literature review based on the main research components, methods, and findings in this field. Finally, we propose a framework and direction for future research.

| The Correlation between Urban Form and Carbon Emissions: A Bibliometric and Literature Review                                                                                                                           | Urban carbon emissions contribute significantly to global warming, but various factors impact these emissions. This study focuses on the correlation between urban form and carbon emissions. Urban form is an entity that can be directly manipulated and optimized by disciplines such as architecture, urban design, and urban planning. The improvement of urban form, particularly at the meso-micro scale, is relatively rapid and affordable compared to other carbon-related factors, such as macro-industry or energy structure. Therefore, conducting a study on the correlation between urban form and carbon emissions is crucial, and the findings will provide direct scientific support for low-carbon city planning. The paper combines bibliometric analysis with a literature review. First, we explore research hotspots and trends using bibliometric analysis. Second, we organize the literature review based on the main research components, methods, and findings in this field. Finally, we propose a framework and direction for future research. It was found that (1) numerous study methodologies are currently being used to investigate the direct and indirect impacts of urban form on carbon emissions, with Chinese scholars' research progressing rapidly; (2) the primary focus of the study is on the carbon emissions related to residents' consumption, and there are still issues with inconsistent measurement approaches; (3) there is more research conducted on the macro-scale of cities but not enough on the meso-micro scale. Future research must focus more on meso-microscale analysis, quantifying the key influences and pathways of urban form on carbon emissions. Additionally, it is crucial to establish a comprehensive research framework that can serve as a guide for more effective urban development aimed at reducing carbon emissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

Tackling impacts generated by mobility practices can pass through active mobility promotion. However, this requires knowledge of travel choices of different population groups, in order to be successful. Students are an interesting travelers group with particular living and mobility conditions. Lately, mobility issues have gained an increasing attention within educational institutions. This mobilization may be of benefit for their overall host area. Students can become trend-setters, creating a multiplying effect with their travel choices. Thus, student mobility characteristics require attention. In Serres, Greece, an action plan for active travel promotion was developed and there has been a recent investment on walking and cycling infrastructure. In this framework, the detection of travel patterns and attitudes of local student community can be really helpful for targeting relevant interventions. This paper departs from a research aiming at recording mobility choices of students of the Technological Educational Institute of Central Macedonia (TEI), located in Serres, through a web-based travel survey and at making suggestions for more sustainable travel behaviour. Results demonstrate that students are largely in favor of bicycle, they would welcome a joint bus and bicycle promotion and measures in favor of intermodality, e.g. properly equipped buses in order to have bikes on board. Also, students call for both hard and soft measures, like more cycling paths, additional bicycle parking equipment throughout the city, bike sharing schemes as well as incentives, like discounts in buying and maintaining a bicycle or reduction in bus tickets. This small scale effort is enriched by other recent works concerning Serres in the field of sustainable mobility and attempts to adjust their suggestions to students target group, as a starting point for an active travel strategy for the city.

| Strategies for greening the economy in three Nordic countries                                                                                                                                                           | Green economy is a concept frequently used by governments and international institutions to promote sustainable transformations of the economy. In this study, we explore how the transition towards a green economy is being conceptualised in policy terms in the three Nordic countries Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Comparing these cases, we analyse strategic policy documents on green growth, circular economy, bioeconomy, low-carbon transitions, and sustainable development. While comprehensive national policy strategies on the green economy are lacking, the studied documents display policy approaches that reflect different aspects of a green economic transformations, such as low-carbon developments, promotion of environmental technology sectors, and enhanced circularity. Our findings indicate the presence of a transformative Nordic model for greening the economy, in which the state plays an active role in supporting innovation and technology development, facilitating cooperation among societal actors, and securing social welfare and human wellbeing. It is underpinned by optimism about the opportunity to reconcile economic growth with sustainable development, while more radical beyond growth approaches are strikingly absent, reflecting their marginal roles in the established policy discourse of these countries. Rather, concepts such as circular economy, sharing economy, and sustainable production and consumption are highlighted as central for greening the economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| Stadium Travel and Subjective Well-Being of Football Spectators                                                                                                                                                         | In the context of leisure travel in sport, the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals to promote public health and combat climate change may be addressed simultaneously. This study investigates football spectators' carbon footprint that is generated from traveling to the stadium. It also examines the effects of stadium travel and everyday pro-environmental behavior on spectators' subjective well-being. The study uses data that were gathered from an online survey in Germany in 2021 (n = 1605). For a detailed carbon footprint assessment, spectators were allowed to indicate multiple transportation means if they switched them during their stadium journey. Seemingly unrelated regression models were calculated to examine the effect of transportation behavior (i.e., stadium travel) and everyday recycling, consumption, and energy-saving behavior on life satisfaction and happiness. Traveling to a home game caused an average carbon footprint of 7.79 kg CO2-e per spectator, or 190.4 tons CO2-e for all home game spectators. Regression results showed that sustainable consumption increased both well-being measures while recycling behavior only positively contributed to happiness. Stadium travel and energy-saving behavior showed no significant effect. These findings implicate that achieving both sustainable development goals can go hand in hand in some contexts of pro-environmental behavior, but not in all dimensions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |
| Stadium Travel and Subjective Well-Being of Football Spectators                                                                                                                                                         | In the context of leisure travel in sport, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals to promote public health and combat climate change may be addressed simultaneously. This study investigates football spectators’ carbon footprint that is generated from traveling to the stadium. It also examines the effects of stadium travel and everyday pro-environmental behavior on spectators’ subjective well-being. The study uses data that were gathered from an online survey in Germany in 2021 (n = 1605). For a detailed carbon footprint assessment, spectators were allowed to indicate multiple transportation means if they switched them during their stadium journey. Seemingly unrelated regression models were calculated to examine the effect of transportation behavior (i.e., stadium travel) and everyday recycling, consumption, and energy-saving behavior on life satisfaction and happiness. Traveling to a home game caused an average carbon footprint of 7.79 kg CO2-e per spectator, or 190.4 tons CO2-e for all home game spectators. Regression results showed that sustainable consumption increased both well-being measures while recycling behavior only positively contributed to happiness. Stadium travel and energy-saving behavior showed no significant effect. These findings implicate that achieving both sustainable development goals can go hand in hand in some contexts of pro-environmental behavior, but not in all dimensions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |

Additional indicators of particular relevance to the built environment are identified relating to the end -users and local community, as well as indicators relating to society, value chain actors, and workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |
| Social life cycle assessment of adaptive reuse                                                                                                                                                                          | Adaptive reuse of existing buildings and shared spaces has been highlighted as a key circular economy concept in the built environment, with the former also having been found to increase social sustainability through the preservation of cultural heritage. However, circular economy research has focused on the economic and environmental dimensions, with the social dimension receiving less attention. The aim of this study is, therefore, to establish the social impact of an adaptive reuse case with shared spaces. A supplementary aim is to test and adapt the general social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) framework to fit the built environment context. A qualitative single case study method is used. The study finds significant positive social impacts from the adaptive reuse case, mainly in the form of economic and cultural impact on the local community. The S-LCA framework was a useful tool in assessing the social impact of the case. Additional indicators of particular relevance to the built environment are identified relating to the end-users and local community, as well as indicators relating to society, value chain actors, and workers.Practice relevanceA set of sector-specific indicators is created to capture the social impact. The findings are useful for researchers and industry professionals intending to evaluate and increase the social sustainability of a construction or demolition project. The improved S-LCA framework and set of indicators allows for an improved understanding of built environment implications. Planners, designers, and clients can employ the revised framework to evaluate projects pre- and post-construction or demolition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |

We characterize the conditions under which integration or segregation will occur, which depends on the majority's social externality parameter and net benefit from leaving, and the minority's leaving probability. Minority segregation may result from the process of tipping, which may arise from three possible channels: two are related to exogenous shocks (migration flows and changes in tipping points) and one is related to the endogenous probabilistic features of our framework (endogenous polarization).

This characterization of integration and segregation conditions yields interesting policy implications for social and urban planning policies to mitigate segregation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Social benefit cost analysis of ecosystem-based climate change adaptations: a community-level case study in Tanna Island, Vanuatu                                                                                       | Small island developing states are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including more intense and frequent extreme weather, warming temperatures, coastal erosion, inundation, and coral bleaching. Locally-specific natural resource threats, associated with population growth and tourism, exacerbate these systemic risks, which are particularly acute where community well-being is subsistence-based and directly reliant on ecosystem services. Garden productivity is falling as the cropping/fallow cycle intensifies and culturally and there is loss of observance of traditional resource taboos, eroding the effectiveness of customary management. Ecosystem based adaptations (EbA) provide a fruitful range of interventions and are beginning to attract development funding. We undertook a social benefit cost analysis for a suite of interconnecting EbAs for Tanna in Vanuatu. We found that funds targeted at increasing the productivity of the gardens returns significant social benefit. This also reduces pressure on natural resource threats and can potentially be adopted by all households on Tanna. In addition, increasing the community's capacity to balance formal forest and reef conservation with customary management can provide small, but nevertheless important complimentary benefits. Our programme design included interlinking activities, including a series of demonstration garden plots, extension officers, community radio, a community ranger programme and a tree nursery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |

| Segmentation of the current levels of passenger mileage by car in the light of sustainability targets - The Swedish case                                                                                                | There is a clear need for debate about targeted policies to address individual behaviour and car mileage. In this study, the point of departure is that we need more knowledge regarding travel behaviour focusing on the needed reduction in car mileages. The study illustrates a series of travel behaviour analyses that can be applied in any other country striving for more detailed knowledge of the challenges ahead regarding reductions in car mileage. The focus is on passenger mileage by car in relation to the level of passenger mileage by car estimated by the Swedish Transport Administration for a sustainable transport system by 2050. Four distance categories are defined and used. The results indicate that on an average day, the overwhelming majority of total passenger mileage by car (>90%) is produced by a minority of the population (25%) and only approximately half of the population use a car on an average day. There are differences between rural and urban areas, but for the category of high passenger mileage by car, the difference is not remarkable. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

| Segmentation of the current levels of passenger mileage by car in the light of sustainability targets - The Swedish case                                                                                                | There is a clear need for debate about targeted policies to address individual behaviour and car mileage. In this study, the point of departure is that we need more knowledge regarding travel behaviour focusing on the needed reduction in car mileages. The study illustrates a series of travel behaviour analyses that can be applied in any other country striving for more detailed knowledge of the challenges ahead regarding reductions in car mileage. The focus is on passenger mileage by car in relation to the level of passenger mileage by car estimated by the Swedish Transport Administration for a sustainable transport system by 2050. Four distance categories are defined and used. The results indicate that on an average day, the overwhelming majority of total passenger mileage by car (>90%) is produced by a minority of the population (25%) and only approximately half of the population use a car on an average day. There are differences between rural and urban areas, but for the category of high passenger mileage by car, the difference is not remarkable. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Anthropogenic sources of environmental pollutants degrade the water resources while population expansion contributes to rising demand for non-renewable energy resources which further enhances the greenhouse gas emissions. Also, maintaining the food security/-safety is another challenge which needs to be addressed for securing 'planetary public health'. The sustainability programs, pragmatic studies, and strategies from regulatory/scientific institutions attempt to reduce the depletion of these resources and mitigate environmental challenges however, the individualistic approaches proves to be inadequate. Therefore, the present review emphasizes the use of Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus as a tool to combat environmental degradation, address climate action, and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this article, we investigate methodological paradigm and application of WEF Nexus in an inter-related framework through case studies on water resources, energy efficiency, urban food production, food waste reduction, cross-sectoral perspectives, and the circular economy. It has been widely observed that excessive exploitation of these resources influences the global food supply and demand, water availability, resilience in energy and socio-economic sector. Also, such perturbations in water, energy, and food sectors were found to be inextricably linked with climate change. The results further revealed that WEF nexus approach stimulates multilevel and inter-sectoral governance, thereby aiding to address the complexities and inefficiencies in achieving the SDGs. The prioritization of WEF Nexus strategy, especially under the event of COVID-19 can be a holistic approach to sustainably utilise natural resources to help achieve the environmental sustainability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| Role of water-energy-food nexus in environmental management and climate action                                                                                                                                          | The demand for water, energy, and food resources increased in tandem with the world's population, industrialization, and urbanization. Anthropogenic sources of environmental pollutants degrade the water resources while population expansion contributes to rising demand for non-renewable energy resources which further enhances the greenhouse gas emissions. Also, maintaining the food security/-safety is another challenge which needs to be addressed for securing 'planetary public health'. The sustainability programs, pragmatic studies, and strategies from regulatory/scientific institutions attempt to reduce the depletion of these resources and mitigate environmental challenges however, the individualistic approaches proves to be inadequate. Therefore, the present review emphasizes the use of Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus as a tool to combat environmental degradation, address climate action, and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this article, we investigate methodological paradigm and application of WEF Nexus in an inter-related framework through case studies on water resources, energy efficiency, urban food production, food waste reduction, cross-sectoral perspectives, and the circular economy. It has been widely observed that excessive exploitation of these resources influences the global food supply and demand, water availability, resilience in energy and socio-economic sector. Also, such perturbations in water, energy, and food sectors were found to be inextricably linked with climate change. The results further revealed that WEF nexus approach stimulates multilevel and inter-sectoral governance, thereby aiding to address the complexities and inefficiencies in achieving the SDGs. The prioritization of WEF Nexus strategy, especially under the event of COVID-19 can be a holistic approach to sustainably utilise natural resources to help achieve the environmental sustainability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Governance |
| Revolutionizing TOD Planning in a Developing Country: An Objective-Weighted Framework for Measuring Nodal TOD Index                                                                                                     | Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a planning strategy that combines land use and transportation planning to promote economic, environmental, and social sustainability. While developed cities have embraced TOD, developing cities need to adopt it faster. This has resulted in a need for robust TOD measurement frameworks for developing countries. Furthermore, existing frameworks often use subjective weightage for different TOD indicators, which can lead to human biases. To address these issues, the authors aimed to develop a more robust and objective framework for measuring TOD in developing cities, particularly Dhaka, Bangladesh. The authors used density, diversity, destination accessibility, and design criteria to select eight indicators for measuring TOD. However, a buffer radius of 800 meters was taken for each of the 17 stations to calculate TOD. An objective-weighted spatial multi-criteria analysis (OSMCA) was used to evaluate the framework. The model's robustness was assessed by analyzing the sensitivity of eight TOD scenarios and identifying hotspot clusters using statistical methods. Additionally, the authors ranked the stations based on the highest TOD score and compared TOD with developed and developing cities to gain planning insights. They proposed three different TOD planning methodologies for nodes that emphasize the importance of design, destination access, and density for (re)development, zoning, and affordable housing policies in Dhaka's regions. Finally, the study discussed limitations and future research priorities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

Finally, the study discussed limitations and future research priorities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Residential-employment mixed use and jobs-housing balance: A case study of Shenzhen, China                                                                                                                              | Residential-employment mixed use has often been proposed to promote jobs-housing balance and to increase employment self-containment of residents, thereby reducing commuting distance and motorized travel. However, the relationship between residential-employment mixed use and work trips has few consensuses. Whether residential-employment mixed use is correlated with employment self-containment of residents remains to be explored. In this study, the relationships between residential-employment mixed use and employment self-containment of residents are examined in the industrial and commercial areas in Shenzhen, China. The relationships between commercial-residential and industrial-residential mixes and employment self-containment of residents are examined using mobile phone data. Results indicate that residential-employment mixed use is positively correlated with employment self-containment of residents in industrial-residential mix areas in the suburbs, but is not correlated in commercial-residential mix areas in the central city. Residential-employment mixed use alone does not achieve high employment self-containment of residents, which also depends on other factors such as its economic sector, location, and housing prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Replacement of speed bumps by chicanes: a step in modernizing the Indian traffic calming strategy                                                                                                                       | Urban regions across the globe are progressively using traffic calming strategies to lower traffic speeds and improve road safety. Certain measures, such as chicanes are used as a lateral or horizontal shift in the carriageway with the intention of reducing speed. The current research aims to investigate the overall impact of speed bumps, which were either removed or replaced in response to its discomfort and public outcry. A crossing 85th percentile speed range of 12 - 15 km/h was observed at the Speed Bumps. In a pilot study, Chicanes as a replacement showed an average of 49% speed reduction compared to 62% by Speed Bumps in mixed traffic conditions. A sample size of 5000 vehicles was used to assess the speed profiles. Despite comparatively high crossing speeds, chicanes still serve the purpose by reducing speeds to less than 25 km/h. Simulation was performed and estimated through node evaluation using a microsimulation tool, to replicate and compare parameters like queue delay and acceleration, reflecting how drivers might behave inside the influence range where speed bump was replaced. It was perceived that while deciding the most appropriate calming measure, the geometric attributes, speed profiles, and public opinion should be considered before implementation. � 2024 ICE Publishing.

| Replacement of speed bumps by chicanes: a step in modernizing the Indian traffic calming strategy                                                                                                                       | Urban regions across the globe are progressively using traffic calming strategies to lower traffic speeds and improve road safety. Certain measures, such as chicanes are used as a lateral or horizontal shift in the carriageway with the intention of reducing speed. The current research aims to investigate the overall impact of speed bumps, which were either removed or replaced in response to its discomfort and public outcry. A crossing 85th percentile speed range of 12 - 15 km/h was observed at the Speed Bumps. In a pilot study, Chicanes as a replacement showed an average of 49% speed reduction compared to 62% by Speed Bumps in mixed traffic conditions. A sample size of 5000 vehicles was used to assess the speed profiles. Despite comparatively high crossing speeds, chicanes still serve the purpose by reducing speeds to less than 25 km/h. Simulation was performed and estimated through node evaluation using a microsimulation tool, to replicate and compare parameters like queue delay and acceleration, reflecting how drivers might behave inside the influence range where speed bump was replaced.

Evaluation of accessibility conditions in eradications in the Metropolitan Area of Tucuman                                                                                                | The Metropolitan Area of Tucuman (AMeT) is undergoing a process of gentrification linked to intense socio-spatial fragmentation, expressed through the unequal growth -regarding both area and population- of municipalities and communes (Gomez Lopez, Cuozzo and Boldrini, 2015). The Institute for Planning, Housing and Urban Development (IPVDU) is undertaking operations to regularize historic settlements in the ATS through relocations.

| Relationship between Rural Built Environment and Household Vehicle Ownership: An Empirical Analysis in Rural Sichuan, China                                                                                             | With the rapid rural urbanization and new rural construction in China, tremendous changes are occurring in rural built environments and rural household vehicle ownership. However, few studies have examined the relationship between rural built environments and rural household vehicle ownership. In this study, a questionnaire survey of 374 rural households was conducted and the built environment data of seven typical villages in rural Sichuan were collected using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and on-site measurement. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the rural built environment and rural household vehicle ownership in China through a multinomial logit (MNL) model. Results show that household structure attributes have the most significant relationship with vehicle ownership, followed by rural built environment attributes and the respondents' driving skills. In the process of urbanization, with increases in building density, road density, and destination accessibility, an increase in high-carbon vehicle ownership is an inevitable trend among rural households. However, low-carbon-oriented rural planning can effectively control the increase in high-carbon vehicle ownership. For example, the distance between rural households and important destinations, such as hospitals, schools, and markets, should be shortened and rural residents should be encouraged to learn to ride bicycles. Moreover, rural residents riding motorcycles can effectively reduce household car ownership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| Relationship between Rural Built Environment and Household Vehicle Ownership: An Empirical Analysis in Rural Sichuan, China                                                                                             | With the rapid rural urbanization and new rural construction in China, tremendous changes are occurring in rural built environments and rural household vehicle ownership. However, few studies have examined the relationship between rural built environments and rural household vehicle ownership. In this study, a questionnaire survey of 374 rural households was conducted and the built environment data of seven typical villages in rural Sichuan were collected using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and on-site measurement. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the rural built environment and rural household vehicle ownership in China through a multinomial logit (MNL) model. Results show that household structure attributes have the most significant relationship with vehicle ownership, followed by rural built environment attributes and the respondents' driving skills. In the process of urbanization, with increases in building density, road density, and destination accessibility, an increase in high-carbon vehicle ownership is an inevitable trend among rural households. However, low-carbon-oriented rural planning can effectively control the increase in high-carbon vehicle ownership. For example, the distance between rural households and important destinations, such as hospitals, schools, and markets, should be shortened and rural residents should be encouraged to learn to ride bicycles. Moreover, rural residents riding motorcycles can effectively reduce household car ownership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Rapid rise in urban sprawl: Global hotspots and trends since 1990                                                                                                                                                       | Dispersed low-density development-"urban sprawl"-has many detrimental environmental, economic, and social consequences. Sprawl leads to higher greenhouse-gas emissions and poses an increasing threat to the long-term availability of many vital ecosystem services. Therefore, urban sprawl is in stark contradiction to the principles of sustainable land use and to the need for a sustainability transformation. This study presents the degree of urban sprawl on the planet at multiple spatial scales (continents, UN regions, countries, sub-national units, and a regular grid) for the period 1990-2014. Urban sprawl increased by 95% in 24 years, almost 4% per year, with built-up areas growing by almost 28 km(2) per day, or 1.16 km(2) per hour. The results demonstrate that Europe has been the most sprawled and also the most rapidly sprawling continent, by 51% since 1990. At the scale of UN regions, the highest relative increases in urban sprawl were observed in East Asia, Western Africa, and Southeast Asia. Urban sprawl per capita has been highest in Oceania and North America, exhibiting a minor decline since 1990, while it has been increasing rapidly in Europe, by almost 47% since 1990. The study revealed a strong relationship between urban sprawl and the level of human development as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI). The results suggest that it will be important for a more sustainable future to find a better balance between a high quality of life and using land more sparingly. There is an urgent need to stop urban sprawl, since current regulations and measures in developed countries are apparently not effective at limiting it. Monitoring urban sprawl can serve to guide policy development such as the implementation of targets and limits and to evaluate the effectiveness of urban growth management strategies at mitigating urban sprawl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

Monitoring urban sprawl can serve to guide policy development such as the implementation of targets and limits and to evaluate the effectiveness of urban growth management strategies at mitigating urban sprawl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |
| Rapid rise in urban sprawl: Global hotspots and trends since 1990                                                                                                                                                       | Dispersed low-density development–“urban sprawl”–has many detrimental environmental, economic, and social consequences. Sprawl leads to higher greenhouse-gas emissions and poses an increasing threat to the long-term availability of many vital ecosystem services. Therefore, urban sprawl is in stark contradiction to the principles of sustainable land use and to the need for a sustainability transformation. This study presents the degree of urban sprawl on the planet at multiple spatial scales (continents, UN regions, countries, subnational units, and a regular grid) for the period 1990–2014. Urban sprawl increased by 95% in 24 years, almost 4% per year, with built-up areas growing by almost 28 km2 per day, or 1.16 km2 per hour. The results demonstrate that Europe has been the most sprawled and also the most rapidly sprawling continent, by 51% since 1990. At the scale of UN regions, the highest relative increases in urban sprawl were observed in East Asia, Western Africa, and Southeast Asia. Urban sprawl per capita has been highest in Oceania and North America, exhibiting a minor decline since 1990, while it has been increasing rapidly in Europe, by almost 47% since 1990. The study revealed a strong relationship between urban sprawl and the level of human development as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI). The results suggest that it will be important for a more sustainable future to find a better balance between a high quality of life and using land more sparingly. There is an urgent need to stop urban sprawl, since current regulations and measures in developed countries are apparently not effective at limiting it. Monitoring urban sprawl can serve to guide policy development such as the implementation of targets and limits and to evaluate the effectiveness of urban growth management strategies at mitigating urban sprawl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |

Walking as a mode of transportation can provide health benefits, and the impact of the built environment on physical activity has been highlighted in numerous studies. This paper introduces a new approach to the quantification of walkability incorporating distance thresholds. The paper presents the research context for the Walking Access Index (WAI), a description of the methodology developed, and an application of the proposed index in the Melbourne metropolitan area, Australia. An integrated approach combining transport and land-use planning concepts was employed to construct the WAI. Using the Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA) dataset, separate negative binomial regression (NBR) models have been applied to examine how the new index performs compared to an existing approach. Key findings indicate that a greater number of residents are likely to have walking trip stages when living in a more walkable environment. Furthermore, it was found using statistical modeling that the WAI produces better results than one of the common approaches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

Furthermore, it was found using statistical modeling that the WAI produces better results than one of the common approaches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

Until the past decade, the theoretical literature on economic geography had focused on stylized settings that could not easily be taken to the data. This article reviews more recent research that has developed quantitative models of economic geography. These models are rich enough to speak to first-order features of the data, such as many heterogeneous locations and gravity equation relationships for trade and commuting. At the same time, these models are sufficiently tractable to undertake realistic counterfactual exercises to study the effect of changes in amenities, productivity, and public policy interventions such as transport infrastructure investments.

| Quantifying the spatial patterns of urban carbon metabolism: A case study of Hangzhou, China                                                                                                                            | With rapid urbanization in China, there is an urgent need to better understand spatial patterns of cities' carbon transitions in urban metabolism processes and to explore ways to achieve low carbon cities through sustainable urban planning. In this study, we took Hangzhou City as an example, and firstly analyzed changes in carbon emission and sequestration based on land use types, using data with 5 years interval from 1995 to 2015. We then quantified both harmful and beneficial carbon transitions by land use changes spatially. Harmful carbon transitions are processes that cause carbon sequestration decreases or carbon emission increases and the beneficial ones are the opposite processes. Finally, we employed a panel data regression analysis to investigate how urban forms and road structures influence urban carbon emission at the district level. We found that carbon emissions experienced a nearly five times increase, while carbon sequestration decreased by 22.29%. And the land use change from cultivated land to industrial land accounted for 61.05% of the harmful carbon transitions. In addition, the spatial analysis of urban carbon transitions indicated harmful carbon transitions always sourced from the eastern parts of Hangzhou. Most beneficial carbon transitions were located in the urban central area and western mountainous areas. The panel data analysis demonstrated that urban expansion modes with high connectedness and a better coupling relationship between urban form and road structure could help to emission reduction, and a mononuclear urban expansion mode at the district-level exerted a positive influence in relation to carbon emissions increase. This study provided an approach to assess urban carbon metabolism and help to better understanding of low-carbon urban form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Public transport and the compact city                                                                                                                                                                                   | The compact-city policy is a prudent strategy for carrying out city intensification and expansion. Similarly, public transport is seen as the most appropriate mode of transportation for this urban form. The connection between the two is clear-public transport makes sense in a compact city, and the compact city seeks to increase the use of public transport. However, the validity of this claim from the perspective of the residents is questionable. The length of trips made by city residents in compact cities tends to be so short in the Netherlands that these trips are often carried out by nonpublic transport modes, such as bicycle and car. Moreover, by increasing densities in and around the compact city, public-transport systems no longer can meet the disperse pattern of transportation demands of all citizens. An evolutionary relationship exists between urban expansion and types of public transport. When a transport system is developed on a regional scale, a choice will need to be made between two alternatives-the commonly used line-by-line approach and the integration and nodal approach. In the first case, success will depend on land use policies, whereas the latter tends to correspond better to the increasing diffuse travel patterns of residents and to evolve according to the features of the city structure and the opportunities for expansion within the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| Public transport and the compact city                                                                                                                                                                                   | The compact-city policy is a prudent strategy for carrying out city intensification and expansion. Similarly, public transport is seen as the most appropriate mode of transportation for this urban form. The connection between the two is clear-public transport makes sense in a compact city, and the compact city seeks to increase the use of public transport. However, the validity of this claim from the perspective of the residents is questionable. The length of trips made by city residents in compact cities tends to be so short in the Netherlands that these trips are often carried out by nonpublic transport modes, such as bicycle and car. Moreover, by increasing densities in and around the compact city, public-transport systems no longer can meet the disperse pattern of transportation demands of all citizens. An evolutionary relationship exists between urban expansion and types of public transport. When a transport system is developed on a regional scale, a choice will need to be made between two alternatives-the commonly used line-by-line approach and the integration and nodal approach. In the first case, success will depend on land use policies, whereas the latter tends to correspond better to the increasing diffuse travel patterns of residents and to evolve according to the features of the city structure and the opportunities for expansion within the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

Besides the theoretical background, this paper presents Projects as a part of the Strategy for the Promotion of a Sustainable Urban Lifestyle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Prioritizing urban nature-based solutions to support scaling-out strategies: A case study in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria                                                                                                 | Nature-based solutions (NbS) can synergistically improve human well-being and biodiversity in urban areas by enhancing ecosystem functions and services. Scaling out NbS, understood as the widespread application of NbS in multiple contexts, is an important policy ambition to increase the number of people and regions benefiting from NbS. However, designing scaling-out strategies requires considering critical aspects of the nexus between NbS and ecosystem services (ES) supply to yield large-scale benefits effectively. The aim of the study is twofold: (i) to simulate the stepwise implementation of multiple NbS and (ii) to quantify their cumulative impacts on ES supply and beneficiaries. The NbS implementation was guided by a method that prioritizes different NbS types in multiple sites, by combining spatial information on ES demand and land suitability with a qualitative description of ES supply by NbS type. The cumulative impacts were computed stepwise using GIS modeling. The study was conducted in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain), focusing on five types of NbS (urban forests, urban parks, community gardens, infiltration ponds), and five ES (runoff mitigation, stormwater treatment, soil erosion control, recreation, and food supply). Overall, 179 NbS were simulated in 130 sites distributed in the city. The findings showed an improvement in all services, albeit significant increments occurred only for certain services. We observed a non-linear relationship between NbS and impacts, including constant, positive, and negative trends. We discussed several factors that were determinants of impacts, providing insights on how to design scaling-out strategies from the biophysical perspective. Moreover, we reflected on the role of multifunctionality, social preferences, and economic feasibility as prioritization criteria for NbS. Finally, we addressed the imple-mentation of NbS scaling-out strategies from a broader perspective, deepening governance, economic and planning challenges, and potential actions for the case study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

| Population, environment and poverty in Pakistan: Linkages and empirical evidence                                                                                                                                        | This study explores the interlinkages among population, environment and poverty and presents empirical evidence in a developing country like Pakistan. It gives alternative views on population environment linkages. It explains poverty trap, market based harmony, and dual effect of poverty on the basis of a link between population growth and natural resource degradation. In addition, the paper also highlights social and political instability through population-poverty-environment spiral. It also presents empirical evidence on population-environment-poverty nexus in Pakistan. It also compares environmental sustainability index and human development index for selected Asian countries. The paper also gives scores for different components of environmental sustainability index for Pakistan and compares these with India. The paper concludes that the causal relationship between poverty and environment works in both directions, often through changes in GDP and population. Population stress does not have any significant direct effect on all aspects of environmental status in Pakistan. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |
| Population, environment and poverty in Pakistan: Linkages and empirical evidence                                                                                                                                        | This study explores the interlinkages among population, environment and poverty and presents empirical evidence in a developing country like Pakistan. It gives alternative views on population environment linkages. It explains poverty trap, market based harmony, and dual effect of poverty on the basis of a link between population growth and natural resource degradation. In addition, the paper also highlights social and political instability through population-poverty-environment spiral. It also presents empirical evidence on population-environment-poverty nexus in Pakistan. It also compares environmental sustainability index and human development index for selected Asian countries. The paper also gives scores for different components of environmental sustainability index for Pakistan and compares these with India. The paper concludes that the causal relationship between poverty and environment works in both directions, often through changes in GDP and population.

The promotion of sustainable mobility choices is a crucialelementof transport decarbonization. It requires a fundamental understandingof the choices available to urban dwellers and of the equity and justiceimplications of green mobility solutions. In this study, we quantifiedpersonal mobility-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the GreaterToronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) and their associations with variousland use, built environment, and socioeconomic factors. Our studycaptured personal, household, and neighborhood-level characteristicsthat are related to high emissions and disparities in emissions acrossthe study region. We observed that the top 30% of emitters generated70% of all transportation GHG emissions. Household income, familysize, and vehicle ownership were associated with increased mobilityemissions, while increased population density was associated withlower emissions. The percentage of visible minorities in a neighborhoodwas associated with lower emissions, but this effect was small. Wefurther contrasted the spatial distribution of traffic-related airpollution with mobility GHG emissions. The results suggest that individualswho emit less GHG live in areas with higher air pollution. A computervision-based model was used to predict GHG emissions from aerial imagesof neighborhoods, demonstrating that areas with high land use mixturewere linked to a lower generation of mobility-based GHG emissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

The promotion of sustainable mobility choices is a crucialelementof transport decarbonization. It requires a fundamental understandingof the choices available to urban dwellers and of the equity and justiceimplications of green mobility solutions. In this study, we quantifiedpersonal mobility-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the GreaterToronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) and their associations with variousland use, built environment, and socioeconomic factors. Our studycaptured personal, household, and neighborhood-level characteristicsthat are related to high emissions and disparities in emissions acrossthe study region. We observed that the top 30% of emitters generated70% of all transportation GHG emissions. Household income, familysize, and vehicle ownership were associated with increased mobilityemissions, while increased population density was associated withlower emissions. The percentage of visible minorities in a neighborhoodwas associated with lower emissions, but this effect was small.

| Perceived accessibility: What it is and why it differs from calculated accessibility measures based on spatial data                                                                                                     | Accessibility is usually evaluated using indicators calculated from spatial data. However, perceived accessibility, defined as the perceived potential to participate in spatially dispersed opportunities, is often poorly reflected by these calculated measures. This paper sets out to explain the mechanisms that lead to these mismatches. A conceptual model is constructed to establish what factors shape perceived accessibility. A schematic framework shows that mismatches between a calculated indicator and perceptions can stem from inaccuracies in awareness as well as from inaccuracies in the measure if the measure fails to take account of the subjective evaluations of accessibility components. When evaluating the performance of land-use and transport system configurations, calculated measures based on spatial and transport data only serve as proxies for how accessibility is actually experienced. This paper argues that bringing perceived accessibility to the fore of accessibility-based planning, by acknowledging and evaluating potential mismatches with calculated accessibility indicators, will advance the evolution from mobility-based to accessibility-based planning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

This paper argues that bringing perceived accessibility to the fore of accessibility-based planning, by acknowledging and evaluating potential mismatches with calculated accessibility indicators, will advance the evolution from mobility-based to accessibility-based planning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Opportunities and Strategies to Incorporate Ecosystem Services Knowledge and Decision Support Tools into Planning and Decision Making in Hawai'i                                                                        | Incorporating ecosystem services into management decisions is a promising means to link conservation and human well-being. Nonetheless, planning and management in Hawai'i, a state with highly valued natural capital, has yet to broadly utilize an ecosystem service approach. We conducted a stakeholder assessment, based on semi-structured interviews, with terrestrial (n = 26) and marine (n = 27) natural resource managers across the State of Hawai'i to understand the current use of ecosystem services (ES) knowledge and decision support tools and whether, how, and under what contexts, further development would potentially be useful. We found that ES knowledge and tools customized to Hawai'i could be useful for communication and outreach, justifying management decisions, and spatial planning. Greater incorporation of this approach is clearly desired and has a strong potential to contribute to more sustainable decision making and planning in Hawai'i and other oceanic island systems. However, the unique biophysical, socio-economic, and cultural context of Hawai'i, and other island systems, will require substantial adaptation of existing ES tools. Based on our findings, we identified four key opportunities for the use of ES knowledge and tools in Hawai'i: (1) linking native forest protection to watershed health; (2) supporting sustainable agriculture; (3) facilitating ridge-to-reef management; and (4) supporting statewide terrestrial and marine spatial planning. Given the interest expressed by natural resource managers, we envision broad adoption of ES knowledge and decision support tools if knowledge and tools are tailored to the Hawaiian context and coupled with adequate outreach and training.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |

| Operationalising energy sufficiency for low-carbon built environments in urbanising India                                                                                                                               | India's urbanisation is considered the largest national urban transformation of the 21st century, with its trajectory having a decisive impact on carbon emissions globally. This study defines and operationalises the concept of energy sufficiency for the growth of Indian cities which is expected to be largely driven by low- and middle-income housing. It combines theoretical framing with quantitative assessment of test models to present an operational framework of energy sufficiency that can be implemented through urban planning regulations. Based on the global budgetary limit to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees C, a precautionary target of 1.0 tCO2 per capita per year is estimated as an energy sufficiency allowance for upcoming residential built environments. By optimising the average dwelling size, limiting the land-use intensity to low-rise (four storeys) and compact urban forms, and improving operational energy performance with adaptive thermal comfort, the carbon emissions from residential buildings can be sufficiently optimised to 0.84 tCO2 per capita per year. The integration of rooftop renewable energy can further reduce it to 0.56 tCO2. The co-benefits of the optimised costs of construction and operation make the case for economic feasibility and wider affordability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |
| Operationalising energy sufficiency for low-carbon built environments in urbanising India                                                                                                                               | India’s urbanisation is considered the largest national urban transformation of the 21st century, with its trajectory having a decisive impact on carbon emissions globally. This study defines and operationalises the concept of energy sufficiency for the growth of Indian cities which is expected to be largely driven by low- and middle-income housing. It combines theoretical framing with quantitative assessment of test models to present an operational framework of energy sufficiency that can be implemented through urban planning regulations. Based on the global budgetary limit to restrict global warming to 1.5°C, a precautionary target of 1.0 tCO2 per capita per year is estimated as an energy sufficiency allowance for upcoming residential built environments. By optimising the average dwelling size, limiting the land-use intensity to low-rise (four storeys) and compact urban forms, and improving operational energy performance with adaptive thermal comfort, the carbon emissions from residential buildings can be sufficiently optimised to 0.84 tCO2 per capita per year. The integration of rooftop renewable energy can further reduce it to 0.56 tCO2. The co-benefits of the optimised costs of construction and operation make the case for economic feasibility and wider affordability.Policy relevanceThe rapid urbanisation in India will significantly increase carbon emissions from the urban built environment. Current trends towards high-rise and high-density residential development contribute significantly to the demand for embodied and operational energy. However, these remain unaccounted for in India’s action plan to meet its nationally determined contribution (NDC) to reduce emissions intensity. Energy sufficiency can be used as a guiding principle for urbanising contexts to limit both the embodied energy of new residential buildings and the associated operational energy demands. The proposed framework for sufficiency serves as a useful policy instrument, capable of being translated to actionable urban planning regulations. By demonstrating the potential of a ‘sufficient’ per capita carbon emissions budget for the growth and regeneration of residential buildings, this framework equips planners to set limits for the height and density of the built environment, fostering a low-carbon future aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |

| Of study enthusiasts and homebirds: students' everyday mobility and sustainability dilemmas in online higher education                                                                                                  | PurposeOnline education enables location-independent learning, potentially providing university students with more flexible study programs and reducing traffic-related CO2 emissions. This paper aims to examine whether online education can contribute to university-related sustainable everyday mobility, with particular consideration given to aspects of social sustainability and potential rebound effects. Specifically, it explores sustainability dilemmas that arise from conflicting social and ecological effects.Design/methodology/approachDrawing on qualitative data from mobility diaries and extensive semistructured interviews (n = 26) collected at Osnabr & uuml;ck University of Applied Sciences in Germany, this study deploys thematic analysis and a typification approach to analyze and classify students' daily practices related to studying, mobility and dwelling, which may be impacted by online education.FindingsThe study identifies six distinct student types with diverse practices in studying, mobility and dwelling.

| Of study enthusiasts and homebirds: students' everyday mobility and sustainability dilemmas in online higher education                                                                                                  | PurposeOnline education enables location-independent learning, potentially providing university students with more flexible study programs and reducing traffic-related CO2 emissions. This paper aims to examine whether online education can contribute to university-related sustainable everyday mobility, with particular consideration given to aspects of social sustainability and potential rebound effects. Specifically, it explores sustainability dilemmas that arise from conflicting social and ecological effects.Design/methodology/approachDrawing on qualitative data from mobility diaries and extensive semistructured interviews (n = 26) collected at Osnabr & uuml;ck University of Applied Sciences in Germany, this study deploys thematic analysis and a typification approach to analyze and classify students' daily practices related to studying, mobility and dwelling, which may be impacted by online education.FindingsThe study identifies six distinct student types with diverse practices in studying, mobility and dwelling. Comparisons between student types reveal stark differences regarding professional and social goals that students associate with their studies, influencing university-related mobility and residential choices. This leads to varying assessments of online education, with some students expecting benefits and others anticipating severe drawbacks.Practical implicationsThe typology developed in this paper can assist Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in comparable contexts in understanding the distinct needs and motivations of students, thereby proactively identifying sustainability dilemmas associated with online education. By leveraging these findings, HEIs can effectively balance diverse interests and contribute meaningfully to sustainability.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is among the first to systematically investigate conflicts and rebound effects of online education in the context of sustainable mobility within HEIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Not all crashes are created equal: Associations between the built environment and disparities in bicycle collisions                                                                                                     | Historically disadvantaged populations are disproportionately represented in bicycle crashes. Previous research has found that Black and Hispanic bicyclists and areas with higher populations of non-White residents, lower median income, and high poverty experience bicycle crashes more frequently than others. Although existing research has explored the role of socioeconomic status and the built environment in predicting crash frequency, few scholars have studied how these factors account for disparities along racial and ethnic lines. Using a database of 7,088 bicycle crashes over a three-year period in the San Francisco Bay Area, this study examines the influence of socioeconomic, transportation, and land-use characteristics as potential causes of differences in bicycle crash occurrences among racial and ethnic groups in the San Francisco Bay Area. While areas of high poverty and high land-use intensity are associated with higher numbers of bicycle crashes overall, lower-traffic streets and bicycle infrastructure do not affect the frequency of crashes involving Black and Hispanic cyclists. Black bicyclists have a disproportionate risk of being involved in a crash in poor urban neighborhoods, controlling for other factors. These findings draw attention to the need for planners to consider how socioeconomic differences and vulnerability at the neighborhood level play a role in safety.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Motivations and Strategies for Bicycle Planning in Rural, Suburban, and Low-Density Communities: The Need for New Best Practices                                                                                        | Problem, research strategy, and findings: Many planners view bicycles as a critical component of sustainable urban transportation, but assumptions about cycling derived from urban places may not translate to the social, political, and built environment contexts outside of cities. Our study focuses on the motivations and strategies that rural, small, and low-density (RSLD) communities have for investing in bicycle systems; our goal was to learn what kind of technical assistance such communities might need to realize their cycling goals. We conducted in-depth interviews in 10 communities that received grants from a Kaiser Permanente program in Colorado to increase cycling.Takeaway for practice: These 10 cases present a conflict between a recreational or quality-of-life approach to increasing cycling in RSLD communities and a transportation approach more common in urban areas, which stresses the use of cycling to supplement or replace auto travel for purposive trips. Most RSLD cities did not have the political or cultural support to plan for and begin constructing major cycling infrastructure for either recreational or transportation cycling. Most need best practices to educate local stakeholders on the value of cycling to support economic development, increase tourism, and improve property values without significantly reducing auto access. Planners in RSLD places also need special guidance for addressing the needs of riders with diverse environmental values and those from disadvantaged communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| Motivations and Strategies for Bicycle Planning in Rural, Suburban, and Low-Density Communities: The Need for New Best Practices                                                                                        | Problem, research strategy, and findings: Many planners view bicycles as a critical component of sustainable urban transportation, but assumptions about cycling derived from urban places may not translate to the social, political, and built environment contexts outside of cities. Our study focuses on the motivations and strategies that rural, small, and low-density (RSLD) communities have for investing in bicycle systems; our goal was to learn what kind of technical assistance such communities might need to realize their cycling goals. We conducted in-depth interviews in 10 communities that received grants from a Kaiser Permanente program in Colorado to increase cycling. Takeaway for practice: These 10 cases present a conflict between a recreational or quality-of-life approach to increasing cycling in RSLD communities and a transportation approach more common in urban areas, which stresses the use of cycling to supplement or replace auto travel for purposive trips. Most RSLD cities did not have the political or cultural support to plan for and begin constructing major cycling infrastructure for either recreational or transportation cycling. Most need best practices to educate local stakeholders on the value of cycling to support economic development, increase tourism, and improve property values without significantly reducing auto access. Planners in RSLD places also need special guidance for addressing the needs of riders with diverse environmental values and those from disadvantaged communities. © 2018 American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Modeling expected air quality impacts of Oregon?s proposed expanded clean fuels program                                                                                                                                 | The public health burden of traffic-related air pollution falls most heavily on the population living closest to major transportation corridors, which leads to exposure disparities between different socio-economic groups across the United States. The state of Oregon has adopted climate policies to reduce transportation fuel carbon intensity (CI). These climate policies have the potential co-benefit of reducing air pollution exposure disparities for different socio-economic groups. Here we analyze the emissions and air quality outcomes of three future year (2035) scenarios for transportation fuels in Oregon: (i) a Business as usual (BAU) scenario, (ii) a Clean Fuels Program (CFP) scenario that represents adoption and successful achievement of a proposed 25% reduction in carbon intensity in 2035; and (iii) a maximum ambition scenario (CFP MAX) that builds on the CFP scenario to achieve a 37% CI reduction by adopting low carbon fuels more aggressively, especially for heavy duty vehicles. Transportation emissions under all scenarios were estimated using the MOVES model for every county in Oregon. Detailed emissions with 4 km spatial resolution were then developed for each scenario by scaling the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) for the year 2017 based on the emissions derived from the MOVES analysis. Air quality in 2035 was simulated using the UCD/CIT chemical transport model that enables a detailed analysis of PM2.5 and PM0.1 components and sources. Exposure fields were analyzed using the BenMAP model to predict public health outcomes. Environmental justice analysis was conducted by race/ethnicity categories and income categories obtained from the American Community Survey (ACS). Results suggest that adoption of low-carbon transportation fuels will improve air quality in Oregon, yielding public health benefits equivalent to approximately $80M/yr. Adoption of low carbon transportation fuels will also reduce disparities in exposure to transportation-related air pollution between residents in different race/ethnicity categories by -14% in Portland and -20% in Salem. Adoption of low-carbon fuels reduces PM2.5 mass disparity by 10% in Salem, but does not have a significant effect in Portland, because on-road mobile sources contribute to less than 3% of the total PM2.5 mass disparity in this city. The analysis reveals that the spatial distribution of each race/ethnicity group in each city is the primary factor that determines the impact of low carbon fuel adoption on exposure disparity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| Micro-stories and the lived experience of transport poverty: Lessons from Iceland for just mobility transitions                                                                                                         | Iceland features a high share of renewable energy supply but remains largely dependent on fossil fuels for transport and is relatively car dependent for mobility. In the context of a public transport system perceived by users and non-users as inadequate, we document individuals' corresponding micro-stories and show how these constrain their 'functionings' within a mobility capabilities perspective. We then show how this relates to a set of mobility justice principles, informing inferences for a more just and inclusive transition to decarbonised mobility. While acknowledging that the country has a pattern of urbanisation and challenging terrain that help to explain the limitations of its public transport system, we nonetheless argue that additional investment and policy measures will be required to address transport poverty. For data, we draw on analysis of Icelandic bus routes, focus groups with representative public, and interviews with vulnerable individuals. We find that transport decarbonisation policy needs to account for existing material poverty and be far more equitable if a just transition to low-carbon mobility is achieved. We also reveal how mobility justice issues interact with other dimensions of justice such as distributive, procedural, cosmopolitan, restorative, and recognition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |
| Micro-stories and the lived experience of transport poverty: Lessons from Iceland for just mobility transitions                                                                                                         | Iceland features a high share of renewable energy supply but remains largely dependent on fossil fuels for transport and is relatively car dependent for mobility. In the context of a public transport system perceived by users and non-users as inadequate, we document individuals' corresponding micro-stories and show how these constrain their ‘functionings’ within a mobility capabilities perspective. We then show how this relates to a set of mobility justice principles, informing inferences for a more just and inclusive transition to decarbonised mobility. While acknowledging that the country has a pattern of urbanisation and challenging terrain that help to explain the limitations of its public transport system, we nonetheless argue that additional investment and policy measures will be required to address transport poverty. For data, we draw on analysis of Icelandic bus routes, focus groups with representative public, and interviews with vulnerable individuals. We find that transport decarbonisation policy needs to account for existing material poverty and be far more equitable if a just transition to low-carbon mobility is achieved. We also reveal how mobility justice issues interact with other dimensions of justice such as distributive, procedural, cosmopolitan, restorative, and recognition. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Metropolitan fringes as strategic areas for urban resilience and sustainable transitions: Insights from Barcelona Metropolitan Area                                                                                     | In an urbanized world, the challenges posed by climate change need to be met through innovative planning for cities and regions. Urban resilience demands that cities adopt new models centered on carbon neutrality, ecosystem services and biodiversity enhancement, circularity, and social inclusion. In light of the multiple interdependencies of metropolitan systems and the natural and territorial potentialities present on their fringes, this paper discusses the metropolitan fringes as strategic for urban resilience and sustainable transitions. By combining a mixed-method analysis of adaptation and urban plans with semi-structured interviews performed with key technicians, the analysis is focused on an inter-municipal fringe zone within the Barcelona Metropolitan Area - the Bes`os territory. Aiming to contribute to the discussions related to Territorial innovation for cities and regions, the paper offers a multi-scale perspective and illustrates innovative urban transformation strategies across scales. The results highlight that governance and multiple planning and participation instances together with technical and financial support are essential for consensus building in an incremental process. Furthermore, the planning strategies of the case study sought to integrate and enhance the green and blue infrastructures and transform consolidated urban areas with a focus on energy transition, sustainable mobility, circularity, and social inclusion. In conclusion, it is argued that resilience has a multi-scalar perspective within the metropolitan context and should be integrated with planning policies at different scales from a coordinated vision. Although adaptation and urban projects have a critical local element, a broader and more strategic vision is necessary, especially in metropolitan fringe areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

Although adaptation and urban projects have a critical local element, a broader and more strategic vision is necessary, especially in metropolitan fringe areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Ecology    |
| Metropolitan fringes as strategic areas for urban resilience and sustainable transitions: Insights from Barcelona Metropolitan Area                                                                                     | In an urbanized world, the challenges posed by climate change need to be met through innovative planning for cities and regions. Urban resilience demands that cities adopt new models centered on carbon neutrality, ecosystem services and biodiversity enhancement, circularity, and social inclusion. In light of the multiple interdependencies of metropolitan systems and the natural and territorial potentialities present on their fringes, this paper discusses the metropolitan fringes as strategic for urban resilience and sustainable transitions. By combining a mixed-method analysis of adaptation and urban plans with semi-structured interviews performed with key technicians, the analysis is focused on an inter-municipal fringe zone within the Barcelona Metropolitan Area - the Bes`os territory. Aiming to contribute to the discussions related to Territorial innovation for cities and regions, the paper offers a multi-scale perspective and illustrates innovative urban transformation strategies across scales. The results highlight that governance and multiple planning and participation instances together with technical and financial support are essential for consensus building in an incremental process. Furthermore, the planning strategies of the case study sought to integrate and enhance the green and blue infrastructures and transform consolidated urban areas with a focus on energy transition, sustainable mobility, circularity, and social inclusion. In conclusion, it is argued that resilience has a multi-scalar perspective within the metropolitan context and should be integrated with planning policies at different scales from a coordinated vision. Although adaptation and urban projects have a critical local element, a broader and more strategic vision is necessary, especially in metropolitan fringe areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |
| Metro-Related Transfers: A Review of Recent Literature                                                                                                                                                                  | Metros constitute an important form of public transport in large cities throughout the world. Because metro transport encompasses long distances and large areas, many metro passengers must transfer to other transport modes to complete their journeys. This paper will review the recent literature on metro-related transfers and will summarize and discuss the key findings and issues regarding transfers between metros and other transport modes. A considerable number of studies in different countries have explored transfer behavior, the influencing factors that are related to metro-related transfers, and travelers' perceptions of and satisfaction with these transfers. The paper will discuss the characteristics of travel behavior that is associated with metro-related transfers and could provide important implications to improve travelers' perceptions of and satisfaction with these transfers. In addition, it will offer recommendations on aspects of the built environment that could facilitate transfers between metros and other travel modes. The paper could provide policy guidance for the integration of public transit and active and private transport and could be valuable in directing future research in this field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

Many urban theorists state their significant role as one of the principal components of a healthy urban setting. This is in addition to their functional role, when they increase a sense of community when intensive social interaction takes place in these areas. However, recently, they have started to lose significance, when they are neglected in the urban planning process, or when existing spaces are lost. Additionally, accessibility and utilization of these areas decreases, since public spaces are neglected in urban planning and development processes.

| Mapping the capacity of concave green land in mitigating urban pluvial floods and its beneficiaries                                                                                                                     | Pluvial floods can exert significant pressure on urban sustainability and human wellbeing during rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization and exacerbated flooding have stimulated investigations of green land's role in mitigating urban flooding in China. The newly applied "Sponge City" plan considers the concave green land (CGL) as an effective tool in mitigating pluvial floods. However, its capacity and beneficiaries still need to be elucidated. This paper fills this research gap by integrating urban flood simulation, scenario analysis, and mitigation assessment in central Shanghai, China. It reveals that CGL could not only mitigate direct runoff and inundation, but also reduce population exposure and enhance community resilience. CGL with a depth of 0.10-0.20 m can mitigate direct runoffs by 23.63-98.35% and inundation extents by 26.09-82.41%, resulting in a slide of the exposed urban population by 0.40-1.04 million persons and the exposed elders by 0.04-0.12 million persons. Moreover, the effectiveness of CGL varies spatially implying for a sound spatial planning of CGLs and a potential combination with other flood mitigation measures. These findings could help cities particularly in developing countries to adapt to rising pluvial flooding through urban planning and nature-based flood mitigation measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |
| Mapping the capacity of concave green land in mitigating urban pluvial floods and its beneficiaries                                                                                                                     | Pluvial floods can exert significant pressure on urban sustainability and human wellbeing during rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization and exacerbated flooding have stimulated investigations of green land's role in mitigating urban flooding in China. The newly applied "Sponge City" plan considers the concave green land (CGL) as an effective tool in mitigating pluvial floods. However, its capacity and beneficiaries still need to be elucidated. This paper fills this research gap by integrating urban flood simulation, scenario analysis, and mitigation assessment in central Shanghai, China. It reveals that CGL could not only mitigate direct runoff and inundation, but also reduce population exposure and enhance community resilience.

These findings could help cities particularly in developing countries to adapt to rising pluvial flooding through urban planning and nature-based flood mitigation measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |

This chapter examines essential concepts and examples of low-carbon urban infrastructure, highlighting urban form designed in harmony with the city's geography; resilience to climate change impacts as well as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; and prioritization of demand-side management in city systems, through improved design, efficiency, and de-carbonization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |
| Local planning scenario for shading from trees as an urban nature-based solution                                                                                                                                        | With more than 75% of the European Union's population living in urban areas covering 21.5% of the EU territory, the importance of climate-resilient cities, towns and suburbs has increased dramatically. However, the rising impact of human-induced land-use changes on ecosystem services (ES) poses a major challenge to the urban environment. This study focuses on scenario development for nature-based solutions (NbS) in a European town with its intense development area. The concept is exemplified in a town in Croatia, Grad Velika Gorica (GVG), that like many others cities undergoes urbanisation processes with limited resources. It serves as a showpiece for the influence of NbS, in particular street trees along various paths. Using spatial analysis and modelling, the approach explores NbS for future urbanisation. The results, supported by quantitative analysis, show that 49% of cycle lanes and footpaths in GVG can be shaded by strategically planted street trees. The shading scenario analysis provides a nuanced perspective on the potential of NbS, offering insights into the key tasks for a climate-resilient city and opportunities towards equitable, green and healthy urban areas. In the context of urbanisation processes and climate adaptation, the study is in line with the overarching objectives of the European Commission which emphasises the need for sustainable NbS alternatives to address environmental challenges. The findings contribute to the framework of informed decision-making towards urban climate resilience. It also supports the pursuit of a sustainable local governance for climate-adjusted environmental quality in urban planning. As towns and cities grapple with the imperative of balancing urban development with environmental protection, this research highlights the central role of NbS, particularly street trees, in shaping climate-resilient and more sustainable urban environments for human well-being in cities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

| Life cycle energy and costs of sprawling and compact neighborhoods                                                                                                                                                      | Purpose The aim of this study is to compare the life cycle energy and costs derived from the production and occupation of social interest housing models located in two different types of neighborhoods: compact and sprawling. Two neighborhood development alternatives in Mexico City were established and evaluated including the potential impacts analysis of the built environment/infrastructure and the commuting of the occupants. Methods The study includes the conventional phases of a building life cycle (LC)-preoccupation, occupation, and post-occupation-but it was expanded to include a fourth phase, "occupant transportation," to cover the commuting potential impacts. The methodology consists of four main stages: (1) definition of function, functional unit, and scope; (2) data collection-divided in three main steps: architectural, land costs and transformations, and commuting data; (3) impact assessment-we used software SimaPro v8.0.1 to manage the LC inventory data; and (4) interpretation of results and sensitivity analysis. Results and discussion In the preoccupation phase, the sprawling neighborhood cell (NC) cumulative energy demand (CED) is 30 % larger than the compact NC ones. Regarding the LC costs, land costs strongly impact the compact NC, but when aggregated in the preoccupation phase, the LC costs for the sprawling NC are only 14 % above those of the compact NC. For the occupation phase, results show that the compact NC has lower CED (by 10 %) and LC costs (16 %) than the sprawling NC. The occupant transportation phase plays a highly important role, since it represents up to 28 % of total LC CED and up to 54 % of total LC costs. This phase affects significantly the sprawling NC, which has a 25% higher CED and doubles LC costs, when compared with the compact NC. Post-occupation phase contributes just in a small proportion of the total CED and LC costs for both NC, since it accounts for 3 % or less of the total energy and LC costs. Overall results show that the compact NC has lower CED and LC costs than the sprawling NC. Conclusions The results show that occupant transportation phase plays a highly important role in the neighborhood performance. Neighborhood development assessment should consider a number of variables beyond CED and costs. However, in order to improve the sector's energy efficiency and household's economy, we recommend to consider house location as it can be as important as other energy or cost-reduction actions in neighborhood development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| Life cycle energy and costs of sprawling and compact neighborhoods                                                                                                                                                      | Purpose: The aim of this study is to compare the life cycle energy and costs derived from the production and occupation of social interest housing models located in two different types of neighborhoods: compact and sprawling. Two neighborhood development alternatives in Mexico City were established and evaluated including the potential impacts analysis of the built environment/infrastructure and the commuting of the occupants. Methods: The study includes the conventional phases of a building life cycle (LC)—preoccupation, occupation, and post-occupation—but it was expanded to include a fourth phase, “occupant transportation,” to cover the commuting potential impacts. The methodology consists of four main stages: (1) definition of function, functional unit, and scope; (2) data collection—divided in three main steps: architectural, land costs and transformations, and commuting data; (3) impact assessment—we used software SimaPro v8.0.1 to manage the LC inventory data; and (4) interpretation of results and sensitivity analysis. Results and discussion: In the preoccupation phase, the sprawling neighborhood cell (NC) cumulative energy demand (CED) is 30 % larger than the compact NC ones. Regarding the LC costs, land costs strongly impact the compact NC, but when aggregated in the preoccupation phase, the LC costs for the sprawling NC are only 14 % above those of the compact NC. For the occupation phase, results show that the compact NC has lower CED (by 10 %) and LC costs (16 %) than the sprawling NC. The occupant transportation phase plays a highly important role, since it represents up to 28 % of total LC CED and up to 54 % of total LC costs. This phase affects significantly the sprawling NC, which has a 25 % higher CED and doubles LC costs, when compared with the compact NC. Post-occupation phase contributes just in a small proportion of the total CED and LC costs for both NC, since it accounts for 3 % or less of the total energy and LC costs. Overall results show that the compact NC has lower CED and LC costs than the sprawling NC. Conclusions: The results show that occupant transportation phase plays a highly important role in the neighborhood performance. Neighborhood development assessment should consider a number of variables beyond CED and costs.

| Leveraging explainable artificial intelligence and big trip data to understand factors influencing willingness to ridesharing                                                                                           | Carpool-style ridesharing, compared to traditional solo ride-hailing, can reduce traffic congestion, cut per-passenger carbon emissions, reduce parking infrastructure, and provide a more cost-effective way to travel. Despite these benefits, ridesharing only occupies a small percentage of the total ride-hailing trips in cities. This study integrates big trip data with machine learning and eXplainable AI (XAI) to understand the factors that influence willingness to take shared rides. We use the City of Chicago as a case study, and results show that users tend to adopt ridesharing for longer distance trips, and the cost of a trip remains the most important factor. We identify a strong diurnal pattern that people prefer to request shared trips during the morning and afternoon peak hours. We also find socio-economic disparities: users who requested trips from neighbourhoods with a high percentage of non-white, a low median household income, a low percentage of bachelor's degrees, and high vehicle ownership are more likely to share a ride. The findings and the XAI-based analytical framework presented in this study can help transportation network companies and local governments understand ridesharing behaviour and suggest new strategies and policies to promote the proportion of ridesharing for more sustainable and efficient city transportation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

| Learning from the Policy and Practice of Green City Development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia                                                                                                                                 | The complex challenge of managing urban growth and development in the context of climate and environmental change has led to a proliferation of policy discourses related to the 'green city'. While useful as a buzzword, it is argued that green city discourses often overlook or even mask questions of social and environmental justice. This case study of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, shows that the presence of green and sustainable city discourses in policymaking does not reflect the reality of urban planning practices. Instead, it has produced an urban vision reflective of the priorities of global capital while contributing to the ongoing destruction of urban biodiversity and the marginalization of urban residents living in poverty. It is argued that a reconceptualization of the green city be undertaken, which incorporates understanding of participatory and distributive justice to ensure that urban planning practices are inclusive and sustainable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |
| Learning from the Policy and Practice of Green City Development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia                                                                                                                                 | The complex challenge of managing urban growth and development in the context of climate and environmental change has led to a proliferation of policy discourses related to the 'green city'. While useful as a buzzword, it is argued that green city discourses often overlook or even mask questions of social and environmental justice. This case study of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, shows that the presence of green and sustainable city discourses in policymaking does not reflect the reality of urban planning practices. Instead, it has produced an urban vision reflective of the priorities of global capital while contributing to the ongoing destruction of urban biodiversity and the marginalization of urban residents living in poverty.

| Large scale urban development projects and local governance: From democratic urban planning to besieged local governance                                                                                                | This article analyses the interaction between social exclusion in the city, the implementation of largescale development projects and changes in urban governance.

| Land Stewardship and Development Behaviors Under an Ecological-Impact-Weighted Land Value Tax Scheme: A Proof-of-Concept Agent-Based Model                                                                              | Sprawling land development patterns have exacerbated ecological degradation, social fragmentation, and public health problems. Perverse incentives arise from the ability to privatize collectively created value in land rents and socialize ecological costs. Land value taxation (LVT) has been shown to encourage urban infill development by reducing or eliminating rent-seeking behavior in land markets. However, despite its purported benefits, this tax reform is value monistic in its definition of optimal land use and, therefore, does little to address the lack of non-market information to inform land use decisions. We propose an ecological-impact-weighted land value taxation policy (ELVT) which incorporates the ecological footprint of land use into one’s land value tax burden. We test both proposed policies (LVT and ELVT) relative to a “status quo” (SQ) property tax scheme, utilizing a conceptual spatially explicit agent-based model of land use behaviors and housing development. Our findings suggest that both tax interventions can increase the capital intensity and decrease the land intensity of housing development. Furthermore, both tax interventions can lead to a net profit loss for speculators and a decrease in the average housing unit price. The ELVT scheme is shown to significantly increase urban nature provisions and dampen the loss of ecological value across a region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

Perverse incentives arise from the ability to privatize collectively created value in land rents and socialize ecological costs. Land value taxation (LVT) has been shown to encourage urban infill development by reducing or eliminating rent-seeking behavior in land markets. However, despite its purported benefits, this tax reform is value monistic in its definition of optimal land use and, therefore, does little to address the lack of non-market information to inform land use decisions. We propose an ecological-impact-weighted land value taxation policy (ELVT) which incorporates the ecological footprint of land use into one’s land value tax burden. We test both proposed policies (LVT and ELVT) relative to a “status quo” (SQ) property tax scheme, utilizing a conceptual spatially explicit agent-based model of land use behaviors and housing development. Our findings suggest that both tax interventions can increase the capital intensity and decrease the land intensity of housing development. Furthermore, both tax interventions can lead to a net profit loss for speculators and a decrease in the average housing unit price.

| Is neighborhood satisfaction related to density perception? Promoting liveable and sustainable land use planning                                                                                                        | While sustainable land use planning ensures land preservation through urban compactness, liveable residential environments are commonly associated with low density levels. Analyzing the relationships between density and neighborhood satisfaction (as a measure for liveability) may therefore help urban planners to offer sustainable infill projects that also guarantee liveability for the residents. Objective or subjective measures of density can be proposed. While the literature considering objective density is plentiful, the empirical work analyzing the relationships between density perception and neighborhood satisfaction is surprisingly scarce.

| Is neighborhood satisfaction related to density perception? Promoting liveable and sustainable land use planning                                                                                                        | While sustainable land use planning ensures land preservation through urban compactness, liveable residential environments are commonly associated with low density levels. Analyzing the relationships between density and neighborhood satisfaction (as a measure for liveability) may therefore help urban planners to offer sustainable infill projects that also guarantee liveability for the residents. Objective or subjective measures of density can be proposed. While the literature considering objective density is plentiful, the empirical work analyzing the relationships between density perception and neighborhood satisfaction is surprisingly scarce. In this study, we use a 2015 online survey in the Loire-Atlantique Departement in France that provided 1,134 questionnaires, which we analyzed using a discrete choice experiment.

| Is carbon footprint reduction always preferred over offsetting? An analysis of tourists' preferences in the Mallorca region                                                                                             | This research is devoted to the analysis of tourists' preferences for climate change (CC) mitigation policies in the Mallorca region. The stated choice experiment, used for evaluation, was designed combining a set of alternatives, characterised by carbon footprint reduction and offset policies, taking into account the existence of environmental direct benefits, but also indirect benefits that improve tourist experience or co -benefits derived from the location of policy projects. Economic welfare in form of willingness to pay (WTP) was estimated, and the alternatives were compared using compensating variation values. The study's findings validate the prevailing preference for carbon reduction policies over offsetting measures, except when the first don't have co -benefits and the latter are implemented locally. In the latter case, there is no significant difference in WTP between reducing the carbon footprint and locally offsetting it. Results not only contributes to the ongoing economic debate surrounding CC mitigation policies but also provides key information for designing mitigation schemes in diffuse emission sectors such as tourism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

The stated choice experiment, used for evaluation, was designed combining a set of alternatives, characterised by carbon footprint reduction and offset policies, taking into account the existence of environmental direct benefits, but also indirect benefits that improve tourist experience or co-benefits derived from the location of policy projects. Economic welfare in form of willingness to pay (WTP) was estimated, and the alternatives were compared using compensating variation values. The study's findings validate the prevailing preference for carbon reduction policies over offsetting measures, except when the first don't have co-benefits and the latter are implemented locally. In the latter case, there is no significant difference in WTP between reducing the carbon footprint and locally offsetting it. Results not only contributes to the ongoing economic debate surrounding CC mitigation policies but also provides key information for designing mitigation schemes in diffuse emission sectors such as tourism. © 2024                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Investigating the Impacts of Urban Built Environment on Travel Energy Consumption: A Case Study of Ningbo, China                                                                                                        | The built environment of cities has increasingly affected the travel mode of residents and led to changes in energy consumption, which is crucial to maintaining urban sustainability. Ningbo is a typical representative of urbanization on the east coast of China, and its energy consumption is in a period of rapid growth. Therefore, using the survey data of 22,112 traffic trip samples from nine streets in Ningbo, this paper establishes a regression analysis model, systematically analyzes the relationship between the built environment and domestic energy consumption from multiple dimensions, and reveals the impact mechanism of the built environment on domestic energy consumption. We find that (1) social and economic conditions are the main factors affecting traffic energy consumption. (2) The population density has a significant negative correlation effect on the energy consumption of transportation trips. When the population density increases by 1%, the energy consumption of total transportation trips, commuting trips, high-energy-consumption trips, and low-energy-consumption trips decreases by 0.094%, 0.115%, 0.273%, and 0.124%, respectively. (3) When the degree of mixed use of land increases by one percentage point, the energy consumption of total transportation trips, commuting trips, high-energy-consumption trips, and low-energy-consumption trips decreases by 0.415%, 0.421%, 2.574%, and 1.197%, respectively. (4) The density of road intersections has a significant negative correlation effect on the energy consumption of traffic trips. (5) The impact of the built environment on the energy consumption of transportation trips is greater than that of residential buildings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

It then describes the challenges involved with assessing societal safety through the analysis of transport system crashes. It concludes with a summary of the contents of the remainder of the book, identifying how various dimensions of the transport system challenges are addressed. Methodology/Approach – This chapter discusses important real-world and methodological challenges that practitioners, academics and researchers face in making a more sustainable highway system through a reduction in the number and severity of transport network crashes resulting in fatalities, injuries and property damage. Findings – The chapter first describes important challenges, such as complexity of the driving task, the challenges of engineering transport systems for humans, unanticipated effects that arise from differences between driver safety and security, the co-mingling of mobility modes of travel, and challenges in evaluating road safety. The chapters are separated into five general themes: driver behaviour, the transportation network, vulnerable road users, methods for understanding and predicting safety performance, and methods for evaluating safety impacts of countermeasures. Practical Implications – Comprehending the challenges associated with road crashes is a first step in making the roadway system more sustainable. This book provides a broad and understandable description of these challenges and how they can be overcome by academics and practitioners working in transport network safety management. Originality – This book presents a clear understanding and offers insights about the challenges and potential solutions that can be brought to bear to make a more sustainable and safe transport system, whether it is located in an urban or rural area, and for a wide variety of functional classifications and designs. The topics covered in this book are intended to be useful and applied to tackle transport system management anywhere in the world. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |
| Introduction                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Governance or the rise of a new vocabulary One of the most striking developments in the analysis of politics and policy-making is the shift in vocabulary that has occurred over the last ten years. Terms such as ‘governance’, ‘institutional capacity’, ‘networks’, ‘complexity’, ‘trust’, ‘deliberation’ and ‘interdependence’ dominate the debate, while terms such as ‘the state’, ‘government’, ‘power’ and ‘authority’, ‘loyalty’, ‘sovereignty’, ‘participation’ and ‘interest groups’ have lost their grip on the analytical imagination. The new vocabulary prevails in spheres ranging from international relations (Finkelstein 1995; Rosenau 1995; World Bank 1997) to policy analysis and public administration (Rhodes 1996; 2000), from comparative politics to urban planning (Forester 1999; Healey 1997; Innes and Booher 1999b), from European studies (Marks et al. 1996) to political theory (Dryzek 2000; March and Olsen 1995). The shift from ‘government’ to ‘governance’ is widely proclaimed and endorsed in the political-science and policy-xscience communities (for an analytical overview, see especially Pierre 2000). Social science is no less immune to fads than popular culture. New concepts often have a remarkably short shelf-life. New vocabularies may signify no more than a change of rhetoric. In this case, such an explanation is too simple. The new vocabulary seems to capture changes in both the nature and topography of politics. A new range of political practices has emerged between institutional layers of the state and between state institutions and societal organizations. The new language is rooted in an appreciation of the importance of these new political practices. © Cambridge University Press 2003 and 2009.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

In fact, healthy ecosystem are able to regulate city temperature reducing the heat island effect, reduce water run off, and improve human health and the overall resilience of urban areas. At the same time, urbanisation has increased the pressure on natural resources, generating several impacts on the ecosystems and on the services provided by them at local, regional, national and global scales. This phenomenon has been exacerbated by the impacts of climate change, increasing vulnerability to natural disaster risks. At international and national level several policies for the protection of ecosystems has been defined. Indeed regional and local authorities can improve integrated spatial planning and coordinated management between sectors to reduce the pressures on natural system. In order to do this it is fundamental to understand the value of the ecosystem to introduce regulatory and market instruments that are able to protect them.

The explicit acknowledgement of gaps and interpretative leaps in the case studies, and the possibilities for comparison provided by juxtaposing different cases and methods, focus attention on specific conceptual, empirical and policy problems rather than on a largely misleading broad sweep of generalisation. A simple descriptive task is assumed to exist of accounting for how the urban consumer’s physical needs are met; sources of food, types of transport, fuel, water and housing are all addressed. Sources are available in a variety of places, enough to support an exploration and interpretation of the broad outlines of change. Using regional social history, this book explores the domains of social and economic life as related to one another in a system, and thereby recontextualises dimensions of food supply which have been analytically separated. © 1987 International African Institute All rights reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Introduction                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Purpose – This chapter first provides the motivation for writing this book. It then describes the challenges involved with assessing societal safety through the analysis of transport system crashes. It concludes with a summary of the contents of the remainder of the book, identifying how various dimensions of the transport system challenges are addressed. Methodology/Approach – This chapter discusses important real-world and methodological challenges that practitioners, academics and researchers face in making a more sustainable highway system through a reduction in the number and severity of transport network crashes resulting in fatalities, injuries and property damage. Findings – The chapter first describes important challenges, such as complexity of the driving task, the challenges of engineering transport systems for humans, unanticipated effects that arise from differences between driver safety and security, the co-mingling of mobility modes of travel, and challenges in evaluating road safety. The chapters are separated into five general themes: driver behaviour, the transportation network, vulnerable road users, methods for understanding and predicting safety performance, and methods for evaluating safety impacts of countermeasures. Practical Implications – Comprehending the challenges associated with road crashes is a first step in making the roadway system more sustainable.

| Impact of Land Use Changes on Ecosystem Services Supply: A Meta Analysis of the Italian Context                                                                                                                         | Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are caused by several factors, including climate change, socio-demographic dynamics, human pressures and urban sprawl. These factors alter the structure and functionality of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem goods and services to society. The study of LULC changes is important for understanding the dynamics of relationships between environmental, social and economic components and for analyzing the factors affecting natural capital. Including ecosystem services (ES) in spatial planning tools and sectoral policies is useful for improving governance. In this paper, the impact of LULC changes on ES provision has been estimated. To this end, we carried out a literature review (Step 1) to select the biophysical and economic coefficients of ES supply by land cover classes and collect them in a database (Step 2). We subsequently aggregated the economic and biophysical coefficients by macro classes (Step 3) and, using the benefit transfer approach, we estimated the change in the supply of ESs concerning permanence and transition phenomena in Italy from 1990 to 2018 (Step 4). The transition phenomena analysis also allowed us to evaluate the consequences of urbanization and urban green space governance on ES supply. Indeed, these urban green spaces can help reduce risks to people’s health and safety and mitigate the effects induced by climate change. In total, approximately 800 coefficients (biophysical and economic) of ESs supplied by Corine Land Cover classes were acquired. The results show a reduction in the annual supply of ecosystem services of EUR 927 million (2022) caused by LULC changes between 1990 and 2018. This research proposes a methodology to improve knowledge of ESs concerning anthropogenic impacts and to support land-use planning policies regarding Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| Identification and Classification of Urban Shrinkage in Northeast China                                                                                                                                                 | The phenomenon of shrinking cities is a significant challenge faced by many cities today. To more accurately identify the leading factors driving urban shrinkage and develop rational recommendations, precise identification and classification of urban shrinkage has become an indispensable part of the process. This paper focuses on the typical population loss region of China's three northeastern provinces, using 497 identified physical cities as the basic research unit. Based on multi-source geographical big data and utilizing the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, spatial modeling of population in the three provinces of northeast China was conducted, resulting in spatialized population data, followed by identification and classification of shrinking cities among the physical cities. Cities with a total population change rate of less than 0 are defined as shrinking cities. In cities where the total population change rate is greater than 0, cities with both a city shrinking area ratio and a decreased population ratio greater than 5% are defined as locally shrinking cities. Based on this, 90 (18.1%) shrinking cities and 118 (23.7%) locally shrinking cities were identified within the three provinces of northeast China. The phenomenon of urban shrinkage is distributed throughout various regions, mainly in smaller cities located near larger cities. According to the standards of the urban shrinkage classification model, the spatial pattern of population loss regions was divided into four types, identifying 13 (6.3%) global type, 111 (53.4%) concentrated type, 64 (30.7%) perforated type, and 20 (9.6%) edge type. Analysis of shrinking cities based on their classification revealed that the main reasons for urban shrinkage are the decline and dissolution of large industrial enterprises, abandonment and neglect of buildings, and unreasonable design planning in cities. Economic development and inward population flow can be promoted in shrinking cities by creating job opportunities, improving living standards, developing transportation, adjusting urban planning or concentrating urban population, as well as vigorously developing urban center areas. These measures can provide support for the revival and development of shrinking cities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

The phenomenon of urban shrinkage is distributed throughout various regions, mainly in smaller cities located near larger cities. According to the standards of the urban shrinkage classification model, the spatial pattern of population loss regions was divided into four types, identifying 13 (6.3%) global type, 111 (53.4%) concentrated type, 64 (30.7%) perforated type, and 20 (9.6%) edge type. Analysis of shrinking cities based on their classification revealed that the main reasons for urban shrinkage are the decline and dissolution of large industrial enterprises, abandonment and neglect of buildings, and unreasonable design planning in cities. Economic development and inward population flow can be promoted in shrinking cities by creating job opportunities, improving living standards, developing transportation, adjusting urban planning or concentrating urban population, as well as vigorously developing urban center areas. These measures can provide support for the revival and development of shrinking cities. © 2023 by the authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| How the physical inactivity is affected by social-, economic- and physical-environmental factors: an exploratory study using the machine learning approach                                                              | Previous studies have utilized regression models to investigate the impact of environmental factors on physical activity. However, such approaches are inadequate for data-driven analysis seeking to identify robust associations from the intricate and multi-variable interactions between physical activity and environmental factors. With the emergence of the concept of the exposome, which encompasses the totality of exposures, this paper explores machine learning models for predicting the percentage of physical inactivity in U.S. counties, while considering 28 social-, economic-, and physical-environmental factors. The aim of this study is to address the research gap and gain insight into the complex associations between environmental exposures and physical activity. Five machine learning models were tested, and the performances were compared to select the best classifier for further investigation. This study used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The mean population of all counties was 102,841, and the mean percentage of population below 18 years was 22.3%. The partial dependence plot analysis indicated that only one feature - bachelor's degree - exhibited a close-to-linear relationship with physical inactivity. Motor-vehicle crash death rate and mean temperature showed nonlinear and non-monotonic relationships with the predicted percentage of physical inactivity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Housing-related differences in sense of community in mixed housing neighborhood: Impacts of residents' daily activities and facility utilization                                                                        | Recent decades have witnessed continued research interest in the residents' sense of community (SOC) towards their neighborhoods, attributed to the rapid global expansion of urban spaces and increased human mobility. Early studies predominantly focused on the influence of SOC from a place -centric perspective, emphasizing the physical attributes of neighborhoods. However, recent scholars have called for a shift in research towards an individual -activity -based approach. Despite this, there has been a relative dearth of knowledge regarding the nuanced activity factors and intrinsic pathways that impact SOC, particularly within mixed housing neighborhoods. To bridge this gap, this study utilized first-hand social survey data and daily activity diaries collected in Fuzhou to examine the associations between daily activities and SOC and identify the critical mediator. Multigroup Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis revealed several noteworthy findings. Firstly, despite living together in a mixed neighborhood, affordable and market housing residents exhibited significant disparities in their daily activities, facility utilization, and SOC. Residents of market housing demonstrated lower SOC compared to those in affordable housing. Secondly, daily activities had differing impacts on SOC between these groups. A variety of activity factors, such as the proportion of activity space to the neighborhood, time allocated to local activities, and the diversity of activity types, collectively enhanced SOC. These effects were particularly marked within affordable housing. Conversely, the positive influence of daily social interactions on SOC was exclusive to residents of market housing. Additionally, the use of neighborhood facilities serves as an underlying mechanism. Frequent utilization of proximal facilities can substantially improve SOC among residents, particularly for those in affordable housing. These findings offer valuable insights for the planning and managing of mixed housing neighborhoods and may also inspire strategies in other neighborhood types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |
| Housing-related differences in sense of community in mixed housing neighborhood: Impacts of residents' daily activities and facility utilization                                                                        | Recent decades have witnessed continued research interest in the residents' sense of community (SOC) towards their neighborhoods, attributed to the rapid global expansion of urban spaces and increased human mobility. Early studies predominantly focused on the influence of SOC from a place -centric perspective, emphasizing the physical attributes of neighborhoods. However, recent scholars have called for a shift in research towards an individual -activity -based approach. Despite this, there has been a relative dearth of knowledge regarding the nuanced activity factors and intrinsic pathways that impact SOC, particularly within mixed housing neighborhoods. To bridge this gap, this study utilized first-hand social survey data and daily activity diaries collected in Fuzhou to examine the associations between daily activities and SOC and identify the critical mediator. Multigroup Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis revealed several noteworthy findings. Firstly, despite living together in a mixed neighborhood, affordable and market housing residents exhibited significant disparities in their daily activities, facility utilization, and SOC. Residents of market housing demonstrated lower SOC compared to those in affordable housing. Secondly, daily activities had differing impacts on SOC between these groups. A variety of activity factors, such as the proportion of activity space to the neighborhood, time allocated to local activities, and the diversity of activity types, collectively enhanced SOC. These effects were particularly marked within affordable housing. Conversely, the positive influence of daily social interactions on SOC was exclusive to residents of market housing. Additionally, the use of neighborhood facilities serves as an underlying mechanism. Frequent utilization of proximal facilities can substantially improve SOC among residents, particularly for those in affordable housing. These findings offer valuable insights for the planning and managing of mixed housing neighborhoods and may also inspire strategies in other neighborhood types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Growth over resilience: how Canadian municipalities frame the challenge of reducing carbon emissions                                                                                                                    | In response to anthropogenic climate change, many governments are adopting policies to reduce carbon emissions. In Canada, federal and provincial governments have implemented carbon pricing. One of the effects of putting a price on carbon is increasing the cost of using private vehicles, which may reduce mobility and increase the risk of social exclusion, especially in contexts where car dependence is high. In this article, we analyse how municipal governments in Canada frame the challenges of climate change and reducing emissions, and examine whether they link these challenges to issues of mobility and social exclusion. Focusing on policies from four of Canada's largest cities - Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Vancouver - we identify four main frames used in planning documents: "the Growing City", "If You Build It, They Will Come", "Better City for All", and "the Resilient City". The Growing City frame is used to support status quo urban development, with climate mitigation options (including sustainable travel modes) optionally included for more concerned residents. This is the dominant frame in Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg. Conversely, Vancouver uses the Resilient City frame to indicate that climate mitigation and adaption strategies are essential, and all citizens must be prepared for change. Vancouver presents changes to mobility as necessary for all, rather than an option for some. Social exclusion is not explicitly addressed in the frames, though it is presented as a reason to support building alternative transportation or more public spaces. Social exclusion receives little consideration as a potential consequence of climate mitigation policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

Researchers addressing these challenges often do so in silos; their efforts persistently separate justice for non-humans and humans. We analyze this separation through two concepts-luxury effect and green gentrification-that each explores urban greenspace and justice, but from different angles. The luxury effect implicitly targets justice for non-humans by exploring biodiversity in cities and finds that wealth explains the distribution of biodiversity. Green gentrification explicitly targets justice for humans by examining how new greenspaces affect people and finds that such greenspaces often displace vulnerable people. Using scientometric analyses, we show the disjunction between these concepts. We draw on socio-ecological justice concepts to suggest that disregarding relationships and conflicts among humans and non-humans in concepts does not eliminate them in practice, but stalls progress toward just cities. We urge scholars to simultaneously focus on justice for humans and non-humans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

We urge scholars to simultaneously focus on justice for humans and non-humans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |
| Global inequality in built-up land per capita and its change trajectories between 1985 and 2020                                                                                                                         | Built-up land has increased rapidly in recent decades, thus aggravating the competition for land between multiple uses. The increase in urban land can be decomposed into changes in population and changes in built-up land per person. Yet, it is unclear how this decomposition differs by country and how this decomposition changes over time. Moreover, we don't know whether these changes affect the inequality in built-up land per capita. Here, we analyze the global distribution of built-up land per capita in the year 2020, as well as the changes therein between 1985 and 2020. We find that built-up land per capita in 2020 differs by an order of magnitude between countries, ranging from 15 m2 2 per person in Ethiopia to 734 m2 2 per person in Australia. Moreover, we find a wide range of different change trajectories, including both increases and decreases in built-up land per capita and in total population. As the total area of urban land increased in all countries, decreases in urban land consumption reflect a situation where the population increases faster than the total amount of urban land. We also find a large inequality in urban land consumption across countries, as indicated by a Gini index of 0.47 in 1985, decreasing only slightly to 0.45 in 2020. These findings suggest the need for a regionally differentiated approach to reduce urban land take, focusing first on mitigating further increases in those countries that already have a high urban land consumption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Fuel Efficiency Improvements: Feedback Mechanisms and Distributional Effects in the Oil Market                                                                                                                          | We study the interactions between fuel efficiency improvements in the transport sector and the oil market, where the efficiency improvements are policy-induced in certain regions of the world. We are especially interested in feedback mechanisms of fuel efficiency such as the rebound effect, carbon leakage and the �green paradox�, but also the distributional effects for oil producers. An intertemporal numerical model of the international oil market is introduced, where OPEC-Core producers have market power. We find that the rebound effect has a noticeable effect on the transport sector, with the magnitude depending on the oil demand elasticity. In the benchmark simulations, we calculate that almost half of the energy savings may be lost to a direct rebound effect and an additional 10% to oil price adjustments. In addition, there is substantial intersectoral leakage to other sectors through lower oil prices in the regions that introduce the policy. There is a small green paradox effect in the sense that oil consumption increases initially when the fuel efficiency measures are gradually implemented. Finally, international carbon leakage will be significant if policies are not implemented in all regions; we estimate leakage rates of 35% or higher when only major consuming regions implement fuel economy policies. Non-OPEC producers will to a larger degree than OPEC producers cut back on its oil supply as a response to fuel efficiency policies due to high production costs. � 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |
| Fuel Efficiency Improvements: Feedback Mechanisms and Distributional Effects in the Oil Market                                                                                                                          | We study the interactions between fuel efficiency improvements in the transport sector and the oil market, where the efficiency improvements are policy-induced in certain regions of the world. We are especially interested in feedback mechanisms of fuel efficiency such as the rebound effect, carbon leakage and the “green paradox”, but also the distributional effects for oil producers. An intertemporal numerical model of the international oil market is introduced, where OPEC-Core producers have market power. We find that the rebound effect has a noticeable effect on the transport sector, with the magnitude depending on the oil demand elasticity. In the benchmark simulations, we calculate that almost half of the energy savings may be lost to a direct rebound effect and an additional 10% to oil price adjustments. In addition, there is substantial intersectoral leakage to other sectors through lower oil prices in the regions that introduce the policy. There is a small green paradox effect in the sense that oil consumption increases initially when the fuel efficiency measures are gradually implemented. Finally, international carbon leakage will be significant if policies are not implemented in all regions; we estimate leakage rates of 35% or higher when only major consuming regions implement fuel economy policies.

| Exploring transportation networks relationship to healthcare access and as affected by urban sprawl                                                                                                                     | Transportation networks and related urban form settlements are frequently recognized as barriers to primary care access. This study explores the role of urban form in constraining accessibility to healthcare as affected by transportation network characteristics. The aim of the study is to measure the spatial accessibility to primary health care providers while controlling for the impact of built environment factors. Orlando Metropolitan statistical area, in Florida, USA, is used as a case study. This study develops a multi-dimensional approach to measure urban form components - density, mixed use, street network and proximity - and spatial measures of accessibility to primary care providers by employing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression is used to assess the impact of urban form characteristics to primary health care providers' accessibility, and to verify previous research that concludes that places with more sprawl have less accessibility to health care facilities. Considering both nurse practitioners (NPs) and primary care physicians (PCPs) as primary health care providers, about 85.67% of total population of Orlando Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) has access to the nearest provider in less than 5 minute drive, which represents remarkable levels of accessibility. In the regression results, the density component shows a positive and proximity a negative and significant correlation to all primary care accessibility measures; whereas the mixed-use components show both positive and negative correlation. The findings from this study show that a more nuanced relationships exists between urban form components and accessibility of primary health care. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The findings from this study show that a more nuanced relationships exists between urban form components and accessibility of primary health care. © 2017 The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

Our research suggests that intermodal approaches could constitute an invisible transport planning revolution.Based on a review defining social sustainability as it applies to urban passenger transportation, we consider the potential of an intermodal focus to better integrate non-motorized (walking-cycling) and public transportation. We start from the premise that rather than being a primary mono-mode such as buses or trains, sustainable transport is best understood as an ecology of modes with specific strengths and complementarities that can be mobilized through planning.Using data from Metropolitan Santiago (Chile), we explore this potential, from a conceptual, mainly social, and spatial perspective. We find that paying more attention to different formats of cycling, public transport integration could significantly improve low-cost alternatives for individual and feeder trips. Moreover, adjusting land use to non-work trip purposes could yield substantial benefits. This approach also offers the possibility of developing relatively simple tools helpful for improving the deliberative aspects of participatory planning, thereby increasing buy-in as well as improving health, efficiency, safety, and other benefits of sustainable transport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

This approach also offers the possibility of developing relatively simple tools helpful for improving the deliberative aspects of participatory planning, thereby increasing buy-in as well as improving health, efficiency, safety, and other benefits of sustainable transport. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

Community Currency (CC) is considered one of the most effective forms of social capital. Understanding factors contributing to CC participation is the key to promoting successful CC systems. Despite the well-documented work on the demographic, socioeconomic, and policy factors related to CC, the roles of the physical environment, such as neighborhood walkability, have not been explored. Using the survey data collected from 77 users and 42 nonusers of CC, this exploratory study examined how neighborhood walkability influenced the levels of CC activities and community attachment. After controlling for demographic factors, the analysis showed walking-friendly neighborhood features were positively related to CC membership and CC activities. Further, CC participants and those living in walking-friendly neighborhoods showed significantly higher levels of community attachment compared to their counterparts. The results suggest that neighborhood physical environments may function to deter or promote CC participation, and that an effective CC promotion strategy may involve targeting walkable communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

| Exploring non-linear urban vibrancy dynamics in emerging new towns: A case study of the Wuhan metropolitan area                                                                                                         | New towns have been extensively developed in many worldwide metropolises to overcome a series of urban crisis caused by over-intensive population and economic activity, such as environmental deterioration, traffic congestion and space shortage. The successful development of new towns has been regarded as a common, international urban challenge aimed at creating vital and lively urban life. Quantifying the complex relationship between new town vibrancy and the built environment provides a theoretical basis for formulating adequate planning regulations and policies to solve the development predicaments of new towns. Taking the Wuhan metropolitan area as the case study, this study employs the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) machine learning method to delve into the intricate non-linear relationship between urban vibrancy and built environment indicators both in both peripheric new towns (NT) and central mother cities (MC), shedding light on the differences in the characteristics and complexities of vibrancy between NT and MC. The findings reveal stark disparities in vibrancy levels between NT and MC, emphasizing the critical need for tailored revitalization strategies. It is found that the indicators with the highest contribution to the impact of vibrancy in NT and MC are respectively the point of interest (POI) density and Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) development intensity. Model comparison between NT and MC concludes that enhancing POI density to meet the basic needs of citizens is a prerequisite for fostering urban vibrancy. To successfully create similarly vital and lively urban life as that in the MC, NT should focus on the impacts of TOD development and policy factors such as government relocation on vibrancy. Finally, deriving from these findings, we propose some policy insights and practical strategies for urban practitioners and policymakers to enhance the vibrancy and sustainability of the new towns. � 2024                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |
| Exploring non-linear urban vibrancy dynamics in emerging new towns: A case study of the Wuhan metropolitan area                                                                                                         | New towns have been extensively developed in many worldwide metropolises to overcome a series of urban crisis caused by over-intensive population and economic activity, such as environmental deterioration, traffic congestion and space shortage. The successful development of new towns has been regarded as a common, international urban challenge aimed at creating vital and lively urban life. Quantifying the complex relationship between new town vibrancy and the built environment provides a theoretical basis for formulating adequate planning regulations and policies to solve the development predicaments of new towns. Taking the Wuhan metropolitan area as the case study, this study employs the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) machine learning method to delve into the intricate non-linear relationship between urban vibrancy and built environment indicators both in both peripheric new towns (NT) and central mother cities (MC), shedding light on the differences in the characteristics and complexities of vibrancy between NT and MC. The findings reveal stark disparities in vibrancy levels between NT and MC, emphasizing the critical need for tailored revitalization strategies. It is found that the indicators with the highest contribution to the impact of vibrancy in NT and MC are respectively the point of interest (POI) density and Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) development intensity. Model comparison between NT and MC concludes that enhancing POI density to meet the basic needs of citizens is a prerequisite for fostering urban vibrancy. To successfully create similarly vital and lively urban life as that in the MC, NT should focus on the impacts of TOD development and policy factors such as government relocation on vibrancy. Finally, deriving from these findings, we propose some policy insights and practical strategies for urban practitioners and policymakers to enhance the vibrancy and sustainability of the new towns. © 2024                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

Examples include exacerbating energy burden, inaccessibility and unaffordability of low-carbon energy and electric end-use technologies, property value loss and displacement from renewable energy siting, and unequal health benefits and employment losses from fossil fuel retirement. To avoid perpetuating historical and creating new injustices, an equitable and just energy transition will require careful planning and execution. To this end, measuring and evaluating the effects of existing and proposed programs and policies aimed at decarbonizing energy systems is critical. However, methods and metrics for evaluating equity effects vary across disciplines and transitions, making it challenging to identify effective evaluation strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the equity implications of low-carbon energy transitions and identifies key metrics that have been used across disciplines to quantify energy injustices and equity impacts. We focus on four key low-carbon energy transitions: (1) renewable energy deployment; (2) fossil fuel infrastructure retirement; (3) transportation electrification; and (4) residential building decarbonization. We classify energy justice and equity metrics into the dimensions of health, access, and livelihood, and construct an analytical framework that supports policymakers, planners and other stakeholders in identifying important equity considerations and quantitatively evaluating the effects of decarbonization initiatives. While our framework can serve as a starting point for evaluating justice and equity impacts of energy transitions, further work is needed to address the limitations of existing metrics and additional evaluation methods will be critical to effect energy transitions that are truly equitable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| Environmental Performance and SDGs: How Do Income Disparity, Urbanization, Resource Consumption, and Female Employers Affect the Ecological Footprint in Emerging Economies?                                            | The significance of environmental deterioration as a pressing issue has led to its prominence in global discussions on strategies for prevention. It can be asserted that there exists a universal agreement that the enhancement of environmental quality is imperative for the promotion of sustainable development and societal well-being, especially in emerging economies. In this perspective, the present research uses panel data of the E7 economies from 1992 to 2021 to assess the effects of income disparity, urbanization, resources consumption (nonrenewable and renewable energy consumption), and women employers on ecological footprint. This study employs second-generation empirical techniques such as CIPS and CADF unit root tests, Westerlund bootstrap cointegration, and DFE/MG/PMG-ARDL models to check the relationships between the studied variables. The empirical findings of this study reveal that in the E7 countries, the ecological footprint is increased with an increased income disparity and nonrenewable energy consumption.

| Environmental Performance and SDGs: How Do Income Disparity, Urbanization, Resource Consumption, and Female Employers Affect the Ecological Footprint in Emerging Economies?                                            | The significance of environmental deterioration as a pressing issue has led to its prominence in global discussions on strategies for prevention. It can be asserted that there exists a universal agreement that the enhancement of environmental quality is imperative for the promotion of sustainable development and societal well-being, especially in emerging economies. In this perspective, the present research uses panel data of the E7 economies from 1992 to 2021 to assess the effects of income disparity, urbanization, resources consumption (nonrenewable and renewable energy consumption), and women employers on ecological footprint. This study employs second-generation empirical techniques such as CIPS and CADF unit root tests, Westerlund bootstrap cointegration, and DFE/MG/PMG-ARDL models to check the relationships between the studied variables. The empirical findings of this study reveal that in the E7 countries, the ecological footprint is increased with an increased income disparity and nonrenewable energy consumption. On the other hand, urbanization, renewable energy consumption, and female employers help reduce the ecological footprint. Additionally, the results of the causality measure under the Dumitrescu and Hurlin test unveil bidirectional causality between all the independent variables except nonrenewable energy and ecological footprint. From the policy perspective, the selected countries must implement policies that promote equitable income distribution, planned urbanization to promote compact cities, efficient transportation systems, and green infrastructure, and provide opportunities for women to attain higher positions in organizations, particularly at the managerial and decision-making levels in order to address the adverse environmental consequences in emerging economies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |
| Enriching geospatial data with computer vision to identify urban environment determinants of social interactions                                                                                                        | Characteristics of urban space (co-)determine human behaviour, including their social interaction patterns. However, despite numerous studies that have examined how the urban space impacts social interactions, their relationships are still poorly understood. Recent developments in computer vision and machine learning fields offer promising new ways to analyse and collect data on social interactions. This study proposes a new computer vision-based approach to study how the urban space impacts social interactions. The proposed method uses pre-trained object detection models to detect social interactions (including their geo-locations) from street-view imagery. After that, it regresses urban space characteristics -which are also detected using object detection models - on social interactions. For this study, 294,852 street-level images from three Dutch cities are analysed. Results from linear regression analysis show that for these three Dutch cities people tend to meet in places with a strong presence of recreational attractions and bicycles. Also, the results of data collection and image processing can be used to identify the areas most likely to produce social interactions in urban space to conduct urban studies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

In Singapore, our dependence on electricity has not been taken for granted and it has always been a long-term objective to be energy efficient not only in terms of operational cost but also due to environmental responsibility. In Singapore, in order to move reliably millions of passengers day in day out, the electric bill can be pretty hefty, in the order of millions of dollars. This paper highlights the various energy conservation measures currently adopted for our Rapid Transit System as well as the some of the ongoing efforts in seeking out alternative energy conservation measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

This paper highlights the various energy conservation measures currently adopted for our Rapid Transit System as well as the some of the ongoing efforts in seeking out alternative energy conservation measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Encounter and its configurational logic: Understanding spatiotemporal co-presence with road network and social media check-in data                                                                                      | Public space facilitates the social interaction between people. It is widely accepted that the connection between spaces creates the possibility of the mutual visibility between people. The relationship between spatial configuration and the spatiotemporal encounters, however, has rarely been investigated explicitly in empirical cases. The focus of this study is two folded: firstly, it examines the way to measure spatiotemporal encounters between different groups of people based on their mobility records; secondly, it investigates how the design of the built environment contributes to physical co-presence on spatial and temporal dimensions. Using ubiquitous individual social media check-in data in Central Shanghai, China, this study proposes a framework for quantifying physical face-to-face co-presence patterns between the defined local random walkers and the remote visitors across time in every street. In the introduced People-Space-Time (PST) model, social capital is conceptualised as an integration among social difference, spatial distance (metric and geometrical distance) and time distance. The reliability of the applied data and the effectiveness of the introduced methods are validated by the investigations of the scaling nature of the extracted mobility patterns and the correlation between the outputs and surveyed data. The produced spatiotemporal patterns of face-toface co-presence reveal that city centres and the large-scale urban complexes (e.g., transport hubs, shopping malls, stadiums, etc.) are ideal places for people to encounter. The results of the regression analyses demonstrate that spatial and functional centrality measures are significant variables for predicting spatiotemporal co-presence in streets, but in which the functional centrality structures maintain a higher standard of explanatory power than the spatial network. The temporal complexity of the co-presence is revealed by the temporally shifting performance of the integrated regression models across time. The findings in this study yield that it is the spatio-functional interaction influencing spatiotemporal variation of the physical encounter between people, and reclaim the necessity of adding fine-scale land-use patterns in the traditional configurational analysis for deeply understanding the social processes with urban big data in the contemporary digitalised cities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

| Empowering a sustainable urban future: The key role of coordinated settlement development for optimising energy efficiency and socio-economic welfare                                                                   | The nexus between urbanisation and energy transition represents a critical juncture in the pursuit of sustainable development. As cities continue to grow and expand, their energy needs rise, driving consumption and emissions. Simultaneously, efforts to transition towards renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency are underway to mitigate climate change and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. However, urbanisation poses a challenge to these efforts, as sprawling cities require more energy for transport, infrastructure and buildings. Reconciling the need for urban development with sustainable energy practices requires integrated spatial planning approaches that consider the spatial layout of residential areas, land use patterns and transport systems. To address this nexus, our study explores the complex interplay between energy efficiency and urban development, alongside communities' quality of life, which is crucial for urban sustainability. We have developed a settlement network model that integrates socio-economic factors and the spatial distribution of energy consumption. Using a U-NSGA 3 algorithm, we have attempted to optimise future settlement network to simultaneously improve the two goals of energy efficiency and socio-economic factors. By optimising settlement networks, we shed light on the relationship between energy efficiency and communities' quality of life arising from different urban development patterns, offering insights for strategic spatial planning and technological advances.

| Empowering a sustainable urban future: The key role of coordinated settlement development for optimising energy efficiency and socio-economic welfare                                                                   | The nexus between urbanisation and energy transition represents a critical juncture in the pursuit of sustainable development. As cities continue to grow and expand, their energy needs rise, driving consumption and emissions. Simultaneously, efforts to transition towards renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency are underway to mitigate climate change and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. However, urbanisation poses a challenge to these efforts, as sprawling cities require more energy for transport, infrastructure and buildings. Reconciling the need for urban development with sustainable energy practices requires integrated spatial planning approaches that consider the spatial layout of residential areas, land use patterns and transport systems. To address this nexus, our study explores the complex interplay between energy efficiency and urban development, alongside communities’ quality of life, which is crucial for urban sustainability. We have developed a settlement network model that integrates socio-economic factors and the spatial distribution of energy consumption. Using a U-NSGA 3 algorithm, we have attempted to optimise future settlement network to simultaneously improve the two goals of energy efficiency and socio-economic factors. By optimising settlement networks, we shed light on the relationship between energy efficiency and communities’ quality of life arising from different urban development patterns, offering insights for strategic spatial planning and technological advances. Using insights from a Swiss case study, we delineate modified strategies encompassing coordinated development, densification and the use of electric vehicles and building insulation. The results offer practical solutions for policymakers and spatial planners dedicated to fostering sustainable urban development.

While electrification is an effective approach to reducing carbon emissions, it may result in environmental justice consequences that need to be tackled. We discuss four categories of related issues: air quality and health-related equity; technology access; equitable infrastructure development; and a just global supply chain. In regions where grid decarbonization is well under way, transport-related disparities in air quality and health are expected to decrease with electrification. In contrast, in regions that still rely heavily on coal generation, disparities may increase, putting further strain on low-income communities and people of color. The high upfront cost of electric vehicles and limited access to charging present additional challenges for achieving equity in transportation electrification. Meeting the electricity demand of a fully electric vehicle fleet will require rapid expansion of power generation, transmission, and distribution capacity, and the location and design of this infrastructure will have further impacts on communities where it is sited. Here, we offer a perspective on these emerging environmental justice issues at the intersection of transportation and electricity systems and provide policy recommendations and future research directions for electrified transportation. We suggest there is a need for policies targeting electrification and power sector decarbonization in tandem, assessment of barriers to electric vehicle adoption in different groups, development of strategies for community inclusion in infrastructure development decisions, and creation of frameworks to assess equity tradeoffs along the global supply chain supporting electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

Traffic congestion is a phenomenon that not only affects transportation systems but also influences commuters' quality of life and population mobility. The present research aims to analyze the effects of traffic congestion on individuals' travel behaviors, addressing both direct and indirect effects of congestion on vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per driver by implementing structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. In addition to the causal analysis between traffic congestion and VMT, this study examined the complex relationship between an individual's socioeconomic characteristics, the built environment, congestion, and VMT. Measuring local congestion at a national level is also a key contribution of this research. This study used the same methodology as the Texas A&M Transportation Institute to compute a road congestion index and quantify local congestion for 93,769 drivers within 337 metropolitan areas. Our findings suggest that congestion is the main driver of VMT reduction. The findings also confirm that residents in compact development regions have lower daily VMTs because of the proximity of origins and destinations in denser areas with higher job-population balances. Therefore, rather than expanding highway networks, public transit investment might address traffic congestion more efficiently-not only by providing residents with more equitable and sustainable means of transportation, but also by encouraging people to reside in more compact and location-efficient areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| Effects of Traffic Congestion on Vehicle Miles Traveled                                                                                                                                                                 | The effects of traffic congestion on travel behavior are complex and multidimensional because they are related to various factors such as density, land use patterns, network connectivity, and individual preferences. Traffic congestion is a phenomenon that not only affects transportation systems but also influences commuters’ quality of life and population mobility. The present research aims to analyze the effects of traffic congestion on individuals’ travel behaviors, addressing both direct and indirect effects of congestion on vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per driver by implementing structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. In addition to the causal analysis between traffic congestion and VMT, this study examined the complex relationship between an individual’s socioeconomic characteristics, the built environment, congestion, and VMT. Measuring local congestion at a national level is also a key contribution of this research. This study used the same methodology as the Texas A&M Transportation Institute to compute a road congestion index and quantify local congestion for 93,769 drivers within 337 metropolitan areas. Our findings suggest that congestion is the main driver of VMT reduction. The findings also confirm that residents in compact development regions have lower daily VMTs because of the proximity of origins and destinations in denser areas with higher job–population balances. Therefore, rather than expanding highway networks, public transit investment might address traffic congestion more efficiently—not only by providing residents with more equitable and sustainable means of transportation, but also by encouraging people to reside in more compact and location-efficient areas. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

Many cities are considering accommodating active mobility, especially walking and biking, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, promoting active mobility without proper planning and transportation infrastructure to combat extreme heat exposure may cause more heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly in future with projected climate change. This study estimated the effectiveness of active trip heat exposure mitigation under built environment and travel behavior change. Simulations of the Phoenix metro region's 624,987 active trips were conducted using the activity-based travel model (ABM), mean radiant temperature (T-MRT, net human radiation exposure), transportation network, and local climate zones. Two scenarios were designed to reduce traveler exposure: one that focuses on built environment change (making neighborhoods cooler) and the other on travel behavior (switching from shorter travel time but higher exposure routes to longer travel time but cooler routes) change. Travelers experienced T-MRT heat exposure ranging from 29 degrees C to 76 degrees C (84 degrees F to 168 degrees F) without environmental or behavioral change. Active trip T-MRT exposures were reduced by an average of 1.2-3.7 degrees C when the built environment was changed from a hotter to cooler design. Behavioral changes cooled up to 10 times more trips than changes in built environment changes. The marginal benefit of cooling decreased as the number of cooled corridors transformed increased. When the most traveled 10 km of corridors were cooled, the marginal benefit affected over 1,000 trips/km. However, cooling all corridors results in marginal benefits as low as 1 trip/km. The results reveal that heavily traveled corridors should be prioritized with limited resources, and the best cooling results come from environment and travel behavior change together. The results show how to surgically invest in travel behavior and built environment change to most effectively protect active travelers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Economic Sustainability and 'Missing Middle Housing': Associations between Housing Stock Diversity and Unemployment in Mid-Size US Cities                                                                               | Single-family detached homes-the lowest-density housing type-continue to dominate the U.S. home construction industry. These homes are carbon-intensive and automobile dependent; the built environments they produce militate against civic relations and attitudes. Cities need to increase density, support multimodality, and develop social capital, but these issues are not propelling cities to diversify their housing stock. The objective of this research is to facilitate this shift by establishing economic arguments for increased density and housing diversity. Municipal-level U.S. Census data is used to explore the interurban relationships between diversity in housing stocks and unemployment rates in 146 mid-size American cities. A measure of diversity, Shannon's H, is applied to housing stock and found to be strongly associated with lower unemployment for workers over 25 years old after controlling for measures of urban social burden. In contrast to the much-heralded "trade-offs" between environmental quality, social equity, and economic development, these findings suggest that the dense, walkable, low-carbon city, and the economically sustainable city might be the same place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

| Driving sustainable transportation: insights and strategies for shared-rides services                                                                                                                                   | The concept of sharing, enabled by emerging technologies, is playing an increasingly important role in contributing to a transformation toward more sustainable transportation. This study aimed to contribute to the growing body of literature on on-demand transportation services, with a particular emphasis on sharing or pooling a ride when using services such as transportation-network companies (TNCs) and microtransit. The study conducted a shared mobility survey of over 2,500 respondents from selected locales across Texas-ranging from large urban areas to small cities and rural areas. We analyzed the survey data in detail using extensive statistical analysis and inferential techniques and adopted an analysis approach toward implementation-oriented research to address the gap between theory and practice. Demographic, as well as geographic and built-environment, factors were found to play an important role in determining whether users will opt for a shared or pooled service and/or how they perceive these alternatives. The findings highlight the importance of improving safety and security, increasing awareness of the benefits of ride-sharing, and designing appropriate policy measures to promote sustainable mobility. We identified potential operational improvements, government policies, and employer programs to improve shared-ride services and encourage their use, such as reducing uncertainty in shared rides and minimizing inconvenience for passengers. A critical finding was the need to prioritize operational improvements in shared-ride trips over solely relying on financial incentives to induce behavior change. Enhanced public awareness and education were also determined to be crucial regardless of the nature of improvements, policies, or programs that are implemented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| Driving sustainable transportation: insights and strategies for shared-rides services                                                                                                                                   | The concept of sharing, enabled by emerging technologies, is playing an increasingly important role in contributing to a transformation toward more sustainable transportation. This study aimed to contribute to the growing body of literature on on-demand transportation services, with a particular emphasis on sharing or pooling a ride when using services such as transportation-network companies (TNCs) and microtransit. The study conducted a shared mobility survey of over 2,500 respondents from selected locales across Texas—ranging from large urban areas to small cities and rural areas. We analyzed the survey data in detail using extensive statistical analysis and inferential techniques and adopted an analysis approach toward implementation-oriented research to address the gap between theory and practice. Demographic, as well as geographic and built-environment, factors were found to play an important role in determining whether users will opt for a shared or pooled service and/or how they perceive these alternatives. The findings highlight the importance of improving safety and security, increasing awareness of the benefits of ride-sharing, and designing appropriate policy measures to promote sustainable mobility. We identified potential operational improvements, government policies, and employer programs to improve shared-ride services and encourage their use, such as reducing uncertainty in shared rides and minimizing inconvenience for passengers. A critical finding was the need to prioritize operational improvements in shared-ride trips over solely relying on financial incentives to induce behavior change. Enhanced public awareness and education were also determined to be crucial regardless of the nature of improvements, policies, or programs that are implemented. © 2023 Texas A&M Transportation Institute.

| Does area type matter for pedestrian distribution? Testing movement economy theory on gated and non-gated housing estates in Wuhan, China                                                                               | This study investigates how the built environment influences pedestrian distribution in housing estates and whether its influence differs between gated and non-gated housing types. This study is built upon the theoretical framework of the movement economy, initially proposed by scholars from the Space Syntax Laboratory and recently extended by others. The extended movement economy framework conceptualises the interrelationship between street configuration, functional uses, physical structures, and pedestrian movement. To evaluate the hypothesised associations within this theoretical framework, we constructed structural equation modelling using pedestrian movement data of 606 locations from six pairs of gated and non-gated housing estates in Wuhan, China. We assessed the direct, indirect, and total effects of street configuration, functional uses, and physical structures on pedestrian movement. We then conducted a multigroup analysis to determine whether statistically significant differences exist between gated and non-gated housing areas regarding how the three spatial factors affect pedestrian movement. The findings indicated that the structural model could explain over 60 % of variances on pedestrian movement data, regardless of housing types. Although pedestrian movement demonstrated statistically significant corre-lations with street configuration, functional use, and physical structure, the street configuration was the most powerful and reliable predictor of all. This paper also evidenced that functional use and physical structure were two effective mediators between street configuration and pedestrian movement, albeit with small mediating effect sizes. More importantly, the results also uncovered several statistically significant differences in the builtenvironmental influences between gated and non-gated models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that (i) verifies the direct, indirect, and total effects of the built environment on pedestrian movement in Chinese housing estates; and (ii) confirms statistically significant differences between gated and non-gated housing types in their built-environmental impacts on pedestrian movement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Do plans matter? A game-theoretic model for examining the logic and effects of land use planning                                                                                                                        | Although state and local growth management programs vary widely, nearly all such programs include one common feature: they require local governments to plan. While there has been extensive research on the effects of growth management in general and on specific policy instruments to manage urban growth there has been little research on the effects of planning. In this paper we present a game-theoretic model of urban development in which a rational local government plans. The model illustrates how planning can serve to guide local government decision making, how land market participants might respond to local government plans, and how planning in a dynamic context can increase social welfare. By considering local government as a player who plans rather than as an external disturbance that might regulate, we can discover insights and frame hypotheses about the efficacy of planning that are not possible in other urban economic models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| Digital twin-driven strategic demolition plan for circular asset management of bridge infrastructures                                                                                                                   | Economic growth plays an important role in the rapid increase in construction of transportation and bridge infrastructures, which in turn causes enormous greenhouse gas emissions contributing directly to climate change. An innovative and effective method, so-called Building Information Modeling (BIM), to sustainably manage detailed lifecycle of infrastructures, has been recently adopted to revolutionise the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Its major function is to sustainably optimise all detailed stages of an infrastructure asset’s lifecycle. A three-dimensional architectural BIM incorporating three additional dimensions (time, cost, and carbon emissions) has then been created in this study to virtualise the whole lifecycle performance of bridge infrastructure through BIM data. For circular asset management, multi-scale details of assets and infrastructures are indispensable. On this ground, these information dimensions are highly critical to asset managers to assure not only public safety, but also sustainability over the whole lifecycle. It is thus critical to quantify carbon footprint in order to identify better alternative solutions for construction and maintenance, resulting in carbon neutrality and carbon credit. Our digital twin (DT), driven by the BIM, has embedded demolition scenarios whose lifecycle cost and carbon footprint can be quantified and optimized simultaneously. Our study is the first to also demonstrate circular end-of-life management through strategic demolition planning that enhances circular economy practice. This aspect is novel and has not been commonly adopted in practice. Our study reveals that the construction stage of the asset lifecycle for this study is the main contributor to carbon emissions and costs stemming from raw materials and their productions. This eventually leads to significant waste at the end of asset’s life, requiring strategic demolition plan to maximise reuse, repurpose, and recycle of materials, parts and components. Our innovative DT is capable of dealing with the cradle-to-cradle lifecycle management. Another co-benefit of using the BIM-based digital twin is to minimise streamlining design, re-work, mitigating risk, and real time processing of design changes in all stakeholders, reducing the effect on carbon emissions, costs, and time schedules. All dimensions (i.e. 6D) can be updated and re-calculated in real time when cross-linked with inspections and condition monitoring, generating real-time digital twin driven solutions. © The Author(s) 2025.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |

All dimensions (i.e. 6D) can be updated and re-calculated in real time when cross-linked with inspections and condition monitoring, generating real-time digital twin driven solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |
| Developing integrated models by coupling together existing models; land use, economics, demographics and transport in Wellington, New Zealand                                                                           | Economics, demographics, land use change, and transport interact in complex and dynamic ways. To inform urban policy decision-making it is important to develop tools that incorporate the interactions of these systems in meaningful ways. Historically, models of these systems have been developed in isolation, and many agencies have already invested large amounts of time and money into developing these independent models. It is thus often desirable to couple existing models, rather than to develop a completely new integrated model. Coupling together independently developed models introduces many challenges including dealing with different spatial and temporal scales, base datasets and levels of aggregation, as well as bringing up deeper questions around the underlying paradigms, assumptions and limitations of the models. This paper describes the key challenges encountered when coupling an existing integrated model of land use change, economic activity, and population (the 'Integrated Scenario Explorer' model) with an existing transport model (the 'Wellington Transport Strategy Model') for the Wellington region in New Zealand. The case study results show that the coupling produces substantial differences in the urban land use change looking forward to 2041, specifically it affects the location of the urban intensification. The paper summarises the important considerations for modellers when coupling independently developed models, highlights the importance of understanding the underlying theories of the component models, and emphasises the need to develop pragmatic solutions that are guided by the intended use of the resulting integrated model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Not About Sufficiency | Nutrition        |

| Developing and Assessing Alternative Land-Use Scenarios from the MOLAND Model: A Scenario-Based Impact Analysis Approach for the Evaluation of Rapid Rail Provisions and Urban Development in the Greater Dublin Region | In this study, environmental sustainability implications of planned rail infrastructure investments on the urban form and development in the Greater Dublin Region (GDR) have been analysed incorporating the scenario analysis approach. Various scenarios are developed using the MOLAND Model applications including: A baseline scenario incorporating a continuation of the present dispersed pattern of urban development and an alternative scenario with rail-oriented corridor development, under varying conditions of economic growth. An alternative scenario was also developed for the recessionary development case considering the prolonged recession in the GDR. Further explorations incorporating a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) approach are developed to evaluate the sustainability implications of different land development scenarios in the Dublin Region. This is assisted by focussing on the impacts of rail investments on urban form and development as raised in the international comparative literature. The findings from the CBA assessment positively indicate that containment policies-as represented by the public transport oriented development indicate benefits over the dispersed development case by reducing the negative consequences of sprawl type of developments. In contrast, dispersed development in the baseline scenario indicates costs of continuation of such development patterns exceed the benefits in the long term. This study will contribute to policy support evaluation measures relating to the integration of scenario analysis tool with the CBA approach in assisting the evaluation of new transport infrastructure proposals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

This study will contribute to policy support evaluation measures relating to the integration of scenario analysis tool with the CBA approach in assisting the evaluation of new transport infrastructure proposals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

| Could improving public transport accessibility reduce road traffic carbon dioxide emissions? A simulation-based counterfactual analysis                                                                                 | Improving public transport accessibility (PTA) has been considered as an effective measure for promoting sustainable urban development. Based on the grid-level data in Nanjing, China, this paper explores the spatially heterogeneous effects of PTA on road traffic CO2 emissions using a geographically weighted random forest (GWRF) model. A simulation-based counterfactual analysis framework is further proposed to predict the intervention effects of improving PTA. Two kinds of practical interventions, adding facilities and increasing service frequency, are considered in our counterfactual prediction. The effects of improving PTA across different areas are predicted and compared. Our results indicate that the GWRF model with a properly tuned bandwidth outperforms the conventional random forest model. The results of counterfactual analysis show that improving PTA could achieve greater environmental benefits in suburb areas. With the process of urbanization in Nanjing, the population and economy has grown rapidly in suburb areas. Therefore, it is reasonable to improve public transport services in these areas. Based on our findings, PTA has potential to make a significant contribution to sustainable development of urban transportation. Moreover, our findings with respect to heterogeneous effects likely improve the efficiency of local transport policies that target such areas, helping achieve greater environmental benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| Could improving public transport accessibility reduce road traffic carbon dioxide emissions? A simulation-based counterfactual analysis                                                                                 | Improving public transport accessibility (PTA) has been considered as an effective measure for promoting sustainable urban development. Based on the grid-level data in Nanjing, China, this paper explores the spatially heterogeneous effects of PTA on road traffic CO2 emissions using a geographically weighted random forest (GWRF) model. A simulation-based counterfactual analysis framework is further proposed to predict the intervention effects of improving PTA. Two kinds of practical interventions, adding facilities and increasing service frequency, are considered in our counterfactual prediction. The effects of improving PTA across different areas are predicted and compared. Our results indicate that the GWRF model with a properly tuned bandwidth outperforms the conventional random forest model. The results of counterfactual analysis show that improving PTA could achieve greater environmental benefits in suburb areas. With the process of urbanization in Nanjing, the population and economy has grown rapidly in suburb areas. Therefore, it is reasonable to improve public transport services in these areas. Based on our findings, PTA has potential to make a significant contribution to sustainable development of urban transportation. Moreover, our findings with respect to heterogeneous effects likely improve the efficiency of local transport policies that target such areas, helping achieve greater environmental benefits. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Correlation or causality between the built environment and travel behavior?

In response, smart growth programs-designed to counter sprawl-have gained popularity in the US. Studies show that, all else equal, residents of neighborhoods with higher levels of density, land-use mix, transit accessibility, and pedestrian friendliness drive less than residents of neighborhoods with lower levels of these characteristics. These studies have shed little light, however, on the underlying direction of causality-in particular, whether neighborhood design influences travel behavior or whether travel preferences influence the choice of neighborhood. The evidence thus leaves a key question largely unanswered: if cities use land use policies to bring residents closer to destinations and provide viable alternatives to driving, will people drive less and thereby reduce emissions? Here a quasi-longitudinal design is used to investigate the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and travel behavior while taking into account the role of travel preferences and neighborhood preferences in explaining this relationship. A multivariate analysis of cross-sectional data shows that differences in travel behavior between suburban and traditional neighborhoods are largely explained by attitudes. However, a quasi-longitudinal analysis of changes in travel behavior and changes in the built environment shows significant associations, even when attitudes have been accounted for, providing support for a causal relationship.

| Considering Occupant Behaviour in Building Energy Simulations along the Design Process: From a Semi-dynamic to a Dynamic Model                                                                                          | To reach the target of nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEBs), considering occupant behaviour is essential from the early design stage. This study proposes a design support tool for architects, which includes flexible and straightforward occupant behaviour modelling from the pre-design stage onwards. The tool uses a semi-dynamic model. The proposed tool can automatically export building characteristics and occupant behaviour to dynamic modelling for a more detailed assessment further on in the design process. The strength of the tool is its capacity of allowing a fast and consistent estimation with simple inputs of occupant behaviour. The tool is developed for Belgium, but the approach is valid for broader contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

Methodology/approach - This chapter reviews the content of the book, drawing together the threads to provide conclusions on parking issues and policies around the world. Findings - The chapter reveals the way in which parking is fundamentally a land-use issue and the importance of parking to different travel demands. As cars spend most of their time parked at home, the issue of residential parking is important and determines the shape and nature of our cities. Planning for parking has a key role to play in determining the outcome of how walkable the built environment becomes. The synthesis of the chapters of the book reveals how the type of parking is intrinsically linked to the activity undertaken and the type of destination, whether the trip is for commuting or for retail or leisure. The chapter identifies strategies such as car-free developments, park and ride and workplace parking levies used to p ovide solutions and the way in which the number of stakeholders involved influences the ease with which the complex interplay of issues in parking can be resolved. Practical implications - Understanding that parking is primarily a landuse policy, dependent on the home location and destination of the trip, has implications for the development of parking policy within the package of measures making up travel demand management strategies. The chapter shows how parking for a stationary vehicle can influence the flow of moving vehicles and the built environment. Originality/value of chapter - This chapter draws on the chapters of this book which offer a multidimensional investigation into parking issues and parking policy, providing a wealth of case study material providing evidence to underpin the design of effective parking management approaches. � 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

This volume investigates the diversity of the models that have been developed and tested in different European countries. This rich intranational variety should be further explored in future research, since in many countries a challenging sub-municipal, “Lilliputian” world of governance, often covered by the shadow of parent municipalities, is waiting to be explored. SMUs may be very important for the future of the welfare state, for social innovation and resilience. Sub-local community development already plays an important role in the sustainability development strategies, for example in the areas of energy and transport. © 2018, The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

It brings into focus the case of the Cano Martin Pena communities in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where residents started a Community Land Trust (CLT) in Latin America and the Caribbean, resulting from an extensive process of community participation. We highlight the importance of this case as still one of the only CLT's in the Global South, a mechanism not yet sufficiently understood as a highly developed instrument for secure land tenure and adaptation to climate change in the Global South. We analyse the mechanisms by which the CLT's collective tenure model effectively ensures greater environmental justice - both regarding ongoing flooding issues, and specific extreme natural events such as hurricanes. Collective land ownership allows residents to remain in the area despite forces of gentrification and displacement after disasters induced by global warming. We conclude with a reflection on the need for similar land-based solutions, and summon public authorities to consider these as a route to effective environmental management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |

It is obvious that the low-income people in urban area have to deal with minimal infrastructure facilities in their settlements. They have to live with bad access to the main road, bad environmental quality, and lack of playgrounds for the children, etc. Many positive aspects that can be found in low-income settlement, if they are observed carefully without having negative prejudice before. Those positive aspects are the creative process of the inhabitant for struggling. Since relationship among the inhabitant is quite close, public spaces are necessary for them, because they use them as a place of communication.

The urban characteristics of these two fundamentally diverse types of residential structures have, as we suppose, a different impact on the sustainable development of the urban area. The amount and character of local greenery, the spatial arrangement and accessibility of the courtyards, the spatial forms of the surrounding buildings and many other factors can influence the ecological stability of the area, its hygienic qualities, the intensity and way of using by various social groups, and also e.g. the prices of real estates. These and many other phenomena indicate the ecological, hygienic, social and economic sustainability of the urban area. The research methodology evaluates specific measureable indicators of sustainability within a range from 0 to 10 points where 5 points correspond to the general standard in the area, 0 points indicate degradation, and 10 points indicate the highest contribution to sustainable development. The survey results are reflected in the overall sustainability index and in the residents' satisfaction index that reflects the subjective satisfaction based on questionnaires surveys. The paper analyses the residential structures in the Central European city of Brno, Czech Republic. The case studies of the urban blocks near the city centre and of the panel housing estate Brno - Vinohrady are compared. The results imply that a considerable positive impact on the sustainable development of the area should be ascribed to the green closed urban blocks near the city centre. These urban blocks with a closed courtyard provide a quality outdoor environment with a certain level of privacy. This factor can significantly support the development of local community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Climate-Related Vulnerability Assessment Toward Disaster Risk Reduction: Insight from Pakistan                                                                                                                          | Globally, climate-related disasters (CRDs) have become a common phenomenon in the last few decades, increasing vulnerability and causing disaster mortality. To manage disaster risk, the global Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction (SFDRR) provides a solid action plan for disaster risk reduction (DRR) considering all the dimensions of vulnerability. However, countries are still less receptive at the local level to adopting the SFDRR. Also, the global research community did not explore vulnerability features based on the Sendai Framework nor integrated such features with the four priorities of SFDRR. Based on the case of Pakistan, this study seeks to bridge the gap through three objectives. The first objective of the study is to identify the vulnerability features cited in the SFDRR. In addition, the research aims to develop a new vulnerability model by integrating SFDRR's four priorities. As a second objective, it is intended to develop a decision support framework for ranking and evaluating each of the SFDRR priority action areas under local conditions. A third objective is to assess the impact of climate-induced environmental, socioeconomic and political vulnerabilities on climate-driven mortality. To meet these three different objectives, the authors have adopted a multi-method approach by using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and binary logistic regression method (BLRM). Based on the assessment, the authors suggested some policy implications. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |
| Climate-Related Vulnerability Assessment Toward Disaster Risk Reduction: Insight from Pakistan                                                                                                                          | Globally, climate-related disasters (CRDs) have become a common phenomenon in the last few decades, increasing vulnerability and causing disaster mortality. To manage disaster risk, the global Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction (SFDRR) provides a solid action plan for disaster risk reduction (DRR) considering all the dimensions of vulnerability. However, countries are still less receptive at the local level to adopting the SFDRR. Also, the global research community did not explore vulnerability features based on the Sendai Framework nor integrated such features with the four priorities of SFDRR. Based on the case of Pakistan, this study seeks to bridge the gap through three objectives. The first objective of the study is to identify the vulnerability features cited in the SFDRR. In addition, the research aims to develop a new vulnerability model by integrating SFDRR's four priorities. As a second objective, it is intended to develop a decision support framework for ranking and evaluating each of the SFDRR priority action areas under local conditions. A third objective is to assess the impact of climate-induced environmental, socioeconomic and political vulnerabilities on climate-driven mortality. To meet these three different objectives, the authors have adopted a multi-method approach by using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and binary logistic regression method (BLRM).

| Circular economy in construction - findings from a literature review                                                                                                                                                    | The paper aims to enable a comprehensive definition for a Circular Economy (CE) that will support its effective introduction in the building and construction sectors. According to the European Commission (EC), the building sector in 2020 accounted for 40 % of the primary energy demand in the European Union (EU) and 37 % of its greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the sector can play a crucial role in decarbonisation and hence in achieving a zero-emissions future in response to climate change. A CE aims to harmonise economic growth with environmental protection and is based on the concept of closing the loop with minimal practical waste as in a natural ecosystem. The adoption of CE concepts is therefore seen as a feasible response to climate change through the deployment of more sustainable construction processes that significantly reduce the need for natural resources by maximising recycling and reuse. However, and despite the recognition of the potential of a CE in relation to sustainability issues, the adoption of a CE model within building and construction sectors is challenging because of the wide range of aspects and priorities which are reflected in the diversity of definition resulting in a narrow and limited adoption. There are currently many definitions of CEs as related to building and construction in the literature, creating confusion and preventing effective implementation. The study presented here intends, using a comprehensive literature review as its basis, to define the key domains of a CE on which to align a concise and accurate definition that will enable effective application in the building and construction sectors. The research also aims to identify current research gaps and barriers to contribute to the future of CE research in the building sector and thus drive the implementation of CE projects to mitigate the effects of climate change and support the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by laying the foundations for a novel and forward-looking approach to circularity based on properly established, defined and understood principles of CEs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Not About Sufficiency | Nutrition        |

The research also aims to identify current research gaps and barriers to contribute to the future of CE research in the building sector and thus drive the implementation of CE projects to mitigate the effects of climate change and support the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by laying the foundations for a novel and forward-looking approach to circularity based on properly established, defined and understood principles of CEs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | About Sufficiency     | Buildings        |
| Chronological Transition of Relationship between Intracity Lifecycle Transport Energy Efficiency and Population Density                                                                                                 | Interests in evaluating lifecycle energy use in urban transport have been growing as a research topic. Various studies have evaluated the relationship between the intracity transport energy use and population density and commonly identified its negative correlation. However, a diachronic transition in an individual city has yet to be fully analyzed. As such, this study employed transport energy intensity widely used for evaluating transport energy efficiency and obtained the transport energy intensity for each transportation means including walk, bicycle, automobile (conventional vehicles, electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles), bus and electric train by considering the lifecycle energy consumption. Then, the intracity lifecycle transport energy intensity of 38 cities in Japan in 1987-2015 was computed, assuming that the cause of diachronic transition of intracity transport energy efficiency is the modal shifting and electricity mix change. As a result, the greater level of population density was associated with the lower intracity transport energy intensity in Japanese cities. The negative slope of its regression line increased over time since the intracity lifecycle transport energy intensity in cities with low population density continuously increased without any significant change of population density. Finally, this study discussed the strategic implications particularly in regional areas to improve the intracity lifecycle transport energy efficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Children's mode choice for trips to primary school: a case study in German suburbia                                                                                                                                     | Research on children's school travel behaviour has grown tremendously in the past decade, although Germany has remained amazingly silent. At the same time the interplay between various factors that affect child travel is not yet fully understood. The paper reports results from a survey in the medium-sized suburban town of Linen, Germany. Mode choice of children to and from primary school is studied using multinomial logistic regression. The models include a large variety of variables that capture child and household sociodemographics, parents' mode use, trip distance, parental concerns, attitudes and perceptions, and the built and transport environment. Some of our results confirm previous studies (e.g. on the role of age, gender, and trip distance), while others differ. For instance, we found no effects of household socioeconomic status or of the social environment on mode choice. Concerning the role of the transport environment, we want to highlight two findings. Firstly, narrow pavements along the route increase the odds of being driven rather than walking. Secondly, traffic calming is associated with higher odds of cycling against walking. Parental attitudes and concerns also play a significant role in child mode choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| Children's mode choice for trips to primary school: a case study in German suburbia                                                                                                                                     | Research on children's school travel behaviour has grown tremendously in the past decade, although Germany has remained amazingly silent. At the same time the interplay between various factors that affect child travel is not yet fully understood. The paper reports results from a survey in the medium-sized suburban town of Lünen, Germany. Mode choice of children to and from primary school is studied using multinomial logistic regression. The models include a large variety of variables that capture child and household sociodemographics, parents' mode use, trip distance, parental concerns, attitudes and perceptions, and the built and transport environment. Some of our results confirm previous studies (e.g. on the role of age, gender, and trip distance), while others differ. For instance, we found no effects of household socioeconomic status or of the social environment on mode choice. Concerning the role of the transport environment, we want to highlight two findings. Firstly, narrow pavements along the route increase the odds of being driven rather than walking. Secondly, traffic calming is associated with higher odds of cycling against walking. Parental attitudes and concerns also play a significant role in child mode choice. © 2018 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

However, these are often fragmented or somewhat disconnected interventions that leave out vulnerable and subaltern groups like children, being also commonly based on strictly formatted designs, with more urban furniture than natural elements. In view of the need to make urban spaces healthier, safer, more resilient, and at the same time more child-friendly, in this Conceptual Analysis paper we build from the literature on Urban Green Spaces, Child-Friendly Cities and environments, and Children's Infrastructure to propose the concept of Children Green Infrastructure (CGI), and discuss its application to urban planning, foregrounding the need for fairer, more inclusive and participatory approaches. GGI derives from the Children Infrastructure concept but it puts at the center of the debate the idea of connecting children to nature where they live, learn and play. CGI is based on the assumption that nature should be transversal in urban planning processes, and that it must be perfectly integrated within urban infrastructures, ensuring access to all. Understanding children's needs and integrating their voices in urban planning and design processes are necessary conditions to moving forward to a fairer, more inclusive and truly collective urban project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

| Carbon footprint effects of shifting from flights to night trains for Swedish tourism                                                                                                                                   | Changes in travel behaviour are needed to tackle the climate impact associated with long-distance flights, including a switch to sustainable transport modes. In this paper, we analyse scenarios of carbon footprint reduction associated with a switch from flights to night trains for holidays in Europe for the case of Sweden, including outbound, inbound and domestic tourism. We use a prospective lifecycle assessment framework combined with results from a stated preference experiment to determine the impact of future mode shift behaviours. Our results indicate that a mode shift could be triggered by progressive night train policies resulting in (i) fewer transfers and (ii) price levels similar to those of flights. The shifts from flights to night trains could result in 9% lower cumulative carbon footprint in relation to a baseline travel demand scenario for the period 2025–2050. Decarbonization of long-distance travel in line with the Paris Agreement would likely require a combination of many different types of measures including a shift to low-carbon fuels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Not About Sufficiency | Digitalisation   |

| Car ownership after having children: Exploring the impacts of income and public transport accessibility                                                                                                                 | Mobility research and theory suggests that new parents often develop a car-dependent way of living that runs counter to prevailing climate policies. In this context, the current study investigates the influence of public transport accessibility on car ownership among first-time parents in the Oslo region. Specific attention is paid to how the effect of accessibility varies with different income levels. Linear probability and fixed-effects models are applied to parents and a control group of non-parents to explore these relationships. The results show that public transport accessibility reduces the likelihood of car ownership in the years after family formation, although with larger impacts for some income groups than for others. Households with a high income combine car ownership with high access, whereas others seem to sacrifice one for the other. These findings have several policy implications. First, urban regions with a combination of gentrification in the central city and increasing poverty in suburban areas face a potential conflict between environmental and social sustainability. Finding ways to increase central-city opportunities for low- and medium-income families is a difficult but important step towards greater overall sustainability. Second, the reduction of car ownership among high-income households appears to require supplementary measures. The article ends with a discussion of the findings in the context of broader urban policy development, particularly in relation to the prioritisation of collective consumption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| Car ownership after having children: Exploring the impacts of income and public transport accessibility                                                                                                                 | Mobility research and theory suggests that new parents often develop a car-dependent way of living that runs counter to prevailing climate policies. In this context, the current study investigates the influence of public transport accessibility on car ownership among first-time parents in the Oslo region. Specific attention is paid to how the effect of accessibility varies with different income levels. Linear probability and fixed-effects models are applied to parents and a control group of non-parents to explore these relationships. The results show that public transport accessibility reduces the likelihood of car ownership in the years after family formation, although with larger impacts for some income groups than for others. Households with a high income combine car ownership with high access, whereas others seem to sacrifice one for the other. These findings have several policy implications. First, urban regions with a combination of gentrification in the central city and increasing poverty in suburban areas face a potential conflict between environmental and social sustainability. Finding ways to increase central-city opportunities for low- and medium-income families is a difficult but important step towards greater overall sustainability. Second, the reduction of car ownership among high-income households appears to require supplementary measures.

| Can systemic governance of smart cities catalyse urban sustainability?                                                                                                                                                  | Smart cities are rapidly gaining momentum around the world as new opportunities to shift towards a sustainable urban future. Despite their promising solutions, there is so far little evidence on how smart city initiatives can achieve urban sustainability. This study explores the impact of smartness on urban sustainability by introducing the concept of smart complementarity and investigating whether the systemic governance of smart complementarities has a positive impact on sustainability. To this end, we employ a panel vector autoregression model with panel data for 26 smart cities from 2009 to 2019 to test the complex dynamic relationships between smart city drivers and dimensions of sustainability. Such analysis seems crucial for smart city governance and whether the vision of a smart agenda is compatible with urban sustainability. The findings suggest that while smart city initiatives have improved economic sustainability, they have compromised environmental and social sustainability. This points to the need for a coordinated approach to address the complexity of urban systems and sustainability challenges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

This points to the need for a coordinated approach to address the complexity of urban systems and sustainability challenges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |
| COP28 roadmap: Do ICT, education, and renewable energy consumption matter for environmental quality? Quantile evidence for emerging economies                                                                           | Renewable energy consumption (REC) is not the only potent tool that can ameliorate the difficulties associated with rising CO2 emissions and ecological distortions. Besides, the role of ICT penetration and education on environmental quality cannot be overshadowed by their contributions to economic growth and improved human well-being. This study scrutinizes the effects of ICT, education, and REC on the ecological footprint (EF) and CO2 emissions in the IMF-selected emerging economies. The study utilizes three variables for the ICT index, computed through principal component analysis. The augmented mean group estimator results suggest that ICT, education, and REC reduce the EF, whereas FDI contributes significantly to environmental degradation. On the flip side, ICT reduces CO2 emissions and EF in both the medium and upper quantiles. It suggests that ICT penetration heals the environment and that a higher level of ICT consumption could be a panacea for sustainable development in emerging economies. The causality results show evidence of a feedback causality between economic growth, REC, and CO2 emissions. However, a unidirectional causality flows from economic growth and FDI to EF. Finally, to maximize the benefits associated with the positive effects of REC and ICT on environmental betterment, several renewable energy and ICT policies have been mentioned and discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

| Building communities to promote physical activity: A multi-scale geographical analysis                                                                                                                                  | The objective of this paper is to make explicit the linkages between specific characteristics in the urban built environment, moderate physical activity (in particular walking and cycling), and public health.

| Bioenergy and bioexergy analyses with artificial intelligence application on combustion of recycled hardwood and softwood wastes                                                                                        | Novel biomass bioenergy-bioexergy analyses via thermogravimetry analysis and artificial intelligence are employed to evaluate the three biofuels from wood wastes (softwood-SW, hardwood-HW, and woods blend-WB). The chemical characterization of SW has the highest bioenergy (higher heating value - HHV: 18.84 MJ kg(- 1)) and bioexergy (specific chemical bioexergy - SCB: 19.65 MJ kg(- 1)) with the SCB/HHV ratio of wood waste as about 1.043-1.046. The high C-element has a significant influence on the HHV-SCB. The three distinct zones of wood waste combustion are identified: moisture evaporation (Zone I, up to 110 degrees C), combustion reaction - degradation of three major lignocellulosic components (hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin) at Zone II, 110-600 degrees C, and ash remains (Zone III, 600-800 degrees C). The ignition (D-ig = 0.01-0.04) and fuel reactivity (R-fuel = 3.82-6.97 %center dot min(- 1)center dot degrees C- 1) indexes are evaluated. The comprehensive combustion index (S-n:>5 x 10(-7)%(2) min(- 2 )degrees C- 3) suggests that wood waste has a better combustion performance than bituminous coal. The statistical evaluation presents that the highest HHV-SCB values are obtained by performing combustion for SW-250 mu m at 15 degrees C center dot min(- 1). The S/ N ratio and ANOVA results agree that the wood waste type and particle size denote the most influential parameters. The artificial neural network prediction shows an excellent result (R-2 = 1) with 1 hidden layer and 5 neuron configurations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not About Sufficiency | Nutrition        |
| Bioenergy and bioexergy analyses with artificial intelligence application on combustion of recycled hardwood and softwood wastes                                                                                        | Novel biomass bioenergy-bioexergy analyses via thermogravimetry analysis and artificial intelligence are employed to evaluate the three biofuels from wood wastes (softwood-SW, hardwood-HW, and woods blend-WB). The chemical characterization of SW has the highest bioenergy (higher heating value – HHV: 18.84 MJ kg−1) and bioexergy (specific chemical bioexergy – SCB: 19.65 MJ kg−1) with the SCB/HHV ratio of wood waste as about 1.043–1.046. The high C-element has a significant influence on the HHV-SCB. The three distinct zones of wood waste combustion are identified: moisture evaporation (Zone I, up to 110 °C), combustion reaction – degradation of three major lignocellulosic components (hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin) at Zone II, 110–600 °C, and ash remains (Zone III, 600–800 °C). The ignition (Dig = 0.01–0.04) and fuel reactivity (Rfuel = 3.82–6.97 %·min−1·°C−1) indexes are evaluated. The comprehensive combustion index (Sn:>5 × 10−7%2 min−2 °C−3) suggests that wood waste has a better combustion performance than bituminous coal. The statistical evaluation presents that the highest HHV-SCB values are obtained by performing combustion for SW-250 μm at 15 °C·min−1. The S/N ratio and ANOVA results agree that the wood waste type and particle size denote the most influential parameters. The artificial neural network prediction shows an excellent result (R2 = 1) with 1 hidden layer and 5 neuron configurations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | About Sufficiency     | Digitalisation   |

The built environment has been recognised as a major contributor to loss of biodiversity and should therefore play a major role in a sustainable world where ecological values are enhanced. There should be a smooth interaction between the built environment and the natural environment because humanity and nature are the usual victims of loss of biodiversity. The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between the Built Environment, Biodiversity and the Sustainable Development Goals. The paper explores the role of a sustainable built environment towards biodiversity conservation which is central to the realisation of the SDGs in general and SDG 15 in particular. The paper adopts a qualitative research methodology using knowledge generation workshop involving 16 experts from both academia and industry. The results show that, even though the built environment has a negative impact on biodiversity, it also has the greatest opportunity to integrate biodiversity into all development projects. Reducing the impact of the built environment on biodiversity should be an integral part of policies and strategies towards a sustainable built environment. All key built environment stakeholders need to engage in raising awareness of the effects of biodiversity loss as a result of construction activities, on the health and wellbeing of mankind. The value of this paper is to help decision-makers such as government agencies, industry players and non-governmental organisations to understand the contributions of the built environment towards biodiversity conservation in achieving the SDGs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

The value of this paper is to help decision-makers such as government agencies, industry-players and non-governmental organisations to understand the contributions of the built environment towards biodiversity conservation in achieving the SDGs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Ecology    |

However, scientific and economic technicalities may limit the ability of biochar to consistently deliver on these expectations. Past research has demonstrated that biochar is part of the black carbon continuum with variable properties due to the net result of production (e.g., feedstock and pyrolysis conditions) and postproduction factors (storage or activation). Therefore, biochar is not a single entity but rather spans a wide range of black carbon forms. Biochar is black carbon, but not all black carbon is biochar. Agronomic benefits arising from biochar additions to degraded soils have been emphasized, but negligible and negative agronomic effects have also been reported. Fifty percent of the reviewed studies reported yield increases after black carbon or biochar additions, with the remainder of the studies reporting alarming decreases to no significant differences. Hardwood biochar (black carbon) produced by traditional methods (kilns or soil pits) possessed the most consistent yield increases when added to soils. The universality of this conclusion requires further evaluation due to the highly skewed feedstock preferences within existing studies. With global population expanding while the amount of arable land remains limited, restoring soil quality to nonproductive soils could be key to meeting future global food production, food security, and energy supplies; biochar may play a role in this endeavor. Biochar economics are often marginally viable and are tightly tied to the assumed duration of agronomic benefits. Further research is needed to determine the conditions under which biochar can provide economic and agronomic benefits and to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for these benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |

| Beyond Traditional TOD: Integrating Multiuse Paths and Bike Share into Public Transit to Address the First/Last Mile Issue                                                                                              | Transit-oriented development (TOD) has been promoted worldwide as an integrated land-use and transportation strategy to foster urban sustainability. Bike share provides people with a convenient and relatively affordable way to enlarge the spatial scale of TODs across urban communities, as a solution to the first/last mile (FLM) issue with respect to the transit nodes of TODs. Even though barriers to FLM have been frequently studied, few studies incorporate people's perceptions of their barriers and/or the integration of multiuse paths (MUPs) into the network of bike share and public transit. Using a survey conducted in the Greater Cincinnati area, Ohio, this study aimed to answer the following questions: (1) What are people's major barriers to integrating different green transportation modes and/or facilities (bike share, MUPs, public transit)? (2) To what extent does the built environment around people's residential location affect their integration level of MUPs, bike share, and public transit? (3) Which improvements would most likely encourage people to integrate them more often? With descriptive statistics, spatial analysis, and statistical comparison, we found that (1) the major barrier to integrating MUPs into the green transportation system was their lack of connection and availability to transit and bike share; (2) a person's living environment is spatially related to whether a person integrates bike share; and (3) more respondents would use MUPs more often if an integrated green transportation system could be provided or improved. These findings suggest the potential of incorporating MUPs and bike share into TOD strategies to address the FLM issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| Beyond Traditional TOD: Integrating Multiuse Paths and Bike Share into Public Transit to Address the First/Last Mile Issue                                                                                              | Transit-oriented development (TOD) has been promoted worldwide as an integrated land-use and transportation strategy to foster urban sustainability. Bike share provides people with a convenient and relatively affordable way to enlarge the spatial scale of TODs across urban communities, as a solution to the first/last mile (FLM) issue with respect to the transit nodes of TODs. Even though barriers to FLM have been frequently studied, few studies incorporate people’s perceptions of their barriers and/or the integration of multiuse paths (MUPs) into the network of bike share and public transit. Using a survey conducted in the Greater Cincinnati area, Ohio, this study aimed to answer the following questions: (1) What are people's major barriers to integrating different green transportation modes and/or facilities (bike share, MUPs, public transit)? (2) To what extent does the built environment around people’s residential location affect their integration level of MUPs, bike share, and public transit? (3) Which improvements would most likely encourage people to integrate them more often? With descriptive statistics, spatial analysis, and statistical comparison, we found that (1) the major barrier to integrating MUPs into the green transportation system was their lack of connection and availability to transit and bike share; (2) a person’s living environment is spatially related to whether a person integrates bike share; and (3) more respondents would use MUPs more often if an integrated green transportation system could be provided or improved. These findings suggest the potential of incorporating MUPs and bike share into TOD strategies to address the FLM issue. © 2022, The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| Associations of the objective built environment along the route to school with children's modes of commuting: A multilevel modelling analysis (the SLIC study)                                                          | As active commuting levels continue to decline among primary schoolchildren, evidence about which built environmental characteristics influence walking or cycling to school remains inconclusive and is strongly context-dependent. This study aimed to identify the objective built environmental drivers of, and barriers to, active commuting to school for a multi-ethnic sample of 1,889 healthy primary schoolchildren (aged 5-11) in London, UK. Using cross-sectional multilevel ordered logistic regression modelling, supported by the spatial exploration of built environmental characteristics through cartography, the objective built environment was shown to be strongly implicated in children's commuting behaviour. In line with earlier research, proximity to school emerged as the prime variable associated with the choice for active commuting. However, other elements of the urban form were also significantly associated with children's use of active or passive modes of transport. High levels of accidents, crime and air pollution along the route to school were independently correlated with a lower likelihood of children walking or cycling to school. Higher average and minimum walkability and higher average densities of convenience stores along the way were independently linked to higher odds of active commuting. The significance of the relations for crime, air pollution and walkability disappeared in the fully-adjusted model including all built environmental variables. In contrast, relationships with proximity, traffic danger and the food environment were maintained in this comprehensive model. Black children, pupils with obesity, younger participants and those from high socioeconomic families were less likely to actively commute to school. There is thus a particular need to ensure that roads with high volumes of actively commuting children are kept safe and clean, and children's exposure to unhealthy food options along the way is limited. Moreover, as short commuting distances are strongly correlated with walking or cycling, providing high-quality education near residential areas might incite active transport to school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Associations of built environments with spatiotemporal patterns of shared scooter use: A comparison with shared bike use                                                                                                | This article presents a comparative study aimed at clarifying the similarities and differences between scooter sharing service (SSS) and bike sharing service (BSS) uses in terms of the link between built environments and spatiotemporal patterns. The data comprise study observations from the rental records of SSS and BSS in Taipei, Taiwan. These data were analyzed using spectral clustering method and logit models. The comparison results between SSS and BSS suggest that motorized vehicle usage and high usage cost result in SSS uses revealing long travel distances and different associations of built environments with spatiotemporal patterns from BSS uses. The distance-to-transit variables are related to the spatiotemporal patterns of BSS uses but are unrelated to those of SSS. The difference indicates that existing knowledge on BSS is partially inapplicable to SSS and provides valuable information for transport planners in developing cooperation plans among different transport systems in a city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| Assessment of the Impact of Road Transport Change on the Security of the Urban Social Environment                                                                                                                       | In the context of accelerating urbanisation, cities must ensure a viable economy, social well-being, and a healthy environment. Transport is one of the key conditions for economic development and meeting the needs of countries, regions, and cities. However, transport must meet not only the physiological but also the social needs of society, one of which is environmental security. Urban transport accounts for around 40% of CO2 emissions and 70% of other pollutants from road transport. Thus, one of the most difficult issues for any city to address when building bypasses is the growing number of cars in the city, traffic congestion, and the reduction of all greenhouse gas emissions. The documents adopted in July 2020 aim to revitalise the EU's economy by moving towards a green economy and sustainability. In addition to the systematic and comparative analysis of concepts published in the scientific literature, the article also presents an analysis of the concepts of the sustainable city and sustainable transport, as well as a study of the social impact of bypasses and the assessment of the security of the social environment in the Baltic capitals. The aim of the article is to assess the impact of the growing number of vehicles on the security of the city's social environment. Research results show that the number of pollutants and a direct dependence between the number of pollutants and the driving speed were established. Therefore, it needs to make investments in the transport sector: improving roads, the construction of bypasses, and the technical parameters of purchased cars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |
| Assessment of the Impact of Road Transport Change on the Security of the Urban Social Environment                                                                                                                       | In the context of accelerating urbanisation, cities must ensure a viable economy, social well-being, and a healthy environment. Transport is one of the key conditions for economic development and meeting the needs of countries, regions, and cities. However, transport must meet not only the physiological but also the social needs of society, one of which is environmental security. Urban transport accounts for around 40% of CO2 emissions and 70% of other pollutants from road transport. Thus, one of the most difficult issues for any city to address when building bypasses is the growing number of cars in the city, traffic congestion, and the reduction of all greenhouse gas emissions. The documents adopted in July 2020 aim to revitalise the EU’s economy by moving towards a green economy and sustainability. In addition to the systematic and comparative analysis of concepts published in the scientific literature, the article also presents an analysis of the concepts of the sustainable city and sustainable transport, as well as a study of the social impact of bypasses and the assessment of the security of the social environment in the Baltic capitals. The aim of the article is to assess the impact of the growing number of vehicles on the security of the city’s social environment. Research results show that the number of pollutants and a direct dependence between the number of pollutants and the driving speed were established. Therefore, it needs to make investments in the transport sector: improving roads, the construction of bypasses, and the technical parameters of purchased cars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |

Housing search mismatches: evidence from Greater Manchester in the UK                                                                                                                | PurposeWith access to the large-scale search data from Rightmove plc, the paper firstly indicated the possibility of using user-generated data from online property portals to predict housing market activities and secondly embraced a GIS approach to explore what people search for housing and what they chose and investigated the issue of mismatch between search patterns and revealed patterns. Based on the analysis, the paper contributes a visual GIS-based approach which may help planners and designers to make more informed decisions related to new housing supply, particularly where to build, what to build and how many to build.Design/methodology/approachThe paper used the 2013 housing search data from Rightmove and the 2013 price data from Land Registry with transactions made after the search period and embraced a GIS approach to explore the potential housing demand patterns and the mismatch between searches and sales. In the analysis, the paper employed the K-means approach to group prices into five levels and used GIS software to draw maps based on these price levels. The paper also employed a simple analysis of linear regression based on the coefficient of determination to investigate the relationship between online property views and values of house sales.FindingsThe result indicated the strong relationship between online property views and the values of house sales, implying the possibility of using search data from online property portals to predict housing market activities. It then explore the spatial housing demand patterns based on searches and showed a mismatch between the spatial patterns of housing search and actual moves across submarkets. The findings may not be very surprising but the main objective of the paper is to open up a potentially useful methodological approach which could be extended in future research.Research limitations/implicationsIt is important to identify search patterns from people who search with the intention to buy houses and from people who search with no intention to purchase properties. Rightmove data do not adequately represent housing search activity, and therefore more attention should be paid to this issue. The analysis of housing search helps us have a better understanding of households' preferences to better estimate housing demand and develop search-based prediction models. It also helps us identify spatial and structural submarkets and examine the mismatches between current housing stock and housing demand in submarkets.Social implicationsThe GIS approach in this paper may help planners and designers better allocate land resources for new housing supply based on households' spatial and structural preferences by identifying high and low demand areas with high searches relative to low housing stocks. Furthermore, the analysis of housing search patterns helps identify areas with latent demand, and when combined with the analysis of transaction patterns, it is possible to realise the areas with a lack of housing supply relative to excess demand or a lack of latent demand relative to the housing stock.Originality/valueThe paper proves the usefulness of a GIS approach to investigate households' preferences and aspirations through search data from online property portals. The contribution of the paper is the visual GIS-based approach, and based on this approach the paper fills the international knowledge gap in exploring effective approaches to analysing user-generated search data and market outcome data in combination. | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

| Analyzing walking route choice through built environments using random forests and discrete choice techniques                                                                                                           | Walking is a form of active transportation with numerous benefits, including better health outcomes, lower environmental impacts and stronger communities. Understanding built environmental associations with walking behavior is a key step towards identifying design features that support walking. Human mobility data available through GPS receivers and cell phones, combined with high resolution walkability data, provide a rich source of georeferenced data for analyzing environmental associations with walking behavior. However, traditional techniques such as route choice models have difficulty with highly dimensioned data. This paper develops a novel combination of a data-driven technique with route choice modeling for leveraging walkability audits. Using data from a study in Salt Lake City, UT, USA, we apply the data-driven technique of random forests to select variables for use in walking route choice models. We estimate data-driven route choice models and theory-driven models based on predefined walkability dimensions. Results indicate that the random forest technique selects variables that dramatically improve goodness of fit of walking route choice models relative to models based on predefined walkability dimensions. We compare the theory-driven and data-driven walking route choice models based on interpretability and policy relevance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

We compare the theory-driven and data-driven walking route choice models based on interpretability and policy relevance. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| An eco-efficiency-based urban sustainability assessment method and its application                                                                                                                                      | It is of critical importance to develop appropriate assessment tools with which to comprehensively measure the sustainability status of a region in order to guide its transformation to sustainable development. This paper proposes a novel method of sustainability assessment based on urban eco-efficiency, which calculates the ratios of welfare and ecological impact. This method can demonstrate the relative sustainability status of targeted regions for different time periods, and it implicitly considers comprehensive urban information including ecology, economy and society. By using the human development index (HDI) and ecological footprint (EF) as measures of urban welfare and ecological burden, we carried out a case study of Xiamen City during 2000-2006 using the proposed method. The results indicated that there is a fluctuation of eco-efficiency, which shows a steady increase then a sharp decline, with a marginal increase towards the end of the studied period. Overall, eco-efficiency, resource efficiency and environmental efficiency declined 0.155-, 0.157- and 0.153-times, respectively, during this period. This means that the increase of ecological consumption is faster than improvement of social welfare. As a result, urban sustainability declines, and its future increase depend on improvements of both resource and environment efficiency. Our method proved effective in analysing the relative sustainability status among targeted regions for different time periods, paving the way for practical applications, such as policy analysis, in pursuit of sustainable development. © 2010 Taylor and Francis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

| An analysis of the effects of suburban densification on vehicle use for shopping: Do existing residents respond to land-use changes in the same way as recent movers?                                                   | Studies examining the influence of smart growth and compact development on travel behavior often focus on a limited subgroup of the population: those who have recently moved from one neighborhood to another. Despite the substantial proportion of existing residents in the population, their responses to land-use changes have not been thoroughly studied. To address this gap in the literature, this study compares two groups of suburban residents in the Atlanta metropolitan area: a treatment group whose neighborhoods experienced increases in density, land-use mix, and street connectivity and a control group whose neighborhoods did not experience such land-use changes. After correcting for self-selection, this study reveals that residents in the treatment group who relocated to suburban neighborhoods before land-use changes drove more miles for household maintenance activities than their control group counterparts in other suburban neighborhoods. The same households, however, drove substantially less for subsistence activities (e.g., commutes to school and work), which more than compensates for the moderate increase in vehicle miles traveled for household maintenance. These findings suggest that increased residential density and land-use mix in older suburbs contributes to a reduction in automobile vehicle miles traveled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |
| An analysis of the effects of suburban densification on vehicle use for shopping: Do existing residents respond to land-use changes in the same way as recent movers?                                                   | Studies examining the influence of smart growth and compact development on travel behavior often focus on a limited subgroup of the population: those who have recently moved from one neighborhood to another. Despite the substantial proportion of existing residents in the population, their responses to land-use changes have not been thoroughly studied. To address this gap in the literature, this study compares two groups of suburban residents in the Atlanta metropolitan area: a treatment group whose neighborhoods experienced increases in density, land-use mix, and street connectivity and a control group whose neighborhoods did not experience such land-use changes. After correcting for self-selection, this study reveals that residents in the treatment group who relocated to suburban neighborhoods before land-use changes drove more miles for household maintenance activities than their control group counterparts in other suburban neighborhoods. The same households, however, drove substantially less for subsistence activities (e.g., commutes to school and work), which more than compensates for the moderate increase in vehicle miles traveled for household maintenance. These findings suggest that increased residential density and land-use mix in older suburbs contributes to a reduction in automobile vehicle miles traveled. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

Increasing urbanization problems including population growth, urban sprawl, land use change, unemployment, and environmental degradation, have markedly impacted urban residents. Quality of Life (QOL). Therefore, urban sustainability and its measurement have gained increasing attention from administrators, urban planners, and scientific communities throughout the world with respect to improving urban development and human well-being. The widely accepted definition of urban sustainability emphasizes the balancing development of three primary domains (urban economy, society, and environment). This article attempts to improve the aforementioned definition of urban sustainability by incorporating a human well-being dimension. Major problems identified in existing urban sustainability indicator (USI) models include a weak integration of potential indicators, poor measurement and quantification, and insufficient spatial-temporal analysis. To tackle these challenges an integrated USI model based on a hierarchical indices system was established for monitoring and evaluating urban sustainability. This model can be performed by quantifying indicators using both traditional statistical approaches and advanced geomatic techniques based on satellite imagery and census data, which aims to provide a theoretical basis for a comprehensive assessment of urban sustainability from a spatial-temporal perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

This model can be performed by quantifying indicators using both traditional statistical approaches and advanced geomatic techniques based on satellite imagery and census data, which aims to provide a theoretical basis for a comprehensive assessment of urban sustainability from a spatial-temporal perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | About Sufficiency     | Urban_Infra      |
| An Examination of the Land Use Determinants of Travel: A Case Study of Calicut City in India                                                                                                                            | Several travel studies focus mainly on mode shifting. Again, most travel studies have focused on mandatory trips. But the influence of land use on travel is rarely verified in all these studies. This paper examines the influence of land use measures on travel in a medium-sized city, India. The travel characteristics like number of trips, person-km and person-hr of travel by various modes and for various purposes are analysed separately. Land use is characterised by population density, employment density, land use intensity, land use mix and accessibility. During the modelling process, the explanatory variables are subjected to transformation to get over the nonlinearity issue. Statistical analysis reveals that a balanced mix of various land use activities causes people to travel less by any mode and for any purpose. Such studies can help the city planners formulate effective transport policies to improve the quality of transport within the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

The research focuses on the importance of any site's given criteria; mainly its slope and topography on the delivery of sustainable buildings. Amman city consists broadly of two main types of buildings; apartment buildings and villas, by studying each type of building with regard to its environmental context on a given site in the city; the research seeks to identify the sustainable variables that site topography delimit or facilitate, using a set of attributes for each building type. The main objective of this research is to highlight the sustainable approach for building on sloped sites throughout the building project life-cycle in general, and to set a sustainability framework for designers during the initial design phase in particular. A number of case studies for both types of buildings are studied and analysed, and conclusions are given based on syntheses of available data from literature review or case analysis. At the end, the research provides a mechanism for the development of guidelines for sustainable and passive viability on preferred buildings orientation in hilly areas with regard to local climatic data..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

This qualitative study aimed to explore factors that influence personal decisions to initiate and maintain cycling, or not to cycle, in inner Sydney, and to identify differences according to current cycling behaviour. Three types of riders were identified and 70 participants (24 males and 46 females) recruited. Of these, 22 were classified as non-riders, 23 were occasional riders and 25 were regular riders. Twelve focus groups were held in inner Sydney during October and November 2005 and explored perceptions of cycling, specific barriers and enablers for recreational and commuter cycling, as well as environmental and socio-cultural influences. Data were audiotaped, transcribed and thematically analysed using the 'template analysis' technique. Personal factors and the built environment had greater influence for occasional and non-riders, while on-road infrastructure and socio-political issues were more significant for regular riders. Major themes centred on safety concerns due to a lack of cycling infrastructure and low recognition and respect of cyclists' needs by other road and path users. Political will and leadership are required to support programs that legitimise cycling as an essential form of transport that deserves infrastructure, investment and promotion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

Political will and leadership are required to support programs that legitimise cycling as an essential form of transport that deserves infrastructure, investment and promotion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

| A tour-based mode choice model accommodating the influence of attitudes, perceptions, and inter- and intra-household interactions                                                                                       | The paper examines the influences of attitude and perceptions on mode choice decisions while accounting for household interactions. A nested ICLVmodel is estimated, incorporating six types of tour typology at the upper level, and the lower level considers four modes (active, PT, MTW, and car) under each tour type. The formulation of tour typologies, consist of a combination of activity types (maintenance, discretionary, and a mix of both these activities) and 'with-whom' travel arrangements (household members and non-household members), is an important contribution of the study. Three latent constructs-green lifestyle, perceived residential neighborhood, and safety consciousness-extracted from 10 measurement items are integrated into the nested framework to account for the taste heterogeneity arising from variations in the perceptions and attitudes of decision-makers. This model is estimated at the household level by considering the activity-travel diary data of Bhubaneswar city, comprising 858 households, 1454 adult individuals, and 2214 joint tours. The tour typologies reveal that intra-household interactions are more pronounced than inter-household interactions involving non-family members. The results from the structural model of the ICLV framework indicate that household socio-demographics and built environment variables significantly influence the attitudes and perceptions of adult household members. With the inclusion of latent factors in the nested ICLV model estimation, a substantial part of the intrinsic taste (or distaste) variability was captured that was previously ascribed to alternative specific constants. Additionally, the study contributed to the literature by deriving distinct values of travel time savings for PT ((sic)19.978/hr.), MTW ((sic)30.687/hr.), and car ((sic)39.635/hr.) for different tour typologies. A sensitivity analysis of selected control variables is carried out, and policy interventions from a broad viewpoint are also discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

The formulation of tour typologies, consist of a combination of activity types (maintenance, discretionary, and a mix of both these activities) and ‘with-whom’ travel arrangements (household members and non-household members), is an important contribution of the study. Three latent constructs—green lifestyle, perceived residential neighborhood, and safety consciousness—extracted from 10 measurement items are integrated into the nested framework to account for the taste heterogeneity arising from variations in the perceptions and attitudes of decision-makers. This model is estimated at the household level by considering the activity-travel diary data of Bhubaneswar city, comprising 858 households, 1454 adult individuals, and 2214 joint tours. The tour typologies reveal that intra-household interactions are more pronounced than inter-household interactions involving non-family members. The results from the structural model of the ICLV framework indicate that household socio-demographics and built environment variables significantly influence the attitudes and perceptions of adult household members. With the inclusion of latent factors in the nested ICLV model estimation, a substantial part of the intrinsic taste (or distaste) variability was captured that was previously ascribed to alternative specific constants. Additionally, the study contributed to the literature by deriving distinct values of travel time savings for PT (₹19.978/hr.), MTW (₹30.687/hr.), and car (₹39.635/hr.) for different tour typologies. A sensitivity analysis of selected control variables is carried out, and policy interventions from a broad viewpoint are also discussed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

The focus was on one Carpathian mountain village in which a Bergitka Roma settlement has existed for more than 80 years. A brand-new apartment house for the local Roma minority partly replaced the earlier settlement in a village populated by Gorale, a highlander group that is the local majority. At present about 70 Roma live in the new building. The ethnographic material was obtained during fieldwork carried out in 1994-2017. Herein the authors reconstruct the most significant moments in this investment from different points of view: the Roma and non-Roma neighbors. Each side interprets the fact in its own, rather paradoxical manner; each side has learned different new things in the process. The ambitious housing policy undoubtedly led to improvement of the Roma standard of living; it did not, however, increase the extent of their integration. The natural geology as well as manmade elements (e.g. a fence and a bridge) create and maintain boundaries. Nevertheless, analysis of the broader social context is decidedly more crucial than an analysis of facts. Ultimately, the sense of such publicly funded housing projects needs to be scrutinized from the diverse perspectives within the local community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| A perspective on education's importance for urban development                                                                                                                                                           | The 21(st) century has been called the age of the city'. The concentration of human activity is what makes cities such an important space of opportunity and challenge. This article views urban development challenges from an education perspective and argues that education must be viewed as an important intermediary for capitalising on the physical, intellectual and social capital available in cities. The distribution of educational opportunity within cities must be monitored to ensure that education plays a role in reducing and not exacerbating urban inequalities. Making sure that the city works for all requires improving how we plan cities and making urban planning processes more inclusive through knowledge-based participation. There needs to be more appreciation of education's role in transformative urban development and stronger advocacy by education stakeholders to gain a seat in the circles that wield the most power in the urban futures debates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |
| A perspective on education's importance for urban development                                                                                                                                                           | The 21st century has been called the ‘age of the city’. The concentration of human activity is what makes cities such an important space of opportunity and challenge. This article views urban development challenges from an education perspective and argues that education must be viewed as an important intermediary for capitalising on the physical, intellectual and social capital available in cities. The distribution of educational opportunity within cities must be monitored to ensure that education plays a role in reducing and not exacerbating urban inequalities. Making sure that the city works for all requires improving how we plan cities and making urban planning processes more inclusive through knowledge-based participation. There needs to be more appreciation of education's role in transformative urban development and stronger advocacy by education stakeholders to gain a seat in the circles that wield the most power in the urban futures debates. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| A multi-year, multi-scale analysis of urban sustainability                                                                                                                                                              | In an urban world human well-being and global sustainability are connected to cities and the way they function. However, the ability and political willingness of local authorities and urbanites to take action to significantly reduce urban negative biophysical impacts is limited. This manuscript presents the results of a research which aimed to examine the extent to which existing and potential measures within and outside urban boundaries can reduce the urban ecological footprint and advance urban sustainability. It focuses on the town of Ra'anana, Israel, as a case study examined over a decade. It identifies the contribution of different urban activities (e.g., transportation, food consumption etc.) and stakeholders (e.g., urban residents, municipality, the state etc.) to the changes of the urban footprint over time. It then examines the potential contributions of selected measures (e.g., plans, technology implementation, behavioral change, etc.) within and outside the town's boundaries to minimize the urban footprint. The research joins a small group of studies that have examined urban footprints over time and an even smaller number that tried to examine the potential footprint reductions from sustainability actions taken at different spatial scales. � 2016 Elsevier Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not About Sufficiency | mobility         |

However, the ability and political willingness of local authorities and urbanites to take action to significantly reduce urban negative biophysical impacts is limited. This manuscript presents the results of a research which aimed to examine the extent to which existing and potential measures within and outside urban boundaries can reduce the urban ecological footprint and advance urban sustainability. It focuses on the town of Ra'anana, Israel, as a case study examined over a decade. It identifies the contribution of different urban activities (e.g., transportation, food consumption etc.) and stakeholders (e.g., urban residents, municipality, the state etc.) to the changes of the urban footprint over time. It then examines the potential contributions of selected measures (e.g., plans, technology implementation, behavioral change, etc.) within and outside the town's boundaries to minimize the urban footprint. The research joins a small group of studies that have examined urban footprints over time and an even smaller number that tried to examine the potential footprint reductions from sustainability actions taken at different spatial scales. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |

Using indicators designed to measure a 'safe and just' development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2-6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships. Strategies to improve physical and social provisioning systems, with a focus on sufficiency and equity, have the potential to move nations towards sustainability, but the challenge remains substantial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Infra      |

Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2-6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships. Strategies to improve physical and social provisioning systems, with a focus on sufficiency and equity, have the potential to move nations towards sustainability, but the challenge remains substantial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | About Sufficiency     | Nutrition        |

Quantitative evaluation of pedestrian-oriented urban objectives is important for various cities, and in this paper, a walkability evaluation system for the advanced model is developed considering the characteristics of a large city. The system calculates the walkability of Seoul. The evaluation system uses the Betweenness index as a weight in the urban network analysis.

| A bottom-up approach to map land covers as potential green infrastructure hubs for human well-being in rural settings: A case study from Sweden                                                                         | Green infrastructure (GI) policy encourages the spatial planning of natural and semi-natural areas to deliver biodiversity conservation and a wide range of ecosystem services (ES) important to human well-being. Much of the current literature relies on expert-led and top-down processes to investigate connections between landscapes' different land covers and ES. Little is known regarding the preferences of residents, and how they connect land covers with the delivery of ES important for their well-being. The aim of this study is to identify and locate such land cover types as GI that provide multiple ES important for human well-being in rural settings. First, we interviewed 400 urban and rural residents to identify ES important for personal well-being and the land covers that deliver multiple ES in three counties that best represent the existing rural-urban gradient in Sweden. Second, to support the inclusion of GI in spatial planning, we identified and located spatial concentrations of individual land covers providing multiple ES (GI hubs) and significant clusters of such land covers (GI hotspots). The majority of urban and rural respondents associated their well-being with lakes, mountains above the tree line, old-growth forests, wooded-pastures, mature pine forests and rural farmsteads. The areal proportion of each type of hub was low, on average 3.5%. At least three land management strategies are needed to sustain GI hubs: maintenance of the composition, structure and function of natural ecosystems in protected areas; support for traditional agroforestry and villages as social-ecological systems; and diversification of the current intensive forest management approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |
| A bottom-up approach to map land covers as potential green infrastructure hubs for human well-being in rural settings: A case study from Sweden                                                                         | Green infrastructure (GI) policy encourages the spatial planning of natural and semi-natural areas to deliver biodiversity conservation and a wide range of ecosystem services (ES) important to human well-being. Much of the current literature relies on expert-led and top-down processes to investigate connections between landscapes’ different land covers and ES. Little is known regarding the preferences of residents, and how they connect land covers with the delivery of ES important for their well-being.

As an emerging form of park-and-ride (PNR) services, remote PNR (RPR) facilities have proved to be more economical and environmentally friendly, allowing travelers to park in a suburban area and travel to a rail station via bus. In this regard, a generalized simulation-based bilevel model for optimizing the locations and capacities of RPR facilities is developed in this article. A hybrid algorithm integrating Bayesian optimization, branch and bound, and trust region sequential quadratic programming is proposed to achieve an optimal solution. The proposed integrated method balances the desired efficiency and accuracy through the combination of machine learning-based technology and mathematical optimization methodology. The validity of the proposed model is tested on a large-scale real-world transportation network in Halle, Germany. Modeling and analyzing RPR schemes using the proposed framework may provide new insights into improving social welfare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not About Sufficiency | Freight          |

Modeling and analyzing RPR schemes using the proposed framework may provide new insights into improving social welfare.  © 2009-2012 IEEE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | About Sufficiency     | mobility         |
| A Participatory Assessment of Perceived Neighbourhood Walkability in a Small Urban Environment                                                                                                                          | Walkability has become a research topic of great concern for preserving public health, especially in the era of the COVID-19 outbreak. Today more than ever, urban and transport policies, constrained by social distancing measures and travel restrictions, must be conceptualized and implemented with a particular emphasis on sustainable walkability. Most of the walkability models apply observation and subjective methods to measure walkability, whereas few studies address walkability based on sense perception. To fill this gap, we aim at investigating the perceived neighbourhood walkability (PNW) based on sense perception in a neighbourhood of Brussels. We designed a survey that integrates 22 items grouped into 5 dimensions (cleanness, visual aesthetics, landscape and nature, feeling of pressure, feeling of safety), as well as the socio-demographic attributes of the participants. Using various statistical methods, we show that socio-demographics have almost no effects on perceived neighbourhood walkability. Nonetheless, we found significant differences between groups of different educational backgrounds. Furthermore, using a binomial regression model, we found strong associations between PNW and at least one item from each grouping dimension. Finally, we show that based on a deep neural network for classification, the items have good predictive capabilities (78% of classification accuracy). These findings can help integrate sense perception into objective measurement methods of walkable environments. Additionally, policy recommendations should be targeted based on differences of perception across socio-demographic groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not About Sufficiency | Buildings        |

| (Re)Designing the built environment to support physical activity: Bringing public health back into urban design and planning                                                                                            | While public health and urban planning fields worked closely to tackle communicable disease outbreaks in the 19th century, this collaboration faded during the 20th century. Over the last few decades, engagement in physical activity - even walking - has declined substantially, with serious impacts on population health. Recently there has been an emerging body of literature and guidance illustrating the role the built environment has in shaping health outcomes; much of this has focussed on physical activity behaviours. Associations between built environment attributes and physical activity have been reported by many studies, however the geographic scales at which these built environment attributes need to be measured and the magnitude of the built environment attributes required to support physical activity are not clear. Further studying these geographical scales and thresholds will facilitate development of specific guidance to urban designers and planners to create supportive built environments to facilitate physical activity engagement. This is an important addition for re-connecting the fields of public health and urban design and planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

| (Re)Designing the built environment to support physical activity: Bringing public health back into urban design and planning                                                                                            | While public health and urban planning fields worked closely to tackle communicable disease outbreaks in the 19th century, this collaboration faded during the 20th century. Over the last few decades, engagement in physical activity - even walking - has declined substantially, with serious impacts on population health. Recently there has been an emerging body of literature and guidance illustrating the role the built environment has in shaping health outcomes; much of this has focussed on physical activity behaviours. Associations between built environment attributes and physical activity have been reported by many studies, however the geographic scales at which these built environment attributes need to be measured and the magnitude of the built environment attributes required to support physical activity are not clear. Further studying these geographical scales and thresholds will facilitate development of specific guidance to urban designers and planners to create supportive built environments to facilitate physical activity engagement. This is an important addition for re-connecting the fields of public health and urban design and planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

| "Living a good life": conceptualizations of well-being in a conservation context in Cambodia                                                                                                                            | Conservation practice has sometimes been criticized for relying on simplistic assumptions about social contexts in natural resource management. Despite recent advances conceptualizing the interface between human well-being and the environment, very few studies moving from theory to practice exist. We address this gap by providing one of the first careful examinations of local conceptualizations of well-being in a conservation context, using mixed methods to examine the multidimensionality and heterogeneity of well-being conceptualizations across three sites in northern Cambodia. Each site faced different levels of conservation activities and development pressures, the latter being mainly linked to the degree of impact from economic land concessions. Our results highlight village context as a key line of variation in individual well-being, rather than differences related to age, gender, or wealth. Our results suggest that conservation incentives that mirror people's aspirations can balance out negative trade-offs linked to compliance and can contribute to well-being. We show that multifaceted values are attached to well-being components, highlighting the importance of subjective indicators and perceptions to capture fully the social changes and impacts of conservation in complex contexts. We conclude that enquiries into subjective well-being should become an integral part of participatory assessments and adaptive management of conservation interventions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Not About Sufficiency | Urban_Ecology    |

We conclude that enquiries into subjective well-being should become an integral part of participatory assessments and adaptive management of conservation interventions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | About Sufficiency     | Nutrition        |
