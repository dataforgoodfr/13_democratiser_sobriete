Particle emissions from rail traffic: A literature review,"Particle emissions are a drawback of rail transport. This work is a comprehensive presentation of recent research into particle emissions from rail vehicles. Both exhaust and nonexhaust particle emissions are considered when examining particle characteristics such as PM10, and PM2.5 concentration levels, size, morphology, composition, and adverse health effects, current legislation, and available and proposed solutions for reducing such emissions. High concentration levels in enclosed rail traffic environments are reported and some toxic effects of the particles. The authors find that only a few limited studies have examined the adverse health effects of nonexhaust particle emissions and that no relevant legislation exists. Thus further research in this area is warranted. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
A systematic literature review on the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in sustainability improvement of transportation construction projects: state-of-the-art and future directions,"Purpose: This systematic literature review aims to investigate the application and integration of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies in transportation infrastructure construction projects focusing on sustainability pillars. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a systematic literature review approach, combining qualitative review and quantitative analysis of 142 academic articles published between 2011 and March 2023. Findings: The findings reveal the dominance of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a central tool for sustainability assessment, while other technologies such as blockchain and autonomous robotics have received limited attention. The adoption of I4.0 technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, Augmented Reality (AR), and Big Data, has been prevalent for data-driven analyses, while Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs) and 3D printing are mainly being integrated either with BIM or in synergy with Artificial Intelligence (AI). We pinpoint critical challenges including high adoption costs, technical barriers, lack of interoperability, and the absence of standardized sustainability benchmarks. Originality/value: This research distinguishes itself by not only mapping the current integration of I4.0 technologies but also by advocating for standardization and a synergistic human-technology collaborative approach. It offers tailored strategic pathways for diverse types of transportation infrastructure and different project phases, aiming to significantly enhance operational efficiency and sustainability. The study sets a new agenda for leveraging cutting-edge technologies to meet ambitious future sustainability and efficiency goals, making a compelling case for rethinking how these technologies are applied in the construction sector. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Socio-economic impacts of solar energy technologies for sustainable green energy: a review,"Although fossil fuels leave environmentally hazardous gases like carbon dioxide, to date, global energy production is mostly dependent on these sources. Depletion of fossil resource and changes in the price make it a major concert for the sustainable use in future and utilization of energy resources which is environmentally safe and sustainable. Therefore, an increase in the use natural sustainable energy like solar power observed to be increased recently. Effective use of solar energy depends on the proper knowledge on its use and techniques. This article reviews different solar storage technologies to obtain green sustainable energy generation. We discussed the variation, mechanism, effectiveness, and worth of greenhouse for solar heat storage and concentrated solar power technologies (CSP). The multi-level evaluation method establishes an evaluation index system, adopts the expert scoring method to determine the weight and score of the index, and combines qualitative and quantitative to obtain a comprehensive evaluation value. There is the evaluation of the socio-economic impact of the green power station construction. The detail of for socio-economic environmental factor for on large-scale operation applications dependence on the use and conditions both solar storage and technologies have advantage and disadvantages. Finally, directions for significant of waste to energy for safe environment are presented. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"The effect of board of directors attributes, environmental committee and institutional ownership on carbon disclosure quality","This study assesses the effect of the board of directors' attributes, environmental committee (EC), and institutional ownership (IO) on carbon disclosure quality (CDQ) from the perspectives of legitimacy and agency theories in Malaysia. This study collects and analyzes data based on 1000 observations of firms from carbon-intensive industries from 2015 to 2019. The effect of the board of directors' attributes, EC, and IO on the CDQ was observed using a panel data regression model. The study revealed a significant positive relationship between board independence, board size, female representation, EC, IO, and CDQ. These findings suggest that carbon disclosure awareness is rising in Malaysia as firms have gradually integrated corporate governance (CG) best practices into their business strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the factors that influence CDQ in Malaysian businesses. This study identified firms with a higher CDQ using a new global reporting initiative-based carbon reporting index. This expands the literature on carbon disclosures. This study focuses on carbon-intensive industries, which might not reflect Malaysia's current CDQ situation. Thus, future research should focus on other sectors to fully grasp the current state of the CDQ in Malaysia and offer new perspectives on emerging markets. The findings may benefit a vast group of regulatory bodies in assessing Malaysian firms' responses to local and international carbon guidelines. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Does the EU sustainable finance disclosure regulation mitigate greenwashing?,"This paper examines the impact of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) on greenwashing by equity mutual funds in the EU. We propose a unique measure called the Greenwashing Index, based on a fund's decarbonisation effort relative to its flows, to quantify the level of greenwashing. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that following the enactment of the SFDR, Article 9 funds experience a lower level in their greenwashing index relative to a control group of funds. However, for Article 8 funds we do not observe any significant reduction in the level of their greenwashing index relative to the same control group. We also use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) and find that the decline in the greenwashing index is more concentrated in Article 9 than in Article 8 funds which indicates a different effect of the SFDR on greenwashing behaviour between those funds. Our findings also show that Article 9 funds decarbonise their portfolios by primarily following a portfolio tilting strategy to overweight low carbon-intensive holdings following the introduction of the SFDR. © 2025 The Author(s).

One-dimensional titanate nanotube materials: heterogeneous solid catalysts for sustainable synthesis of biofuel precursors/value-added chemicals—a review,"One-dimensional (1D) titanate nanotubes materials (protonated titanate nanotube (HTNT) and sodium titanate nanotube (NaTNT)) have been reported as low-cost and efficient catalytic materials in chemical syntheses for the production of biofuel precursors with interesting catalytic performance exhibited, even better than some commonly used zeolites, H-MOR, H-β, SO42−/Al2O3, and H-ZSM-5 solid catalysts with environmental benign in focus when compared with homogeneous catalytic materials. This mini-review expressly revealed the significance and potential of using HTNT and NaTNT as sustainable and environmentally benign solid catalysts/supports in various chemical reactions. The critical assessment of biomass valorization and titanate nanostructured materials as catalysts/supports via Green Chemistry approach, #7 (use of renewable feedstocks), #9 (use of catalyst against stoichiometry) and United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), #7 (affordable and clean energy; ensure access to inexpensive, reliable, sustainable, and new energy), is presented as integrated pathways to meet environmental benign technology toward sustainability. Hence, this work follows in the pattern of recent formulated features reported for solid catalysts—‘PYSSVR’ concept, which means P–production cost, Y–yield, S–stability, S–selectivity, V–versatility, and R–reusability.

Climate-change disruptions to migration systems,"Climate change represents a major potential drag on progress towards sustainable development, not least in its disruption to processes of the movement of people. Principal threats from climate change include increasing the involuntary displacement of people from the impacts of extreme weather events, through to making urban settlements more hazardous for new migrant populations. This chapter illustrates these risks, focusing on how climate-change risks limit the choice and agency of those experiencing the impacts, both in source and destination areas. Collective responses to climate change, such as recognising displaced populations or planning for relocation of settlements, currently have limited recognition of the social dynamics of migration and its role in sustainable development. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Tanja Bastia and Ronald Skeldon; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying the capacity needs of built environment professionals to deliver environmentally sustainable buildings: a scientometric review,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify the capacity needs of building professionals to deliver environmentally sustainable buildings (ESBs) globally, from a unique systems approach. Through a review of extant literature, this study contributes to knowledge of the global delivery of ESBs by identifying research trends and gaps that can be tackled in future research, and current hotspots in capacity building (CB) research within the built environment (BE). The adopted systems approach to CB postulates that the construction industry is systemized in nature, and thus, CB solutions within the industry should be approached from a systems approach. Design/methodology/approach: A literature search was conducted using the Scopus search engine, augmented by Google Scholar and Web of Science, to produce 54 relevant articles for analysis. The scientometric analysis was undertaken with the use of VOSViewer to better understand the broad literature on CB in the construction industry which would not have been possible with traditional data analysis. The content analysis allowed, for a systematic review of selected articles, to reveal key themes in this study. Findings: Through a content analysis, four levels of CB were identified within the construction industry; individual level, organizational level, industry level and state level. Nine sub-capacities were subsumed under the four identified levels adopted from Potter and Brough (2004), including but not limited to Performance capacity, Workload capacity, Supervisory capacity, Industry Role capacity and Systems capacity. Under each sub-capacity, key questions were posed to aid identify the capacity needs of BE professionals. A framework for identifying capacity needs in the BE is proposed. Practical implications: The findings of this study serve as a useful reference for practitioners and policymakers to assess their level of commitment to CB efforts for ESB delivery. The findings of this study have revealed that building the capacities of BE professionals to deliver ESBs should be addressed as part of a broader framework, interdependent on the other levels of CB in the systemic construction industry. Originality/value: As a review study identifying capacity needs for BE professionals to deliver ESBs, this study enhances knowledge of CB within the construction industry. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
"Synthesis, antifungal evaluation and molecular docking studies of some tetrazole derivatives","A facile and simple protocol for the [3+2] cycloaddition of alkyl nitriles (RCN) with sodium azide (NaN3) in the presence of copper bis(diacetylcurcumin) 1,2-diamin-obenzene Schiff base complex, SiO2-[Cu-BDACDABSBC] as a heterogeneous catalyst in the presence of ascorbic acid and a solution of water/i-PrOH (50:50, V/V) media at reflux condition is described. The supported catalyst was prepared by immobilization of a copper bis(diacetylcurcumin) 1,2-diaminobenzene Schiff base complex [Cu-BDACDABSBC] on silica gel. The complex has high selectivity, catalytic activity, and recyclability. The significant features of this procedure are high yields, broad substrate scope and simple and efficient work-up procedure. According to this synthetic methodology, excellent yields of 5-substituted 1H-tetrazoles having bioactive N-heterocyclic cores were synthesized. The in vitro antifungal activities of title compounds were screened against various pathogenic fungal strains, such as Candida species involving C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis as well as filamentous fungi like Aspergillus species consisting of A. fumigatus and A. flavus. The molecular docking analysis is discussed for one most potent compound against fungi.

Neo-liberal conservation analysing carbon forestry and its challenges in India,"Carbon forestry projects such as REDD+, A/R CDM and the Green India Mission are based on the neo-liberal principles of privatisation, commoditisation, and marketisation. These market-oriented tools abstract forests from their sociocultural and ecological contexts and reduce their value for carbon forestry. These projects promote plantations of fast-growing species and undermine local knowledge and institutions. The available empirical evidence on the carbon forestry projects indicates that these have an impact on the rights and livelihoods of forest-dependent communities adversely. Hence, it is imperative to critically analyse them before scaling them up. © 2019 Economic and Political Weekly. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
A Comprehensive Review of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Studies in Roofing Industry: Current Trends and Future Directions,"Highlights: Main findings: There is significant variability in LCA methods and impact categories in roofing studies. Only a few studies have examined roofing components at the urban scale. Implications of the main finding: Standardized LCA methods are needed for consistent assessments in the roofing industry. More urban-scale LCA studies are needed to better understand the environmental impact of roofing materials. The building sector is crucial in keeping the environment healthy, mainly because of its energy and material usage. Roofs are one of the most important components to consider, as they not only shield the building from the elements but also have a big impact on the environment. The paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the life cycle assessment (LCA) application in the roofing industry. The review examines three main focus areas: (1) LCA of different roofing materials, (2) LCA of roofing systems, and (3) whole-building LCA. Key takeaways from the literature review demonstrate that there is significant variability in LCA methods and impact categories assessed across roofing studies. Only a few studies have explored the complete urban scale in LCA assessments of roofing components. Future research can include utilizing the potential of LCA at urban scales, which can offer a full understanding of the environmental impacts associated with roofing materials in urban settings. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis from lens of economic complexity index for BRICS: Evidence from second generation panel analysis,"The present study contributes to the ongoing discussion on environmental sustainability, energy efficiency for the case of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa economies by investigating the dynamic connection regarding foreign direct investment, economic complexity index, renewable energy, natural resources, urbanization, and CO2 emission for annual frequency data from 1990 to 2019. The present study employs robust econometric techniques including Augmented Mean Group with Fully Modified-Ordinary Least Squares estimators as estimation techniques. Empirical outcome shows both inverted U-Shaped and N-Shaped EKC relationship between ECI and CO2 emission. The empirical findings also lend support to the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, which suggest that foreign direct investment influx is a contributing factor to environmental degradation in Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa economies. Furthermore, renewable energy and the interaction between economic complexity index and urbanization is found to have adverse impact on emission while natural resources and urbanization have positive impact on the environment. Finally, the results from the Dumitrecu and Hurlin causality reveals a bi-directional causality between economic complexity and CO2 emission. Similar causality is found between economic complexity index and urbanization and CO2 emission while a one-way causality is seen running from foreign direct investment to CO2 emission over study period. These findings encourage authorities of the investigated countries to offer a broader energy strategy on alternative energies i.e., renewables improve Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa environmental quality. Furthermore, emphasis on economic strategies that foster a healthier manufacturing activity to engender environmental sustainability without compromise for economic prosperity should be pursued among the examined economies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Protected areas and poverty reduction: The role of ecotourism livelihood in local communities in Ghana,"Ecotourism has become a sustainable alternative to degrading livelihoods around protected areas in developing countries. Its contributions to poverty reduction are captured in terms of employment and income generation. As a result, studies assessing ecotourism’s contributions have traditionally focused on the accumulation and distribution of the economic benefits. However, little attention has been given to the non-economic aspects relevant to poverty reduction. Using the livelihood approach, this article aims at assessing ecotourism impacts on the livelihoods of households. The results indicate that ecotourism contributes to reducing poverty, however, this can be enhanced by focusing on the non-economic aspects and minimizing its negative impacts on household livelihood. © 2019, © 2019 Community Development Society.",Not About Sufficiency
"Game, Not Fight: Change Climate Change!","This article argues that in the long run gaming (i.e., managing unstable equilibria while maintaining societal sustainability) serves better as a strategy against the undesired effects of global change (GC) than fighting (i.e., understanding only one's own standpoint, but not the standpoint of one's adversaries). GC is believed to be driven by a bundle of drivers, some of which are global long-term trends that are almost impossible to change. Climate change is only one component of this syndrome. GC exerts a bundle of effects on society. Given this interlinked and systemic character of GC, an explorative, reflexive, dialogue-driven strategy allowing for continuous adaptation, rather than a theory-driven predesigned solution, is advocated. Taking roles allows actors to perceive the paradigms and perspectives of adversaries. Hence, game-based (but structured) procedures allow the taking of adversarial positions without being compromised. As an example of such procedural structuration, the negotiation game SURFING GLOBAL CHANGE (SGC, © Gilbert Ahamer) published earlier in this journal is recommended. The social dynamics of SGC is graphically analyzed. SGC was implemented three dozen times with students within several university curricula such as Environmental Systems Science or Global Studies training developmental cooperation. Through changing roles, SGC allows one to walk through the complex argumentative landscape while gaming. This article proposes several conclusions to the way in which gaming should respond to the complex patterns of GC. © 2013 SAGE Publications.",Not About Sufficiency

Co-production of Knowledge in Multi-stakeholder Processes: Analyzing Joint Experimentation as Social Learning,"Abstract: Purpose: Changing research design and methodologies regarding how researchers articulate with end-users of technology is an important consideration in developing sustainable agricultural practices. This paper analyzes a joint experiment as a multi-stakeholder process and contributes to understand how the way of organizing social learning affects stakeholders’ ownership of process outcomes. Design/Methodology/Approach:A learning group composed of the different stakeholders of the oil palm seed system in Benin was set around a joint experiment. We use a detailed account of the group dynamics to understand the social process. Findings: The way the process is designed and conducted has a great effect on the ownership by the participants. Methodological steps taken in this research process showed its efficacy to produce quick and positive feedback mechanisms. Stakeholders’ perspectives on what constitutes a quality oil palm seedling varied widely. Participants, mainly nursery holders, learned new production practices. Representatives of the research center learned a mismatch of recommendations with users’ contexts. Field observations further to the process indicate changes in practices among stakeholders that would be sustainable. Practical Implications: Beyond focusing on outcomes, initiatives in multi-stakeholder processes should also document and analyze social processes in order to better understand the mechanisms by which such processes foster socio-technical change, as well as identify potential institutional barriers to such processes. Originality/Value: Through a detailed analysis of group dynamics, this paper addresses an important knowledge gap in participatory agricultural development. © 2014 Wageningen University.",Not About Sufficiency
The impacts of different types of globalization on energy security risk: Can globalization be a remedy for the energy security risk of OECD countries?,"This study analyzes the impact of globalization and its sub-dimensions on energy security risk for OECD countries. In our study, annual data of 26 OECD countries for the period 1980–2018 were used. Second generation panel data techniques were used as the methodology. The results of the analysis show that economic, political and aggregate globalization increases energy security risk, while social globalization is statistically insignificant. The Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test results demonstrate that there is a unidirectional causality relationship between inflation and energy security risk, and a bidirectional causality relationship between economic globalization, social globalization, political globalization, aggregate globalization, GDP and Gross Fixed Capital Formation and energy security risk. The study also analyzed how the impact of globalization on energy security risk varies across countries. The results of the analysis reveals that there are significant differences in the direction, significance and coefficient size of the relationship across countries. These findings suggest that the effects of globalization on energy security risks vary across countries. Therefore, countries should develop policies to minimize energy security risks by taking into account their own dynamics. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Environmental, social and governance impact on financial performance: evidence from the Levant countries","Purpose: This paper aims to investigate whether the sustainability disclosure with the environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects has an impact on the financial performance represented by Tobin’s Q, return on assets (ROA) and return on equity indices in the Levant countries for the period 2012–2019, which was a period of turmoil and political repercussions that affected the countries of the region. Design/methodology/approach: Using the content analysis technique, the data was collected from 124 nonfinancial companies from Levant countries (Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon), and 883 observations were collected as panel data for the research analysis. Findings: The findings indicate that the environmental, social and ESG collective performance maximizes financial performance, while the governance performance influences ROA only. This suggests that companies pay great attention to various stakeholders, mainly external. Maximizing stakeholder value remains an optimal strategy to achieve the company’s financial goals. Thus, improving the disclosure levels of nonfinancial performance in the capital markets will improve the chances of growth of the financial performance indicators of companies. Originality/value: The study provided insights about the ESG role and its impact on the financial performance of companies in a less explored context by previous literature, namely, the Levant. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable Development in Third Level Programs: Distilling a Pathway to a True Net-Zero Education,"This study probes the notable gap between the theoretical endorsement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDGs 7, 12, and 13, and their tangible implementation in higher education curricula. We hypothesize that entrenched unsustainable practices in key academic disciplines, such as engineering and business, persist despite the global shift towards sustainability. The study engages a diverse cohort of participants from academia, public, private, and nonprofit sectors, chosen for their distinct roles and insights in integrating SDGs into educational and industrial frameworks. Our research design integrates an extensive qualitative literature review and critical analyses with quantitative surveys using specially designed instruments. The study was conducted with a sample of 48 participants, representing various sectors, using specially designed survey instruments to gauge expert opinions on the barriers and opportunities in advancing sustainable education. Our findings identify economic and administrative hurdles as primary impediments to academia’s shift towards sustainability. The data underscore the urgent need for targeted strategies in transitioning to a net-zero educational paradigm. The study concludes with a call to reshape academic initiatives, highlighting the critical role of education in preparing future leaders. It emphasizes bridging the gap between theoretical support for SDGs and their practical application in academia, proposing actionable strategies for this alignment. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of government healthcare financing in carbon emissions and climate change,"Government financing among OPEC+ countries predominantly stems from oil investments. However, given the global prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases, aging, population growth, and pandemic mutations, these countries require more oil investments to finance healthcare, with potential adverse consequence on carbon emissions and climate change. This study aims to investigate the relationship between government healthcare financing and carbon emissions and climate change and propose solutions for greener healthcare financing. Quantitative data from 2000 to 2020 were extracted from the WHO and Global Economy databases. The relationship of four variables indicating government healthcare financing to government budget, to total healthcare financing, to GDP, and per-capita with oil investment were investigated using a multiple regression analysis. The analysis included the world’s ten oil-producing countries with the highest oil revenue to GDP. The results showed significant relationships between government healthcare financing to total healthcare financing, to GDP, and per-capita with oil investment among most of the included countries, thereby demonstrating the substantial contribution of OPEC+ to carbon emissions and climate change. The predominant dependence of OPEC+ on oil for financing, with no tangible future transition insight, should make them persistent contributors to carbon emissions and climate change given the considerable publicly financed part of their healthcare systems and the world’s changeable healthcare needs. Thus, oil-dependent countries should strive to free their healthcare financing from oil investment with the environmental harm that this coupling incurs and adopt transformative strategies that expedite the transition to net-zero carbon emissions. © 2023 The Author(s).

Impacts of Renewable Energy Generation on Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Saudi Arabia: A Comprehensive Review,"Over the last few years, the electric energy demand in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has increased many folds due to several factors including increased population, industrialization, economic activities, and urbanization. The main source of electric power generation in KSA is the burning of petroleum products. Almost one third of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are contributed from the electric power generation sector, mainly, by burning diesel and natural gas. As a result, it makes it necessary to consider alternate forms of electricity generation in order to cut down emissions and to keep sustainable growth alive. The government has planned to diversify energy sources and suppliers. In recent years, energy generation from renewable sources including solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, concentrated solar power (CSP), biomass, geothermal, and tidal, has been given more importance. The ambitious Saudi Vision 2030 targets of 58.7 GW of power generation from renewable energy sources will cause a significant reduction in GHG emissions from the energy sector. This article systematically reviews the impact of renewable energy generation on GHG emissions. The detailed breakdown of GHG emission is discussed. Then, the status of renewable energy generation is investigated, focusing on the technical and economic potentials. The correlation of renewable energy generation and GHG emissions is then explained. The most distinguishing feature of this review is that it provides a comprehensive list of recommendations to reduce GHG emissions. The discussions and recommendations of this article will support decision makers, system planners, industry personnel, researchers, and academics to develop sustainable energy pathways for the Kingdom. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of Batch and Fixed Bed Processes for Competitive Removal of Direct Dyes by a Grade III Compost Adsorbent: Relative Efficacy Factor,"There is an increasing attention for using compost in remediation of heavy metals, textile dyes and emerging contaminants. In this work, the competitive uptake of two weakly interacting dyes, Direct Blue 71 and Direct Blue 151, by compost is examined. The optimum uptake of both dyes in single and bi-solute systems is achieved at pH 3.0, 240 min equilibrium time, 25 °C, and a relatively high compost dose 3.0 g L−1. Using Langmuir model, the maximum individual uptake of dyes by compost is 117.5 and 102.5 mg g−1 for DB151 and DB71, respectively. These values, estimated from their single-solute solution, were used to assess their overall competition under batch and fixed bed conditions. Under batch conditions, both dyes are removed from bi-solute solutions with higher competition for DB151 against DB71. The estimated competitive factors were 0.70 and 0.80 for DB71 and DB151, respectively. With a combined uptake capacity of 162 mg g−1 for both dyes, the performance of compost is promising. The fixed bed uptake of dyes indicated 80% utilization of compost capacity for single-solute solutions, at bed-depth 20 cm, flow rate 10 mL min−1 and inlet concentration 150 mg L−1. However, dyes adsorption under dynamic conditions is making only 40 and 60% of the maximum capacity of DB71 and DB151, respectively. The incomplete utilization is attributed to the fact that dynamic conditions are not as favorable to reach equilibrium as the batch process. The relative efficacy factor rexp was then used to select the optimum treatment process. From single and bi-solute solutions, dyes are effectively removed by fixed bed adsorption as rexp < 1.0, however, batch process is recommended to remove DB71 in the presence of DB151 as rexp > 1.0. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
A review on feasibility and techno-economic analysis of hydrocarbon liquid fuels production via catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic materials,"The single-use waste plastics is one of the major concerns globally to society as well as to the scientific community. It is even more so at the present-day due to the rapid production of plastic and polymeric materials to meet the societal demand. The consumers’ demand and dependency on plastic is huge due to its versatility, low production cost, light weight and numerous applications of it. With increasing the demand, waste plastic generation is also high that leads to creation of environmental and health problems like vomiting, anemia, headache, kidney, liver damage, cancer, shortened lifespan and chronic damage to nervous system. Therefore, new and modern techniques such as pyrolysis has been developed to reduce the environmental pollution and cutting of carbon tracers of plastic products by reducing the emissions of oxides of carbon like monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as compared to other technologies. This review paper mainly focused on the plastic waste generation scenario in India and minimization technique to produce fuels. Additionally, other new technologies to handle waste plastic along with energy generation (in the form of oil and gas production) with the specific process parameters (reaction time, reactor type, catalyst type and reaction temperature) to obtain the maximum yield are also discussed. The technoeconomic analysis and energy participation of waste plastic oil has also been highlighted to enhance the utilization of pyrolysis products and their futuristic application as an automotive fuel. An attempt was also made to analyze the emissions reduction as well as promotion of circular economy. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Bihar and Mithila: The historical roots of backwardness,"The world has become obsessed with the Western notions of progress, development, and globalization, the latter a form of human and economic homogenization. These processes, through the aegis of the United Nations, are comparatively monitored. Those nations deemed to be ‘lagging behind’ are then provided with foreign aid and developmental assistance. For nearly seventy years, India has sought its place in this global endeavour; yet, even today, abject poverty and backwardness can be observed in districts in almost every state; with the highest concentration of such districts found in the state of Bihar and a cultural enclave, known as Mithila. Development in India has been elusive because it is difficult to define; and because the Western concepts of development and progress have no absolute equivalents within many non-Western settings. As a consequence, development programmes often fail because they are unable to ask the right questions, but equally important is the political economy derived from foreign aid. For politicians, there is no long-term benefit to be derived from successful development. In general, foreign aid only serves to corrupt governments and politicians and, in the end, does very little for those who need help. The struggling states of Bihar and Mithila serve as extreme examples of India’s problems. Development here has been thwarted by a hereditary landed aristocracy supported by religion, casteism, custom, social stratification, tradition, and patterns of behaviour that can be traced back millennia. In turn, all these have been masterfully manipulated by co-opted politicians, who have turned politics into a veritable art form as this volume comprehensively demonstrates. © 2017 J.

Determinants of green logistics in BRICS countries: An integrated supply chain model for green business,"The objective of the study is to identify the main determinants of integrated supply chain management for green business growth, controlling socio-economic and environmental factors for BRICS countries, using a time series data from 1995 to 2015. The results show the positive relationship between green logistics indices and country's per capita income, which confirmed that supply chain management is integrated with country's economic growth and corporate environmental policies that is imperative for sustained payoffs. On the other side, logistics indices linked with high mass carbon emissions, social factors, and trade openness, which need sustainable cleaner instruments for achieving broad-based growth. The results of panel causality confirmed the two-way linkages between country's per capita income and logistic indices, and socio-economic factors and logistics indices, while there is one –way causal relationship running from carbon-fossil emissions to logistics indices across countries. The study confirmed the ‘neutrality hypotheses’ in between FDI, trade, and logistics indices during a given time period. The overall results emphasized the need of an integrated supply chain model to support environmental sustainability agenda and provoked for ‘go-for-green’ business. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
A review of sustainable facility management research,"Sustainable facility management (SFM) has a positive effect on the three main pillars of sustainable buildings: economic, environmental, and social benefits, thereby adding value to companies, organizations, and governments that integrate SFM into their vision.

Abstracts from 232 peer-reviewed journal publications from 2007 to 2016 were analyzed according to research discipline, topic studied, and methods used. This analysis suggests that the body of academic knowledge about SFM has reached a certain maturity, and that various research disciplines have contributed to the field from different viewpoints using diverse methods, demonstrating that the SFM research field is an interdisciplinary field. This review demonstrates that the number of SFM publications has decreased over time starting from 2012 until 2016, compared with the highest number of published papers (36) in 2011. This indicates that academic interest in SFM is now driven more by an interest in empirical phenomena rather than SFM as a new research discipline. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Impact of trade openness, human capital, and institutional performance on economic growth: Evidence from Organization of Islamic Cooperation countries","The study analyzes the impact of trade openness, human capital, and institutional performance on economic growth in OIC countries. The traditional methodologies of panel data ignore the issues of cross-sectional dependence (CD) and heterogeneity and give spurious results. A novel econometric technique “dynamic common correlated effects (DCCE)” is used to tackle these issues. The long-run estimates indicate that trade openness, human capital, and public expenditure have a positive and significant association with economic growth for higher-income and overall OIC countries. However, trade openness has a negative, and human capital has an insignificant correlation with economic growth in lower-income OIC countries. Institutional performance is positively correlated with economic growth in all groups of OIC countries. The study tends to support the call for the continuation of trade openness and human capital formation policies for overall and higher-income OIC countries to get benefits in the form of economic growth. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Asymmetric impact of coal and gas on carbon dioxide emission in six Asian countries: Using asymmetric and non-linear approach,"The Industrial Revolution began when machines powered by new energy sources replaced humans, and it has since brought about Climate Change, which is now the world's most challenging concern. This article's primary purpose is to investigate the impacts of coal and gas consumption on environmental quality in six Asian countries: China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and Bangladesh. While these countries' borders are interconnected, each country's economic growth and environmental changes have repercussions for the others. This analysis uses annual time-series data from 1990 to 2017. We employed modern techniques such as Johansen, NARDL, and asymmetric and symmetric Granger causality. For China and Bangladesh, long-term shock values of coal consumption demonstrate a positive co-integration relationship with carbon dioxide emissions. According to the feedback hypothesis, positive shocks between coal consumption and the environment have a Granger cause-effect for Pakistan and Russia, whereas four other countries do not. Due to rising gas use, the carbon dioxide emissions of Bangladesh have increased over time from the view of symmetric causal effect. According to the residual diagnostics checks, the NARDL model is stable, reliable, and credible in its current state. We discovered asymmetric unidirectional causalities in Russia, Pakistan, and Iran of carbon emission impacts on capital. Furthermore, the Environmental Ministries of the six nations should strictly enforce existing environmental standards, encourage a shift from natural gas and coal to clean energy sources such as ethanol, and promote eco-friendly vehicles such as electric cars and motors. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon neutrality concept and progress,"With advancement in technology the volume of international trade increased many folds. Global trade heavily depends upon fossil fuels for transportation of goods needed to run an uninterrupted supply of goods. The use of fossil fuel inflates the presence of greenhouse gases in the environment. The reliance on use of fossil fuel has two major limitations: one it is a source of greenhouse gases which damages the overall ecosystem, second the fossil fuel itself is a natural resource and its deposits deplete with pace of its use. Either way, the world cannot make its use on a continuous basis. Foregoing in view, the world community needs to look for alternatives. The alternative must be able to address the issues that are caused using fossil fuels or at least it should be least detrimental for the ecosystem compared to fossil fuels. The good part of the story is that the voice of environment scientists is well heard and now the world leaders have realized the importance of natural balance of the ecosystem. In his regard, the world community has gathered and shared common thoughts of bringing carbon emission to a low level. The pledge looks for decarbonization technologies and initiatives, and negative emissions technologies, carbon trading, and carbon tax. This sense has given birth to the idea of combating the carbon emission issue as a global responsibility. Global leaders have gathered multiple times to engage scholars for scholarly discussion to reach a wise solution to this ever-increasing issue. The world is tied up with hope based upon pledges of countries to reach carbon neutrality that the earth planet shall be set free from the challenges of climate issues. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Income Inequality and Environmental Degradation in Middle-Income Countries: A Test of Two Competing Hypotheses,"The relationship between income inequality and environmental degradation is still a global concern of empirical research. In this study, two main hypotheses concerning this relationship are tested using data from a panel of 42 middle-income countries (MICs) over the period 1990–2016. The results adopted from two different methodologies based on panel quantile regression techniques emphasize a trade-off relationship between inequality and environmental degradation, which supports the marginal propensity to emit (MPE) hypothesis rather than the political economy (PE) hypothesis in understanding the impact of inequality on environmental degradation in MICs. This finding leaves policymakers in MICs facing a difficult choice: either reducing inequality or improving the environment because the two goals are not achieved simultaneously according to the results. The results also confirm the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) across all quantiles. The effect of economic growth in MICs turns to improve environmental indicators in the long run. Accordingly, the study recommends that MICs give priority to reducing income inequality to ensure the continuity of achieving economic growth that improves environmental indicators in the long run, according to the EKC. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Scientific Cosmology and International Orders,"Scientific Cosmology and International Orders shows how scientific ideas have transformed international politics since 1550. Allan argues that cosmological concepts arising from Western science made possible the shift from a sixteenth-century order premised upon divine providence to the present order centred on economic growth. As states and other international associations used scientific ideas to solve problems, they slowly reconfigured ideas about how the world works, humanity's place in the universe, and the meaning of progress. The book demonstrates the rise of scientific ideas across three cases: natural philosophy in balance of power politics, 1550–1815; geology and Darwinism in British colonial policy and international colonial orders, 1860–1950; and cybernetic-systems thinking and economics in the World Bank and American liberal order, 1945–2015. Together, the cases trace the emergence of economic growth as a central end of states from its origins in colonial doctrines of development and balance of power thinking about improvement. © Bentley B.

"Board Gender Diversity, Information Asymmetry, and Investment Efficiency: Do Female Voices Make a Difference?","This paper investigates how board gender diversity (BGD) impacts information asymmetry (IA) and investment efficiency (IE), in addition to the moderating role of board gender diversity on the nexus between information asymmetry and investment efficiency in Egypt, motivated by the unclear lens and mixed evidence in the previous literature within this area, especially in developing countries. Thus, the paper followed a deductive research approach for 84 listed firms on the Egyptian Exchange from 2014 to 2023. The findings present new evidence that differs from the common findings in the literature, such as a U-shaped non-linear impact that was found regarding the impact of BGD on both IA (20.71% turning point) and IE (20.38% turning point). However, the IA shows a U-shaped non-linear effect on IE, and the incorporation of BGD as a moderator cause shifting from a (U) shape curve to an inverted (U) shape curve. Our findings from Egypt can motivate future academic research to re-examine the role of BGD from other perspectives in other countries and circumstances. In addition, this paper gives professional authorities and regulators insights into the optimal level of BGD and its critical role in corporate governance and performance, not just the benefits of increasing the diversity ratio, and can also help promote gender equality in corporate management, which can have social and economic benefits. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Response surface modeling and setpoint determination of steam- and air-assisted flares,"Federal Regulation 40 CFR §63.670 requires flare operators to specify smokeless design capacity for flares with no visible emissions. Alternatively, 96.5% combustion efficiency (CE) or 98% destruction efficiency must be achieved with threshold limits of minimum combustion zone net heating value (NHVcz) ≥ 270 British thermal unit/standard cubic feet (BTU/scf) for steam-assisted and net heating value dilution parameter (NHVdil) ≥ 22 BTU/ft2 for air-assisted flares. There is still no guarantee for smokeless flaring (SLF) or CE >96.5%. Robust response surface models developed in this study expressed %CE and %Opacity as a function of operating variables for air- and steam-assisted flares. Opacity and CE test data from 1983 to 2016 were analyzed. General quadratic models with transforms of CE and Opacity showed R2 > 0.90, and bivariate sigmoid models for CE showed R2 > 0.87. Two-dimensional (2D) contours illustrate the trends of major operating parameters. Operational setpoints at the incipient smoke point (ISP) and SLF were determined by solving the models subject to NHVcz and NHVdil threshold limits specifying Opacity at 3% (ISP) and 2% (SLF). The predicted steam/air assists/makeup fuel, NHVcz (or NHVdil), and CE at ISP and SLF conditions are compared with the experimental 1984 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and 2010 Texas Commission on Environmental Quality flare study ISP test data. These setpoints would help flare operators to establish ISP or SLF conditions either by adding makeup fuel to vent gas with low heating value or by minimizing the assist without adding makeup fuel for steam- and air-assisted flares. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",Not About Sufficiency
"Review of Resources from the Perspective of Wave, Tidal, and Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion","The conversion of Ocean Renewable Energy (ORE) sources to electricity could meet increasing energy demand and diversify the energy supply in Malaysia. Possessing a long coastline overlooking the South China Sea (SCS) and the Malacca strait has encouraged the Malaysian government to promote ORE and assess available resources to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. However, most of the previous attempts to assess the potential of Malaysian ORE resources have focused primarily on theoretical resource assessment, which in practice may not reflect the viability and suitability of the resource. Other technical and practical issues must be accounted for as well. This paper presents a brief description of ORE conversion technologies and reviews the existing studies on regional ORE resources in Malaysia with an emphasis dedicated to wave energy, tidal energy, and Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC). It also highlights the essential technical and practical constraints limiting or excluding the utilization of ORE sources. While some ORE resources, particularly the OTEC, appear to be theoretically promising for exploitation in Malaysia, this review has shown a lack of precise resource mapping linked to socio-economic and environmental constraints. © 2023, Penerbit Akademia Baru.

The rationale for SEA to overcome the inadequacy of environmental assessment in Bangladesh,"The first remarkable environmental initiatives in Bangladesh were taken because of the Stockholm Conference on Human Environment in 1972. The provision that requires Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for any new public and private project was first incorporated in the National Environmental Policy, 1992. Still environmental degradation is one of the major concerns in Bangladesh. Like some other developing countries, it initiates and conducts EIA in order to satisfy international donor agencies. Now, EIA is becoming matured through the positive steps of government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international agencies. However, EIA cannot adequately address all the prevailing environmental issues in Bangladesh because of its inherent and contextual limitations. This article explores the evolution of environmental assessment in Bangladesh, mostly at the strategic level. It investigates some of the policy failures, which resulted due to the absence of environmental assessment at the strategic level. Through a questionnaire survey (e-mail) and extensive literature review, this research concludes that Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) as a process can effectively address the limitations of EIA and contribute to policy development in order to ensure sustainable development. © 2007 Sage Publications.",Not About Sufficiency
The potential of organic waste in improving fire-free cassava cultivation systems in the Brazilian Amazon,"This chapter describes four fire-free cassava cultivation systems as alternatives to the slash-and-burn agriculture, which is deleterious to the environment. These systems are Roça sem Fogo, Jardim de Reciclagem, Parcagem, and semimechanized. Roça sem Fogo consists in preparing the land by slashing a secondary forest fragment and chopping the plant materials on the soil. Jardim de Reciclagem is a legume tree–cassava intercropping in which tree branches are pruned and chopped on the soil. Parcagem is a traditional practice of fertilizing the soil with excreta deposited directly by cattle. In turn, semimechanized is a system based on mechanized tillage. Also, the chapter describes manipueira, a liquid organic waste from cassava flour production that currently is discarded in soils and surface waters without any criteria, improves the performance of Roça sem Fogo by increasing the root yield of the crop. In conclusion, the combination of a fire-free cultivation system and manipueira has the potential to be more sustainable by increasing the cassava root yield while minimizing the environmental impact resulting from the use of fire in agriculture and the inadequate discard of organic wastes. However, experimental studies are needed to define the most efficient and safer use of manipueira in soils. © 2024 by Elsevier Inc.

Drivers of mangrove vulnerability and resilience to tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic Basin,"The North Atlantic Basin (NAB) has seen an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones since the 1980s, with record-breaking seasons in 2017 and 2020. However, little is known about how coastal ecosystems, particularly mangroves in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, respond to these new “climate normals” at regional and subregional scales. Wind speed, rainfall, pre-cyclone forest height, and hydro-geomorphology are known to influence mangrove damage and recovery following cyclones in the NAB. However, previous studies have focused on local-scale responses and individual cyclonic events. Here, we analyze 25 years (1996–2020) of mangrove vulnerability (damage after a cyclone) and 24 years (1996–2019) of short-term resilience (recovery after damage) for the NAB and subregions, using multi-annual, remote sensing-derived databases. We used machine learning to characterize the influence of 22 potential variables on mangrove responses, including human development and long-term climate trends. Our results document variability in the rates and drivers of mangrove vulnerability and resilience, highlighting hotspots of cyclone impacts, mangrove damage, and loss of resilience. Cyclone characteristics mainly drove vulnerability at the regional level. In contrast, resilience was driven by site-specific conditions, including long-term climate trends, pre-cyclone forest structure, soil organic carbon stock, and coastal development (i.e., proximity to human infrastructure). Coastal development is associated with both vulnerability and resilience at the subregional level. Further, we highlight that loss of resilience occurs mostly in areas experiencing long-term drought across the NAB. The impacts of increasing cyclone activity on mangroves and their coastal protection service must be framed in the context of compound climate change effects and continued coastal development. Our work offers descriptive and spatial information to support the restoration and adaptive management of NAB mangroves, which need adequate health, structure, and density to protect coasts and serve as Nature-based Solutions against climate change and extreme weather events. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Increasing the adoption of conservation agriculture: A framed field experiment in Northern Ghana,"Conservation agriculture techniques have the potential to increase agricultural production while decreasing CO2 emissions, yet adoption in the developing world remains low—in part because many years of continuous adoption may be required to realize gains in production. We conduct a framed field experiment in northern Ghana to study how incentives and peer information may affect adoption. Incentives increase adoption, both while they are available and after withdrawal. There is no overall effect of peer information, but we do find evidence that information about long-term adoption increased adoption, particularly when that information shows that yield gains have been achieved. © 2023 The Authors.

The perceptions of fisheries management options by Spain's Atlantic fishermen,"This paper analyses the perceptions of Spanish fishermen working in Atlantic fishing grounds on current fishery regulation measures and the possibility of introducing transferable rights as is established in the EC's latest proposal to reform the Common Fisheries Policy. A survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews and ordered logistic and multiple regression models to identify which characteristics influence fishermen's perceptions and attitudes. The results show that the fleet segments most in favour of implementing ITQs correspond to industrial fishing, while the smaller-scale fisheries (artisanal, gillnets, longline and coastal trawl) are more in favour of a system involving individual effort (fishing days or kW days), transferable or otherwise. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Board risk oversight and environmental and social performance,"We examine the relation between board risk oversight and environmental and social (E&S) performance. Our study is motivated by heightened awareness of E&S risks and growing calls for their inclusion in the purview of board risk oversight. Using a novel proprietary dataset on board risk oversight for an international sample, we find that firms with more extensive board risk oversight are more likely to institute E&S compensation, set environmental (but not social) targets, adopt policies that address E&S risks and opportunities, and issue an E&S report. Our exploratory evidence also shows that more extensive board risk oversight is associated with better environmental outcomes, specifically lower monetized environmental costs, but worse social outcomes, namely lower monetized employee benefits and a higher likelihood of social risk incidents. Our results suggest that risk oversight is analogous to a constrained optimization problem whereby risk exposures are prioritized and receive different degrees of oversight consideration by the board. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Integrative approaches to dispersing science: A case study of March Mammal Madness,"Objectives: Public engagement is increasingly viewed as an important pillar of scientific scholarship. For early career and established scholars, navigating the mosaic landscape of public education and science communication, noted for rapid “ecological” succession, can be daunting. Moreover, academics are characterized by diverse skills, motivations, values, positionalities, and temperaments that may differentially incline individuals to particular public translation activities. Methods: Here we briefly contextualize engagement activities within a scholarly portfolio, describe the use of one public education program—March Mammal Madness (MMM)— to highlight approaches to science communication, and explore essential elements and practical considerations for creating and sustaining outreach pursuits in tandem with other scholarly activities. Results: MMM, an annual simulated tournament of living and fossil animal taxa, has reached hundreds of thousands of learners since 2013. This program has provided a platform to communicate research findings from biology and anthropology and showcase numerous scholars in these fields. MMM has leveraged tournament devices to intentionally address topics of climate change, capitalist environmental degradation, academic sexism, and racist settler-colonialism. The tournament, however, has also perpetuated implicit biases that need disrupting. Conclusions: By embracing reflexive, self-interrogative, and growth attitudes, the tournament organizers iteratively refine and improve this public science education program to better align our activities with our values and goals. Our experiences with MMM suggest that dispersing science is most sustainable when we combine ancestral adaptations for cooperation, community, and storytelling with good-natured competition in the context of shared experiences and shared values. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Homestays at korzok: Supplementing rural livelihoods and supporting green tourism in the Indian himalayas,"Ladakh presents some unique challenges for development and nature conservation initiatives. Since opening to tourism in 1974, its unique landscapes, biodiversity, and culture have attracted adventure-seeking tourists from all over the world. Tourism, especially in the past few decades, has developed very rapidly, bringing many economic and social changes with adverse environmental impacts. By recognizing the threats posed by unplanned tourism, a number of organizations and institutions working in the area felt the urgency to initiate sustainable community-based tourism projects that would protect the local wildlife and natural resources and offer alternative livelihood opportunities to the local population. The homestay model in Ladakh is designed on the principle of equitable access and hence is available for adoption by households across economic classes. This article uses the particular case of Korzok homestays, implemented by the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF-India) near the Ramsar wetland Tsomoriri, to illustrate how community development needs can be integrated with conservation goals.

A framework for conceptualizing and modeling social-ecological systems for conservation research,"As conservation biology has matured, its scope has expanded from a primarily ecological focus to recognition that nearly all conservation problems involve people. At the same time, conservation actions have been increasingly informed by ever more sophisticated quantitative models. These models have focused primarily on ecological and geographic elements of conservation problems, such as mark-recapture methods, predicting species occurrences, and optimizing the placement of protected areas. There are many off-the-shelf ecological models for conservation managers to draw upon, but very few that describe human-nature interactions in a generalizable manner. We address this gap by proposing a minimalistic modeling framework for human-nature interactions, combining well-established ideas in economics and social sciences (grounded in Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework) and accepted ecological models. Our approach begins with a systems breakdown consisting of an ecosystem, resource users, public infrastructure, and infrastructure providers; and interactions between these system elements, which bring together the biophysical context, the relevant attributes of the human society, and the rules (institutions, such as protected areas) currently in use. We briefly review the different disciplinary building blocks that the framework could incorporate and then illustrate our approach with two examples: a detailed analysis of the social-ecological dynamics involved in managing South African protected areas and a more theoretical analysis of a general system. We conclude with further discussion of the urgent need in conservation biology for models that are genuinely designed to capture the complexities of human socioeconomic behavior, rather than the more typical approach of trying to adapt an ecological model or a stochastic process to simulate human agency and decision-making. Our framework offers a relatively simple but highly versatile way of specifying social-ecological models that will help conservation biologists better represent critical linkages between social and ecological processes when modeling social-ecological dynamics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The innovation and industry dynamics of technology phase-out in sustainability transitions: Insights from diversifying petroleum technology suppliers in Norway,"The urgency of a sustainability transition in the energy sector has led numerous authors to argue that it can and should be accelerated through active phase-out, disruption and destabilization of the undesirable established technologies. This paper starts out accepting the phase-out premise, but argues that a more nuanced view of ‘established’ technologies and incumbents is needed. Technologies often involve many different sectors, and there may be a great but underappreciated potential to realize transitions through recombinations and diversification by upstream firms providing the components and material inputs for the undesirable technology. Recombination and diversification can also dampen the possible negative effects of transitions such as loss of jobs and bankruptcy of firms that are not at the core of these technologies. By combining literature on transitions and phase-out, technological innovation systems, and diversification, we develop a framework of analysis that is used to study diversification processes in supplier firms in the Norwegian offshore petroleum technology value chain. We find that these firms face a number of diversification challenges that are mostly non-technological. These findings are used to discuss how policies can better support diversification and how theories of sustainability transitions can take this perspective into account. © 2020 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

Altered Belowground Carbon Cycling Following Land-Use Change to Perennial Bioenergy Crops,"Belowground carbon (C) dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems play an important role in the global C cycle and thereby in climate regulation. Globally, land-use change is a major driver of changes in belowground C storage. The emerging bioenergy industry is likely to drive widespread land-use changes, including the replacement of annually tilled croplands with perennial bioenergy crops, and thereby to impact the climate system through alteration of belowground C dynamics. Mechanistic understanding of how land-use changes impact belowground C storage requires elucidation of changes in belowground C flows; however, altered belowground C dynamics following land-use change have yet to be thoroughly quantified through field measurements. Here, we show that belowground C cycling pathways of establishing perennial bioenergy crops (0- to 3. 5-year-old miscanthus, switchgrass, and a native prairie mix) were substantially altered relative to row crop agriculture (corn-soy rotation); specifically, there were substantial increases in belowground C allocation (>400%), belowground biomass (400-750%), root-associated respiration (up to 2,500%), moderate reductions in litter inputs (20-40%), and respiration in root-free soil (up to 50%). This more active root-associated C cycling of perennial vegetation provides a mechanism for observed net C sequestration by these perennial ecosystems, as well as commonly observed increases in soil C under perennial bioenergy crops throughout the world. The more active root-associated belowground C cycle of perennial vegetation implies a climate benefit of grassland maintenance or restoration, even if biomass is harvested annually for bioenergy production. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable Development Goal 14 in the Western Indian Ocean: a socio-ecological approach to understanding progress,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) intend to “achieve a better and more sustainable future for all people in the world”1. They have become a key driver for policy and decision-making in many regions, including in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region. This paper analyses national and regional progress towards achieving SDG 14 in the WIO. Progress of four of the SDG 14 targets that were due in 2020 are analysed. SDG 14 has influenced regional and national policy agendas but current tools to measure this progress fail to provide a detailed picture of achievement towards each target for countries in the WIO. The paper highlights that the region has shown limited success in achieving the targets and SDG 14 targets are unlikely to be reached by 2030. The WIO region lags behind with regard to marine conservation related targets. More than half of the countries have low to average progress on SDG 14.2 on marine areas being covered by area-based management tools. Even more countries are far from achieving the 10 % coverage of marine protected areas under SDG 14.5. The region is performing better with regards to fisheries management targets with most countries classified as making average to good progress towards SDG 14.4 on sustainable stocks and SDG 14.6 on addressing harmful subsidies and IUU fishing. The diversity of the socio-economic and governance contexts in the WIO countries contributes to different levels of progress. The fairly positive ecological state of the WIO supports progress towards SDG 14. Understanding barriers to progress is fundamental to help with the prioritisation of the actions needed to meet the SDG 14 targets by 2030. Regional actors and policy-makers will need to increase their ambitions to meet the SDG 14 targets and ensure a healthy ocean and improved prospects for the region and its citizens. To account for barriers in progress towards SDG 14, the WIO region needs appropriate reporting and monitoring mechanisms and it should follow a holistic regional approach of ocean governance integrating conservation and sustainable resource use. It needs to build capacity and knowledge sharing for implementation of SDG 14 and ocean governance at various levels. Improved implementation of SDG targets will have social, economic and environmental benefits within the region. © 2022, Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association.

The relationship between CSR and financial performance and the moderating effect of ownership structure: Evidence from Chinese heavily polluting listed enterprises,"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) contributions are essential for the firm's profit considering sustainable economic growth, whereas it also imposes additional financial burdens for many firms. This paper utilizes the sample data of 6306 Chinese heavily polluting listed companies from 2012 to 2019 to investigate the impact of heavily polluting enterprises’ CSR on corporate financial performance (CFP). In addition, ownership structure is divided into ownership concentration, ownership balance and ownership type to explore its moderating impact on CSR and CFP. An ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model is applied to test the four proposed hypotheses, and two-stage least squares method (2SLS) and propensity score matching-difference in differences method (PSM-DID) are adopted to the endogenous test. It is observed that CSR can have a positive impact on CFP in Chinese heavily polluting listed companies. However, ownership concentration will reduce this positive impact, conversely, ownership balance can promote the positive effect of CSR on CFP. CSR promotes CFP better in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) compared with state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Additionally, heterogeneity tests are conducted and found that the promoting effect of CSR on CFP is affected by the region, and the promotion effect in Middle and Western China is greater than that of Eastern China. The effect is similar for both technology-capital-intensive enterprises and labor-resource-intensive enterprises. These conclusions provide theoretical and practical reference values for CSR management practices and the improvement of CFP. Enterprises should actively undertake CSR and optimize their ownership structure to promote better CFP. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Not About Sufficiency
Water conflicts: From ancient to modern times and in the future,"Since prehistoric times, water conflicts have occurred as a result of a wide range of tensions and/or violence, which have rarely taken the form of traditional warfare waged over water resources alone. Instead, water has historically been a (re)source of tension and a factor in conflicts that start for other reasons. In some cases, water was used directly as a weapon through its ability to cause damage through deprivation or erosion or water resources of enemy populations and their armies. However, water conflicts, both past and present, arise for several reasons; including territorial disputes, fight for resources, and strategic advantage. The main reasons of water conflicts are usually delimitation of boundaries, waterlogging (e.g., dams and lakes), diversion of rivers flow, running water, food, and political distresses. In recent decades, the number of human casualties caused by water conflicts is more than that of natural disasters, indicating the importance of emerging trends on water wars in the world.

The poverty—environment thesis: Was brundtland wrong?,"Summary: Arild Angelsen, ‘The Poverty—Environment Thesis: Was Brundtland Wrong?’, Forum for Development Studies, 1997:1, pp. 135–154. The poverty-environment thesis suggests that the poor are both the agents and victims of environmental degradation. Even though the thesis may have been necessary to avoid a North-South confrontation on environmental issues, its validity can be questioned. It is argued that the coexistence of poverty and environmental disruption could more appropriately be seen as the joint consequence of limited opportunities for some groups, uneven processes of development, an unequal distribution of rights and power, and misguided policies. Higher income in many cases increases the pressure on the environment. This will in particular be the case when investments and purchased inputs are used to increase the capacity to exploit natural resources, and where pollution is related to the use of fossil fuels. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Navigating Water Challenges in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta: How Can a Shift in Water Management Help?,"The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) is currently grappling with multiple water challenges. These challenges stem from the alteration of the Mekong River’s natural flows caused by upstream hydropower development, unpredictable rainfall patterns, and local policies that prioritize agricultural production. This article examines how these combined stressors have prompted a shift in water management strategies—from focusing onwater expulsion to water retention—to tackle water scarcity and achieve long-term water security in the VMD. Case studies from An Giang and Ben Tre showcase evolving water management approaches, revealing how state-led expansions of water infrastructure have contributed to water scarcity and increased the vulnerability of rural inhabitants. Achieving sustainable water security requires integrating empirical research with policy in sights by considering the complex dynamics of local and trans boundary water conditions, as well as the contestations between state-driven water management strategies and livelihood preferences of local farmers. We advocate for a balanced approach that recognizes and utilizes diverse water resources for rural livelihood development, particularly in coastalzones. While freshwater remains essential for agriculture and household needs, incorporating brackish and saline water into local development strategies can better align with farmers’ aspirations for sustainable and profitable livelihoods. © 2025 East-West Center.",Not About Sufficiency

Policies and incentive mechanisms for the permanent adoption of agricultural carbon sequestration practices in industrialized and developing countries,"Scientists agree that soil degradation continues to be a key limiting factor for agricultural sustainability, despite decades of research to improve soil conservation and other sustainable practices (Barrett et al., 2002; Scherr, 1999; Hudson, 1991; Sanchez, 2002). The prevailing economic explanation for the continuing loss of natural resources in many parts of the world is that economic incentives often encourage degradation and discourage conservation. In industrialized countries, with well-developed market institutions, these incentive problems are generally associated with what are known as “externalities” and “market failures.” In developing countries, with lessdeveloped market institutions, these incentive problems are often attributed to high discount rates that poor farmers apply when assessing the future, lack of capital markets, high transport costs and other market imperfections, adverse government policies, insecure property rights, and limited availability of fodder for livestock and domestic uses (Lutz et al., 1994; Scherr, 1999; Antle and Diagana, 2003). Thus, numerous important factors must be considered in assessing the potential for soil carbon sequestration in order to address the problem of agricultural sustainability and associated problems of soil degradation and poverty. © 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
"Motivations, enablers and barriers to the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by smallholder farmers: Evidence from the transitional and savannah agroecological zones of Ghana","This paper examined the prioritized climate-smart agricultural practices by smallholder farmers, the motivations of adopting climate-smart agricultural practices, the enablers to the successful adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices, and the barriers to the successful adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices in the transitional and savannah agroecological zones of Ghana. Specifically, we employed ethnographic research using participatory approaches, including two stakeholder workshops and household surveys with 1061 households in the transitional and savannah agroecological zones of Ghana. The Weighted Average Index (WAI) and Problem Confrontation Index (PCI) were used to rank smallholder farmers’ perceived enablers to the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices and the barriers affecting climate-smart agricultural practices, respectively. Results suggest that the majority of the respondents used a suite of climate-smart agricultural practices, including the timely harvesting of produce and storage, emergency seed banking, appropriate and timely weed and pest control, and early planting as practices to build climate resilience. The majority of smallholder farmers primarily employed climate-smart agricultural practices to improve household food security (96.2%), reduce pests and diseases (95.6%), and obtain higher yields and greater farm income (93.2%). Findings also show that secured land tenure system arrangement, understanding the effects of climate change, and access to sustainable agricultural technologies were ranked the first, second, and third most important enablers to the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices with the WAI values of 2.86, 2.75, and 2.70, respectively. Key barriers to the successful adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices included incidences of pests and diseases (PCI = 2530), inadequate access to agricultural credit (PCI = 2502), high cost of improved crop varieties (PCI = 2334), and limited government support with farm inputs (PCI = 2296). Smallholder farmers need to be better supported through the provision of appropriate institutional and policy arrangements together with improved land management extension advice to overcome these barriers and facilitate the more effective implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices in Ghana. © 2022 Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Not About Sufficiency
Murine rodents: Late but highly successful invaders,"Prior to European settlement the Australian continental landmass (i.e. Australia plus the main island of New Guinea; Figure 10.1) was successfully invaded by only four groups of placental mammals: bats (Chapter 8), rodents, primates (our own species) and the dog (which almost certainly came with people; Chapter 19). Not surprisingly, bats were the earliest and in many respects, the most successful invaders (Hand 2006). Bats colonised Australia at least nine times, commencing sometime prior to the Early Eocene (Hand et al. 1994) when Australia was still connected to other Gondwanan landmasses. At the other end of the geological timescale, humans entered the region only during the late Pleistocene (c. 50 thousand years ago; kya) despite a much longer occupancy of islands to the immediate north (Morwood et al. 1999). Later still, the dog was transported to Australia around 4000years ago (see Chapter 19). Rodents represent the middle ground in the history of placental invasion of Australia. They first entered the Australasian region during the late Miocene, after northward drift had brought the Australian continental plate into collisional contact with the Asian Plate (Lee et al. 1981). Despite the proximity of landmasses, the journey from Asia to Australasia still involved multiple water crossings, even during periods of low sea levels. Ultimately, only one of the many different kinds of rodents found in Asia proved fit for the challenge – the true rats and mice of the family Muridae – but members of this group succeeded on multiple occasions through natural dispersal and, more recently, with human assistance. At the time of European settlement Australia supported around 66 species of native rats and mice, more species than in any family of marsupials or bats. Murine diversity is even more pronounced on the island of New Guinea and its major satellites to the north, with 114 species of native rodents already known and more being discovered (Helgen 2005a, b; Musser et al. 2008; Helgen and Helgen 2009; Musser and Lunde 2010). Native rodents thus comprised around 29% of the native terrestrial mammal fauna of Australia, and around 59% of that of the Melanesian islands. These figures do not rest comfortably with the common notion of Australasia as a continent of marsupials – but they do point to a fascinating history of invasion by what is clearly a highly successful evolutionary lineage. © Cambridge University Press 2014.",Not About Sufficiency
Modelling the implications of sustainable supply chain management practises on firm performance: the mediating role of green performance,"The influx of the Paris Accord on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development have reiterated the need to reconsider how extractive companies manage their supply chains and see how well they balance economic value, social equity and environmental friendliness, especially in the context of an emerging economy. The purpose of this article is to build a conceptual model that examines the relationship between sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practises and firm performance (FP), as well as the mediating role of green performance (GP). A quantitative approach and survey design have been used to garner data from the extractive industry in Ghana. Our hypothesised relationships have been tested using the variance-based structural equation modelling (SEM) and Smart-PLS software version 3.3.1. The results have shown that SSCM practises such as green purchasing, reverse logistics, internal environment management and environmental corporation positively relate to FP. Our probing results have further shown that GP significantly mediates the relationship between SSCM practises and financial performance (FP). The practical implications of the article include the emergence of an integrated baseline model that explains the symbiotic relationships between SSCM practises, environmental factors and firms’ performance. Moreover, policymakers, practitioners and advocacy groups are able to identify sustainable factors that affect firms’ performance under safe environmental conditions in order to advance the adoption and realisation of sustainable consumption and production practises as well as climate mitigation actions within Ghana’s extractive industry, in accordance with sustainable development goals (SDGs) Twelve and Thirteen. © 2024 The Author(s).

Recovered phosphorus for a more resilient urban agriculture: Assessment of the fertilizer potential of struvite in hydroponics,"Urban agriculture (UA) is a means for cities to become more resilient in terms of food sovereignty while shortening the distance between production and consumption. However, intensive soilless UA still depends on the use of fertilizers, which relies on depleting non-renewable resources such as phosphorous (P) and causes both local and global impact for its production and application. With the aim to reduce such impacts and encourage a more efficient use of nutrients, this study assesses the feasibility of using struvite precipitated from an urban wastewater treatment plant as the unique source of P fertilizer. To do so, we apply various quantities of struvite (ranging from 1 to 20 g/plant) to the substrate of a hydroponic Phaseolus vulgaris crop and determine the yield, water flows and P balances. The results show that treatments with more than 5 g of struvite per plant produced a higher yield (maximum of 181.41 g/plant) than the control (134.6 g/plant) with mineral fertilizer (KPO4H2). On the other hand, P concentration in all plant organs was always lower when using struvite than when using chemical fertilizer. Finally, the fact that different amounts of struvite remained undissolved in all treatments denotes the importance to balance between a correct P supply to the plant and a decrease of P lost through the leachates, based on the amount of struvite and the irrigated water. The findings of this study show that it is feasible for UA to efficiently use locally recovered nutrients such as P to produce local food. © 2018 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Evaluating sustainability criteria for a marine protected area in Veracruz, Mexico","Marine protected areas are designed to protect natural resources within their limits. The National Park Veracruz Reef System was declared a protected area in 1992, however in the ensuing 17 years only limited measures have been taken to reduce harvesting within the area. This study was conducted as a base line to evaluate the sustainability of the park area in the present open access regime. Indicators were selected based upon sustainability attributes and criteria previously defined, patterned after a method used to evaluate sustainability in agricultural systems. To evaluate the selected indicators questionnaires were applied to the inhabitants of three fishing communities surrounding the park. Results show a precarious sustainability index for the reef system of 45.87%. We observed differences in the sustainability indices for the three communities when a classification and ordination analysis were applied. Also, applying this analysis to the indices, we found differences between social and economic criteria. The application of this kind of evaluation for the management of the area is discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Mechanical Characterization of Biocomposites Reinforced with Untreated and 4% NaOH-Treated Sisal and Jute Fibres,"Composites reinforced with natural fibres have gained popularity compared to synthetic fibre-reinforced polymer composites due to their environmental sustainability, despite their reduced stiffness and load-bearing capability. In this work, the biocomposites reinforced with sisal and jute fibres which are made by hand layup technique were investigated for mechanical and water absorption characteristics. The effect of a 4 percent NaoH treatment concentration on the aforementioned properties was investigated. The specimens' tensile and flexural broken surfaces were morphologically characterized to investigate microstructural failures. The experimental results show that, compared to untreated fibre-reinforced composites, the biocomposites reinforced with 4 percent NaoH-treated fibre exhibit higher tensile, flexural, and impact strengths, as well reduced water absorption rate. These composites are aimed to be used for strengthening existing civil structures as a retrofitting element. © 2022 D. P. Archana et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Investigating the antecedents of general purpose technologies: A patent perspective in the green energy field,"This study analyzes how general purpose technologies are developed within the green energy field, by examining the relationship between search breadth across diverse knowledge domains and the technological generality of the resulting inventions.

Board governance and ESG performance in Tokyo stock exchange-listed automobile companies: An empirical analysis,"The study investigated the impact of board characteristics on the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance of automobile companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It aimed to discern how corporate governance affects these firms, focusing on both medium and larger-sized companies. The central research question was: How do board characteristics impact the ESG performance of automobile companies? Data from Thomson Reuters Eikon for 32 automobile companies, spanning 2005 to 2021, were analyzed, with the companies categorized into medium (15) and larger-sized (17) classifications. The study employed random and fixed effect models and utilized Hausman specification tests to validate the consistency and efficiency of the fixed effect model against the random effect model. To address endogeneity, a two-step robust GMM methodology was applied. Results revealed intriguing findings: board gender diversity and meetings had a negative and insignificant impact on ESG performance, while non-executive directors had a detrimental and significant effect. Conversely, board size, educational background, CEO dual roles, and independent board members positively and significantly influenced ESG performance in these automobile companies. Given the significant impact identified, it is recommended to reconsider the composition of non-executive directors. A more balanced approach could mitigate the observed detrimental effect on ESG performance. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Community adaptation to climate change on burn-prone peatlands: A case study in wetland area of South Kalimantan,"Peatland fires always occur repeatedly, especially in the dry season. The long dry season has resulted in the expansion of burned peatlands. Communities on peatlands prone to fire need to adapt to climate change. The purpose of this study is to analyze the adaptation made by the community to face climate change in peatland areas that are prone to burning. Data collection in this study will use field observations, interviews, and secondary data related to the adaptation carried out by the community. The informant in this study was a volunteer community member who joined the Fire Care Community (MPA) in the Banjarbaru area, a fire-prone area in South Kalimantan. The results showed that various forms of adaptation have been carried out by the community, including managing peatlands appropriately and innovations to avoid drought and fires in the dry season. They have local knowledge and local traditions in recognizing climate change that will impact fires on peatlands. The existence of drilled wells and various fire suppression technologies is a form of adaptation the community makes to fires that often occur in the dry season. Through various adaptations carried out by these communities, they can reduce the risk of peatland fires due to climate change. 2025 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
A BLUE NEW DEAL: Why We Need a New Politics for the Ocean,"The ocean sustains life on our planet, from absorbing carbon to regulating temperatures, and, as we exhaust the resources to be found on land, it is becoming central to the global market. But today we are facing two urgent challenges at sea: massive environmental destruction, and spiraling inequality in the ocean economy. Chris Armstrong reveals how existing governing institutions are failing to respond to the most pressing problems of our time, arguing that we must do better. Armstrong examines these crises—from the fate of people whose lands will be submerged by sea level rise, to the exploitation of people working in fishing, to the rights of marine animals—and makes the case for a powerful World Ocean Authority capable of tackling them. A Blue New Deal presents a radical manifesto for putting equality, democracy, and sustainability at the heart of ocean politics. © 2022 Chris Armstrong.",Not About Sufficiency
The performance of global forest governance: Three contrasting perspectives,"The scope and complexity of international forest-related governance have expanded tremendously over the last decades. As many as 41 ‘institutional elements’ were counted by scholars (from UNFF to UNFCCC to SDGs). The questions of how these governance arrangements ‘perform’, for what purpose and for whom are widely contested between scholars and practitioners. This paper compares three different analytical frames, which have been employed by some of the authors. These are 1) the consequences of a fragmented regime complex, 2) the global-local nexus and 3) the critical global political economy. The frames map out their contributions and key differences in analytical perspective and help focus and advance debates. Each perspective is based on different theories, epistemologies and methodological approaches and hence yields different key results. The first frame emphasises institutional and policy fragmentation, the symbolic nature of the agreements and the ineffectiveness of the policy measures; the second shows progress in discourses, institutional design, and on-the-ground performance, while the third finds global governance has reinforced inequalities in power and access to land and natural resources. All authors agree, however, that a shift in the balance of power and novel actor coalitions are necessary to change the current global forest governance trajectory significantly. They also acknowledge the need for much greater diversity in voice and representation in both the research and practice of global forest governance. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Microbial flocculants as an excellent alternative to synthetic flocculants for industrial application: A comprehensive review,"Flocculation is used to effectively separate suspended colloids in domestic and industrial wastewater. Flocculants are classified into three categories as organic, inorganic and natural flocculants. Its flocculating properties, ease of use and commercial use have led to the widespread use of organic and inorganic flocculants. However, it can cause serious health problems due to its carcinogenicity and neurotoxicity. Therefore, natural bioflocculants are used to treat wastewater without harming humans and the environment. Natural flocculants are non-toxic, environmentally friendly and capable of flotation even at low concentrations. This article also discusses the classification, functions, mechanisms and applications of flocculants. Applications of natural flocculants and flocculation efficiency in the treatment of industrial wastes such as food, heavy metal and dyeing are discussed. Future studies will use methods to understand how agricultural and food wastes are used for cost-effective bioflocculant production.

Poultry,"Consumption of chicken has increased in many countries due to its beneficial health effects and nutritional value (Chouliara et al., 2007). Poultry meat is very susceptible to spoilage, and its stability and microbiological safety are based on a combination of various factors in order not to be contaminated by microorganisms (Chun et al., 2009). The spoilage of fresh poultry products, apart from being an economic burden to the producer, may also cause health problems, since poultry meat is likely to contain pathogenic microorganisms (Geornaras et al., 1998). The main bacterial pathogens occurring in chicken are Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter jejuni, present in the intestinal microflora of the chicken (Anang et al., 2007). Application of MAP has the potential to suppress microbial growth and extend the shelf life of foods (Zardetto, 2005). According to Brody (1996), “nearly a third of all fresh poultry in North America is master-packaged in bulk under modified atmospheres for distribution to retail grocery and hotel, restaurant and institutional outlets.” The success of MAP depends on several factors such as gas mixture composition, initial microbial meat quality, temperature control, packaging properties, and the efficiency of equipment used (Taylor, 1996). © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Impact of Waste Disposal Sites on the Local Water Resources: A Case Study of the Kiteezi landfill, Uganda","There is a knowledge gap on the extent of the impact of waste disposal sites on water resources in Uganda. This study assessed the effectiveness of the leachate treatment process and the extent of water pollution by the leachate at the biggest sanitary landfill in East Africa, the Kiteezi landfill. Samples of leachate, surface water and groundwater were collected in and around the landfill for four months. Results showed that leachate treatment at the landfill is ineffective for reducing its pollution potential; all the measured parameters, except nitrate and sodium, were above Uganda's National Standards for Effluent Discharge after treatment. Treated leachate had higher pH (9.1 ± 0.10), EC (22,384 ± 879 µS/cm), and concentrations of nitrate (0.469 ± 0.035 mg/L) and potassium (320 ± 30 mg/L) than the untreated leachate, but lower ammonium concentration. The groundwater had very high concentration of ammonium (range: 67.8 – 1313 mg/L), indicating possible pollution by leachate. Additionally, surface water from the point at which untreated leachate enters the Kitetikka stream had values comparable to raw leachate for all measured parameters. The study recommends the improvement of the leachate collection and treatment system to reduce untreated leachate flow into the surface water. Further study into the health impact of the water quality on the local community is essential. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Climate Change Adaptation Among Smallholder Farmers in Rural Ghana,"Climate change has the potential to disrupt sustainable development initiatives, particularly in developing economies. A substantial body of literature reveals that developing economies are vulnerable to climate change, due to high dependency on climate-sensitive sectors, such as agriculture. In Ghana, a growing body of literature has revealed multiple adaptation strategies adopted by smallholder farmers to respond to and reduce climate change impacts. However, there is a dearth of literature on the effectiveness of adaptation strategies. This chapter explores the adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers and analyzed the predictors of effective adaptation. Through the technique of simple random sampling, 378 smallholder farmers were selected, and data was collected using a questionnaire survey. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed using the SPSS software. The findings indicate that smallholder farmers adopt multiple adaptation strategies to reduce the impact of climate change. In addition, it is revealed that marital status, years of farming experience, knowledge of climate change, and education are significant predictors of adaptation. Moreover, the chapter found that marital status, weedicide application, change in staple food consumption, and planting of early-maturing crops are good predictors of effective adaptation. The chapter recommends the need to intensify adaptation strategies through agricultural extension programs and interventions that improve rural food security and livelihood. In addition, the chapter recommends strengthening the capacity of farmer organizations and rural institutions, particularly agricultural extension and advisory services. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
Nicotine dependance and carbon monoxide intoxication amonng adult smokers,"Background: The high nicotine dependence is one of the contributing factors to failure of attempts to quit. Moreover, the carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication, proportional to the intensity of smoking, is the basis of cardiovascular complications. Objectives: To describe tobacco consumption and the degree of CO intoxication, as well as to assess nicotine dependence and identify its determinants in a population of adult smokers. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study, based on a selfadministered questionnaire and a dosage of CO in expired air among smokers who participated in awareness sessions conducted in public places and academic institutions in the city of Monastir. Multivariate analysis was based on a binary logistic regression. Results: A total of 914 smokers participated in our survey whose mean age was 29.5 ± 12.4 years. More than 2/3 of cases (68.7 %) were strongly addicted to nicotine. Heavy smokers (consumption > 20 cigarettes / day) accounted for 28 % of subjects aged under 30 and 59% of older adults (p < 10-4). Determinants of strong tobacco dependence were age of first cigarette ( OR = 0.912) , duration of tobacco consumption (OR = 1.059) , alcohol consumption (OR = 1.764) , sedentarity (OR = 2.024) and the rate expired CO (OR = 1.059) . The mean rate of exhaled CO was 13.1 ± 11.1 ppm. It was positively correlated with Fagerström score (r = 0.5, p < 10-4) and the number of cigarettes smoked before dosing CO (r = 0.6, p < 10-4). In the contrary, it was negatively correlated to the time elapsed between the last cigarette and the test (r = - 0.2, p = 0.001). Conclusion: The results of this study focused on smoking addiction and its determinants. They encourage us to strengthen efforts for effective implementation of the WHO Framework Convention of Tobacco control in Tunisia. © 2011 LA TUNISIE MEDICALE.

"Inequality thresholds, governance and gender economic inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa","Inequality and gender economic exclusion are major policy concerns facing sub-Saharan Africa in the post-2015 development agenda. This paper identifies ‘thresholds’ of inequality that should not be exceeded if governance is to promote gender economic participation. The research focuses on 42 countries in sub-Saharan Africa using annual data from 2004 to 2014. The empirical work utilises the Generalized Method of Moments. The following findings are established. First, inequality (i.e. the Gini coefficient) levels that completely nullify the positive effect of governance on female labour force participation are 0.708 for political stability, 0.601 for voice & accountability, 0.588 for government effectiveness, 0.631 for regulatory quality, 0.612 for the rule of law, and 0.550 for corruption-control. Second, inequality thresholds at which female unemployment can no longer be mitigated by governance channels include: 0.561 for political stability and 0.465 for the rule of law. Third, inequality levels that completely dampen the positive impact of governance on female employment are 0.608 for political stability, 0.580 for voice & accountability, 0.581 for government effectiveness, and 0.557 for the rule of law. As the main policy implication, for good governance to promote gender economic inclusion, inequality levels should not exceed such thresholds. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
"Maps, volunteered geographic information (VGI) and the spatio-discursive construction of nature","This paper interrogates the role that spatial media such as maps and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) play in the construction and mobilisation of representations of nature. Drawing on poststructural political ecology, critical cartography, and GIScience, this article engages maps and VGI as discursive mechanisms that solidify and convey meanings and representations of nature tied to broader strategies of commodification. Particularly, we explore how spatial media reproduces and legitimises discursive strategies that rationalise the reconciliation of economic development and conservation through nature-based tourism by producing new ways of nature commodification. Drawing on evidence from Patagonia-Aysén, Chile, this paper examines the intersections between the discourse of nature encoded within institutional tourist maps and advertisements, and within the VGI platform for travellers, TripAdvisor. This illustrative case shows, firstly, how tourist maps and advertisements have contributed to normalising a discursive construction of nature as pristine, grandiose, sublime and wild that has not only secured aesthetics as ontological qualities of nature, but also as embedded values that protect ‘nature’ as a commodity to consume. Secondly, our findings evidence that TripAdvisor emerges out of this context as content that mobilises individual perceptions of and narratives about Patagonian nature that is already mediated by this dominant discourse. This dynamic suggests that VGI constitutes a new form of discursive power that digitally reproduces and mobilises a dominant discourse of nature, (re)producing what we term ‘discursive digital nature’. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Managing sustainable microfinance institutions in the covid-19 situation through revitalizing balinese cultural identity,"Managing microfinance institutions in Bali, Indonesia, is very dependent on the philosophy of culture of harmony as a guide for people to live in harmony with other people and the environment around them. This basis makes microfinance institutions stronger compared to other microfinance institutions in Indonesia. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic situation has paralyzed Bali’s economy, prompting company leaders to look inward and outward to keep the business running sustainably. The main purpose of this study is to analyze a comprehensive and broader view of how companies identify the drive for sustainability without eliminating practices and values that are following the culture of the Balinese people of Indonesia. Experimental data were obtained from native Balinese as influential corporate leaders and executive agencies. The results show that responsive leadership is the leading force in dealing with the Covid-19 problem from an internal approach. On the other hand, from an external point of view, the main determining factor is the difference in the company’s ability to make it difficult for the government to handle problems. This research combines both companies with internal and external motivations for sustainability and how cultural values influence sustainability drives. This is based on cultural identity having a strategic role in microfinance institutions in Bali. Therefore steps are needed to revitalize a culture of harmony related to strategy formulation and implementation in microfinance institutions to gain competitive advantage and organizational performance. © 2021, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

Blue carbon as just transition? A structured literature review,"Non-technical summary Substantive carbon is sequestered in mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass, and other marine ecosystems. Blue carbon is considered to offer potential for enhanced carbon sequestration. Bringing blue carbon to market, however, presents risks to local people and communities with livelihood and other connections to these environments. While efforts are forged to establish payments for ecosystem services, blue carbon presents critical challenges to social and environmental justice. In this paper, we synthesize insights from relevant literature and provide direction for future research on the social and cultural dimensions of blue carbon.Technical summary Blue carbon has been proposed as a nature-based solution to mitigate climate change and is the focus of concerted scientific and policy attention. The rush to operationalize blue carbon however, presents significant risks for social and environmental justice where it intersects with inequality and marginalization. To date, the reasonable and just consequences of the social transformation that will accompany blue carbon are under-examined. We undertake a structured literature review of research published over the past decade that addresses the social and cultural dimensions of blue carbon, and chart four themes: (1) conceptual issues, (2) governance issues; (3) emergent lessons (from practice); and (4) future research directions that address: social acceptability; processes to address social justice including engagement, participation, and benefit sharing; information and data deficits; and institutional governance reform. If the stated opportunities are to be fully realized, we argue the social and cultural dimensions of blue carbon, and its intersections with social justice, must be attended to explicitly and clarified.Social media summary Just transitions to climate change mean attending to people, culture, and livelihoods as blue carbon is operationalized.",Not About Sufficiency

Animal Cities: Beastly Urban Histories,"Animal Cities builds upon a recent surge of interest about animals in the urban context. Considering animals in urban settings is now a firmly established area of study and this book presents a number of valuable case studies that illustrate some of the perspectives that may be adopted. Having an ‘urban history’ flavour, the book follows a fourfold agenda. First, the opening chapters look at working and productive animals that lived and died in nineteenth-century cities such as London, Edinburgh and Paris. The argument here is that their presence yields insights into evolving understandings of the category ‘urban’ and what made a good city. Second, there is a consideration of nineteenth-century animal spectacles, which influenced contemporary interpretations of the urban experience. Third, the theme of contested animal spaces in the city is explored further with regard to backyard chickens in suburban Australia. Finally, there is discussion of the problem of the public companion animal and its role in changing attitudes to public space, illustrated with a chapter on dog-walking in Victorian and Edwardian London. Animal Cities makes a significant contribution to animal studies and is of interest to historical geographers, urban, cultural, social and economic historians and historians of policy and planning. © Peter Atkins 2012.",Not About Sufficiency

The uneven distribution of silver nanoprisms in the electrodes is expected to induce asymmetry in local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) under broad band light illumination, producing a lead-lag in the carrier injection into the semiconducting layer. The nanolevel asymmetry in silver electrodes along with the photoresponse characteristics of a few layers of the MoS2 system is identified as the plausible reason for the self-powered and dual-polarity photoresponse displayed by the device. The energy band diagram is analyzed to substantiate the device behavior. © 2023 American Chemical Society",Not About Sufficiency
Level of dependence to electronic cigarettes in medical students at the University of the Pacific in the year 2023,"Introduction: electronic cigarettes are devices whose purpose is to mimic the smoking experience. Although they are promoted as a less harmful alternative to conventional cigarettes, their effects on health are not harmless. General objective: to determine the level of dependence on electronic cigarettes among medical students at the Universidad del Pacífico. Methodology: a cross-sectional descriptive observational study was carried out where the IDCE questionnaire was applied to medical students during the month of July 2023, classifying them as non-dependent, with low dependence, with moderate dependence, dependence with signs of high dependence, high dependence. Results: we studied 142 students with a mean age of 24 ± 5 years where 51,4 % (73) were male, 45,8 % (65) were from the Central Department and 34,5 % (49) from Asuncion. It was found that 35,3 % (30) of those who smoked electronic cigarettes had a level of dependence with signs of high dependence, 30,6 % (26) had a moderate level of dependence and 12,9 % (11) had a high level of dependence. Conclusion: the level of dependence found in this work was mainly with high dependence onset signs followed by high level dependence. © Autor(es); 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Governance and stewardship for research data and information sharing: Issues and prospective solutions in the transdisciplinary plant phenotyping and imaging research center network,"Societal Impact Statement: High-throughput plant phenotyping is a transdisciplinary field of research that provides a systematic approach to assessing and understanding the life cycle of plants and aims to integrate plant genotype with plant ecophysiology and agronomy. Sharing data and information (D&I) is key to accelerating new scientific breakthroughs and innovations in plant phenotyping. The development of a governance and stewardship framework can overcome institutional, legal, and technical barriers that limit D&I sharing. This framework governs how decisions are made about D&I, how researchers engage with each other to manage D&I, and improves the content, discoverability, accessibility, and usability of D&I from different sources. Summary: Despite the widely acknowledged value to be added by sharing research data and information (D&I), significant institutional, legal, and technical barriers remain to be addressed, particularly in managing transdisciplinary research. The Plant Phenotyping and Imaging Research Centre (P2IRC) offers an illuminating case study in how various researchers are exchanging their D&I to accommodate the requirements of transdisciplinary research. Using social network analysis to explore the current state of D&I sharing in P2IRC, we found that D&I sharing was modest, with most exchanges taking place between academic researchers and predominantly within the same discipline. Lacking benefits arising from broader dissemination, scholars are not optimally sharing their D&I. Many researchers identified a range of barriers that limited sharing. These barriers are mainly rooted in the absence of D&I governance and stewardship. To overcome barriers, we offer recommendations and solutions for developing a governance and stewardship framework that is tailored to the P2IRC project, but relevant to the wider research world. This includes how to assist adoption of a governance model, accountability and oversight mechanisms, and an operational framework for effective data collection, analysis, possession, and dissemination. We provide recommendations that enable data stewards to preserve and improve the content, discoverability accessibility, and usability of data and metadata by making data interoperable from semantic, syntactic/technical, and legal perspectives. A governance framework would help open all aspects of research outputs, while achieving the access and benefit-sharing (ABS) goal and contributing to the preservation and sustainable use of D&I. © 2021 The Authors.

Reflecting on species diversity and regeneration dynamics of scientific forest management practices in Nepal,"Implementation of sustainable forest management approaches, balancing mass timber production and intact ecosystem services through maintaining species diversity, has ever been the challenges for policy makers and practitioners in tropical forestry. Scientific forest management (SciFM) is a popular management approach that is increasingly adopted in Sal (Shorea robusta) dominated forests of Nepal, aiming to accelerate timber production and to improve forest condition. Being based on specific management plan, SciFM practices involve application of various silvicultural practices to manipulate forest composition and stand structure referring to the whole rotation period of a particular forest stand. Of the various aspects of SciFM, we aim to quantify the effect of SciFM on species diversity and regeneration dynamics, and compare diversity indices and regeneration attributes between managed and unmanaged forest stand in lowlands of Nepal, through establishment of permanent sample plots and its measurement in 2014 and 2018. Data collection about plant species and regeneration attributes was carried out in 50 sample plots of size 10 m × 10 m, established by stratified random sampling using quadrat method. Data analysis was done by using various diversity indices and compared through paired t-test. We also carried out correlation and regression analysis of diversity indices with predictor variables; such as canopy cover, number of individuals ha−1, basal area ha−1 and site productivity index. Our study found that plant diversity is significantly decreased but the concentration of dominance is significantly increased in managed forest blocks. Diversity indices were found to have a higher degree of relationship with number of individuals ha−1 and canopy cover as compared to site productivity index and basal area ha−1. Similarly, seedling density and sapling density is found to be increased in managed blocks, ensuring the production and productivity of forest stand sustainably. Based on our analysis, we argue that opening of canopy through regeneration felling is important in promoting regeneration establishment and growth but further research is needed to balance the species diversity along with the practice of intensive management interventions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Information provision and energy consumption: Evidence from a field experiment,"Energy consumption and the residential real estate market are closely related, leading to a multitude of policy interventions targeted to reduce the carbon externality from the housing market. Feedback provision regarding household energy consumption is considered a low-cost strategy for promoting energy conservation. Although various studies investigate the impact of information feedback on energy consumption, less is known about the heterogeneity of these responses. In this paper, we report the findings from a field experiment where participants are exposed to consumption feedback through the use of in-home displays during two discrete stages. The results show that information provision reduces electricity consumption by around 20%, on average, relative to a sample of non-treated households. Importantly, we also show that this average effect significantly differs based on the time of day and across the treatment group. Most of the feedback effect occurs during off-peak hours, and clusters among households that are older and that are most focused on energy conservation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Protected Area Governance and Its Influence on Local Perceptions, Attitudes and Collaboration","Globally, protected areas are faced with a myriad of threats emanating principally from anthropogenic drivers, which underpins the importance of the human element in protected area management. Delving into the “exclusive” and “inclusive” approaches to nature conservation discourse, this study explored the extent to which local communities collaborate in the management of protected areas and how the governance regime of these areas influences local perceptions and attitudes. Data for the study were collected through stakeholder interviews, focus group discussions as well as a probe into participating groups’ collective perceptions and opinions on certain key issues. A total of 51 focus group discussions were held in 45 communities involving 630 participants. The analysis was done using qualitative methods and simple case counts to explain levels of acceptance or dislike of issues. The results showed that the objectives of state-managed protected areas, by their nature, tend to exclude humans and negatively influence local perceptions and attitudes. This, in addition to human-wildlife conflicts and high handedness by officials on protected area offenders, affects community collaboration. The study concluded that for protected area management to be effective, effort must be made to positively influence local perceptions and attitudes by promoting “win-win-win” partnerships among all stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors.

Design new organic material based on triphenylamine (TPA) with D-π-A-π-D structure used as an electron donor for organic solar cells: A DFT approach,"Because of the increasing scarcity of fossil fuels and the growing need for energy, it has become necessary to research new renewable energy resources. In this study, five new high-performance materials (TP-FA1F-TP - TP-FA5F-TP) of the D-π-A-π-D configuration based on triphenylamine (TPA) were theoretically investigated by applying DFT and TD-DFT methods for future application as heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ). The influence of the modification of the acceptor (A) of the parent molecule TP-FTzF-TP on the structural, electronic, photovoltaic and optical properties of the TP-FA1F-TP - TP-FA5F-TP organic molecules was investigated in detail. TP-FA1F-TP - TP-FA5F-TP showed Egap in the interval of 1.44–2.01 eV with λabs in the range of 536–774 nm, open-circuit voltage (Voc) values varied between 0.3 and 0.56 V and power conversion efficiencies (PCE) ranging from (3-6) %. Our results also show that the donor molecules suggested in this research exhibit an improved performance compared to the recently synthesized TP-FTzF-TP, such as a lowest HOMO energy, a smaller Egap, and a greater absorption spectrum, and can lead to higher performance. Indeed, this theoretical research could lead to the future synthesis of better compounds as active substances used in BHJ. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Proximity to Neighborhood Services and Property Values in Urban Area: An Evaluation through the Hedonic Pricing Model,"Neighborhood services, property attributes, and their associated amenities have positive impacts on land and property values. This impact is estimated by the hedonic pricing model, which is considered an effective method used in previous studies for such evaluations. The study uses Geographical Information Science by digitizing the point of interest in the study area for spatial modeling of data collection points and multi-linear regression as a statistical analysis of hedonic measurements. The hedonic measurements include the data of structural, locational, environmental, and community attributes of a property at a given time and space at a walkable distance from the neighborhood for measuring proximity. The results of the study are represented through the summary of the regression model, which expresses the impact of every individual variable on the entire value of the property, and the appropriateness of the results is shown by values R, R2, and adjusted R2. The result of the study concluded that property characteristics are varied from location to location, and that is why it is difficult to measure the exact market values, particularly in areas that lack urban planning and heterogeneous data. Research on such burning issues is essential for sustainable urban development. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Biochar modified by ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate for high selective adsorption of copper in wastewater,"Biochar application in wastewater purification is extremely appealing. Although heteropolysaccharides like Gum Seyal biochar (BC GS500) display great surface area and porosity, the adsorption capacity for Cu (II) was relatively low due to the week-binding surface functional groups. In this work, an innovative modification with the chelating agent ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) capable of selectively and effectively adsorbing Cu (II) was conducted. Gum Seyal biochar was grafted with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (C5H8NS2–), amine (–NH2), and imine (–NH) groups using APDC based on the “hard and soft acids and bases theory” (HSAB). Batch studies, along with characterization (FITR, XPS, and SEM-EDS), molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) mapping, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, were implemented to investigate the adsorption performance and mechanism responsible for selectively adsorptive Cu (II) removal. It was found that Cu (II) adsorption by modified biochar occurred endothermically and spontaneously. The adsorption data at pH 5 matched the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm (211.24 mg/g). DFT calculations show that modified biochar selectively binds Cu (II) superior to common ions such as Mg (II) and Ca (II) through a unique chelating mechanism. Their performance in real electroplating wastewater was investigated, and the production cost was estimated. It was concluded that the modified biochar (BC APDC) could have high applicable potential for Cu (II)-laden wastewater purification. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Hybrid PVP/Battery/Fuel Cell Wireless Charging Stations Using High-Frequency Optimized Inverter Technology for Electric Vehicles,"The design and integration of intelligent energy management systems in hybrid electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, leveraging industry 4.0 and renewable energy sources, is crucial for advancing sustainability, efficiency, and technological development. The innovative hybrid EV charging station described in this study uses a combination of fuel cells, batteries, and solar panels that run at 14 amps a piece at 240 volts. The system consists of five essential components that work together to transfer power wirelessly: an EV battery bank, a boost converter, an HF inverter, transfer coils, and a power supply. Two crucial phases make up the optimization process. In phase 1, the boost converter’s maximum power point is tracked and optimized to generate the most power possible by varying the duty cycle between 10% and 90%. In phase 2, the HF uses a class ϕ2 inverter at 30 MHz to synchronize with the resonant frequency of wireless power transfer coils. Zero-voltage switching is used by a digital signal processor card to carry out control for effective operations. By utilizing hybrid sources to optimize power transmission, this design improves the sustainability of EV charging options. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Global Inequalities in the Bioeconomy: Thinking Continuity and Change in View of the Global Soy Complex,"As a proposed pathway to societal transformation, the bioeconomy is aimed at providing a sustainable alternative to the fossil-based economy, replacing fossil raw materials with renewable biogenic alternatives. In this conceptual contribution, we argue that it is impossible to transform societies into sustainable bioeconomies considering the narrow boundaries of the bioeconomy as a policy. Drawing on approaches including agro-food studies, cheap food, and agrarian extractivism, we show that the bioeconomy is entangled in a broader context of social relations which call its claim to sustainability into question. Our analysis of the global soy complex, which represents the core of the current agro-food system, demonstrates how the bioeconomy perpetuates global inequalities with regard to trade relations, demand, and supply patterns, as well as power relations between the involved actors from the global to the local level. Against this background, we propose a fundamental rethink of the underlying understanding of transformation in bioeconomy policies. Instead of thinking the bioeconomy only along the lines of ecological modernisation, its proponents should consider studies on social-ecological transformation, which would entail radical structural change of the prevailing food regime to cope with the social-ecological crisis. © 2022 by the authors.

Evaluating the impact of an agricultural land-use change adaptation strategy on household crop production in semi-arid Ghana,"In this study, the Land Use Dynamic Simulator model was applied to investigate the impact of farm credit as an adaptation strategy to cope with effects of climate variability on agricultural land-use change and crop production in the Vea watershed in Ghana. The authors identified the determinants of crop choices within the landscape (e.g., farm household and biophysical characteristics of farm plot). The crop choice sub-model was then linked to the crop yield sub-model to determine the yields of selected crops. In adapting to the impacts of climate variability, the maize credit adoption sub-model under the maize cultivation credit scenario was integrated into decision-making. This was simulated for a 20-year period, and compared with the business-as-usual scenario. Under the simulated maize credit scenario, maize adopters increased from about 20 per cent to about 50 per cent and the area allocated for maize cultivation significantly increased by about 266 per cent. Consequently, the average annual aggregated household crop yield increased by 6.3 per cent higher than in the business-as-usual scenario. This simulation study shows that access to maize credit can significantly influence agricultural land-use change and food availability in the study area. However, although access to farm credit may translate into food availability, the sustainability of this strategy is questionable. © 2020 Department of Geography, National University of Singapore and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
An Empirical Assessment of Households Livelihood Vulnerability: The Case of Rural Ghana,"This study seeks to extend the analytical utility of the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI). Four major contributions were made in this respect; (1) the study introduced institutional influence into the framework, (2) LVI was estimated for each household and results visually presented, making it possible to understand the spatial distribution, (3) it investigated spatial variation of households’ livelihood vulnerability and lastly, (4) results were analysed based on gender (household headship). Mixed methods, including personal observation, structured and unstructured interviews and questionnaire survey (N = 110) were utilized in collecting empirical data. Results show high households livelihood vulnerability, with institutional influence and socio-demographic profile recording the highest and lowest scores respectively. In terms of headship, male-headed households were likely to be more vulnerable than their female counterparts, although the difference were found not statistically significant (0.617 against 0.580). Spatial variation analysis shows differences in spatial distribution of livelihood vulnerability, albeit insignificant differences, indicating that social groups are likely to vary, hence, erroneous to assume homogeneity among study populations. Results clearly suggest rethinking of institutional roles in livelihood activities and mainstreaming of gender into rural development and livelihood policies. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Global Trends in Environmental Flow Assessment: An Overview,"Diminution of riverine ecosystem is one of the major challenging issues which is caused due to the alteration of river flow in order to meet the day to day increase in requirements of human being. These alterations in river flow is mainly due to the construction of storage, diversion and control structures which are primarily for generation of electricity, irrigation and flood control. Recently, environmental flow assessment has advanced in the past decade in order to improve the environmental degradation to certain degree. This paper reviews various methods for assessing environmental flow (EF) and provides global trends. We observe that, most of the methods involve different set of data and time requirements. Moreover, the reliability of results and the level of experience required to apply the different methods are different and that no method is superior over the other. The procedure of environmental flow analysis and application is adaptive which involves likewise fluctuation in EF due to increase in the available information and change in priority and infrastructure. This review of case studies of global rivers provides an insight into the environmental flow assessment obtained through hydrological and hydraulic rating method ranged from 30 to 50% of mean annual flow. Other methods for environmental flow assessment are dependent on various ecosystems. Furthermore, the discussion on various methodologies applicable for EF assessment of Indian rivers is also provided in the article. © 2018, The Institution of Engineers (India).",Not About Sufficiency
Heating choices and residential willingness to pay for clean heating: Evidence from a household survey in rural China,"Due to the severity of climate change, the Chinese government has committed to the carbon neutrality target. Winter heating is a major source of carbon emissions in northern China, and it is urgent to promote the adoption of clean heating in northern rural areas. With indoor-survey data, both two-stage regression and structural equation modeling were used in this study to figure out the exact driving factors and causal relationships of rural households' energy choices considering subjective factors that may influence the energy choices and willingness to pay. Results contradict the energy ladder hypothesis and conclude that it might be caused by energy consumption habits and fuel stacking strategy. Both demographic characteristics and education level have a significant effect on heating energy choices. As for residents' willingness to pay for clean heating, it shows that households’ environmental perceptions, socioeconomic status, and demand for policy subsidies play an important role. Our results make a strong case for policies that shape residents' low-carbon values, promote technological innovation in clean energy, and set reasonable subsidies for clean heating to encourage a clean heating transition. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Assessment of tap water quality and corrosion scales from the selected distribution systems in northern Pakistan,"Corrosion deposits formed within drinking water distribution systems deteriorate drinking water quality and resultantly cause public health consequences. In the present study, an attempt was made to investigate the concurrent conditions of corrosion scales and the drinking water quality in selected water supply schemes (WSS) in districts Chitral, Peshawar, and Abbottabad, northern Pakistan. Characterization analyses of the corrosion by-products revealed the presence of α-FeOOH, γ-FeOOH, Fe3O4, and SiO2 as major constituents with different proportions. The constituents of all the representative XRD peaks of Peshawar WSS were found insignificant as compared to other WSS, and the reason could be the variation of source water quality. Well-crystallized particles in SEM images indicated the formation of dense oxide layer on corrosion by-products. A wider asymmetric vibration peak of SiO2 appeared only in Chitral and Abbottabad WSS, which demonstrated higher siltation in the water source. One-way ANOVA analysis showed significant variations in pH, turbidity, TDS, K, Mg, PO4, Cl, and SO4 values, which revealed that these parameters differently contributed to the source water quality. Findings from this study suggested the implementation of proper corrosion prevention measures and the establishment of international collaboration for best corrosion practices, expertise, and developing standards. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
"Distribution and abundance of sacred monkeys in Igboland, Southern Nigeria","Although primates are hunted on a global scale, some species are protected against harassment and killing by taboos or religious doctrines. Sites where the killing of sacred monkeys or the destruction of sacred groves is forbidden may be integral to the conservation of certain species. In 2004, as part of a distribution survey of Sclater's guenon (Cercopithecus sclateri) in southern Nigeria, we investigated reports of sacred monkeys in the Igbo-speaking region of Nigeria. We confirmed nine new sites where primates are protected as sacred: four with tantalus monkeys (Chlorocebus tantalus) and five with mona monkeys (Cercopithecus mona). During 2004-2006, we visited two communities (Akpugoeze and Lagwa) previously known to harbor sacred populations of Ce. sclateri to estimate population abundance and trends. We directly counted all groups and compared our estimates with previous counts when available. We also estimated the size of sacred groves and compared these with grove sizes reported in the literature. The mean size of the sacred groves in Akpugoeze (2.06 ha, n=10) was similar to others in Africa south of the Sahel, but larger than the average grove in Lagwa (0.49 ha, n=15). We estimated a total population of 124 Sclater's monkeys in 15 groups in Lagwa and 193 monkeys in 20 groups in Akpugoeze. The Akpugoeze population was relatively stable over two decades, although the proportion of infants declined, and the number of groups increased. As Sclater's monkey does not occur in any official protected areas, sacred populations are important to the species' long-term conservation. Despite the monkeys' destruction of human crops, most local people still adhere to the custom of not killing monkeys. These sites represent ideal locations in which to study the ecology of Sclater's monkey and human-wildlife interactions. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Advancing the understanding of treponemal disease in the past and present,"Syphilis was perceived to be a new disease in Europe in the late 15th century, igniting a debate about its origin that continues today in anthropological, historical, and medical circles. We move beyond this age-old debate using an interdisciplinary approach that tackles broader questions to advance the understanding of treponemal infection (syphilis, yaws, bejel, and pinta). How did the causative organism(s) and humans co-evolve? How did the related diseases caused by Treponema pallidum emerge in different parts of the world and affect people across both time and space? How are T. pallidum subspecies related to the treponeme causing pinta? The current state of scholarship in specific areas is reviewed with recommendations made to stimulate future work. Understanding treponemal biology, genetic relationships, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations is crucial for vaccine development today and for investigating the distribution of infection in both modern and past populations. Paleopathologists must improve diagnostic criteria and use a standard approach for recording skeletal lesions on archaeological human remains. Adequate contextualization of cultural and environmental conditions is necessary, including site dating and justification for any corrections made for marine or freshwater reservoir effects. Biogeochemical analyses may assess aquatic contributions to diet, physiological changes arising from treponemal disease and its treatments (e.g., mercury), or residential mobility of those affected. Shifting the focus from point of origin to investigating who is affected (e.g., by age/sex or socioeconomic status) and disease distribution (e.g., coastal/ inland, rural/urban) will advance our understanding of the treponemal disease and its impact on people through time. © 2020 American Association of Physical Anthropologists.",Not About Sufficiency
Techno-ecological synergy: A framework for sustainable engineering,"Even though the importance of ecosystems in sustaining all human activities is well-known, methods for sustainable engineering fail to fully account for this role of nature. Most methods account for the demand for ecosystem services, but almost none account for the supply. Incomplete accounting of the very foundation of human well-being can result in perverse outcomes from decisions meant to enhance sustainability and lost opportunities for benefiting from the ability of nature to satisfy human needs in an economically and environmentally superior manner. This paper develops a framework for understanding and designing synergies between technological and ecological systems to encourage greater harmony between human activities and nature. This framework considers technological systems ranging from individual processes to supply chains and life cycles, along with corresponding ecological systems at multiple spatial scales ranging from local to global. The demand for specific ecosystem services is determined from information about emissions and resource use, while the supply is obtained from information about the capacity of relevant ecosystems. Metrics calculate the sustainability of individual ecosystem services at multiple spatial scales and help define necessary but not sufficient conditions for local and global sustainability. Efforts to reduce ecological overshoot encourage enhancement of life cycle efficiency, development of industrial symbiosis, innovative designs and policies, and ecological restoration, thus combining the best features of many existing methods. Opportunities for theoretical and applied research to make this framework practical are also discussed. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
Projection of sdgs in codes of ethics—case study about lost in translation,"The United Nations’ (UN) drive for sustainability culminates in a recent milestone document, Agenda 2030, which sets forth 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Arguably, these SDGs inspire governments more than they do individual businesses and their embracement and measurement at the business level faces a myriad of shortcomings. A case study of internal declaratory documents about sustainability and other ethical commitments, such as codes of ethics, represents a feasible platform to collect fresh and inside primary data about the projection of SDGs in these codes of ethics, and ultimately in the strategy and daily operations of involved businesses. The representativeness of the sample of 30 businesses is ensured by the size of these businesses, their inter-related nature, and significance in the EU. A holistic approach, along with meta-analysis, comparison, and a combination of automatic keyword-based content analysis and of a manual simplified Delphi-method, allows for the addressing of both underlying burning questions—(i) how SDGs are projected in these codes of ethics and (ii) why not in a perfect manner. The main five findings point out the deep conceptual misunderstandings and shortcomings by businesses, which do not properly work with their codes of ethics, and which could take at least partially the SDG’s guidance. These rather pioneering propositions are not conclusive, due to the inherent and inevitable limitations of the performed case study, and need to be verified over time (longitudinally), while expanding the pool of studied codes of ethics. © 2020 by the authors.

Findings obtained from the Driscoll Kray regression estimator suggest that a rise in income inequality contributes to increasing CO2 emissions. Further, an increase in poverty has a detrimental effect on environmental pollution in Sub-Saharan African countries.

"Fresh validation of the low carbon development hypothesis under the ekc scheme in portugal, italy, greece and spain","The present study is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) that address pertinent global issues. This study focuses on the need for access to clean and affordable energy consumption, responsible energy consumption, sustainable economic growth, and climate change mitigation. To this end, this paper evaluates the relevance of the renewable energy sector on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) framework in Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain for the period 1995–2015. As an econometric strategy, we adopt the use of panel data over the highlighted countries. In the first step, we apply the unit root test recommended by Levin, Lin, and Chu in conjunction with ADF-Fisher, and Phillips-Perron for robustness and consistency. We found that the variables used in this study are integrated I (1) in the first difference. In the second step, we apply the Pedroni cointegration test, and Kao Residual cointegration test, and we observe that the variables are cointegrated in the long run. The generalized least squares (GLS), the panel fully modified least squares (FMOLS), ordinary least squares robust (OLS), and panel quantile regression are considered in this research. The econometric results validate the assumption of the environmental Kuznets curve, i.e., and there is a positive correlation between income per capita and a negative effect of squared income per capita on carbon dioxide emissions. In contrast, we observe that renewable energy reduces CO2 emissions. Finally, we also find a direct connection between the urban population and the environmental degradation in the examined blocs. These results show that in Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain, more is required to achieve environmental sustainability in the respective countries growth trajectory.

Does ESG Reporting Relate to Corporate Financial Performance in the Context of the Energy Sector Transformation? Evidence from Poland,"This paper aims to investigate whether the environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) score of companies operating in the energy sector is associated with their corporate financial performance (CFP). The research covered data from eight companies with a dominant position in the Polish energy sector. The research used the comparative analysis between ESG performance and accounting‐based measures of profitability: return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA) and return on sales (ROS). Additionally, reference was also made to the DuPont model. The acquired results do not reveal repetitive dependencies that would facilitate the discovery of a pattern of the impact of the factors of ESG on the financial performance of enterprises. Despite indicating the cases of correlations between the ESG scores and CFP at a high level, indeed sometimes at a very high level, the particular case studies significantly differ from each other. This may be caused by the fact that Polish enterprises from the energy sector illustrate far‐reaching specifics, among others, with regard to the key significance of the entities with a prevalent state ownership and strict administrative regulations, which are subject to the energy market, state of development and structure of the whole sector in Poland. Thus, this is also why the mechanisms or dependencies, whose existence it is possible to expect in conditions of free competition, may be weakened or even eliminated in Polish conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

Valuing ecosystem services as productive inputs,"This paper explores two methods for valuing ecosystems by valuing the services that they yield to various categories of user and that are not directly valued in the market, and illustrates the usefulness of these methods with an application to the valuation of mangrove ecosystems in Thailand. The first method is known as the production function approach and relies on the fact that ecosystems may be inputs into the production of other goods or services that are themselves marketed, such as fisheries. I discuss issues that arise in measuring the input into fisheries, particularly those due to the fact that the fishery stock is changing over time, and the shadow value of the ecosystem consists in its contribution to the maintenance of the stock as well as its contribution to current output. The second method is known as the expected damage approach and is used to value the services of storm protection in terms of the reduction in expected future storm damage that the ecosystem can provide. These two methods are shown to yield very different valuations of ecosystems from those that would be derived by the methods typically used in cost-benefit analyses. I argue that they represent a significant improvement on current practice. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2007.",Not About Sufficiency

This study focuses on the level of awareness of green banking practices, daily operations, investments, and banking policies related to green banking in Somalia. This study adopted a quantitative research method by using descriptive analysis. An adopted and self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 226 Somali bank employees. Convenience sampling was used to select the respondents and data was analyzed by employing Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 23. It was found that Somali bank employees have a poor level of awareness about green banking practices. Daily operations in green banking, investments in green banking, and banking policies related to green banking all showed low levels of green banking practices. As long as the majority of respondents claimed their banks don't offer any green products, it was also discovered that Somali banks only offer a small number of green products. The results of this study will help government officials and bank executives in Somalia in reducing climate change risk and eventually promoting environmental sustainability and sustainable banking practices. By raising awareness of green banking practices in Somalia, the survey adds to the literature. Copyright: ©2024 The author.

Social dimensions of fertility behavior and consumption patterns in the Anthropocene,"We consider two aspects of the human enterprise that profoundly affect the global environment: population and consumption. We show that fertility and consumption behavior harbor a class of externalities that have not been much noted in the literature. Both are driven in part by attitudes and preferences that are not egoistic but socially embedded; that is, each household's decisions are influenced by the decisions made by others. In a famous paper, Garrett Hardin [G. Hardin, Science 162, 1243-1248 (1968)] drew attention to overpopulation and concluded that the solution lay in people “abandoning the freedom to breed.” That human attitudes and practices are socially embedded suggests that it is possible for people to reduce their fertility rates and consumption demands without experiencing a loss in wellbeing. We focus on fertility in sub-Saharan Africa and consumption in the rich world and argue that bottom-up social mechanisms rather than top-down government interventions are better placed to bring about those ecologically desirable changes. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Private Funder Perspectives on Local Social and Environmental Impacts in ‘Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation+’,"‘Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation' (REDD+) is a mechanism for developed countries to compensate developing countries for reducing forest loss. At present, REDD+ is underfunded, due in part to a lack of private funding caused by the absence of a compliance market for REDD+ credits. One of the obstacles in creating a compliance market is a concern that private funders will capture profits for themselves at the expense of local welfare. To date, however, little research has been done to assess this risk. This study helps to fill this gap by investigating the motives of current and potential future private REDD+ funders. Interview results indicate that most current funders have sought positive local social impacts, both to mitigate the risk of deforestation and to demonstrate social benefits for marketing purposes. The risk mitigation motive could exist in a compliance market, depending on how contractual arrangements distribute risk along the supply chain. However, respondents suggested that the social marketing motive would be diminished in a compliance market, because compliance buyers would prioritize credit price and volume over reputational benefits. There is a need for further research that examines whether these reported motives correlate with actual firm behaviour and how this might inform future REDD+ governance. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
How does the arctic council support conservation of arctic biodiversity?,"The Arctic Council is an intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction among Arctic states, indigenous communities, and peoples on issues of common importance. The rising geo-political importance of the Arctic and the onset of climate change has resulted in the Council becoming a focus of increasing interest from both inside and beyond the Arctic. This has resulted in new demands placed on the Council, attracting an increasing number of participants, and instigating a period of transformation as Arctic states work to find a way to balance conflicting demands to improve the Council's effectiveness and take care of national interests. This paper considers whether, during this time of change, the Council is having an impact on the issues it was formed to address, i.e., environmental protection and sustainable development. To provide answers, it looks at how the Council reports on and evaluates progress towards the implementation of recommendations it makes regarding biodiversity, how it identifies where activities have had impacts and uncovers the mechanisms through which they were successful, to provide an insight into how the Arctic Council can be an agent of change. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy in viticulture systems: winegrowers’ insights from Marlborough, New Zealand","Viticulture systems face risks from a changing climate due to grapevine sensitivity and the large degree of specialization that often exists. Diversification of agricultural production systems has been proposed as an effective adaptation strategy. Elements of diversification have featured in viticulture adaptation studies, but the understanding of diversification and its potential as a climate change adaptation strategy has not been explicitly explored with winegrowers. To develop insights in this area we identified regional climate challenges, defined climate change related threats and opportunities, and envisaged diversification solutions. Data collection involved a literature review on climate change impacts, adaptation and diversification in viticulture systems, followed by a focus group with industry stakeholders. Agroecological practices, plant material and vineyard location were the core diversification themes identified in the literature. The study found that winegrowers’ understanding of the potential for diversification include implementing agroecological practices, diversification of plant material (clones, rootstocks), alternative vineyard locations, integrating different crops and growing alternative varieties. The study expands on current literature by explicitly assessing winegrower understanding of the potential for diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy in winegrowing systems. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency

"An outlook on the development of renewable energy, policy measures to reshape the current energy mix, and how to achieve sustainable economic growth in the post COVID-19 era","Currently, COVID-19 due to emergence of various variants shows no signs of slowing down and has affected every aspect of life with significant negative impact on economic and energy structures around the world. As a result, the governments around the world have introduced policy responses to help businesses and industrial units to overcome the consequences of compliance with COVID-19 strategies. Our analysis indicates that global energy sector is one of the most severely affected industries as energy price mechanisms, energy demand, and energy supply have shown great uncertainty under these unprecedented economic and social changes. In this regard, we provide brief overview of demand, supply, and pricing structure of energy products as well as policy mechanisms to provide better outlook about how industrial sector can cope with energy consumption in the post pandemic era. We further propose changes in the existing policy mechanisms so that transition towards renewable energy sources under different environmental agreements can be achieved. Moreover, as a reference, we outline major challenges and policy recommendations to ease energy transition from fossil fuels to environmental friendly energy mix. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services,"The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) provides scientific knowledge for safeguarding the diversity of life on Earth and its contributions to people. IPBES was preceded by the Global Biodiversity Assessment (GBA) and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) as well as the Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO) and the Global Environmental Outlook (GEO). This paper describes these international assessments and their relationship with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). It then focuses on the genesis of IPBES by summarizing the consultative processes on an International Mechanism of Scientific Expertize on Biodiversity (IMoSEB), and the ensuing UNEP consultations and negotiations for the establishment of IPBES. This is followed by a presentation of the institutional and procedural design and operations of IPBES, including of its conceptual framework, and its past and current work program with a focus on assessing knowledge, building capacity, strengthening the knowledge foundation, supporting policy, communicating and engaging, and improving the effectiveness of the platform. The paper finally synthesizes the key findings of the completed IPBES assessments, highlights ongoing and planed assessments, gives examples of impact on policy, and discusses the possible future role of IPBES. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

A preliminary study of indoor air quality conditions in Dubai public elementary schools,"It is important for schools to create and maintain good and healthy indoor environment in order to accomplish their core mission of educating and improving their students academic achievements. This becomes very important if the occupants are children because they are known to be very vulnerable. This study presents the findings of preliminary investigation into the indoor air quality (IAQ) conditions of a classroom in four public elementary schools across Dubai using walkthrough investigation and objective measurement methods. Physical and chemical parameters were measured in selected classrooms for 6-7 h during school period. Majority of the environmental parameters exceed recommended threshold limits provided by cognizance authorities. This study is important because it shows the need for monitoring (a practice which is non-existing) IAQ conditions seriously in UAE elementary schools. Understanding of IAQ conditions is a step forward towards providing indoor environmentally responsible solutions that could be used to improve school children health and comfort, performance and increase their attendance rates. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Exhaust emissions of an engine fuelled by petrol and liquefied petroleum gas with control algorithm adjustment,"It has been shown that appropriate regulation of parameters of the gas supply system control algorithm allows to reduce the emission of selected components of the exhaust gas (carbon monoxide [CO], hydrocarbon [HC], and oxides of nitrogen [NOx]). The test engine met the Euro 6 standard on petrol and was equipped with an additional alternative multipoint fuelling system for multipoint injection (MPI) of the gaseous phase liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The tests are comparative in nature. The first test to compare LPG petrol fuelling was carried out in the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) where small differences in emissions were shown. The second part of the test compared emissions in the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC), wherein the initial phase there was a significant difference in emissions to the detriment of the gas supply. An innovative approach was therefore proposed to correct settings in the gas system control algorithm. In the first option, the settings for the multiplier of the opening time of LPG and petrol injectors were adjusted, resulting in a decrease in HC and NOx emissions with an increase in CO. In the second variant, the connection between the reducer and the engine intake manifold was removed, which increased the HC and NOx emissions, with a decrease in CO compared to the previous variant. In the third variant, the connection between the reducer and the engine intake manifold was restored and several coolant temperature threshold adjustments were made when switching from petrol to LPG. As a result of the corrections made in the gas system control algorithm during WLTC implementation, HC emissions were lower by 10.2%, CO by 21.2%, and NOx by 68.2% compared to the initial test. © 2020 SAE International",Not About Sufficiency
Prediction of enteric methane emissions by sheep using an intercontinental database,"Enteric methane (CH4) emissions from sheep contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions from livestock. However, as already available for dairy and beef cattle, empirical models are needed to predict CH4 emissions from sheep for accounting purposes. The objectives of this study were to: 1) collate an intercontinental database of enteric CH4 emissions from individual sheep; 2) identify the key variables for predicting enteric sheep CH4 absolute production (g/d per animal) and yield [g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)] and their respective relationships; and 3) develop and cross-validate global equations as well as the potential need for age-, diet-, or climatic region-specific equations. The refined intercontinental database included 2,135 individual animal data from 13 countries. Linear CH4 prediction models were developed by incrementally adding variables. A universal CH4 production equation using only DMI led to a root mean square prediction error (RMSPE, % of observed mean) of 25.4% and an RMSPE-standard deviation ratio (RSR) of 0.69. Universal equations that, in addition to DMI, also included body weight (DMI + BW), and organic matter digestibility (DMI + OMD + BW) improved the prediction performance further (RSR, 0.62 and 0.60), whereas diet composition variables had negligible effects. These universal equations had lower prediction error than the extant IPCC 2019 equations. Developing age-specific models for adult sheep (>1-year-old) including DMI alone (RSR = 0.66) or in combination with rumen propionate molar proportion (for research of more refined purposes) substantially improved prediction performance (RSR = 0.57) on a smaller dataset. On the contrary, for young sheep (<1-year-old), the universal models could be applied, instead of age-specific models, if DMI and BW were included. Universal models showed similar prediction performances to the diet- and region-specific models. However, optimal prediction equations led to different regression coefficients (i.e. intercepts and slopes) for universal, age-specific, diet-specific, and region-specific models with predictive implications. Equations for CH4 yield led to low prediction performances, with DMI being negatively and BW and OMD positively correlated with CH4 yield. In conclusion, predicting sheep CH4 production requires information on DMI and prediction accuracy will improve national and global inventories if separate equations for young and adult sheep are used with the additional variables BW, OMD and rumen propionate proportion. Appropriate universal equations can be used to predict CH4 production from sheep across different diets and climatic conditions. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptive network nanomedicine: An integrated model for homeopathic medicine,"This paper presents an evidence-based model for the nature and mode of action of homeopathic remedies. Recent studies reveal that homeopathic remedies contain nanoparticles (NPs) of source materials formed by ""topdown"" mechanical grinding in lactose and/or succussion (forceful agitation) in ethanolic solutions. Silica nanostructures formed during succussions in glass and/or biosynthesized by specific plant extract tinctures also may acquire and convey epitaxial information from remedy source materials into higher potencies. NPs have enhanced bioavailability, adsorptive capabilities, adjuvant reactivity, electromagnetic and quantum properties compared with their bulk forms. NPs induce adaptive changes in the organism at nontoxic doses (hormesis), serving as salient, low level danger signals to the biological stress response network. Activation of stress response effectors, including heat shock proteins, inflammasomes, cytokines and neuroendocrine pathways, initiate beneficial compensatory reactions across the interconnected networks of the organism as a complex adaptive system. Homeopathic remedies act by stimulating hormetic adaptive rather than conventional pharmacological effects. Updating terminology from ""homeopathy"" to ""adaptive network nanomedicine"" reflects the integration of this historical but controversial medical system with modern scientific findings.",Not About Sufficiency
Natural capital accounting for sustainability: Bibliometric analysis and explainable artificial intelligence modeling for citation counts,"Natural capital accounting plays a pivotal role in the sustainable management and conservation of natural resources. This paper aims to contribute to this field by conducting a bibliometric review of 1409 articles and employing explainable artificial intelligence modeling (XAI) to identify and predict the factors that influence the impact of natural capital accounting (NCA) research, especially in terms of citations to this research. The findings revealed that the Journal of Cleaner Production is the leading publication in this field, with the highest h-index of 37. The XAI found that age of publication and number of references significantly impacted the likelihood of a paper receiving many citations. This study offers an innovative and practical framework for forecasting citation counts and provides effective strategies for authors and editors to enhance the citation impact of their work. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability and governance of sugarcane ethanol companies in Brazil: Topic modeling analysis of CSR reporting,"The current debate on corporate social responsibility was triggered by the understanding that companies should be responsible for mitigating the impacts of their activities on the society and the environment. In this paper, drawing on the structural power of business, we examine the rule-setting power in which sugarcane ethanol companies engage, and then discuss why these companies develop and use institutions to promote sustainability. We use a machine learning algorithm, latent Dirichlet allocation, to identify companies’ commitment to sustainability and business-led governance by analyzing a large volume of data from public corporate documents. The results reveal 36 main themes that demonstrate the rule-setting power of the sugarcane ethanol industry through voluntary standards, codes of conduct, and corporate social responsibility these companies use as indicators of superior social and environmental performance and to show sustainability is embedded in companies’ priorities. However, the results also show critical issues of unsustainable production practices can affect industry image and stress socio-environmental relationships. These issues can be ameliorated with integrative governance that considers the independence of the sectors involved in ethanol production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Between resistance and consent: Project-village relationships when introducing REDD+ in zanzibar,"Reductions of Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) is one example of a globally important environmental intervention implemented throughout the global South. This article investigates the possibilities for rural villagers to influence these interventions, and thus negotiate access to forest resources at the local level. Based on data from ethnographic fieldwork in Zanzibar, the article explores a process where representatives from one village and forest authorities negotiate a Community Forest Management Agreement that will be part of a future REDD scheme in Zanzibar. The article reviews the multiple local responses to this pre-REDD process and discusses factors that contribute to shaping these responses. Local claims about 'lost land' and 'disappearing benefits' are at the core of what villagers want to see redressed by taking part in the REDD project. But despite the seemingly great local expectations towards the arrival of the project, as well as the project's self-presentation as participatory, villagers soon realize that their influence on the project is marginal. After attempting to voice their concerns through negotiation, villagers experience that the ahistorical and apolitical approach of the project forces them into more resistance-like behaviour - complicating the distinction between consent and non-consent to the project. Inspired by Foucault's conception of power and the tensions between different knowledge, logics and practices at project vs. village level, the article seeks to contribute to furthering our theoretical reflections and understanding of 'project'-'village' dynamics in external environmental interventions with a global agenda, where REDD is just one example. © 2014 Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI).",Not About Sufficiency
Kinship and migration in prehistoric mainland Southeast Asia: An overview of isotopic evidence,"An exciting topic in the prehistory of Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) is where, when and why matriliny/matrilocality existed in certain regions during the rise of complex societies. Linguistic and genetic evidence have been used to infer kinship questions on a broad, continental scale. To contribute to this discussion on the site scale, here we summarize and compare, for the first time, almost two decades of isotopic work on prehistoric skeletons from across the region. For comparability of mobility patterns between sexes and between sites, we introduce simple normalized conversions of the (strontium, oxygen and carbon) isotopic data. Taking the evidence together, we find support for our hypothesis that matriliny/matrilocality was most likely at times and places with maritime or riverine trade, as exhibited at several coastal/deltaic sites of Thailand and Vietnam. In any case, there is an exciting future ahead for multi-method investigations into prehistoric kinship and social differentiation in Southeast Asia. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
Global Climate Change: Political Realism and the Case for a World Climate Bank,"The Paris Agreement’s goals cannot be achieved without sufficient funding, but the funding has been extremely inadequate. Addressing this problem innovatively, John Broome and Duncan Foley offer economic and political arguments in favor of establishing a new international institution, a World Climate Bank (WCB). The economic case for a WCB appears strong insofar as the bank’s main function would be to scale up mobilization of the financial resources needed for decarbonizing the world economy. However, Broome and Foley problematically assert that a WCB must buy up fossil fuel assets. I argue that this could lead to disastrous consequences and must be ruled out. Claims by Broome and Foley about realism play important roles in their proposal, although it is not clearly based on any particular form of realist political theory. I argue that a realistic proposal would include sound arguments, and I show that the political arguments offered by Broome and Foley involve equivocation, vagueness, and self-contradiction. I sketch a provisional political case for a World Climate Bank for Mitigation, Adaptation, and Resilience (WCB-MAR) satisfying certain desiderata. In the course of critiquing and revising the Broome-Foley proposal, I begin to develop a new conception of political realism. Here I aim to motivate political scientists and theorists focusing on international institutions and global justice to help develop and assess political responses to the climate crisis, including my proposal for a WCB-MAR. When doing such work, they should take full account of the gravity and urgency of the crisis. This requires them to be politically realistic in the sense discussed herein. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Anthropogenic stresses on the world’s big rivers,"The world’s big rivers and their floodplains were central to development of civilization and are now home to c. 2.7 billion people. They are economically vital whilst also constituting some of the most diverse habitats on Earth. However, a number of anthropogenic stressors, including large-scale damming, hydrological change, pollution, introduction of non-native species and sediment mining, challenge their integrity and future, as never before. The rapidity and extent of such change is so great that large-scale, and potentially irreparable, transformations may ensue in periods of years to decades, with ecosystem collapse being possible in some big rivers. Prioritizing the fate of the world’s great river corridors on an international political stage is imperative. Future sustainable management, and establishment of environmental flow requirements for the world’s big rivers, must be supported through co-ordinated international funding, and trans-continental political agreement to monitor these rivers, finance their continual upkeep and help ameliorate increasing anthropogenic pressures. To have any effect, all of these must be set within an inclusive governance framework across scales, organizations and local populace. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Harnessing stakeholder engagement for sustainable agricultural intensification: contemporary evidence from northern Ghana,"This article analyses the indispensable role of sustainable agricultural intensification practices (SAIP) in meeting the needs of a burgeoning human population with limited planetary resources and examines the role of various stakeholders in the adoption of these practices by local farmers. The study setting is the Upper West, a semi-arid region of Ghana. The study employs a stakeholder salience theory and a mixed-method design. Firstly, qualitative data were collected and analysed as a basis for formulating a structured questionnaire administered to beneficiary farmers, which were then analysed using marginal effects from logistic regression. Notably, the study found four sustainable crop cultivation practices and three eco-friendly crop storage methods promoted in the area. Furthermore, the engagement of stakeholders like selected farmers, Traditional authorities, and implementing NGOs had statistically significant effects on the adoption of SAIP. However, these effects were smaller when compared to the direct involvement of all beneficiary farmers in the planning and implementation of the intervention. This suggests that while technocrats and authorities are important, they alone cannot achieve the desired impact of development interventions. Beneficiary farmers are the most critical stakeholders in adopting and promoting SAIP. The article further proposes a conceptual framework for implementing SAIP in agro-based rural communities. This research therefore underscores the importance of sustainable agricultural intensification practices in a resource-constrained world and emphasizes the central role of beneficiary farmers in driving the success of such initiatives. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
A cooperative game analysis of transboundary hydropower development in the lower mekong: Case of the 3s sub-basins,"Hydropower development has enormous economic, environmental, and social impacts at a local, national, and trans-national level. It has been suggested that transboundary water conflicts, such as those that may arise from hydropower development, may be addressed through benefit sharing. This study attempts to investigate the net benefits of hydropower development and water resources utilization in transboundary sub-basin, the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok (commonly known as 3S) sub-basin, in the Mekong River Basin using a game theory approach. This study proposes a methodology for analyzing complex transboundary river-basin issues using the game theory concepts, such as core stability and incentive compatibility. A wide range of parameters have been incorporated to define models and methodologies, and an adaptation strategy for the area has been proposed. The results suggests that benefit sharing and cooperation among the riparian countries would lead to benefits to all. It is observed that the greater the cooperation, the higher is the total benefits. External funding and optimal usage of funds will also play a critical role in this context in the near future. The results of the study will provide a basis for local policy decisions and regional planning in the Mekong River and beyond. ©Springer Science+Business Media",Not About Sufficiency

An integrated approach for analysing the enablers and barriers of sustainable manufacturing,"Manufacturing performance is very crucial to the success of any organization. Hence, it becomes imperative for manufacturing industries to adopt sustainability measures considering their dependence on non-renewable resources along with the generation of a large amount of wastes. This study aims to propose comprehensive sustainability framework for manufacturing domain to strengthen the enablers and mitigate barriers based on the responses of researchers, and industry professionals. Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory approach has been applied to identify most influential factors amongst ten identified enablers and barriers in both the groups. Further, a scientific approach, Maximum Mean De-Entropy algorithm has been utilised to integrate the obtained results with Interpretive Structural Modeling based on threshold value to develop a hierarchical structure of the complex system. Finally, the study has been statistically validated for enablers and barriers by employing structural equation modeling based on the responses of both the groups. The obtained results are expected to highlight the underlying differences in their opinions which can be jointly worked upon to minimize this gap towards sustainability implementation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"CONSERVATION OF URBAN WETLAND WITH POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE: A CASE STUDY ON NAJAFGARH JHEEL, DELHI, INDIA","Urban lakes, or jheels, are essential ecological elements that help maintain ecosystem services such as groundwater, regional climate, and biodiversity. The continuous urban sprawl and population growth in urban areas are essential factors in the decline of freshwater bodies. However, these ecosystems have functional advantages. The National Capital Region of India has a population of 46 million and is situated on the Yamuna watershed. The resilience plan for the city requires research on hydrological sustainability. The present study focuses on the case study of Najafgarh Jheel, a trans-boundary lake that has recently received the status of a water body under the wetland rules of 2017 of India by the National Green Tribunal after 215 years of existence and deterioration. The primary data collection was through field visits of avifauana data, and secondary data from eBird data, research articles, government reports, and newspaper articles have been the main tools for analysis. The baselines of international significance for Najafgrah Jheel were compared to criteria laid out by the Important Bird and Biodiversity Area Programme and the Ramsar Convention. The Najafgarh Jheel area could be a prospective wetland of international significance for its ornithological significance.

From Models to Mannequins: The Oxymoronic Equation of International Labor Law Standards in the World of Fashion,"Fashion law is an emerging field that addresses the legal issues that arise in the fashion industry. With the rapid growth and globalization of the fashion industry, there is an increasing need for specialized legal guidance in this area. Fashion law encompasses a wide range of legal issues, including intellectual property, contract law, employment law, international trade law, and environmental law. One of the main drivers behind the need for fashion law is the rise of counterfeiting and intellectual property theft in the fashion industry. With the proliferation of ecommerce and social media, it has become easier than ever for counterfeiters to produce and sell fake designer goods. Fashion law provides legal protections for designers, brands, and manufacturers to safeguard their intellectual property rights and prevent infringement. Moreover, the fashion industry has a significant impact on the environment, with issues such as textile waste, carbon emissions, and ethical sourcing of materials. Fashion law can play a crucial role in ensuring that fashion companies comply with environmental regulations and ethical standards. Interestingly, fashion models comprise a group of working professionals that do not have any laws dealing with the specific issues that they are faced with on account of their profession. This Article discusses the various reasons why there is a need for fashion law. © 2023,Cleveland State Law Review. All Rights Reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
The Effect of Farmer’s Cognition on the Inconsistency Between Behavior and Intention in Manure Application,"Manure utilization in China is below optimum due to the inconsistency between farmers’ behavior and their intention to apply manure to their crops. With increasing constraints on the availability of chemical fertilizer and their impact on the environment, understanding how farmers’ perceptions affect their intention and behavior toward manure application is an issue for the implementation of sustainable agricultural development. This study uses primary survey data from 653 farmers. A probit model was used to assess the influence of cognition on farmers’ intentions, behavior, and the inconsistency between them in the use of manure application. Heterogeneity analysis was conducted to identify differences between farmers with different education levels and operation scales. The results showed that enhancing subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral attitudes could increase their intention and behavior. Furthermore, improving the perceived behavioral control and behavioral attitudes of farmers would reduce the inconsistency between behavior and intention. In addition, some differences were identified in the role of farmers’ cognition with different education levels and operation scales. In general, it is necessary to enhance farmers’ comprehensive cognition of the value of manure through publicity and popularization of technology, reduce farmers’ perceptions about difficulties in applying manure through new policies and subsidies, and stimulate farmers’ enthusiasm to participate in the practice. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Whose Reality Counts? Critical Junctures in Livelihood Trajectories Under Deforestation,"Livelihoods approaches focus on the poor and their knowledge and agency, but risk underplaying broader contextual forces which constrain and shape that agency. Livelihood trajectories approaches attend more fully to these structural, contextual dynamics. A three-year study using quantitative and qualitative methods investigated livelihood trajectories over two decades in a village affected by deforestation in Northeast Cambodia, and sought to identify critical junctures structuring those trajectories. A timber rush, a land rush, a turn to agriculture and ongoing competition to shape post-forest reterritorialisation were identified as the critical junctures. These transformed the physical environment, and initiated waves of migration which in turn transformed the social and economic structure and everyday life of the village. This valuably disrupts narrative simplifications associated with community forestry. The junctures furthermore suggest an analytical framework for understanding deforestation-livelihoods dynamics in other contexts, thus demonstrating how livelihood trajectories research might contribute to middle-level theory building. © 2016 Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG",Not About Sufficiency
"Wicked facets of the German energy transition–examples from the electricity, heating, transport, and industry sectors","We shed light on wicked problems in the German energy transition. Our methods consist of a multiple-case study and multi-criteria analysis, utilising the wicked problems theoretical framework introduced by Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber [1973. “Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning.” Policy Sciences 4 (2): 155–169. Accessed August 20, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01405730]. Results from the energy supply, heating/cooling, transport, and industry sectors illustrate where and how the 10-point frame of wicked problems manifests in the German energy transition. The four cases exhibit more wicked tendencies in the governance domain than the technical domain and differ in their degrees of technology maturity, policy regulation, and knowledge states. We do not find that the German energy transition is inherently wicked. However, wickedness unfolds through the social setting into which technical solutions of the energy transition are embedded. We aim to highlight these intricacies and encourage scrutinising these wicked facets early on. © 2023 The Author(s).

High-order network analysis for financial crash identification,"Network analysis is a powerful method to characterize the complexity and dynamics of socio-economic systems. However, traditional network analysis often ignores the higher-order dependencies that arise from the interactions of more than two nodes. In this paper, we propose to use high-order networks, which are generalized network structures that capture the higher-order dependencies, to study the temporal evolution of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index. We construct high-order networks from the DJIA time series using the visibility graph method, and we measure the topological complexity of the high-order networks using various metrics. We find that the complexity of the system changes drastically during crisis events, indicating that high-order network analysis can be used as an indicator (indicator-precursor) of financial crashes. We also show that high-order network analysis and topology can provide more insights into the nonlinear and nonstationary behavior of the DJIA index than traditional tools of financial time series analysis. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of virtual training in implementing Sustainable Development Goals globally,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the role of virtual training in supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and reducing workforce inequalities. It analyzes both the advantages and challenges of integrating virtual training within sustainable development frameworks and the circular economy, underlining its crucial role in transforming workforce strategies and enhancing economic and social progress. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses Becker’s human capital theory (1964) and Bandura’s social learning theory (1977) to explore the impact of virtual training on human capital development and its contributions to specific SDGs. This integrated approach provides a detailed exploration of how virtual training intersects with sustainable development initiatives. Findings: The findings highlight the pivotal role of technology in training and development, particularly in the post-pandemic landscape. Virtual training significantly enhances global collaboration, inclusivity and sustainability.

Use of a business excellence model to improve conservation programs,"The current shortfall in effectiveness within conservation biology is illustrated by increasing interest in ""evidence-based conservation,"" whose proponents have identified the need to benchmark conservation initiatives against actions that lead to proven positive effects. The effectiveness of conservation policies, approaches, and evaluation is under increasing scrutiny, and in these areas models of excellence used in business could prove valuable. Typically, conservation programs require years of effort and involve rigorous long-term implementation processes. Successful balance of long-term efforts alongside the achievement of short-term goals is often compromised by management or budgetary constraints, a situation also common in commercial businesses. ""Business excellence"" is an approach many companies have used over the past 20 years to ensure continued success. Various business excellence evaluations have been promoted that include concepts that could be adapted and applied in conservation programs. We describe a conservation excellence model that shows how scientific processes and results can be aligned with financial and organizational measures of success. We applied the model to two well-documented species conservation programs. In the first, the Po'ouli program, several aspects of improvement were identified, such as more authority for decision making in the field and better integration of habitat management and population recovery processes. The second example, the black-footed ferret program, could have benefited from leadership effort to reduce bureaucracy and to encourage use of best-practice species recovery approaches. The conservation excellence model enables greater clarity in goal setting, more-effective identification of job roles within programs, better links between technical approaches and measures of biological success, and more-effective use of resources. The model could improve evaluation of a conservation program's effectiveness and may be used to compare different programs, for example during reviews of project performance by sponsoring organizations. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.",Not About Sufficiency

The Rhetoric of Energy Darwinism: Neoliberal Piety and Market Autonomy in Economic Discourse,"Energy Darwinism is a metaphor used in economic discourse that proposes markets will naturally become greener and cleaner as fossil fuel costs increase. Influenced by Kenneth Burke’s dramatism, I perform a close reading of the metaphor to analyze its presence in two Citigroup reports. Based on this reading, I argue that the Energy Darwinism metaphor anthropomorphizes markets as acting subjects whose economic autonomy should not be violated and supports the cleansing of industry’s environmental sins. These features of Energy Darwinism construct what I call neoliberal piety, which frames environmental restoration not as inherently valuable but as a by-product of economic success and technological progress. The Energy Darwinism metaphor provides an important case study for analyzing contemporary energy discourse, the rhetorical obstacles that prevent imagining sustainable futures, and the ways we might rework neoliberal assumptions in service of those sustainable futures. © 2019, © 2019 The Rhetoric Society of America.",Not About Sufficiency
FLEXURAL PROPERTIES OF AÇAÍ PALM WOOD: A POTENTIAL RESOURCE FOR AMAZON TRADITIONAL PEOPLE,"Açaí berry is the main product from Euterpe oleracea, a palm tree largely found in the Amazon forest. The management of açaí areas involves the selective thinning of stems, a waste that accumulates in the area without any use. We aimed to assess the flexural properties of the peripheral zone of E. oleracea stems and their relationships with density and anatomical features. Açaí palm wood has properties similar to Amazon timbers, such as Hymenaea courbaril and shows strong correlation of density and fibre percentage with flexural properties. Euterpe oleracea palm wood has percentage of fibre tissue (46.99%) and bundle diameter (0.83 mm) similar to Cocos nucifera, but density (0.95 g cm-3) and flexural properties (strength = 151.6 MPa, stiffness = 16.89 GPa) superior to other palm woods, such as C. nucifera and Elaeis guineensis. Due to the stem peripheral zone thickness, açaí palm wood has the same limitations as bamboos have and, thus, can be used as a local substitute for imported bamboo products. According to its properties, açaí palm wood can be used for handicrafts, doors, frames, furniture, and structural purposes. By aligning with the ecological and social sustainability trend seen in our society, açaí palm wood products can generate deluxe items with high added value and serve as an additional income source for traditional Amazon people dependent on açaí berry management. ©Forest Research Institute Malaysia.",Not About Sufficiency
Emerging Low-Carbon Energy Landscapes and Energy Innovation Dilemmas in the Kenyan Periphery,"Interest in electrical grid access is high throughout Kenya and yet parastatals continually use location and proximity concepts to define the periphery as spaces ineligible for electrical grids due to dispersed and low electricity demand. Even the ongoing spatial expansion of electrical infrastructures to achieve universal electricity access (Vision 2020) and nation-wide economic transformation (Vision 2030) agenda favor peripheral locations only where electricity demand is considered adequate and residents live within the required 600-m radius from existing transformers. Uncertainties surrounding future grid extensions, unreliable electricity supply, and strong sociocultural attachments to homelands are the driving forces behind the uptake of decentralized solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in the periphery to gain energy autonomy by means of self-generating electricity in homes. Most households, at least based on the sample, frequently performed very important social practices according to energy services provided by decentralized systems and could perform energy-intensive practices only occasionally. Solar PV system uptake, however, grants users only a partial energy autonomy because it engenders rather precautionary energy practices, thereby obstructing certain social practices, not excluding home-based microbusiness activities. The solar PV transition potentially obstructs the state’s socioeconomic transformation visions, undermines the monopolistic agenda of parastatals, restricts practices in households and expectations placed on energy infrastructure, and fortuitously creates low-carbon energy solutions in specific spaces. The placemaking processes create low-carbon energy landscapes in the periphery but are inextricably bundled with tensions and conundrums in energy systems—henceforth called energy innovation dilemmas—subject to spatial (re-)organization of electrical grids and societal energy visions. In this article, I hypothesize geographical energy futures in Kenya and emphasize academic contributions realized by employing relational perspectives of energy, practices, and space in energy transition studies in settings characterized by structural uncertainties and constantly changing energy systems.

Greening Capitalism? A Marxist Critique of Carbon Markets,"Climate change is increasingly being recognized as a serious threat to dominant modes of social organization, inspiring suggestions that capitalism itself needs to be transformed if we are to 'decarbonize' the global economy. Since the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, carbon markets have emerged as the main politico-economic tools in global efforts to address climate change. Newell and Paterson (2010) have recently claimed that the embrace of carbon markets by financial and political elites constitutes a possible first step towards the transformation of current modes of capitalist organization into a new form of greener, more sustainable 'climate capitalism.' In this paper, we argue that the institutionalization of carbon markets does not, in fact, represent a move towards the radical transformation of capitalism, but is better understood as the most recent expression of ongoing trends of ecological commodification and expropriation, driving familiar processes of uneven and crisis-prone development. In this paper, we review four critical Marxist concepts: metabolic rift (Foster, 1999), capitalism as world ecology (Moore, 2011a), uneven development and accumulation through dispossession (Harvey, 2003, 2006), and sub-imperialism (Marini, 1972, 1977), developing a framework for a Marxist analysis of carbon markets. Our analysis shows that carbon markets form part of a longer historical development of global capitalism and its relation to nature. Carbon markets, we argue, serve as creative new modes of accumulation, but are unlikely to transform capitalist dynamics in ways that might foster a more sustainable global economy. Our analysis also elucidates, in particular, the role that carbon markets play in exacerbating uneven development within the Global South, as elites in emerging economies leverage carbon market financing to pursue new strategies of sub-imperial expansion. © The Author(s) 2012.",Not About Sufficiency
Corporate Biodiversity Management through Certifiable Standards,"This article analyzes the motivations, internalization challenges and outcomes of implementing certifiable standards for corporate biodiversity management. For this purpose, a qualitative study based on interviews with 39 environmental managers, auditors, consultants and other experts in the field was conducted. The findings show that the adoption of new standards for biodiversity management is essentially driven by the need to improve the social acceptability of activities that can have a significant impact on natural habitats. The possible benefits of certification, particularly in terms of stakeholder relationships, and the difficulty of measuring the intangible aspects of biodiversity issues are also discussed. The study contributes to the emerging literature on organizational biodiversity management and to the debates on the symbolic versus substantial adoption of certifiable environmental standards. Managerial implications for organizations interested in biodiversity management are also discussed. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

"Energy, uncertainty, and entrepreneurship: John D Rockefeller's sequential approach to transaction costs management in the early oil industry","This article delves into the challenge of successful entrepreneurship in the energy industry under conditions of uncertainty by examining the case of John D Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company, which rapidly seized control of an initially-uncertain industry. It finds that Rockefeller cemented control through a willingness to internalise contextual uncertainty (related to the nature of the energy business)as a stepping stone to managing contractual uncertainty (related to transactions with other parties). This finding suggests that thinking sequentially about the management of contextual and contractual uncertainty aids entrepreneurial success in the field of energy. This suggestion accords with standing calls in the transaction costs literature, which means that findings may generalise to some extent. However, the exploratory nature of the analysis implies the need for further research about the argument's compatibility with modern energy practices and its generalisability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Subsampling and space-filling metrics to test ensemble size for robustness analysis with a demonstration in the Colorado River Basin,"Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty often uses prohibitively large scenario ensembles to calculate robustness and rank policies’ performance. This paper contributes a framework using subsampling algorithms and space-filling metrics to determine how smaller ensemble sizes impact the accuracy of robustness rankings. Subsampling methods create smaller scenario ensembles of varying sizes. We evaluate ranking sensitivity to the ensemble size and calculate accuracy relative to a baseline ranking. Then, metrics of scenario set quality predict ranking accuracy. Notably, the metrics and subsampling methods do not require additional model simulations. We demonstrate the framework with a case study of shortage policies for Lake Mead in the Colorado River Basin (CRB). Results suggest that fewer scenarios than previous studies can accurately rank Lake Mead policies, and results depend on the type of objective and robustness metric. Smaller ensembles could reduce the computational burden of robustness analyses in the ongoing CRB policy renegotiation. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
Uptake and effects of carbon nanotubes,"Nanotechnology is a rapidly developing industry that promises great societal and economic benefits. In particular, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have enormous potential for innovation in the fields of engineering, electronics, and medicine. However, recent reviews of the scientific literature predict that CNTs will be a risk for lung diseases, particularly pulmonary fibrosis and granuloma formation, related to occupational and perhaps consumer exposure (Bonner 2010a, Bonner 2011). Inhalation studies using mice or rats demonstrate that CNTs deposit reach the alveolar regions in the lung and also migrate to the subpleural tissues beneath the mesothelial lining of the lung, where they remain embedded in the extracellular matrix or within resident lung cells for months following exposure (Ryman-Rasmussen et al. 2009a). CNTs also localize in lymphoid tissues (Ma-Hock et al. 2009, Pauluhn 2010) and stimulate systemic immune effects that influence extra-pulmonary tissues and organs such as the spleen and heart (Mitchell et al. 2007, 2009). In addition, genetic and environmental factors influence susceptibility to CNT-induced lung diseases in rodents. For example, CNTs exacerbate allergen-induced airway inflammation in mice (Ryman-Rasmussen et al. 2009b). The aim of this chapter is to summarize the uptake, fate, and effects of CNTs following pulmonary exposure to rodents to predict possible human health effects that could result as a consequence of occupational, consumer, or environmental exposure. © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
When risks cannot be seen: Regulating uncertainty in emerging technologies,"Commercializing an emerging technology that employs an immature production process can be challenging, particularly when there are many different sources of uncertainty. In industries with stringent safety requirements, regulatory interventions that ensure safety while maintaining incentives for innovation can be particularly elusive. We use the extreme case of metal additive manufacturing (an emerging technology with many sources of process uncertainty) in commercial aviation (an industry where lapses in safety can have catastrophic consequences) to unpack how the characteristics of a technology may influence the options for regulatory intervention. Based on our findings, we propose an adaptive regulatory framework in which standards are periodically revised and in which different groups of companies are regulated differently as a function of their technological capabilities. We conclude by proposing a generalizable framework for regulating emerging process-based technologies in safety-critical industries in which the optimal regulatory configuration depends on the industry structure (number of firms), the performance and safety requirements, and the sources of technological uncertainty. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

"Decision-Making in Design, Maintenance, Planning, and Investment of Wind Energy","This book demonstrates how decision-making models can be applied to solve specific real-life problems, with a particular emphasis on wind energy. In a step-by-step manner, it guides the reader through decision-making, the formulation of optimization models, and the methods for solving them. After providing an overview of various models for the design of wind farms, it presents an optimization model for deciding which economy (country) to invest in and models for selecting suppliers. A dedicated chapter focuses on different models for monitoring and predictive maintenance for wind turbines (farms) due to the construction of turbine blades and vibration. It shows how combinatorial optimization models can help to make optimal decisions for one-dimensional cutting stock of blanks, their processing, and determining the optimal composition for production. Moreover, it discusses how the energy consumption balance index formed by conventional and renewable sources can be determined and presents a means of identifying the relative share of wind energy consumption among the other renewable sources. Operations research professionals, students, and decision-makers alike will find this book to be a valuable resource for tackling real-world challenges and driving sustainable advances in wind energy solutions. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
How do individuals and groups perceive wetland functioning? Fuzzy cognitive mapping of wetland perceptions in Uganda,"Wetlands are critical natural resources around the globe, providing many direct and indirect benefits to local communities. However, wetland degradation and conversion to other land uses are widespread. Sustainable wetland management requires an understanding of stakeholders’ perceptions of the ecosystem and its management. This paper uses fuzzy cognitive mapping to capture individual stakeholder perceptions and group knowledge of wetland ecosystems in order to assess areas of consensus and opposing interests between different stakeholders and to develop future management scenarios. For this purpose, the Rushebeya-Kanyabaha wetland, which is one of the few wetlands in southwest Uganda that is still largely intact, is used as a case study. Our findings reveal differences in perceptions between different resource users. Papyrus harvesters, beekeepers, fishermen, wetland non-users, and hunters associate the largest livelihood benefits with a wetland conservation scenario, while farmers and government officials perceive increased agricultural production in the wetland area to be more livelihood enhancing. This poses a challenge to sustainable wetland management. The scenario results also suggest that centralized top-down laws and rules on wetland use are not sufficient for maintaining the wetland ecosystem. Therefore, there is a need to develop shared understanding through bottom-up approaches to wetland management that are nested within national regulatory frameworks, ideally combined with awareness building and knowledge sharing on the ecological benefits of the wetland. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The Blue Bond Market: A Catalyst for Ocean and Water Financing,"The blue bond market has emerged as one of the latest additions in the sustainable debt market. Its goal is to channel funding toward sustainable blue economy projects related to the ocean and freshwater. While the protection of hydric resources has gained importance within the problem of climate change, Sustainable Development Goals linked to water remain the most underfunded. Since the issuance of the first blue bond in the Seychelles in 2018, multiple public and private organizations have turned to the blue bond market to raise funds. However, unlike the green bond market, no comprehensive market overview exists, preventing stakeholders from judging whether this label has been effective in protecting water resources and drawing conclusions on its future potential. This paper draws on an extensive review of academic research and complements it with a unique and comprehensive analysis of blue bonds issued to date, providing a contribution to the literature on sustainable finance. Between 2018 and 2022, 26 blue bond transactions took place, amounting to a total value of USD 5.0 billion, with a 92% CAGR between those years. Currently, blue bonds represent less than 0.5% of the sustainable debt market. The use of proceeds has mostly focused on waste management, biodiversity, and sustainable fisheries, but also ranges across other areas of the sustainable blue economy. Only two-thirds of blue bond issuers report on impact metrics, providing further opportunity to add detail and rigor. We draw comparisons to the more mature green bond market and conclude that a lack of standardized definitions, metrics, and expertise by issuers and investors are significant barriers to the blue bond market. Resolving these barriers is crucial to attract corporations and ensure continued growth of the blue bond market. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
ADAPTIVE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE FORMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS,"In the context of growing environmental challenges and the need for sustainable development, the formation of environmental awareness in students is becoming an important aspect of education. Adaptive educational technologies based on the use of artificial intelligence and data analysis offer a personalized approach to learning that can significantly increase awareness of environmental issues and sustainable development. This paper examines various aspects of the introduction of adaptive educational technologies into the educational process in order to form environmental awareness. The study examines adaptive learning methods such as intelligent learning systems, mobile applications and online platforms that can adapt to the individual needs and levels of students. These technologies allow for the creation of personalized educational trajectories that take into account the interests and previous experience of students. In addition, the work analyzes the effectiveness of adaptive technologies in the context of developing critical thinking, problem-solving skills and the formation of sustainable behavior among students. It is expected that the use of such technologies will contribute not only to increasing the level of knowledge about ecology, but also to the development of an active civic position, readiness to act in defense of the environment. The results of the study may be useful for educational institutions developing new educational programs, as well as for educational technology developers seeking to integrate sustainability principles into their products. © 2024, Gnedenko Forum.

"Stakeholder politics: Social capital, sustainable development, and the corporation","The war is over. The largest corporations in the world are now committed to sustainability. But, behind the public relations gloss, corporate executives and managers are perplexed. The majority of them have a genuine desire to work in an ethical and sustainable manner. Yet, when they engage with their stakeholders for that purpose, they unexpectedly encounter a world of hardball politics full of hostile activists, self-interested elites and unpredictable attacks. Unfortunately, corporate management is too often unskilled in this rough-and-tumble world. While managers rely on facts and rational analysis, their self-appointed critics have mastered the arts of political discourse, issue framing and media manipulation. At the same time, as corporations extend their global reach, their third-world stakeholder communities are beset with a variety of poverty-maintaining and sustainability-thwarting conditions. In many parts of the world, communities suffer from entrenched divisions, exclusion from power, unpredictable violence and economic dependency. In order to both reduce reputational risk and to contribute to sustainable development, companies need the equivalent of roadmaps of the socio-political terrain in their stakeholder networks.This book moves on to next challenge of giving companies what they need now: namely, ""how to"" guides addressing the twin problems of firstly maintaining political legitimacy (talking the talk), and, secondly, promoting sustainable development (walking the walk). They need to learn how to both play stakeholder politics and collaborate with stakeholders towards sustainability goals. Most companies have already encountered or anticipated the barriers that this book addresses, and managers will recognize the dilemmas described.Stakeholder Politics is the first book to offer a method for classifying and dealing with these socio-political problems.The book presents a typology of stakeholder networks that will help managers and community leaders identify and improve the social capital patterns in their own networks. Once they know what patterns they have, they can move their networks towards those that foster sustainable community development. The author describes vivid cases in which managers and community stakeholders have already used the approach successfully. At the same time, managers get handy tools for predicting and avoiding community-level socio-political risk around stakeholder issues: most notably, the Stakeholder 360 which has been successfully used in Canada and Australia with large groups of managers learning about stakeholder engagement.The book has been written for an audience of both managers and academics.

"Impact of lifestyle, human diet and nutrient use efficiency in food production on eutrophication of global aquifers and surface waters","A spatially explicit (0.5 degree resolution) analysis is presented of the impact of human lifestyle, diet and nutrient use efficiency in food production and wastewater treatment on exceedance of threshold concentrations for nitrate in groundwater, and total N and total P concentrations in surface water, as well as criteria for their ratio. This analysis starts from the middle-of-the-road (SSP2) and the sustainability (SSP1) Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP), focusing on the year 2050. The scenarios with changed lifestyle assume a reduction of food wastage and a low-meat diet for all world inhabitants, implying large reductions of meat and milk consumption and production in industrialized countries. Scenarios with improved nutrient use efficiencies assume maximum achievable efficiencies under practical conditions. The SSP2 scenario combined with assumptions on lifestyle and human diet leads to improvement in industrialized countries only, and increased levels in many other regions. A strong improvement is achieved in SSP1, but not in many developing countries, and SSP1 combined with changed lifestyle leads to improvement of groundwater and surface water quality in industrialized countries only. Therefore, changed lifestyle needs to be combined with efforts to improve the efficiency in food production systems and wastewater treatment to achieve reductions of the area affected by groundwater contamination and eutrophication of surface waters. Reduction strategies need to find a balance between N and P, since it is easier to reduce N in rivers to levels below the threshold than P. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency

"Taboos, toilets and biogas: Socio-technical pathways to acceptance of a sustainable household technology","Toilet-linked anaerobic digesters (TLADs) can provide users with a clean gaseous fuel and a fertiliser product as well as offer waste management services. Socio-cultural resistance towards domestic TLADs, due to the use of human excreta as a feedstock, is often articulated as a finite barrier to adoption. However, no research has specifically investigated the issues associated with TLADs separately from those associated with domestic digesters without toilet connections, consequently, there has been little attempt to discover what motivates users to use TLADs. Drawing on qualitative data from Nepal this paper explores how socio-cultural resistance impacts TLAD adoption and subsequent use of the biogas, and how adoption and transition pathways evolve. We argue that socio-cultural resistance is not a finite barrier to adoption and the opportunity to observe or trial a TLAD can positively influence adoption, especially amongst the older generations. Technical issues affected how TLADs were utilised more than socio-cultural norms and we discuss how socio-technical factors might co-evolve to influence sustainable adoption and use of TLADs. Caste and gender were not found to influence adoption pathways as much as the leadership or ‘risk-taking’ characteristics of specific adopters. Adoption of TLADs can occur within a year of a user first observing or trialling a TLAD; however, most users still do not use biogas for ritual cooking, despite having had a TLAD for many years. Grassroots initiatives that understand the diversity of localised socio-cultural norms will likely be imperative for successful TLAD dissemination. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
The language of sustainable tourism as a proxy indicator of quality,"Sustainable tourism (ST) has recently become the mainstream of the tourism industry and, accordingly, has influenced contemporary tourism research. However, ST is not just theories about indications and contraindications of global travel, but also a specific language that needs mastering to take sustainability work forward. In other words, what research receives recognition depends on the proficiency in how the articulation in research proposals and within assessment under the head-ing of “research impact”. The aim of this paper is to investigate how tourism research gains recognition within research evaluation, by investigating the national research appraisal in the United Kingdom (Research Excellence Framework). By using content analysis, we disentangle the rhetorical choices and narrative constructions within researchers’ impact claims. Our findings suggest that researchers adopt a rhetorical style that implies causality and promotes good outcomes facilitating ST. However, the structure of the assessment format enforces an articulation of sustainable research impact without stat-ing the methodological limitations of that such claim. Therefore, the rhetorical choices of ST researchers merely represent a proxy indicator of the claimed impact. We conclude that the lack of rigor in accounting for the impact of ST research may inadvertently restrict attaining ST. © 2020 by the authors.

"The Past Erased, the Future Stolen: Lignite Extractivism as Germany’s Trope for the Anthropocene","Coal, and even more so, brown coal or lignite, is currently under-researched in the energy humanities. Lignite still provides approximately 25% of “green” Germany’s energy; its extraction obliterates human settlements and vibrant ecosystems, and its incineration produces more CO2 than any other fossil fuel, contributing massively to climate change. After discussing German mining history, the genres of the energy narrative, the bioregional novel, and ecopoetry, and earlier literary treatments of lignite mining, I analyze recent lignite novels by Anja Wedershoven, Andreas Apelt, Bernhard Sinkel, and Ingrid Bachér, and ecopoems by Max Czollek and Marion Poschmann. I discuss socioenvironmental issues such as “slow violence” and “environmental injustice” enacted upon rural communities that are being resettled in “sacrifice zones” for national energy needs; political–economic entanglements, and activism against this complete devastation of the naturalcultural landscape; differences in representation in narrative and lyrical texts; and how the authors frame local perceptions of the mining operations and the resulting “moonscape” within the larger temporal and spatial scales of the Anthropocene. I argue that these literary texts prefigure where the Earth may be headed in the Anthropocene, and that Germany’s lignite extractivism can be considered a trope for the Anthropocene. © 2020 by the author.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of multiple board directorships in sustainability strategies: symbol or substance?,"Multiple board directorships are a global phenomenon in the business environment and have come under intense debate from regulators, professionals, and academics alike. At the same time, sustainability has become a major challenge for firms in the current scenario. The main objective of this paper is to investigate whether multiple directorships lead firms to symbolic or substantive sustainability strategies. After performing different methodological approaches and robustness tests, our findings highlight that multiple directorships lead to symbolic sustainable development by significantly intensifying environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting practices, although this is not supported by substantial ESG actions. This symbolic behaviour is even more evident in socially and environmentally sensitive industries. Given the ongoing regulatory and professional discussions concerning multiple board directorships, the ever-increasing importance of sustainability and the significant consequences of symbolic ESG strategies, our paper has direct implications for firms in the selection of board members, as well as for regulators and professionals when refining their legislation and recommendations concerning boards. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

On the History and Future of 100% Renewable Energy Systems Research,"Research on 100% renewable energy systems is a relatively recent phenomenon. It was initiated in the mid-1970s, catalyzed by skyrocketing oil prices. Since the mid-2000s, it has quickly evolved into a prominent research field encompassing an expansive and growing number of research groups and organizations across the world. The main conclusion of most of these studies is that 100% renewables is feasible worldwide at low cost. Advanced concepts and methods now enable the field to chart realistic as well as cost- or resource-optimized and efficient transition pathways to a future without the use of fossil fuels. Such proposed pathways in turn, have helped spur 100% renewable energy policy targets and actions, leading to more research. In most transition pathways, solar energy and wind power increasingly emerge as the central pillars of a sustainable energy system combined with energy efficiency measures. Cost-optimization modeling and greater resource availability tend to lead to higher solar photovoltaic shares, while emphasis on energy supply diversification tends to point to higher wind power contributions. Recent research has focused on the challenges and opportunities regarding grid congestion, energy storage, sector coupling, electrification of transport and industry implying power-to-X and hydrogen-to-X, and the inclusion of natural and technical carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches. The result is a holistic vision of the transition towards a net-negative greenhouse gas emissions economy that can limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C with a clearly defined carbon budget in a sustainable and cost-effective manner based on 100% renewable energy-industry-CDR systems. Initially, the field encountered very strong skepticism. Therefore, this paper also includes a response to major critiques against 100% renewable energy systems, and also discusses the institutional inertia that hampers adoption by the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as well as possible negative connections to community acceptance and energy justice.

Review on Sensors for Sustainable and Safe Maritime Mobility,"The increasingly stringent requirements—in terms of limiting pollutants and the constant need to make maritime transport safer—generated the necessity to foresee different solutions that are original. According to the European Maritime Safety Agency, the total number of reported marine casualties and incidents is 21.173 over the period 2014–2021, with a yearly average of 2.647 casualties and incidents. According to the same source, 495 cases of pollution were reported in the period from 2014 to 2021. Marine pollution by ships’ fuel and other pollutants is linked to 64.2% of all pollution. It is mandatory to offer a new kind of ship that can exploit new technologies to increase safety for people and onboard goods. It has been found that existing marine structures for maritime mobility do not have essential sensors for avoiding emergency situations such as flooding, oil spills, or health situations requiring efficient monitoring. In addition, there is a lack of legislation defining the insertion of unmanned vehicles into the actual marine infrastructure. This review highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of sensors in the maritime sector, intensifying areas of improvement for future challenges, such as sensor energy efficiency, data processing, sensor fusion methodologies, and accurate sea state description with environmental monitoring by means of unmanned vehicles. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Methods for measuring the IEQ and students' perceived IEQ, internal responses, and academic performance were derived from literature. Next, this systematic approach was tested in a pilot study during a regular academic course. The perceptions, internal responses, and short-term academic performance of participating students (n = 163) were measured. During the pilot study, the IEQ of the classrooms varied slightly. Significant associations (p < 0.05) were observed between these natural variations and students' perceptions of the thermal environment and indoor air quality. These perceptions were significantly associated with their physiological and cognitive responses (p < 0.05). Furthermore, students' perceived cognitive responses were associated with their short-term academic performance (p < 0.01). The observed associations confirm the construct validity of the systematic approach. However, its validity for investigating the influence of lighting remains to be determined. © 2022 The Authors.

Heavenly lights: An exploratory review of auroral ecosystem services and disservices,"Auroral ecosystem services (ES) is a subject that has not yet been formally addressed in the expansive ecosystem services literature. This study conducts a systematic literature review using the Search, Appraisal, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA) method to investigate the vast multi-century auroral literature for synthesis with the ES concept and identifies the main ES provisioned by the auroral phenomenon. A total of 2,900 publications concerning the aurora were sourced from three scientific databases (ScienceDirect, Scopus and Google Scholar), 1,054 articles were advanced to the synthesis and analysis stage, and 525 of the most illustrative examples were retained for the purposes of this review. Based on the categorization in accordance with Version 5.1 of the Common International Classification for Ecosystem Services typology, a total of 14 auroral ES are identified: provisioning (4), regulation and maintenance (1) and cultural (9). In addition, 9 ecosystem disservices (EDS) are also identified and classified: provisioning (4), regulation and maintenance (3) and cultural (2). The aurora is found to function in geophysical, biophysical and socio-ecological systems in a variety of ways. A novel extension of the ES concept is introduced as “exosystem services” (EXS), accounting for the aurora as an overlap between flows into ecosystems from the space environment, mirroring the geosystem services (GS) concept and its flows into ecosystems from the subsurface environment. Auroral ES in management and decision-making is discussed, and multiple opportunities for additional research are explored. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Islam and Capitalism in the Making of Modern Bahrain,"In recent decades, the culture, society, politics, and economics of Bahrain have been transformed, driving its global ambitions while retaining to a degree the rule of law and cosmopolitanism. Islam and Capitalism in the Making of Modern Bahrain examines the transformation of Bahrain from the 1930s, from a regional trading port and then an important oil producer into the financial hub for the Gulf and into a global centre of Islamic finance. It focuses on the changes and tensions that transformation brought to Bahrain's political, legal, economic, religious, and social structures. In this book, Rajeswary Brown explores the rising force of youth populism driven by the persistence of poverty and unemployment, notably among rural Shi'ite communities and unemployed middle-class youth, as well as examining Bahrain's skillful reconciliation of the demands of Islamic faith, expressed in the Sharia, to the requirements of modern financial capitalism. In this, Bahrain's experience can be set against the modern history of much of the rest of the Middle East, most strikingly with respect to the position of Islamic charities, notably in Syria, comparisons of which are fully explored here. © Rajeswary Ampalavanar Brown 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Smart Touristic Ports – The Emergence of Sustainable Marinas from Smart Conversion. What Future for Sardinians Ports,"Among the sectors covered by Blue Growth, the Europe 2020 strategy to foster sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors, coastal tourism represents an important sector of the tourism industry. The Region of Sardinia recently launched the Regional Plan for the Tourist Port Network as a fundamental tool for strategic planning of the sector, in order to better exploit the islands strategic position in the Mediterranean. However, the potential of ports is not always expressed by the territories in which they are located for various reasons, economic, political, administrative, etc. Competition will therefore take place if all the potential is balanced according to the peculiarities of the territories and the dictates of the most advanced multi-sectoral policies. In this context, the focus will be on the strategy that conceives the future of ports, in particular of the Sardinian Region, considering a smart, green and integrated approach for a better management, accessibility and safety of marinas and surrounding areas. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency

"Disruptive technologies for environment and health research: An overview of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and internet of things","The purpose of this descriptive research paper is to initiate discussions on the use of innovative technologies and their potential to support the research and development of pan-Canadian monitoring and surveillance activities associated with environmental impacts on health and within the health system. Its primary aim is to provide a review of disruptive technologies and their current uses in the environment and in healthcare. Drawing on extensive experience in population-level surveillance through the use of technology, knowledge from prior projects in the field, and conducting a review of the technologies, this paper is meant to serve as the initial steps toward a better understanding of the research area. In doing so, we hope to be able to better assess which technologies might best be leveraged to advance this unique intersection of health and environment. This paper first outlines the current use of technologies at the intersection of public health and the environment, in particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The paper provides a description for each of these technologies, along with a summary of their current applications, and a description of the challenges one might face with adopting them. Thereafter, a high-level reference architecture, that addresses the challenges of the described technologies and could potentially be incorporated into the pan-Canadian surveillance system, is conceived and presented. © 2019 by the authors.

The environmental and social footprint of the university of the Basque Country UPV/EHU,"This work has calculated the organisational environmental and social footprint of the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) in 2016. First, input and output data flows of the UPV/EHU activity were collected. Next, the environmental and social impacts of the academic activity were modelled, using the Ecoinvent 3.3 database with the PSILCA-based Soca v1 module in openLCA software. In order to evaluate the environmental impacts, CML and ReCiPe LCIA methods were used. The Social Impact Weighting Method was adjusted for the assessment of specific social impacts. The modelling has identified some hotspots in the organisation. The contribution of transport (8,900 km per user, annually) is close to 60% in most of the environmental impacts considered. The life cycle of computers stands out among the impacts derived from the consumption of material products. More than half of environmental impacts are located outside the Basque Country. This work has also made it possible to estimate some of the impacts of the organisational social footprint, such as accidents at work, only some of which occur at the UPV/EHU. Traces of child labour and illiteracy have also been detected in the social footprint that supports the activity of the UPV/EHU. Some of the social and environmental impacts analysed are not directly generated by the UPV/EHU, but they all demand attention and co-responsibility. Based on the modelling performed, this work explores alternative scenarios and recommends some improvement actions which may reduce (in some cases over 30%) the environmental and social impacts of the UPV/EHU's activity. These scenarios and improvement actions will feed a process with stakeholders in the UPV/EHU based on the Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
The need to transform U.S. energy innovation,"The Need for an Energy Technology Revolution How will countries provide the reliable, affordable energy needed to fuel a growing world economy and lift billions of people out of poverty without causing catastrophic climate change and other environmental disasters? Answering this question is perhaps the greatest challenge human civilization faces in the 21st century. It cannot be done without a revolution in the technologies of both energy production and use. And for that revolution to arrive in time will require a dramatic acceleration in the pace at which new or improved energy technologies are invented, demonstrated, and adopted in the marketplace. This book outlines policies the U.S. federal government in particular can adopt to foster such an energy technology revolution. These approaches will help meet the myriad energy challenges of the 21st century - and help ensure that the United States plays a leading role in doing so, capturing its share of the multi-trillion-dollar energy technology markets of the coming decades. This book seeks to answer four basic questions. First, how much should the U.S. government spend on energy research, development, and demonstration (RD&D), and how should that money be allocated? Second, how can the U.S. government best work with the private sector and encourage it to invest its own funds in researching, developing, demonstrating, and deploying new energy technologies? Third, how can the U.S. government manage its energy RD&D investments and the institutions through which they flow to get the most beneficial energy innovation per dollar invested? Fourth, how can the U.S. government best manage competition and cooperation with other countries in energy technology innovation? © Cambridge University Press 2014.",Not About Sufficiency
What can deliberative approaches bring to the monetary valuation of ecosystem services? A literature review,"In response to extensive criticism of the monetary valuation of ecosystem services deliberative monetary valuation (DMV) has been proposed as an improved approach that combines the benefits of deliberative decision-making with the advantages of monetary values. In this study the body of literature that has developed in the field of deliberative monetary valuation is reviewed to assess the potential advantages and challenges that this approach can bring to the valuation of ecosystem services. The studies reviewed present a range of approaches to DMV based on different paradigms and methods. While studies that implemented DMV were primarily concerned with improving monetary values within the neoclassical economic paradigm, proposals for DMV in theoretical papers are challenging this paradigm and stress the potential for DMV to produce more democratic and equitable values. It was found that DMV still faces large practical and theoretical challenges, most notably the lack of a theoretical base for the interpretation of the monetary values produced. Before these challenges are addressed it is early days to assess the usefulness of DMV for the valuation of ecosystem services. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
A Massive Open Online Course on climate change: The social construction of a global problem using new tools for connectedness,"Climate change is a pervasive and challenging phenomenon that takes on a variety of meanings and frames, each of which suggests different victims, villains, and solutions. New tools are emerging that may facilitate a reframing, or at least the collaborative coproduction, of the climate change conversation. Web-based social media have provided a new level of connectedness and capacity to collaborate through a merging of the social and educational worlds in the form of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs): web-based, freely available courses taught by university and college instructors, and offered to thousands of students at a time. Our development and delivery of the first interdisciplinary climate change MOOC has opened a new window into (1) the tools available to convene a conversation about climate change, (2) the processes of negotiation, cultural articulation, and identity formation that occur through conversations that include large populations from diverse backgrounds, and (3) the implications of this conversation for the broader climate change discourse, the definition of the problem, attributions of responsibility, and the development of solutions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
SDG 7 requires post-growth energy sufficiency,"Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) aims to achieve “energy for all” by improving energy security for the world's poor while supporting a global transition toward low-carbon energy sources.

Allies for subsistence: poverty alleviation in community forestry limited by powerful actors,"Over one billion people in the world depend on forests to meeting livelihood needs and more than half of them engage in community-based forest management. Community forestry has the potential of making important contributions in achieving the sustainable development goals; however, their positive effects on local livelihoods have been questioned. Actors, with their interests and power balance, can be important factors explaining the success of community forestry by shaping the decision-making process. Hence, the aim of our study was to analyze the economic performance of community forestry across the world, through its contribution to poverty reduction and explain how the economic outcome relates to the interests of the powerful actors. Community forestry from seven countries was analyzed including cases in Asia (Nepal, Indonesia, Vietnam), Africa (Namibia and Cameroon), and Europe (Germany and Albania). Data were collected with a sequence design method aiming to identify the participating actors and their power. A multivariate principal components analysis was conducted to capture the power dynamics within each community forestry. Results showed that community forestry programs do not always lead to poverty alleviation. The economic outcomes can be linked to the interests of the most powerful actors which in most cases do not desire a high economic outcome but rather promote contributions up to subsistence level. © 2022 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
The good farmer: Culture and identity in food and agriculture,"Developed by leading authors in the field, this book offers a cohesive and definitive theorisation of the concept of the ‘good farmer’, integrating historical analysis, critique of contemporary applications of good farming concepts, and new case studies, providing a springboard for future research. The concept of the good farmer has emerged in recent years as part of a move away from attitude and economic-based understandings of farm decision-making towards a deeper understanding of culture and symbolism in agriculture. The Good Farmer shows why agricultural production is socially and culturally, as well as economically, important. It explores the history of the concept and its position in contemporary theory, as well as its use and meaning in a variety of different contexts, including landscape, environment, gender, society, and as a tool for resistance. By exploring the idea of the good farmer, it reveals the often-unforeseen assumptions implicit in food and agricultural policy that draw on culture, identity, and presumed notions of what is ‘good’. The book concludes by considering the potential of the good farmer concept for addressing future, emerging issues in agriculture. This book will be of interest to students and scholars of food and agriculture and rural development, as well as professionals and policymakers involved in the food and agricultural industry. © 2021 Rob J.

Defining human critical determinants for sustainability: asking psychologists could help,"Why are sustainability goals so hard to achieve? In a recent Note & Comment, Santos et al. (Sustain Sci 19:1097–1105, 2024) call for an examination of ‘human critical determinants’ as barriers to the achievement of sustainability goals. We fully support this call. However, we argue that the vital role played by ‘inner worlds’ cannot be understood if abstracted away from the context in which cognition is situated., i.e., it is not just ‘inner worlds’ that must be accounted for, but also their place within their broader situational and social contexts. We recommend future research in sustainability science consider the evidence and frameworks accumulated by psychologists on what humans, as socially and culturally situated organisms, need to thrive, and we explain why this interdisciplinarity could be transformative towards achieving the goals of sustainability science. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Inequality in a Context of Climate Crisis after COVID: A Complex Realist Approach,"Inequality in a Context of Climate Crisis after COVID uses a complex realist approach to examine the crisis of three interconnected problems: economic inequality, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Widely acknowledged as the key driver of political discontent and social instability, economic inequality across high and middle-income countries is profoundly interconnected with climate change. Both of these issues are now set within the particularly acute context of COVID-19 and its aftermath. Confronting the crisis of these inherently interwoven issues is now the major problem for all political and governance systems. This book uses a complex realist frame of reference to understand the character of social-cultural-economic-political-ecological systems. It gives us a vocabulary and modes of thinking to confront these societal challenges and inform future action. Contributing to our thinking about dynamic social systems, this text deploys complex realism to understand our trajectory towards increasing inequality. It puts complexity to work in addressing fundamental social issues in a context of climate crisis after COVID-19. This book will be of interest to students and scholars across the social sciences, in particular to those studying social inequality, climate change, heterodox economics, complex systems, and Master's students in prgrammes with an applied focus. It will be of use to policymakers and practitioners. © 2021 David Byrne. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency

Conferencing in times of climate crisis and Covid-19: feminist and queer reflections on the digital shift in academic work,"This article employs a holistic understanding of environmental, social, and economic sustainability to explore the interaction between neoliberalism, climate crisis, digitalization, and academic work with a focus on its everyday aspects. Drawing our experience of organizing an online conference during the Covid-19 pandemic and our dialogue with conference participants, we first problematize the presumed disembodiment of digital exchange and suggest a nuanced understanding of physicality’s role in knowledge production. We then explore the impact of the changing times and spaces of academic work on bodies and minds and the boundaries between private and public realms. Finally, we challenge the notion of digital solutionism by highlighting the implications of inhabiting digital platforms as spaces for knowledge production. While there is no simple solution to the problems around the digital shift in academic work and conferencing, we argue, downsizing can be a counteraction to platform capitalism in times of the climate crisis. © 2024 The Author(s).

Spatial Analysis of Risk Exposure of Urban Trees: A Case Study from Bologna (Italy),"In Europe, more than two-thirds of the population live in urban areas. The management of urban green areas and trees is becoming increasingly relevant involving different players and stakeholders, as well for keeping a focus on the Sustainable Development Goals. Society and policy makers are often unaware of the disservices that neglecting these areas can cause. Appropriate monitoring interventions can protect both citizens and trees themselves. The aim of the study was to assess the risk potential in urban trees in Bologna suburbs (Italy). For each tree in the city of Bologna, three target variables identifying the number and categories of streets, buildings, and walking and cycle paths near the tree were considered and used as covariates. A multiple regression model assessing the relationship between a dependent synthetic spatial variable (digital number, DN), proxy of the likelihood of tree failure, and the three independent covariates was estimated. Both the number of streets and walking and cycle paths in the area surrounding a tree are shown to be significantly associated with the DN value. The use of open data can assist in monitoring and maintaining urban green areas. The tool supports a virtuous circle between stakeholders in urban systems through sustainability and efficiency. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"A scientometric analysis and review of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions: Research hotspots, new frontiers, and environmental implications","Bioenergy is considered a promising alternative to achieve carbon neutrality and emission reduction. There is a debate over the role of bioenergy in climate change mitigation because of carbon emissions from the production and utilization of biofuels. Recently, studies on emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) have substantially increased as they have a significant impact on human health and climate change due to large emissions and high reactivity. A scientometric analysis of 2895 journal papers during 1991 and 2020 related to BVOC emissions from the Web of Science Core Collection was conducted by CiteSpace and Carrot2. Results showed that three main knowledge domains were BVOC emissions and drivers, BVOCs and their oxidation products in biosphere-atmosphere exchange, and soil BVOCs in plant-microbe interactions during the period under study. Generally, the relationships between plant BVOC emissions and environmental variables (e.g., temperature, drought, light solar radiation, humidity, availability of nutrients, carbon dioxide, ozone, etc.) can be investigated by measurement techniques (i.e., chamber) or models (i.e., Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature). Soils could work as both the sink and source of BVOCs through various processes that are affected by soil temperatures, pH, organic matter, and moisture. Anthropogenic activities might affect the emission of BVOCs and promote the formation of BVOC-derived pollutants (e.g., ozone, particles, etc.). Incorporating BVOC emissions and their relationships with pollutants, biomass, and energy into environmental management and decision-making is a promising direction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a Reference Organism to Study Algal–Microbial Interactions: Why Can’t They Be Friends?","The stability and harmony of ecological niches rely on intricate interactions between their members.

Optimizing the use of forestry biomass producer gas in dual fuel engines: A novel emissions reduction strategy for a micro-CHP system,"Low energy density fuels, like producer gas from biomass gasification, can be profitably used in compression ignition (CI) engines by means of a proper combustion strategy, such as the dual-fuel mode. Experimental investigations have proven the environmental benefits of the use of producer gas in terms of green-house gas emissions but critical issues related to their use in CI engines have been also highlighted. In particular, under specific operating conditions, the performance and the emissions of the engine might be derated reducing the attractiveness of the technology. In this work a new data-driven emission optimization strategy for a micro-cogeneration system based on an open-top biomass gasification unit coupled with a CI engine running in dual-fuel mode (producer gas/diesel) is presented and discussed. The main purpose of the work is to provide an appropriate tool to address one of the typical problems of dual-fuel systems, namely the nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) emission trade-off, by calculating the optimal diesel substitution rate (DSR) at a certain required power load. The methodology baseline is the experimental characterization and parametric modeling of the system in terms of NOx, CO, and electrical efficiency (ηe). Then a trade-off objective function (TOF) is defined. The novelties of the proposed approach stands in the building of an ad-hoc designed TOF so as to describe the problem with a single-objective optimization, and thus avoiding the computational and time complexity of a multi-objective optimization. Moreover, a second peculiar aspect is the introduction in the TOF of an internally dependent coefficient (namely the load factor Kl) able to take into account the effect of load and DSR on CO emissions: the adding of such a physical-related feature represents an effective enrichment of the minimization strategy, especially considering the nature of the optimization, which is purely data-driven. Finally, sequential quadratic programming (SQP) minimization of the TOF is carried out by means of the available MATLAB SQP libraries, and two optimization strategies – namely, CO-driven and efficiency-driven - are discussed. Results show (i) promising potentialities in identifying the best effective utilization range of dual-fuel combustion; (ii) high flexibility in the use of the optimization algorithm thanks to the definition of the TOF, which can be easily adapted to different objectives (e.g., NOx mitigation, maintenance of high electrical efficiencies, CO emission bounding) while maintaining external constraints; (iii) high robustness even in the extreme cases in which the imposition of a particular constraint (e.g., high electrical efficiency) is not compatible with the capabilities of the system. © 2023 The Author",Not About Sufficiency
Strengthening the Interaction of the Virology Community with the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) by Linking Virus Names and Their Abbreviations to Virus Species,"The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) is tasked with classifying viruses into taxa (phyla to species) and devising taxon names. Virus names and virus name abbreviations are currently not within the ICTV's official remit and are not regulated by an official entity. Many scientists, medical/veterinary professionals, and regulatory agencies do not address evolutionary questions nor are they concerned with the hierarchical organization of the viral world, and therefore, have limited use for ICTV-devised taxa. Instead, these professionals look to the ICTV as an expert point source that provides the most current taxonomic affiliations of viruses of interests to facilitate document writing. These needs are currently unmet as an ICTV-supported, easily searchable database that includes all published virus names and abbreviations linked to their taxa is not available. In addition, in stark contrast to other biological taxonomic frameworks, virus taxonomy currently permits individual species to have several members. Consequently, confusion emerges among those who are not aware of the difference between taxa and viruses, and because certain well-known viruses cannot be located in ICTV publications or be linked to their species. In addition, the number of duplicate names and abbreviations has increased dramatically in the literature. To solve this conundrum, the ICTV could mandate listing all viruses of established species and all reported unclassified viruses in forthcoming online ICTV Reports and create a searchable webpage using this information. The International Union of Microbiology Societies could also consider changing the mandate of the ICTV to include the nomenclature of all viruses in addition to taxon considerations. With such a mandate expansion, official virus names and virus name abbreviations could be catalogued and virus nomenclature could be standardized. As a result, the ICTV would become an even more useful resource for all stakeholders in virology. © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press, on behalf of the Society of Systematic Biologists 2019.",Not About Sufficiency

Big changes in backyard birds: An analysis of long-term changes in bird communities in Australia's most populous urban regions,"Urban environments are increasingly acknowledged as a priority for biodiversity conservation. Birds in particular are capable of persisting, and sometimes thriving, in cities and towns globally. However, the process of urbanization results in the loss of many bird species due to the resulting changes in habitat conditions. Urban expansion and densification present a threat to both urban bird biodiversity and bird conservation more broadly. Australian urban areas, including suburban and peri-urban areas, currently support moderate bird species richness, but the rapidly changing urban landscape threatens these communities. Unfortunately, many bird species' population trends are not actively studied, resulting in a poor understanding of species persistence in urban environments. Here, we used bird survey data from long-running citizen science databases in a Bayesian List Length Analysis to determine changes in bird species prevalence (the probability of observing a species in a given survey event) over time in Australia's four most populous urban regions. We found that introduced species, historically prominent in Australian urban bird communities, are decreasing in prevalence in all four regions, while a small group of native urban exploiters are becoming more prevalent. Our results also show that many species perceived to be “iconic” or “common” are experiencing declines in prevalence in urban areas, highlighting the importance of monitoring and conservation action in urban areas. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Community-based conservation with formal protection provides large collateral benefits to Amazonian migratory waterbirds,"Populations of migratory waterbirds are facing dramatic declines worldwide due to illegal hunting, habitat loss and climate change. Conservation strategies to reverse these trends are imperative, especially in tropical developing countries, which almost invariably allocate insufficient levels of investment for environmental protection. Here, we compared the effectiveness of sustainable-use Protected Areas (PAs) and Community-based Conservation (CBC) arrangements for the conservation of migratory waterbirds that breed on seasonal riverine sandy beaches in Brazilian Amazonia. We modeled local population responses of four migratory waterbird species on 155 beaches along a ~1,600 km section of a major tributary of the Amazon, as a function of community enforcement, official protection status, human pressure and landscape features. We show that 21 community-protected beaches within the study area host more than 80% of all sampled birds. Black Skimmers showed the most dramatic response, with breeding numbers 135-fold larger in CBC arrangements compared to beaches with no official protection status. The same pattern was observed for nesting Large-Billed and Yellow-Billed Terns. For the Near Threatened Orinoco Goose, PA status was the strongest predictor of local population size. These dramatic results demonstrate the value of protected refugia, achieved through the concerted action of participating local communities, to support breeding populations of key waterbird species. This highlyeffective and low-cost conservation model can potentially be replicated in other regions of the developing world experiencing increasingly intensive exploitation of riverine natural resources.

Recognizing first-person opportunities for sustainable development,"Opportunity recognition has been acknowledged as one of the most relevant topics in the entrepreneurial process. Specifically, entrepreneurial opportunities are defined as ‘situations in which new goods, services, raw materials, and organizing methods can be introduced and sold at greater than their costs of production’ (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000: 220). Opportunity recognition acts as a trigger for the entire entrepreneurial process by uncovering a prospective pattern for the entrepreneurial initiative (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000; McMullen and Shepherd, 2006; Baron, 2006). Although this topic has been widely explored within the traditional entrepreneurship domain, the adaptability of opportunity recognition to new forms of entrepreneurial initiatives - such as entrepreneurship for sustainable development - has been overlooked. Sustainable development (which includes preservation of the ecosystem, reduction of degradation and deforestation) has been acknowledged as a priority at all latitudes by the global community (WCED, 1987; Hall et al., 2010). Within this urgency, entrepreneurship has been advocated by a number of scholars as a key element for counteracting negative social and environmental trends (Brown, 2006; Homer-Dixon, 2006; Lovins et al., 2004; Vaitheeswaran, 2003).

Institutional entrepreneurs on opportunity formation and exploitation in strategic new industry two cases of solar energy industry development in china,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of institutional entrepreneurship in opportunity formation and opportunity exploitation in developing emerging strategic new industries. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews the focal literature focussing on institutional entrepreneurs’ role in opportunity formation with special attention to opportunities for institutional entrepreneurs in emerging economy. A multi-method approach consisting of historical case studies and event sequencing is applied to track the historical development of the solar energy industry in two case contexts and to investigate the role of institutional entrepreneurs in this process. Findings – Investigation of two cases illustrates that different types of institutional entrepreneur, as represented by individual entrepreneurs and local government, in the context of massive institutional change – such as the Grand Western Development Program and the Thousand Talents Program in China – have varied effects on triggering and inducing institutional change and innovation to explore and exploit opportunities in emerging new industries. Practical implications – The significance of local context for the nature and scope of institutional entrepreneurship in emerging economy is worthy of further research. The top-down process of institutional innovation dominated by local government might cause myopic outcome and distortion of market opportunities. Indigenous individual entrepreneurs with well-accumulated political capital and strong perceived responsibility could be the main actors to introduce incremental institutional change by combining bottom-up and top-down processes and promoting sustained new industry development through creating and seizing institutional opportunities and market opportunities. Originality/value – This paper illustrates the close relationship between institutional environment and opportunity formation in emerging economies, contributes to the understanding of contextualizing institutional entrepreneurs in different regional contexts and discloses the problems involved in local government acting as an institutional entrepreneur. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
When carbon emission trading meets a regulated industry: Evidence from the electricity sector of China,"This paper provides retrospective firm-level evidence on the effectiveness of China's carbon market pilots in reducing emissions in the electricity sector. We show that the carbon emission trading system (ETS) has no effect on changing coal efficiency of regulated coal-fired power plants. Although we find a significant reduction in coal consumption associated with ETS participation, this reduction was achieved by reducing electricity production. The output contraction in the treated plants is not due to their optimizing behavior but is likely driven by government decisions, because the impacts of emission permits on marginal costs are small relative to the controlled electricity prices and the reduction is associated with financial losses. In addition, we find no evidence of carbon leakage to other provinces, but a significant increase in the production of non-coal-fired power plants in the ETS regions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
How Do Ecosystem Services Affect Poverty Reduction Efficiency? A Panel Data Analysis of State Poverty Counties in China,"Scientific evaluation of the interaction between poverty reduction efficiency (PRE) and ecosystem services (ES) in state poverty counties is essential in promoting the rural revitalization strategy and the construction of an ecological civilization. Using the DEA model, the InVEST model, and fixed-effect panel data, this study was analyzed using the panel data of 832 poverty counties in China for 2010–2019 to evaluate the relationship between poverty reduction efficiency and ecosystem services. The main results are as follows: (1) The overall poverty reduction efficiency showed an upward trend, while ES exhibited a declining trend with spatial heterogeneity. The poverty reduction efficiency of state poverty counties in the western region increased rapidly. (2) The impact of different types of ecosystem services on poverty reduction efficiency varied considerably. Habitat quality was significantly negatively impacted, while food production and carbon storage showed significant positive effects. There was a significant positive relationship between ecosystem services and poverty reduction efficiency in all regions, with the eastern region having the strongest correlation. (3) The panel regression analysis showed a significant positive impact. The environmental parameters were the primary factors affecting poverty reduction efficiency, while economic and social factors were the driving and external factors. The rural revitalization strategy should strive towards the win-win effect of ecological protection and economic development. © 2022 by the authors.

The investment of renewable energy: Is green bond a safe-haven to hedge U.S. monetary policy uncertainty?,"This paper uses the bootstrap rolling-window Granger causality test to investigate the relationship between U.S. monetary policy uncertainty and green bond. The method addresses the limitations of ignoring the instability of coefficients and the time-varying relationship between the variables in previous literature. The results find both insignificant and significant relationship in the full period. One explanation of the insignificant relationship is that the changes of investor sentiment influence their judgment regarding to the monetary policy uncertainty and green bond, and thus the significance of the relationship between the variables. Besides, this paper finds the significant inter-relationship is time-varying. Specifically, in the sub-period when the market sentiment is low, the rising monetary policy uncertainty influences green bond price negatively. Meanwhile, the unexpected changes of green bond may also have both positive and negative effects on monetary policy uncertainty in different sub-periods. Thus, this paper proposes that the impact mechanism between the variables is effective when the investors are irrational. Furthermore, the findings may provide valuable implications for investors and governments, including adjusting investment strategy when the monetary policy is unclear, increasing monetary policy transparency, and monitoring speculative activity in green bond market. In addition, it is necessary to emphasize that the validity of the findings is limited to the U.S. and the period when investors’ sentiment experience large fluctuations. Finally, future research may consider expand the analysis to the green stock, as it is another important channel for renewable energy investment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Resilience of aging structures and infrastructure systems with emphasis on seismic resilience of bridges and road networks: Review,"Risk assessment and mitigation programs have been carried out over the last decades in the attempt to reduce transportation infrastructure downtime and post-disaster recovery costs. Recently, the concept of resilience gained increasing importance in design, assessment, maintenance, and rehabilitation structures and infrastructure systems, particularly bridges and transportation networks, exposed to natural and man-made hazards. In the field of disaster mitigation, frameworks have been proposed to provide a basis for development of qualitative and quantitative models quantifying the functionality and resilience at various scales, including components, groups and systems within infrastructure networks and communities. In these frameworks, the effects of aging and environmental aggressiveness must be explicitly considered, affecting the structural performance and functionality of civil infrastructure systems. Significant efforts have been made to incorporate risk and resilience assessment frameworks into informed decision making to decide how to best use resources to minimize the impact of hazards on civil infrastructure systems. This review paper is part of these efforts. It presents an overview of the main principles and concepts, methods and strategies, advances and accomplishments in the field of life-cycle reliability, risk and resilience of structures and infrastructure systems, with emphasis on seismic resilience of bridges and road networks. © 2022 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Responding to a Public Health Objection to Vaccinating the Great Apes,"Capps and Lederman, in a paper published in this journal in 2015, argued that, at the time, the dismal circumstances of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was an opportunity to revisit public health responses to emergent infectious diseases. Using a One Health lens, they argued for an ecological perspective—one that looked to respond to zoonoses as an environmental as well as public health concern. Using Ebola virus disease as an example, they suggested shared immunity as a strategy to vaccinate both humans and great apes. Since then, vaccination as a conservation strategy in this case has been debated and at least one great ape vaccination trial has been proposed: some, however, are less convinced of the ethical arguments to pursue vaccinating wild animals. Using this opportunity, we review Capps and Lederman’s arguments and directly respond to the plausible objections to them. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Not About Sufficiency

Nanotechnology and the New Frontiers of Drug Delivery in Cerebral Gliomas,"Gliomas amount to about 45% of all primary CNS tumors and 77% of all malignant primary CNS tumors. It is now generally accepted that the modulation of gene expression may be the most effective modality to control specific gene functions correlated to the development and progression of gliomas. The efficacy of current multimodal therapeutic strategies in gliomas is limited by the lack of specific therapies against malignant cells, and the prognosis in patients affected by primary brain tumors is still very unfavorable. Current pharmacological treatments for brain tumors are also limited by the presence of the blood-brain barrier as a natural obstacle to overcome. Thus, therapies for brain tumors are still limited to date. Nanotechnology offers a way to bypass, in a noninvasive manner, the barrier delivering specific therapeutic compounds. Moreover, nanoparticles drug delivery systems can improve bioavailability and sustain release of drugs for systemic delivery. Interestingly, multifunctional nanoplatforms provide multiple functions in a single compound. These innovative compounds are able to deliver drugs in the optimal dose range, which results in augmented therapeutic efficacy and minimal side effects. In this chapter we will focus on the different types of nanoparticle compounds studied for the treatment of brain tumors. Finally, we will report various preclinical and/or clinical studies in brain tumor treatment. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Coal to biomass conversion as a path to sustainability: A hypothetical scenario at pego power plant (Abrantes, Portugal)","Energy consumption is associated with economic growth, but it comes with a toll regarding the environment. Renewable energies can be considered substitutes for fossil fuels and may contribute to reducing the environmental degradation that the world is presently facing. With this research, we aimed to offer a broader view of the state-of-the-art in this field, particularly regarding coal and biomass. The main objective is to present a viable and sustainable solution for the coal power plants still in operation, using as a hypothetical example the Pego Power Plant, the last operating coal fueled power plant in Portugal. After the characterization of land use and energy production in Portugal, and more particularly in the Médio Tejo region, where the power plant is located, the availability of biomass was assessed and it was concluded that the volume of biomass needed to keep the Pego power plant working exclusively with biomass is much lower than the yearly growth volume of biomass in the region, which means that this transition would be viable in a sustainable way. This path is aligned with policies to fight climate change, since the use of biomass for energy is characterized by low levels of GHGs emissions when compared to coal. The risk of rural fires would be reduced, and the economic and social impact for this region would be positive. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
The public health emergency of climate change: how/are Canadian post-secondary public health sciences programs responding?,"Objective: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently issued a statement that the fate of human society and human health is at serious risk of catastrophic impacts unless we take bold action to keep global warming under 1.5 °C. In 2015, the Canadian Public Health Association noted emerging efforts to embrace intersectoral approaches to global change in public health research and practice. In this study, we question the extent to which Canadian Graduate Public Health Sciences Programs have kept pace with these efforts to see climate change surface as a new frontier for training the next generation of researchers and practitioners. Methods: Semi-structured interviews (19) were conducted with Department Heads (or equivalents) of graduate-level Public Health Sciences Programs at 15 Canadian universities concerning the place of climate change in their respective curricula. Interviews were designed to elicit participants’ institutional perspectives on the importance of climate change in the Public Health Sciences and identify perceived challenges and opportunities. Results: Despite wide recognition among participants that climate change is a public health “crisis”, very few reported having substantive curricular engagement on the topic. Key challenges identified were lack of resources, organizational issues, and political barriers. Key opportunities to adapt curricula to address this new frontier in Public Health were faculty interest and expertise, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and pressure from the institution. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence for post-secondary Public Health Sciences Programs to understand the need to address their own sluggishness when what is needed are bold, even radical, shifts to existing curricula. © 2020, The Canadian Public Health Association.",Not About Sufficiency
Multifaceted determinants influencing South African smallholder farmers’ choices to access and utilize underutilized crops,"Underutilized crops (UCs), referred to as neglected or orphan crops, play a crucial role in addressing food security, nutrition, and rural development. However, despite their nutritional, economic, and environmental benefits, their consumption remains low among smallholder farmers. This study investigates the socio-economic and perceptual factors influencing smallholder farmers’ decisions to consume UCs, focusing on taro roots (Colocasia esculenta) and sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Using data from 300 smallholder farmers, the study applies Factor Analysis (FA) and a binary logistic regression model to identify key determinants of UC consumption. The FA revealed four main perception factors influencing farmers’ decisions: perception of production, taste, awareness, and availability of UCs. The binary logistic regression results showed that household size (p < 0.05), marital status (p < 0.01), and gender (p < 0.05) significantly influenced UC consumption. Notably, farmers’ positive perception of taste (p < 0.1) increased the likelihood of consumption, whereas a lack of awareness (p < 0.1) had a negative impact. However, contrary to initial expectations, receiving a government grant (p < 0.05) and off-farm income (p < 0.05) were negatively associated with UC consumption, indicating that financial stability does not necessarily translate into increased adoption. These findings suggest that raising awareness, addressing market constraints, and fostering positive perceptions of UCs are crucial for increasing their consumption. The study highlights the need for targeted interventions to improve UC accessibility and appeal, thereby supporting sustainable food security strategies in South Africa and other regions with similar demographics.

The impact of green spaces on the perception and well-being of the academic population in face of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Amazon and Southeast Brazil,"The present research aims to evaluate the impact of green spaces (GS) and their influence on the human perception of comfort, as well as on well-being in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic and has case studies conducted in the cities of São Paulo, SP, and Porto Velho, RO, in Brazil, with primary data collection from >400 respondents in the year 2021 and served as support for an unprecedented discussion on human perception, vegetation and Covid-19. The results show that the way people feel is impacted by the availability of vegetation in cities and that the greater the availability of intra-urban vegetation, the greater the perception of benefits. The social isolation during the investigation period caused the population of São Paulo to reduce their experiences in GS, which had an impact on their well-being. Important differences were evident when the sample was grouped by demographic groups. Finally, the present research provides important subsidies to the government, architects, urban planners and planners in the development of cities focused on human well-being, capable of acting as an active means in the quality of life. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Undermined Efforts? The Ambiguous Role of Mining Jobs in a Just Transition,"In finding alternatives for workers currently employed in the fossil fuel industry, just transition policies can ultimately undermine environmental concerns and efforts to redress inequalities. For example, it is suggested to create jobs in other extractive industries to meet the material requirements of renewable energy technologies. We focus on this ambiguous role of job preservation as a key demand of just transition and review selected national transformation strategies from the Global North and the Global South. Comparing qualification requirements of coal mining jobs with other alternatives, we propose to complement current strategies with jobs outside the extractive sector value chains. Fostering these can work towards realising social and environmental goals in synergy, rather than pitting one against the other. We conclude that finding work opportunities that minimise extraction requirements and benefit local communities can help level global and regional inequalities by allowing mining regions to escape from their current positions in global value chains. © 2023 Mattersburger Kreis fur Entwicklungspolitik.

"A just transition for whom? Politics, contestation, and social identity in the disruption of coal in the Powder River Basin","Substantially decreasing carbon emissions is both necessary to stave off the worst impacts of climate change and also certain to result in a loss of jobs and revenue for fossil fuel communities and workers. Just transition policies aim to mitigate these losses and provide an equitable transition away from fossil fuel extraction and use. Yet, just transition is often contested in the regions the policies are meant to aid. This paper presents a case study of the Powder River Basin, Wyoming, the largest coal mining region in the U.S where the energy transition is deeply contested. In the summer of 2019, two large coal mines suddenly and unexpectedly shut down. The research conducted explored whether this sudden change in conditions changed perceptions toward the energy transition or just transition polices based on interviews with decision makers, environmental advocates, coal industry officials, and union officials. I find that the energy transition and just transition remains deeply contested and opposed, even after the sudden closure of the mines, indicating that transition may always be contested due to the long-standing role coal has played in the region. Despite opposition and efforts to prolong the life of the coal industry, an energy transition is occurring and a government-led managed decline with just transition policies is the best way to prevent severe economic distress in the region. © 2020",Not About Sufficiency
Isn’t it time we transitioned to integrated sustainability? De-codifying the hard-soft divide from a systems-theoretic perspective,"Purpose: The instrumental-normative divide that has historically characterized approaches to societal sustainability has also resulted in a rift between underlying mental models and methods destined to address the issue. This separation makes our understanding and tackling of the present global ecological problems only limited and ineffective. The present work aims to draw on theoretical background to develop a conceptual framework for transitioning to integrated corporate sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing inspiration from Luhmann’s (1995) theory of social systems, we consider the instrumental (hard) and normative (soft) methods (Jackson 2019) for corporate sustainability as “conceptual systems” that derive much of traditional social systems’ attributes. These systems are autopoietic, complexity-reducing and functionally differentiated. Following Luhmann’s philosophical grounding, we suggest that integrating the two systems of hard and soft methods boils down to constraining both systems’ internal complexity by imposing limitations on their operational structures. This translates into a decodification–recodification process whereby new methods emerge as a combination of initially disconnected structures. Findings: The proposed conceptual integration framework is applied to the case of the Sustainability Balanced Scorecard (SBSC) which has been recently subject to inconclusive controversy. Our work demonstrates that redesigning the SBSC’s architecture following the presented framework leads to embracing complexity, tensions and conflict all the while offering a systematic approach for properly identifying and quantifying cause–effect relationships. Moreover, the proposed framework scores high in Complexity and Systemicity measures, making it both durable and practically useful. More generally, this work drives home the point that an integrated approach to sustainability management is not only important but also feasible and theoretically durable. Research limitations/implications: Theoretically, the present work underscores the contribution of systems theory, and particularly the Luhmannian perspective, to transcending some of the most salient “divides” in approaches to societal sustainability. The decodification–recodification process not only enables integrating two distinct conceptual systems, but it also transforms the divide into an opportunity to gain a fresher perspective on one of the most challenging issues of our time. This process may demand, however, some adjustments as we move across various function systems, which requires solid knowledge and understanding of the underlying “codes” that define the systems subject to integration. Practical implications: This work implies that integration of varied and sometimes outwardly opposed function systems can and must be carried out to achieve larger societal impact. With respect to the illustrated case, the emerging dynamic SBSC offers a viable strategic planning platform whereby managers and stakeholders can concurrently define, forecast and adjust the societal strategy that maximizes triple bottom-line indicators and sustainable development impact. Social implications: Providing decision and policymakers with integrated sustainability management approaches and instruments will have a direct benefit on enhancing the way systems, and large corporations in particular, treat and deal with nature and human beings. Originality/value: We propose that proper integration of multiple function systems, employing integrative, unbiased and structured methodologies, can be decisive in challenging current practices in sustainability management and in providing informed guidance for making the high-stake decisions needed in the transition towards sustainable development of business and society. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Interplay between sodium and chloride decides the plant’s fate under salt and drought stress conditions,"In saline conditions, sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions are considered a major impediment to the growth and development process. The abundance of these two ions in plants decides the overall fate of the plant under salinity stress. A myriad of evidence is present, where the excessive accumulation of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) leads to irreversible damages. However, NaCl-mediated amelioration is also reported to withstand extreme drought and salt stress and improve photosynthesis and plant metabolism. The chloride (Cl-) ion-mediated repair of stress-induced DNA damage might provide important benefits under salt stress. The primary impact of salinity and drought stress is via osmotic effect, so the immediate downstream signaling process in response to these stresses was similar; however, it differs substantially during the later period of stress. A plant’s sensitivity toward salt stress relies on the modulation of gene expression belonging to the functional (HKT, SOS, NHX, HAK) and regulatory (NAC, MYB) gene families. Among different types of plants, glycophytes are very sensitive to salt stress and, in general, utilize an ion-exclusion mechanism for maintaining ionic and cellular homeostasis and a low Na+/K+ ratio in active plant parts. The SOS, HKT, HAK, PM-ATPase family transporter genes were reported to contribute to better performance of the glycophytes. On the contrary, in halophytes, both ion exclusion and tissue tolerance strategies play a major role as these plants can use Na+ as an osmoregulator. Here, the NHX family transporters and vacuolar ATPase were reported to play a key role. In addition, it was reported that xerophytic plants could utilize NaCl to improve their tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses. Therefore in this compilation, we summarize the relative contribution of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions for deciding the plant’s fate to salt and drought stress and their possible ameliorative roles in stress adaptation and tolerance. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Deep learning approaches and interventions for futuristic engineering in agriculture,"With shrinking natural resources and the climate challenges, it is foreseen that there will be an imminent stress in agricultural outputs. Deep learning provides immense possibilities in allowing computational models to learn representation of data generated for precise application of agricultural inputs and the smart management of outputs. This will go a long way in addressing the global food security concerns. Present study demonstrates the discriminative and predictive power of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches that have been successfully applied to the various facets of engineering in agriculture; ranging from estimation of soil moisture, water stress determination, disease detection, weed identification, agro-produce quality evaluation and more. Realization of these approaches will preclude human judgment by the underlying iterations of deep learning framework resulting in an increased precision and universality. Broader acceptance and applicability of deep learning would require inclusion of ground-truth datasets and should feature integration of mechanisms for fusion of data from multiple provenances; thus making the models robust and field worthy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
"How might adaptation to climate change by smallholder farming communities contribute to climate change mitigation outcomes? A case study from Timor-Leste, Southeast Asia","The agriculture industry is significantly exposed to the impacts of climate change, and is also responsible for contributing extensive greenhouse gas emissions. As a way of responding to both adaptation and mitigation challenges within the industry, this article examines how community-based climate change adaptation initiatives might provide mitigation outcomes in the agriculture sector in Timor-Leste. Beginning with an exploration of nation-wide institutional responses to climate change, the study utilises interviews, field observations and document analysis to examine an extensive community-based adaptation program in two districts in Timor-Leste focused on increasing the resilience of the agriculture sector and the livelihoods of poor rural farmers. Analysis of this program reveals a largely synergistic relationship between adaptation measures focused on land and water management and agriculture and their corresponding greenhouse gas mitigation potential, including co-benefits such as soil/atmospheric carbon sequestration, reduced emissions, soil nitrification and reduced use of inorganic fertilisers. Community-based adaptation programs in the agriculture sector have a significant influence on mitigation outcomes, which is often overlooked in community-based programs. The adaptation program in Timor-Leste has provided useful insights into the inter-relationships between adaptation and mitigation at the community level, which could be further supported and scaled-up in other Southeast Asia countries and elsewhere.",Not About Sufficiency

Food security and biodiversity: Can we have both? An agroecological analysis,"We present an extensive literature review exploring the relationships between food insecurity and rapid biodiversity loss, and the competing methods proposed to address each of these serious problems. Given a large and growing human population, the persistence of widespread malnutrition, and the direct and significant threats the expanding agricultural system poses to biodiversity, the goals of providing universal food security and protecting biodiversity seem incompatible. Examining the literature shows that the current agricultural system already provides sufficient food on a worldwide basis, but in doing so methodically undermines the capacity of agroecosystems to preserve biodiversity. However, the available evidence emphasizes the interdependence of biodiversity and agriculture, and the important role each plays in the maintenance of the other. Thus, our review supports the claim that the solutions to the problems of widespread food insecurity and biodiversity loss need not be mutually exclusive, and that it may be possible to address both using appropriate alternative agricultural practices. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Pollinators and Pollination Management through Indigenous Knowledge Based Adaptation in Indian Trans-Himalayan Region: Climate Change Perspective,"Indian Trans-Himalaya is a high-altitude, dry region with a rocky mountainous landscape with valleys. The local people are traditional agro-pastoralist and nomadic, semi-nomadic. Livestock grazing, agriculture and orchard farming have an important ecological history. These land use practices, impacted the ecological system in many forms. Due to changes in habitat, ecosystem structure, and biogeochemical cycles, negative impacts have weakened ecosystem services. The biggest challenges include industrialization, urbanization, climate change, livestock grazing, illegal hunting and trade in endangered species, and increased unsustainable methods of agriculture. Human needs for ecosystem services are many and will increase in the future. Unfortunately, global ecosystem services are at risk. Pollination service is an important tangible service with directly affecting the food production and security, as well as indirect consequences on other ecosystem services such as cultural and aesthetic. Therefore, the conservation of pollinators and pollination services in in mountainous region is very important. Taking into account the roles of traditional knowledge and socio-ecological memory in conservation, this study aimed to identify and document the adaptation strategies for the conservation of insect pollinators. This includes increasing community participation on different aspects of conservation and help communities to adapt to climate change while understanding the best management practices, their beliefs, and traditional knowledge linked with biodiversity conservation. Capacities building of local communities, youth, school children, and baseline agencies have been achieved through workshops, conservation awareness programs, and a participatory rural appraisal approach. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) exercise has been conducted with the community. The exercise developed linkages between the community and conservation of natural resources. Publications and knowledge products like brochures and pamphlets on the conservation of insect pollinators have been prepared and distributed. The citizen science approach and capacity buildings were used to enhance the awareness of insect pollinators and their conservation. Hands-on training were organized for youths to impart a basic knowledge of insect pollinators. Increased practice of monocultures and unsuitable use of insecticides were observed. Capacity-building programs were organized for baseline agencies (frontline staff of the Forest Department/village youths/local communities). Best practices for efficient management and conservation of insect pollinators based on traditional knowledge have been recorded and documented. The study revealed that the incorporation of indigenous knowledge of communities living in the region could be used to establish and ensure the role of local communities in decision-making processes, as well as their active participation in biodiversity conservation. © The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Nexus between financial development, energy consumption, income level, and ecological footprint in CEE countries: do human capital and biocapacity matter?","In recent decades, climate change and environmental pollution have been at the center of global environmental debates. Nowadays, researchers have turned their attention to the linkage between real output and environmental quality and test the environmental Kuznets curve. Majority of the studies focus on a single pollutant aspect and measure the deterioration of the environment through carbon emission (CO2) only. In contrary, the current study uses a comprehensive proxy, ecological footprint, to measure the environmental quality of the sixteen Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs). The aim of this paper is to discover the impact of financial development, economic growth, and energy consumption (renewable and non-renewable) on the environment. In addition, for the first time, the current study includes biocapacity and human capital in the growth–energy–environment nexus in the case of CEECs. In doing so, we used annual data of sixteen CEE countries in perspective of the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative and cover the period of 1991–2014. For reliable findings, this study focuses on second-generation econometric approaches to check stationarity, cross-sectional dependency, and co-integration among the model parameters. The long-run estimations of the “Dynamic Seemingly Unrelated-co-integration Regression” (DSUR) signify that the effect of economic growth on ecological footprint is not stable and validate N-shaped relationship for cubic functional form between per capita income and ecological footprint (environmental quality). Empirical evidence divulges that financial development and energy use significantly contribute to environmental degradation while renewable energy improves environmental quality by declining ecological footprint significantly. Moreover, the significant effects of biocapacity and human capital are positive and negative on the ecological footprint, respectively. In robustness check through the “Feasible Generalized Least Square” (FGLS) and “Generalized Method of Moment” (GMM) models, we found consistent result. Lastly, the “Dumitrescu-Hurlin (D-H) Panel Causality Test” demonstrates that two-way causal relationship exists between EF and GDP, EF and FD, EF and EU, EF and BC, and EF and HC, while one-way causality is running from RE to EF. This study puts the present scenario of CEE economies in front of the policymakers and suggests that they should consider the vital role of renewable energy and human capital to get sustainability. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
"Payments for Watershed Ecosystem Services in the Eyes of the Public, China","Recent decades have witnessed an increased development of schemes for payment for watershed ecosystem services (PWES). However, the public is usually excluded from PWES systems. Reliable and empirical research on PWES from the public perspective is scarce. Aiming to understand public perceptions, attitudes, participation, and responses to PWES, this paper investigated local residents living in the Yongding River watershed area through a face-to-face questionnaire survey. The results showed that the public had limited knowledge of PWES. The public was keen to be involved in PWES decision-making, but the current level of public participation was very low. Regarding willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA), nearly 55% of the respondents supported paying the upstream residents for protecting the environment if they were beneficiaries in the downstream areas, while 85% of the respondents agreed to accept compensation if they were contributors to environmental improvement in the upstream areas. Although some of the respondents’ daily lives were affected by the watershed environment, they were reluctant to pay, reflecting a sign of “free-riding”. The regression analysis showed that public concerns, values, knowledge of PWES and the watershed environment, and demographic factors determined the WTP and WTA. The results of the contingent valuation method and opportunity costs method showed that the annual payment for headwater conservation areas (Huailai and Yanqing) ranged from CNY 245 to 718 million (USD 36 to 106 million). This study contributes to our limited knowledge and understanding of public sentiment and makes recommendations for improving public receptivity to PWES. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Occupational Health and Safety in China: A Systematic Analysis of Research Trends and Future Perspectives,"The frequent occurrence of various occupational accidents has resulted in significant casualties and occupational disease issues, which hinder economic and social development seriously. The promotion and enhancement of occupational health and safety (OHS) require greater efforts to be made to achieve sustainable economic development, particularly in developing countries. With remarkable progress and achievements that have been made in terms of OHS in China, a systematic and thorough review is needed to gain insight into the development process, current status, and research trends regarding OHS in China. Additionally, pathways for future work need to be discussed to boost the OHS development in China in the new era. Therefore, a systematic literature review is performed in this study to investigate the development of OHS in China with the help of a bibliometric analysis. Firstly, a total of 5675 publications related to OHS in China between 1979 and 2022 were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) and the Chinese Science Citation Database (CSCD) before being refined manually. Then, the temporal distribution and journal sources of the collected publications were analyzed before the collaboration networks of the “productive institutions” and “productive authors” were discussed. Furthermore, the key research topics (e.g., disease prevention, psychological safety, occupational exposure) and dominant research methods (e.g., epidemiological methods, risk modeling) associated with OHS during different periods were identified and discussed based on the keywords and bibliographic analysis. Finally, the current needs and promising pathways for future work were discussed. It is suggested that the prevention and control of conventional and new occupational diseases, the protection of workers’ occupational health rights and interests, the development and implementation of advanced technologies for OHS, and the development of more sophisticated and efficient health and safety risk assessment models may be focused on to accelerate the development of OHS in China. This study systematically reviews the development processes, current status, and future prospects regarding OHS in China. The results of this study provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners who are involved in the Chinese OHS development, and the promising pathways for future works are suggested to boost the OHS development in China. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

The findings indicate the main sustainability problems of M+ include limited publicity, overpricing, lack of public cultural literacy, and limited coverage of social activities. Thus, the authors suggest strategies centered on building a multifunctional online community, including expanding online services for members, designing and selling electronic peripherals, developing online visual culture education programs, pushing events regularly, establishing a materials mall, inviting artists into the digital community, and designing a VR collection display. © 2023 by IGI Global.",Not About Sufficiency
Operations strategy for a construction supply chain: modular integrated construction and blockchain adoption,"Modular integrated construction (MiC) becomes a promising solution to improve production efficiency in the construction industry. However, the off-site production and on-site installation processes of MiC pose challenges to collaboration efficiency among the multiple stakeholders involved, including subcontractors, contractors, and consumers. These challenges stem from information dispersion, which impedes effective collaboration and communication. Such problems can be solved by introducing a blockchain-based cyber-physical service platform, which can facilitate information sharing and collaboration across the supply chain. In this paper, we study the impacts of MiC and blockchain technology on construction supply chains and reveal several important insights. First, we find that there exists a first-mover advantage in the traditional construction supply chain, where subcontractors engage in a sequential game, and the subcontractor who produces first obtains more profit than the counterparts. Moreover, the contractor's ability to increase profits by reducing the unit cost of construction time is limited, but it can improve the effectiveness of the time gap due to early delivery. Second, we show that MiC should not be introduced if it significantly reduces collaboration efficiency in the supply chain. Interestingly, increasing the unit cost of construction for subcontractors can actually result in greater profits for all members of the supply chain. Regarding adopting blockchain technology, our findings suggest that supply chain members generally hold similar attitudes. Specifically, when the value of blockchain in improving collaboration efficiency is below a certain threshold, its adoption may not be beneficial, despite its potential to enable rapid production and early delivery. © 2023 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Green Development in Saline–Alkali Lands: The Evolutionary Game Framework of Small Farmers, Family Farms, and Seed Industry Enterprises","Amid global climate change and population growth, the prevalence of saline–alkali lands significantly hampers sustainable agricultural development. This study employs theories of asymmetric information and bounded rationality to construct an evolutionary game model, analyzing the interactions among small farmers, family farms, and seed industry enterprises in the context of saline–alkali land management. It investigates the strategic choices and dynamics of these stakeholders under the influence of economic incentives and risk perceptions, with a focus on how government policies can foster green development. Utilizing Delay Differential Equations (DDEs) for simulations, this study highlights the risk of “market failure” without government intervention and underscores the need for government participation to stabilize and improve the efficiency of the green development process. The findings reveal that factors such as initial willingness to participate, the economic viability of salt-tolerant crops, seed pricing, research and development costs, and the design of incentive policies are crucial for sustainable land use. Accordingly, the paper proposes specific policy measures to enhance green development, including strengthening information dissemination and technical training, increasing the economic attractiveness of salt-tolerant crops, alleviating research and development pressures on seed companies, and optimizing economic incentives. This study provides a theoretical and policy framework for the sustainable management of saline–alkali lands, offering insights into the behavioral choices of agricultural stakeholders and supporting government strategies for agricultural and environmental protection. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF AGARWOOD RESEARCH AND THE IMPACT OF CITES LISTING,"Agarwood is a renowned fragrant non-timber wood product primarily originating from the Indo-Malesia region. It also plays a pivotal role in the global industry due to its economic and cultural significance. As a response to illegal harvesting and trade activities leading to declining populations, all agarwood-producing species have progressively been incorporated into CITES Appendix II. We conducted an in-depth investigation into the temporal dynamics of the scientific literature pertaining to agarwood in this study. The evolving trends in agarwood research and the influence of CITES listing on publication numbers were elucidated by utilizing a bibliometric approach. The quantity of research activity was leveraged as an indicator of the engagement of a country, and the status of agarwood research before and after the CITES listing was analyzed. A rigorous selection process yielded 704 articles from the Web of Science (WoS) core database and 1,054 articles from Scopus, using four specific keywords: ""agarwood,"" ""Aquilaria,"" ""Gyrinops,"" and ""gaharu,"" spanning the years 1995–2022. A notable upswing in the number of scientific publications following the implementation of the CITES listing was identified, while China has been the leading country in most publications and research work since 2009 and 2008 based on WoS and Scopus, respectively. The journal ""Molecules"" has received the most related articles over the years, and the most popular keyword used is ""agarwood."" China is also, so far, the country with the most related patents filed. The trending research topics based on the keywords from 2021 to 2022 would be studies related to pharmacological effects, understanding the mechanism of agarwood formation, exploring alternative agarwood-producing species from Gyrinops, and promoting sustainability in agarwood production. Furthermore, the discussion also covered potential research initiatives that could address the existing knowledge gaps in agarwood research up to the present moment. © 2024, Pakistan Agricultural Scientists Forum.

A path towards China's energy justice: Is government intervention absolutely necessary?,"With the accelerated pace of the global energy transition, energy justice has become a focus of international attention. However, the greatest challenge to achieving energy justice may be the absence of comprehension of energy governance in other countries. To address this gap in the literature, this paper initially uses the improved entropy method to measure and analyze the level of energy justice in 30 provinces in China from 2004 to 2017. Then, using panel OLS, the mediating effect model, and the Spatial Durbin Model, the paper examines the impact and mechanism of government intervention on energy justice in China. The findings indicate that: (1) Government intervention has a significant positive impact on energy justice. The result remains robust following the application of IV-2SLS, System GMM, and placebo tests to address endogeneity. (2) The mechanism analysis indicates that the government can indirectly promote energy justice by adjusting credit allocation. (3) Due to the inter-provincial competition effect, demonstration effect, and the externalities of energy itself, the increase in the degree of local government intervention will have a positive impact on energy justice in spatially adjacent regions. (4) Heterogeneity analysis shows that the impact of government intervention on energy justice is more pronounced in northern regions due to differences in resource endowments and economic structures; the contribution of government intervention to energy justice is mainly reflected in improving energy accessibility. Finally, the article suggests that the government should create a comprehensive energy governance system, focus on credit allocation, and establish a regional coordination mechanism for energy governance to promote the ultimate realization of energy justice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
What evidence exists on the links between natural climate solutions and climate change mitigation outcomes in subtropical and tropical terrestrial regions? A systematic map protocol,"Background: Natural climate solutions (NCS)—actions to conserve, restore, and modify natural and modified ecosystems to increase carbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—are increasingly regarded as important pathways for climate change mitigation, while contributing to our global conservation efforts, overall planetary resilience, and sustainable development goals. Recently, projections posit that terrestrial-based NCS can potentially capture or avoid the emission of at least 11 Gt (gigatons) of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, or roughly encompassing one third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris Climate Agreement goals by 2030. NCS interventions also purport to provide co-benefits such as improved productivity and livelihoods from sustainable natural resource management, protection of locally and culturally important natural areas, and downstream climate adaptation benefits. Attention on implementing NCS to address climate change across global and national agendas has grown—however, clear understanding of which types of NCS interventions have undergone substantial study versus those that require additional evidence is still lacking. This study aims to conduct a systematic map to collate and describe the current state, distribution, and methods used for evidence on the links between NCS interventions and climate change mitigation outcomes within tropical and sub-tropical terrestrial ecosystems. Results of this study can be used to inform program and policy design and highlight critical knowledge gaps where future evaluation, research, and syntheses are needed. Methods: To develop this systematic map, we will search two bibliographic databases (including 11 indices) and 67 organization websites, backward citation chase from 39 existing evidence syntheses, and solicit information from key informants. All searches will be conducted in English and encompass subtropical and tropical terrestrial ecosystems (forests, grasslands, mangroves, agricultural areas). Search results will be screened at title and abstract, and full text levels, recording both the number of excluded articles and reasons for exclusion. Key meta-data from included articles will be coded and reported in a narrative review that will summarize trends in the evidence base, assess gaps in knowledge, and provide insights for policy, practice, and research. The data from this systematic map will be made open access. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Metagenomics reveals structural and functional gut mycobiota dysbiosis in Tibetan subjects with coronary heart disease,"Gut mycobiota play indispensable roles in human health. However, little is known about the alterations to gut mycobiota and their correlations with coronary heart disease (CHD) in Tibetan subjects. We conducted a study based on shotgun metagenomic sequencing of DNA extracted from faecal samples to analyse the taxonomic composition and functional annotation of the gut mycobiota of 14 CHD patients, 13 patients with non-stenosis coronary heart disease (NCHD), and 18 healthy controls (HT). The TMAO, creatinine, and TG levels of the CHD group were significantly higher than HT. The alpha-diversity indices, including Richness, Shannon, Simpson, and beta diversity were significantly different between CHD and HT. The relative abundances of Anaeromyces robustus, Aspergillus taichungensis, Glomus cerebriforme, Monosporascus ibericus, and Ophiocordyceps sinensis significantly differed among the three groups. There were significant positive correlations between lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and several metabolic pathways, including thermogenesis, Alzheimer's disease, oxidative phosphorylation, Parkinson's disease, and cardiac muscle contraction. A redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that LPS and body mass index (BMI) were strongly positively associated with CHD. The foregoing results demonstrated that gut mycobiota dysbiosis is an important mechanism in the development of CHD in Tibetan subjects. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
The intimacy of human-nature interactions on islands,"Islands provide a place to conceptualise human-nature interactions in socio-ecological systems and to explore how such phenomena occur within decisive boundaries. Isolation, vulnerability to disruption, and constraints on the availability of natural resources add urgency to island sustainability questions with limited solution sets. This chapter presents findings that contribute to the larger issues of resiliency and vulnerability on islands. Cross-cutting reflections are offered based on studies conducted over the last 10 years at the Yale Center for Industrial Ecology of four diverse islands: Singapore, a highly developed island city-state; Puerto Rico, an island rich with nature and industry; O’ahu, a high density, tourism-dependent island, home to Honolulu, Hawai’i; and Hawai’i Island, also known as “The Big Island”, with a larger land area and a lower population density than O’ahu. Over the course of the twentieth century, each of these islands became heavily dependent on imports such as water, food, or fuel to sustain basic human needs and modern economic functions. Within the last decade, each has consciously sought to restructure its socio-ecological configurations by using more locally available resources in one or more of its metabolic linkages. This pattern has the potential to reconnect island economies with their natural systems while simultaneously enhancing relationships and increasing resilience. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.",Not About Sufficiency

"PERSISTENCE IN ERROR: Science, Society, and the U.S. Museum in an Age of Urgency","Museums have been shaping the public discourse on science for centuries. They serve as a bridge between science and society - a way for citizens to connect with, engage, increasingly understand, and even contribute to scientific advances. Examples of this relationship include the presentation and promotion of Darwin’s theory of evolution by means of natural selection, as well as the growth of science centers during the mid-20th century as a reaction to Cold War anxiety and fear. Today’s most pressing scientific issue is the current climate crisis, fueled by humanity’s extraordinary input of carbon dioxide into Earth’s atmosphere. Though the science of global warming is long-established, with even popular publications presenting the issue more than 70 years ago, museums of science and natural history have been slow to react. While minimal progress has been made, proposed here is an urgent call for these institutions to not only authoritatively present the science behind global warming but also serve as a catalyst for what to do with that science. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Laura Schiavo; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency

Use of phytoproductivity data in the choice of native plant species to restore a degraded coal mining site amended with a stabilized industrial organic sludge,"Coal mining-related activities result in a degraded landscape and sites associated with large amounts of dumped waste material. The arid soil resulting from acid mine drainage affects terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and thus, site remediation programs must be implemented to mitigate this sequential deleterious processes. A low-cost alternative material to counterbalance the affected physico-chemical-microbiological aspects of the degraded soil is the amendment with low contaminated and stabilized industrial organic sludge. The content of nutrients P and N, together with stabilized organic matter, makes this material an excellent fertilizer and soil conditioner, fostering biota colonization and succession in the degraded site. However, choice of native plant species to restore a degraded site must be guided by some minimal criteria, such as plant survival/adaptation and plant biomass productivity. Thus, in this 3-month study under environmental conditions, phytoproductivity tests with five native plant species (Surinam cherry Eugenia uniflora L., C. myrianthum–Citharexylum myrianthum, Inga–Inga spp., Brazilian peppertree Schinus terebinthifolius, and Sour cherry Prunus cerasus) were performed to assess these criteria, and additional biochemical parameters were measured in plant tissues (i.e., protein content and peroxidase activity) exposed to different soil/sludge mixture proportions. The results show that three native plants were more adequate to restore vegetation on degraded sites: Surinam cherry, C. myrianthum, and Brazilian peppertree. Thus, this study demonstrates that phytoproductivity tests associated with biochemical endpoint measurements can help in the choice of native plant species, as well as aiding in the choice of the most appropriate soil/stabilized sludge proportion in order to optimize biomass production. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Not About Sufficiency
Breaking Down Silos in Sustainable Forest Management and Fostering Interagency Collaboration through the “Adopt a Forest” Initiative in Kenya,"Forests are vital for sustainable development and provide ecosystem services. The “Adopt a forest” initiative is proposed to tackle deforestation and forest management challenges. This study sought to analyze the implementation of forest adoption in Kenya, seeking to improve understanding and promote it as a solution for sustainable forest management by enhancing interagency collaboration. The study assessed the effects of the adopt-a-forest initiative from 2019 to 2021, focusing on its role in promoting interagency collaboration and its socio-economic and environmental benefits in Kenya. A case study research design and literature review using document-content analysis were used to evaluate secondary data obtained from online sources of government bodies, NGOs, and private sector organizations involved in forest restoration across counties. Case results from Kenya demonstrate that forest adoption encourages interagency collaboration, with 49 agencies collectively adopting 18,386 hectares of public forests and nurturing 742,235 tree seedlings. The initiative has mobilized Kshs. 36,862,788 for restoration. However, uneven collaboration distribution raises concerns about exacerbating regional development disparities and negative equity outcomes. The study enhances understanding of the adopt-a-forest initiative’s impact on interagency collaboration for forest restoration. It identifies socio-economic and environmental benefits, challenges of uneven distribution, informing policy enhancements and advocating for ongoing monitoring. The study’s findings impact forest management policies globally. The adopt-a-forest initiative promotes collaboration and resource mobilization for restoration, addressing deforestation and enhancing ecosystem services. Addressing collaboration disparities is crucial for equitable development, requiring ongoing policy monitoring and refinement. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
The Role of Philosophers in Climate Change,"Some conceptions of the role of philosophers in climate change focus mainly on theoretical progress in philosophy, or on philosophers as individual citizens. Against these views, I defend a skill view: philosophers should use our characteristic skills as philosophers to combat climate change by integrating it into our teaching, research, service, and community engagement. A focus on theoretical progress, citizenship, expertise, virtue, ability, social role, or power, rather than on skill, can allow for some of these contributions. But the skill view, I argue, uniquely captures the breadth of philosophers' role in climate change; promises to make us more effective in practice; and offers a compelling way to overcome our own lingering climate denial by integrating climate change into all aspects of philosophical activity.

Analysis of landscape performance assessment by key stakeholders in a transfrontier conservation area,"Stakeholder engagement has become an important aspect of sustainable natural resources management. This study analysed a landscape performance assessment by local and ‘external’ stakeholders in a transfrontier conservation area in Southern Africa. The landscape was divided into three agro-ecological zones and focus group discussions were facilitated for stakeholders to evaluate the landscape based on four ecoagriculture dimensions (production, conservation, livelihoods and institutions). The conservation dimension showed the best performance and the overall score for the landscape was 2.97, implying a fairly good performance. Perceptions and ratings did not significantly differ by age, gender or stakeholder groups. We conclude that despite their low levels of formal education and training, communal farmers can assess the performance of local landscapes in a consistent way. This study provides information about the degree to which the landscape under focus conformed to the main ecoagriculture goals and can guide development planning and extension service provision. © 2017 Landscape Research Group Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Austerity Measures and the Resilience of Zimbabwe's Healthcare System: Challenges and Solutions,"Austerity measures have become a contentious topic, shaping the landscape of health care systems around the world. As governments grapple with economic challenges, the impact of austerity on health care has emerged as a critical concern. This study focuses on the consequences of austerity actions adopted by the Zimbabwean government under the Transitional Stabilization Program (TSP) from August 2018 to December 2025. This research examines the impact of austerity measures on Zimbabwe's health care sector, exploring its connections with health infrastructure and resources, accessibility and affordability of health care, health funding, health care inequalities, and the health care workforce. Using a quantitative approach and data from 970 participants, including the general populace, health care providers, and government officials, significant positive correlations between austerity measures and these health care variables were identified. The findings indicated a noteworthy positive correlation between the independent variable “austerity measures” and five dependent variables: health care accessibility and affordability, health care inequalities, infrastructure and resources, health care funding, and health care workforce. The t-statistics values exceeded the threshold of 1.96, with values of 5.085, 3.120, 6.459, 8.517, and 3.830, respectively. These findings highlight the importance of considering the effects of austerity on health care access, health funding, health care inequalities, health workforce, health infrastructure and resources development. Policymakers should prioritize equitable resource allocation and targeted investments to strengthen the resilience of the health care system during economic challenges. Understanding these associations is crucial for evidence-based policy decisions and fostering a more equitable and resilient health care system in Zimbabwe. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

Role and Potential of Copper Nanocomposites for Use in Power and Electrical Systems: An Overview,"This paper focuses on the role and significance of material development for simultaneous enhancement of electrical properties, thermal properties, and mechanical properties as economies shift towards reduced carbon emission with increased importance and emphasis being given to a “greener environment”, thereby emphasizing upon electrification as a potentially viable source of “clean” energy. In this manuscript, an effort is made to elaborate upon recent developments in the domain of copper nanocarbon composite materials for comparison with commercially pure copper with the prime objective of meeting the emerging demands of electrical devices. Carbon nanotubes and graphene have been some of the most widely studied materials due to a healthy combination of attractive physical properties and mechanical properties. The addition of these carbon allotropes to a copper matrix is anticipated to significantly enhance the electrical properties, thermal properties, and mechanical properties of the resultant copper nanocomposite. Further, integration of the constituent phases present is a non-trivial task that often results in detrimental effects and observably lower levels of enhancement than expected. This paper discusses the various methods of synthesis of the high-performing copper nanocarbon composites compiled in the published literature and attempts to consolidate the key findings in accordance with the process-structure–property framework. This is essential so that they can better fulfil their role and potential as next-generation materials for selection and use in power and electrical systems. © 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",Not About Sufficiency

Data-driven photocatalytic degradation activity prediction with Gaussian process,"Photocatalysis has emerged as a powerful technology with beneficial impacts on the fields of science and engineering. To date, most photocatalysis research are experimentally-based that strongly rely on various experimental conditions. As the coronavirus pandemic hit the world in 2020, research and experiments were disrupted in various scientific disciplines. During these unprecedented times, machine learning plays a vital role in the continuity of photocatalysis research, notably for researchers under physical access restrictions. More specifically, machine learning is capable of predicting the photocatalytic efficiency and analysing the photocatalytic activity. In recent work, it was demonstrated that a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model succeeded in predicting the efficiency of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) photodegradation using titanium dioxide (TiO2) as a photocatalyst, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5%. In this work, we investigate the applicability of the Gaussian Process (GP) technique to predict the photodegradation efficiency of contaminants catalyzed by pure and doped-titanium dioxide (TiO2); and we compare their performance with the current state-of-the-art SVR. Within this context, we discuss the foundations of both the machine learning models, as well as demonstrate how photocatalysis researchers can apply them to solving relevant problems in the field of photocatalysis. © 2022 The Institution of Chemical Engineers",Not About Sufficiency

Socioeconomic factors affecting households' use of indigenous forest management practices in managing non-wood forest products: evidence from forest communities in Nigeria derived savannah,"Although indigenous forest management practices have been used effectively by local people in the management and conservation of forest resources, these practices are eroding, causing negative consequences on the welfare of the people and their forests. To stem the erosion of the indigenous practices and instead stimulate, preserve, or improve their use, this study determines the socioeconomic factors that drive the household's use of the practices in the management and conservation of plant species of non-wood forest products (NWFPs). The study was carried out in Nigeria derived savannah. Data was collected from 200 randomly selected households in 10 randomly selected forest communities. Multivariate probit model was used to estimate the socioeconomic factors that influence the simultaneous use of indigenous forest management practices by households. Given multiple use of the practices, the result shows that the indigenous forest management practices used by the households are selective weeding (82.98%), controlled harvesting (82.45%), enrichment planting (75.53%), fire breaks (76.06%) and indigenous protective mechanism (45.74%). The majority (71.28%) of the respondents said they managed bush mango (Irvingia gabonensis and wombulu) using the practices, while the lowest proportion (21.28%) managed bush buck (Gongronema latifolium). The result of the multivariate probit model shows that virtually all the indigenous forest management practices are positively and significantly associated and are thus, complements. However, local protective mechanisms and controlled harvesting, local protective mechanisms and selective weeding, and local protective mechanisms and enrichment planting are not significantly associated. Farming occupation significantly increases the likelihood of simultaneous use of controlled harvesting, enrichment planting, and fire breaks as indigenous forest management practices in the management and conservation of NWFP. On the other hand, age significantly reduces the likelihood of the use of controlled harvesting and selective weeding. The study recommends the provision of support for young people who are more likely to be involved in the indigenous forest management practices; support to farmers who simultaneously use the practices, for example, through the provision of credit facilities; and a proper definition of user rights in community forests. © 2020 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Liquefied Natural Gas: Redefining Nature, Restructuring Geopolitics, Returning to the Periphery?","The liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry began as a means of making use of natural gas resources in socially remote regions and of natural gas associated with oil production. Natural gas was transformed from a waste product into LNG that could be moved thousands of miles to market, redefining “waste” as a valuable raw material. As the newest large-scale LNG exporter, the United States entered the LNG industry based on another redefinition of nature: the extraction of natural gas previously economically and technologically inaccessible in shale formations. Hydraulic fracturing and new drilling technologies have created reserves of natural gas that are driving down prices with excess production and provoking a search for new markets via LNG exports. Liquefied natural gas is reshaping economies, communities, industries, and ecosystems in the United States and in other parts of the world. This article analyzes the role of the LNG industry with a particular focus on the economic and geopolitical consequences for the United States. The United States is returning to its historical role of energy exporter. Some view the return to this role as an economic and geopolitical boon that will enhance the U.S. economy and the nation’s global standing. A contrasting interpretation sees the United States sliding into the extractive periphery, serving the energy demands of a growing China, much like the United States once did for Europe and especially Great Britain.

Effectively planning for and conserving current urban green infrastructure will be essential to ensure resilience and maintenance of quality urban environments. Gardens represent major portions of urban green infrastructure. In this paper we review literature to determine the current status of garden ecosystem services under the main themes of provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services in sub-Saharan Africa and identify the current challenges in optimizing these ecosystem services. Studying gardens as social-ecological systems might be the key to promote and enhance their resilience capacity in a changing world, acknowledging the fact that gardens are communities of practice in which social learning may occur. Studies on health clinic gardens in the North-West Province of South Africa have indicated how some of the challenges in terms of optimizing garden ecosystem services can be addressed. Multiple stakeholders involved in the health clinic gardens contribute towards a co-production of knowledge that could lead to social learning on aspects such as cultivation of nutritious food. More detailed studies on health clinic gardens are however, necessary to be able to develop a community-based resource management framework that can be implemented in the North-West Province and potentially in other South African provinces and countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Periodic closures as adaptive coral reef management in the Indo-Pacific,"This study explores the social, economic, and ecological context within which communities in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia use adaptive coral reef management. We tested whether periodic closures had positive effects on reef resources, and found that both the biomass and the average size of fishes commonly caught in Indo-Pacific subsistence fisheries were greater inside areas subject to periodic closures compared to sites with year-round open access. Surprisingly, both long-lived and short-lived species benefited from periodic closures. Our study sites were remote communities that shared many socioeconomic characteristics; these may be crucial to the effectiveness of adaptive management of reef resources through periodic closures. Some of these factors include exclusive tenure over marine resources, a body of traditional ecological knowledge that allows for the rapid assessment of resource conditions, social customs that facilitate compliance with closures, relatively small human populations, negligible migration, and a relatively low dependence on fisheries. This dynamic adaptive management system, in which communities manage their resources among multiple social and ecological baselines, contrasts with western fisheries management practices, centered on maintaining exploited populations at stable levels in which net production is maximized.

"The unintended consequences of formal fisheries policies: Social disparities and resource overuse in a major fishing community in the Gulf of California, Mexico","This study investigates the local social and fisheries impact of formal fisheries policies in Bahía de Kino, one of the most important fishing villages in terms of extraction of benthic resources in the Northern Gulf of California, Mexico. The paper focuses on cross-scale institutional interactions, describing how existing formal policies are functioning on the ground, how these policies interact with local arrangements, and how this interaction may affect the incentives of different actors towards sustainable fisheries. Besides providing lessons on how the performance of a local fishery could be improved, this paper addresses the question of whether the formal institutional structure of Mexican fishing regulations is effective in promoting responsible behavior by small-scale fishery stakeholders. It is argued that the design of the most widely used management tool to regulate access to marine resources throughout Mexico -the permit (licensing) system- provides the wrong incentives for sustainable-use. Granting secure rights to resources to those actively involved in the fishery is a necessary step for promoting sustainable fishing practices. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Peer navigation for smoking cessation in smokers with HIV: Protocol for a randomized clinical trial,"Background: Smoking prevalence in persons with HIV (PWH) is high (40%) and cessation rates remain low. Lack of social support and poor adherence to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are related to poor cessation outcomes; thus, both factors represent possible targets for smoking cessation interventions. Peer navigators (PNs) have been integrated into HIV care with great success to improve engagement and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. However, no clinical trial has evaluated the potential for PNs to provide social support and improve NRT adherence for smoking cessation. We developed a treatment protocol that targets social support, adherence, and self-efficacy for quitting by incorporating PNs into a smoking cessation program. This randomized trial will test whether this approach results in higher rates of 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 12- and 24-weeks, compared to standard treatment. Methods: Seventy-two smokers with HIV will be randomized to either Peer Navigation Social Support for smoking cessation (PNSS-S) or standard cessation counseling. All participants will meet with a nurse for a smoking cessation counseling session, which will include discussion of FDA-approved cessation pharmacotherapy. Participants assigned to PNSS-S will receive weekly phone calls from the PN for 12 weeks. The PN will address readiness to quit, using medication to quit, common barriers to cessation, high risk situations, slip management, and maintaining abstinence. Smoking cessation outcomes will be measured at 4, 12, and 24 weeks following the baseline appointment. Conclusion: Results from this study will provide preliminary evidence of whether incorporating a peer navigator-based intervention into smoking cessation treatment can improve smoking cessation outcomes in PWH. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency

Agricultural intensification alters bat assemblage composition and abundance in a dynamic Neotropical landscape,"The recent trend of agricultural intensification in tropical landscapes poses a new threat to biodiversity conservation. Conversion of previously heterogeneous agricultural landscapes to intensive plantation agriculture simplifies and homogenizes the landscape, reducing availability, and connectivity of natural habitat for native species. To assess the impact of agricultural intensification on bats, we characterized the bat assemblage in the Sarapiquí region of Costa Rica, where heterogeneous land uses are being converted to intensive, large-scale pineapple plantations. In 2012 and 2013, we sampled bats in 20 remnant forest patches surrounded by varying proportions of pasture, mature forest, and pineapple and captured 1821 individual bats representing 39 species. We used ordination analyses to evaluate changes in species composition, where pineapple is the main component of the agricultural matrix. We identified landscape metrics specifically correlated with pineapple and used multiple linear regression to test their effects on bat species richness, diversity, and guild-specific relative abundance. Results suggest pineapple expansion is driving changes in assemblage composition in remnant forest patches, resulting in new assemblages with higher proportions of frugivorous bats and lower proportions of insectivorous bats than in continuous mature forests. In addition, while pineapple does not diminish total bat species richness and diversity, the reduced forest cover and increased distance between forest patches in pineapple plantations has a significant negative impact on the relative abundance of insectivores. We also identify a potential threshold effect whereby patches surrounded by more than 50 percent forest can retain assemblage composition similar to that found in continuous mature forest. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation",Not About Sufficiency
Mitochondrial iron chelation ameliorates cigarette smoke-induced bronchitis and emphysema in mice,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is linked to both cigarette smoking and genetic determinants. We have previously identified iron-responsive element-binding protein 2 (IRP2) as an important COPD susceptibility gene and have shown that IRP2 protein is increased in the lungs of individuals with COPD. Here we demonstrate that mice deficient in Irp2 were protected from cigarette smoke (CS)-induced experimental COPD. By integrating RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (RIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and gene expression and functional enrichment clustering analysis, we identified Irp2 as a regulator of mitochondrial function in the lungs of mice. Irp2 increased mitochondrial iron loading and levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which led to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent experimental COPD. Frataxin-deficient mice, which had higher mitochondrial iron loading, showed impaired airway mucociliary clearance (MCC) and higher pulmonary inflammation at baseline, whereas mice deficient in the synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase, which have reduced COX, were protected from CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and impairment of MCC. Mice treated with a mitochondrial iron chelator or mice fed a low-iron diet were protected from CS-induced COPD. Mitochondrial iron chelation also alleviated CS-induced impairment of MCC, CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and CS-associated lung injury in mice with established COPD, suggesting a critical functional role and potential therapeutic intervention for the mitochondrial-iron axis in COPD. © 2016 Nature America, Inc.

Floral resources shape parasite and pathogen dynamics in bees facing urbanization,"Urbanization is associated with increases in impervious land cover, which alters the distribution of resources available to wildlife and concentrates activity in unbuilt spaces such as parks and gardens. How resource shifts alter the dynamics of parasite and pathogen transmission has not been addressed for many important species in urban systems. We focus on urban gardens, resource-rich “islands” within the urban matrix, to examine how the availability of floral resources at local and landscape scales influences the prevalence of six RNA viruses and three parasites in honey bees and bumble bees. Because parasites and pathogens are transmitted at flowers between visitors, we expected that floral abundance would concentrate bees within gardens, amplifying infection rates in pollinators, unless increases in floral resources would enhance bee diversity enough to dilute transmission. We found that garden size and flowering perennial plant abundance had a positive, direct effect on parasite and pathogen richness in bumble bees, suggesting that resource provisioning amplifies transmission. We also found that parasitism rates in honey bees were positively associated with parasites and pathogens in bumble bees, suggesting spillover between species. Encouragingly, we found evidence that management may mitigate parasitism through indirect effects: garden size had a positive impact on bee diversity, which in turn was negatively associated with parasite and pathogen richness in bumble bees. Unexpectedly, we observed that that parasite and pathogen richness in honey bees had no significant predictors, highlighting the complexity of comparing transmission dynamics between species. Although floral resources provide bees with food, we suggest more research on the tradeoffs between resource provisioning and disease transmission to implement conservation plantings in changing landscapes. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Limited effects of tree planting on forest canopy cover and rural livelihoods in Northern India,"Many countries have adopted large-scale tree planting programmes as a climate mitigation strategy and to support local livelihoods. We evaluate a series of large-scale tree planting programmes using data collected from historical Landsat imagery in the state of Himachal Pradesh in Northern India. Using this panel dataset, we use an event study design to estimate the socioeconomic and biophysical impacts over decades of these programmes. We find that tree plantings have not, on average, increased the proportion of forest canopy cover and have modestly shifted forest composition away from the broadleaf varieties valued by local people. Further cross-sectional analysis, from a household livelihood survey, shows that tree planting supports little direct use by local people. We conclude that decades of expensive tree planting programmes in this region have not proved effective. This result suggests that large-scale tree planting may sometimes fail to achieve its climate mitigation and livelihood goals. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Contrasts and conflicts in anthropology and archaeology: The evolutionary/interpretive dichotomy in human behavioural research,"Evolutionary theory continues to transform how we understand ourselves and our place in the world, providing a powerful, general framework within which to understand the evolution of human behavioural diversity. Within and beyond biology, appreciation of evolution as a guiding principle has allowed previously disparate disciplines to communicate and integrate (Dunbar and Barrett 2007). Evolutionists have called for the social sciences to become more Darwinian (e.g., Boyd and Richerson 1985, 2005; Cartmill 1994; Gintis 2004; Henrich et al. 2008; Lieberson and Lynn 2003; Mesoudi 2007; Mesoudi et al. 2006; Sear et al 2007; Shennan 2002), yet a profound mistrust of the evolutionary approach to human behaviour is still pervasive in many social science disciplines (Blute 1997; Boone and Smith 1998; Bryant 2004; Hodgson 2002; Ingold 2000; Marks 1995, 2004; Rose 1999; Steel 2004). A sometimes bitter divide has emerged between those who consider themselves on one or the other side of an intellectual boundary that supposedly separates ‘interpretive’ and evolutionary approaches to behaviour. Disagreements abound over the usefulness and validity of scientifi c approaches in anthropology and archaeology, over the methods that may be justifi ably used to examine human behaviour, and over the use and understanding of evolutionary theory and terminology (Aberle 1987; Carrithers et al. 1990; Dunnell 1982; Trigger 1998). Unhelpful caricatures of the work of each ‘side’ contribute to a general feeling that the differences are irreconcilable (see Fearn 2008 for recent mudslinging in anthropology; Kristiansen 2004 for discussion in archaeology). Many evolutionists are enthusiastic about subdisciplinary communication in the behavioural sciences (we include ourselves), but reconciliation under Darwinian theory may not be realistic, since there are many in the social sciences who do not wish to study evolutionary approaches to human behaviour. Moreover, disagreements over the validity of disparate research areas will not be resolved through enforcing a shared theory. However, integration may be possible through shared commitments to basic ‘scientific’ methodological approaches that enable communication and critical evaluation. This will in turn depend on a commitment to evidence-based research. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
An Integrated and Multi-Stakeholder Approach for Sustainable Phosphorus Management in Agriculture,"Conventional agriculture relies on non-renewable rock phosphate as a source of phosphorus. The demand for food has led to increased phosphorus inputs, with a negative impact on freshwater biodiversity and food security. The importation of phosphorus fertilizers makes most food systems vulnerable to phosphorus supply risks. The geopolitical instability generated by the pandemic and the current Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has led to a 400% increase in phosphorus commodity prices, offers the international community and institutions an opportunity to embrace the global phosphorus challenge and move towards a more circular system. Here, we discuss an integrated and multi-stakeholder approach to improve phosphorus management in agriculture and increase the efficiency of the whole chain, highlighting the contribution of conventional breeding and genetic engineering, with a particular focus on low-phytic-acid (lpa) crops, whose grains may help in reducing phosphorus-management-related problems. In recent decades, the choice of short-term strategies-such as the use of phytase as a feed additive-rather than lpa mutants, has been carried out without considering the long-term money saving to be derived from lpa crops. Overall, lpa crops have the potential to increase the nutritional quality of foods and feeds, but more research is needed to optimize their performance.",Not About Sufficiency

Towards vibrant fish populations and sustainable fisheries that benefit all: learning from the last 30 years to inform the next 30 years,"A common goal among fisheries science professionals, stakeholders, and rights holders is to ensure the persistence and resilience of vibrant fish populations and sustainable, equitable fisheries in diverse aquatic ecosystems, from small headwater streams to offshore pelagic waters. Achieving this goal requires a complex intersection of science and management, and a recognition of the interconnections among people, place, and fish that govern these tightly coupled socioecological and sociotechnical systems. The World Fisheries Congress (WFC) convenes every four years and provides a unique global forum to debate and discuss threats, issues, and opportunities facing fish populations and fisheries. The 2021 WFC meeting, hosted remotely in Adelaide, Australia, marked the 30th year since the first meeting was held in Athens, Greece, and provided an opportunity to reflect on progress made in the past 30 years and provide guidance for the future. We assembled a diverse team of individuals involved with the Adelaide WFC and reflected on the major challenges that faced fish and fisheries over the past 30 years, discussed progress toward overcoming those challenges, and then used themes that emerged during the Congress to identify issues and opportunities to improve sustainability in the world's fisheries for the next 30 years. Key future needs and opportunities identified include: rethinking fisheries management systems and modelling approaches, modernizing and integrating assessment and information systems, being responsive and flexible in addressing persistent and emerging threats to fish and fisheries, mainstreaming the human dimension of fisheries, rethinking governance, policy and compliance, and achieving equity and inclusion in fisheries. We also identified a number of cross-cutting themes including better understanding the role of fish as nutrition in a hungry world, adapting to climate change, embracing transdisciplinarity, respecting Indigenous knowledge systems, thinking ahead with foresight science, and working together across scales. By reflecting on the past and thinking about the future, we aim to provide guidance for achieving our mutual goal of sustaining vibrant fish populations and sustainable fisheries that benefit all. We hope that this prospective thinking can serve as a guide to (i) assess progress towards achieving this lofty goal and (ii) refine our path with input from new and emerging voices and approaches in fisheries science, management, and stewardship. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of the health benefits to children of a transportation climate policy in New York City,"Background: Assessments of health and environmental effects of clean air and climate policies have revealed substantial health benefits due to reductions in air pollution, but have included few pediatric outcomes or assessed benefits at the neighborhood level. Objectives: We estimated benefits across a suite of child health outcomes in 42 New York City (NYC) neighborhoods under the proposed regional Transportation and Climate Initiative. We also estimated their distribution across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Methods: We estimated changes in ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations associated with on-road emissions under nine different predefined cap-and-invest scenarios. Health outcomes, including selected adverse birth, respiratory, and neurodevelopmental outcomes, were estimated using a program similar to the U.S. EPA BenMAP program. We stratified the associated monetized benefits across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Results: The benefits varied widely over the different cap-and-investment scenarios. For a 25% reduction in carbon emissions from 2022 to 2032 and a strategy prioritizing public transit investments, NYC would have an estimated 48 fewer medical visits for childhood asthma, 13,000 avoided asthma exacerbations not requiring medical visits, 640 fewer respiratory illnesses unrelated to asthma, and 9 avoided adverse birth outcomes (infant mortality, preterm birth, and term low birth weight) annually, starting in 2032. The total estimated annual avoided costs are $22 million. City-wide, Black and Hispanic children would experience 1.7 times the health benefits per capita than White and Non-Hispanic White children, respectively. Under the same scenario, neighborhoods experiencing the highest poverty rates in NYC would experience about 2.5 times the health benefits per capita than the lowest poverty neighborhoods. Conclusion: A cap-and-invest strategy to reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector could provide substantial health and monetized benefits to children in NYC through reductions in criteria pollutant concentrations, with greater benefits among Black and Hispanic children. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Geographic factors predict wild food and nonfood NTFP collection by households across four African countries,"Wild foods and other nonfood NTFPs are important for improving food security and supplementing incomes in rural peoples’ livelihoods. However, studies on the importance of NTFPs to rural communities are often limited to a few select sites and are conducted in areas that are already known to have high rates of NTFP use. To address this, we examined the role of geographic and household level variables in determining whether a household would report collecting wild foods and other nonfood NTFP across 25 agro-ecological landscapes in Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Ghana. The aim of this study was to contribute to the literature on NTFP collection in Africa and to better understand where people depend on these resources by drawing on a broad range of sites that were highly variable in geographic characteristics as well as rates of NTFP collection to provide a better understanding of the determinants of NTFP collection. We found that geographic factors, such as the presence of forests, non-forest natural areas like grasslands and shrublands, and lower population density significantly predict whether a household will report collecting NTFP, and that these factors have greater explanatory power than household characteristics © 2018 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Scientific production on urban pruning waste: a scientometric analysis,"Urban afforestation provides several ecosystem services to humans, such as improved air quality and thermal comfort. However, when it comes to tree residues from pruning, complex activities are necessary, especially when it comes to the correct destination and/or reuse of such residues. Therefore, a scientometric analysis of studies on the reuse of pruning residues, published between 1991 and 2020, was performed. The analyzed studies were obtained through advanced searches in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. 607 studies were analyzed, the main authors, institutions and countries researching pruning residues were identified, the Bradford Law was applied to the visualization of the main journals. The keywords were also analyzed using a co-occurrence network and thematic mapping to visualize the main themes and research trends. It was observed that Spanish researchers and institutions were influential in the analyzed scientific field, which placed Spain in the first position in number of publications. 28 journals were considered core, or core for publications on pruning residues, publishing 1/3 of all studies.

"Exploring the trade-offs between carbon emissions, income inequality, and poverty: A theoretical and empirical framework","This study investigates the relationship between income inequality, poverty, and carbon emissions using a balanced panel dataset of 83 countries from 1990 to 2020. Employing panel quantile regression, which provides insights into distributional heterogeneity, the research analyzes both consumption-based and production-based CO2 emissions through the lens of classical economic theories, including Keynes' Absolute Income Hypothesis and Duesenberry's Relative Income Hypothesis. The findings challenge the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, as income increases consistently lead to higher emissions across all quantiles, regardless of income level. Notably, reducing income inequality in high-income countries lowers consumption-based emissions, though it may increase production-based emissions, highlighting the need for degrowth policies. In contrast, for lower- and upper-middle-income countries, reducing inequality tends to increase both consumption- and production-based emissions, illustrating the complex relationship between income levels and emissions. Poverty-related factors such as household consumption and animal protein intake positively affect emissions, while vegetable protein intake reduces them, aligning with the principles of Doughnut Economics and the circular economy. Renewable energy usage consistently reduces emissions across all income groups and quantiles, while daily caloric supply reduces emissions only in high-income countries but contributes to increased emissions in low, lower-middle, and upper-middle-income countries. Policymakers should prioritize reducing consumption-based emissions in high-income countries through income redistribution, while ensuring that poverty alleviation in lower-income nations is pursued sustainably to balance emissions and equity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Performance of crossbred steers post-weaned in an integrated crop-livestock system and finished in a feedlot,"The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of crossbred steers post-weaned in an integrated crop-livestock system (ICL) and finished in a feedlot, fed either a high-level concentrate diet or whole corn with no roughage. Weaned calves of two breed groups - 1/2 Angus × 1/2 Nellore, and 1/2 Charolais × 1/4 Angus × 1/4 Nellore - were allotted in a completely randomized experimental design (CRD). During the rainy season, the 1/2 Angus × 1/2 Nellore animals showed a higher performance than the 1/2 Charolais × 1/4 Angus × 1/4 Nellore ones, with 0.748 and 0.490 kg average daily gain, respectively. The productivity in the post-weaning period was 926 kg ha-1 body weight in a 11-month period, in the ICL system. Subsequently, the animals were confined and fed high-concentrate diet or whole corn with no roughage, in a CRD with a 2×2 factorial arrangement. In the feedlot, the 1/2 Charolais × 1/4 Angus × 1/4 Nellore animals showed lower values for carcass average daily gain, carcass yield, and slaughter weight than the 1/2 Angus × 1/2 Nellore animals. The high productivity in the ICL shows that this strategy, associated with the use of crossbreeding during the post-weaning and finishing stages, can be indicated for the new demand for a sustainable livestock activity.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental Justice as Scalar Parity: Lessons From Nuclear Waste Management,"The development of major infrastructure projects, such as power stations, waste facilities or transport networks, commonly raises concerns of how to ensure environmental justice within policy and planning. Environmental justice has been divergently theorised, though procedural/participative, distributive and recognition-related elements are commonly cited. With growing inter-disciplinarity between normative ethics and the geographic social sciences, there is a renewed interest in the scalar aspects of environmental justice (particularly in relation to infrastructure projects)—how the framing of environmental decisions at multiple and conflicting scales results in disparities between locally affected communities, and regional and national decision-making authorities. In analysing this problem, the paper has three principal aims. The first is to outline the problem of scalar environmental justice. The second is to explore a practical case of scalar environmental justice, by examining the decision-making processes surrounding radioactive waste management in the UK. The third is to outline a new concept of “scalar parity” derived from the radioactive waste policy process, whereby local communities and regional and national political stakeholders are charged with balancing their competing interests through the “fulcrum” of a partnership organisation, to fairly resolve environmental justice disputes. This scalar parity model is used as an exemplar of good practice in environmental justice resolution that could be applied to other major infrastructure projects. © 2018, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Factors influencing people's participation in the forest management program in Burkina Faso, West Africa","In attempts to foster sustainable forest management practices, participation of local communities has become widely recognized as a better alternative than the traditional protectionist approach. This paper analyzed factors influencing local people's participation in forest management program in Sissili and Ziro provinces, southern Burkina Faso based on data collected through a household survey of 165 members of forest management groups using factor analysis and multiple regression. Factor analysis resulted in a three-factor solution, which accounted for 64.82% of the total variance. Participation in decision-making, followed by participation in forest conservation and economic benefits were found to be the main factors influencing participation in the forest management program. Gender, household size, income source, land tenure status and technical assistance also appeared to influence members' participation in the program. The results indicate that participatory management program can be enhanced by changing the administrative structure of forest management groups in order to empower members in decision-making processes. In addition, increasing women's participation and more equitable benefit-sharing among user groups are essential in improving the success of the participatory forest management program. Thus, policies reforms to improve the structure of the forest management groups and to establish equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms are essential to improve the participation of local people in the forest management program and, hence, require immediate attention. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Made in Languaging; Ecolinguistic Expertise,"Made in languaging aims to help ecolinguists with recrafting ideation and human practices. Inspired by Alexander and Stibbe, I turn to how ecolinguistic expertise can favour life-sustaining relations. In approaching normative goals, I start with how knowledge is made, self-sustains and is disseminated. Ecolinguistic analysis of languages, discourse and narratives can thus be enriched by tracing how practices inform languaging. In turning to epistemic agency, I emphasise the following: (1) building corpora popularia, organised bodies, in order to enhance life-sustaining relations; (2) illuminating life from the inside; and (3) developing bioecological awareness. I contend that, while all living beings use coordinative activities to bring forth what appears to us, humans also use wording types and practices. As we use the already known, languaging enables subjecthood, a person’s little worlds, and a group’s common realities. Hence, what appears as (and to) experience is made in languaging. When linked to normative concerns, the resulting middle worlds also offer means of putting knowledge to work. As in social epistemology, one might regard ‘wealth and well-being’ as a marker of public good. Yet, critical work shows, appeal to these values is anthropomorphic. In order to encompass nonhumans and the biogenic, one can reject market orientatation by tracing languaging, and knowing, back to living. In showing benefits of so doing, I contrast two evolving wording types. The case of growthism, I suggest, attests to praxis and contrasts starkly with the ideational value of life-sustaining relations. Yet, in both cases, languaging meshes practices, happenings and the effects of action. The move shows how one can challenge the hypostatisation of ideology by pursuing how epistemic agency can contribute to the future of evolution. © 2024 by the author.",Not About Sufficiency
"Optimising hydropower development and ecosystem services in the Kafue River, Zambia","Fisheries are an important resource in Zambia, but are experiencing overexploitation and are under increasing pressure from external development activities that are compromising river ecosystem services and functioning. One such system is the Kafue Flats floodplain, which is under threat from hydropower development. This paper reviews the effect of potential hydropower development on the Kafue Flats floodplain and explores mechanisms to optimise the expansion of hydropower while maintaining the ecosystem functioning and services that the floodplain delivers. Since completion of the Kafue Gorge and Itezhi-tezhi dams, seasonal fluctuations in the height and extent of flooding have been suppressed. This situation is likely to get worse with the proposed incorporation of a hydropower scheme into Itezhi-tezhi dam, which will operate under a hydropeaking regime. This will have major ramifications for the fish communities and ecosystem functioning and is likely to result in the demise of the fishery, along with destruction of the wetlands and associated wildlife. To redress the problem, it is recommended that an environmental-flow study is conducted, as initiated by World Wildlife Fund, to protect provision of the existing ecosystem services and optimise hydropower development, thus ensuring sustainability of the aquatic resources of the Kafue Flats for future generations. © CSIRO 2018.",Not About Sufficiency
"Bioactive Compounds, Antioxidant, and Antimicrobial Activity of Seeds and Mucilage of Non-Traditional Cocoas","The biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest includes little-known cocoa species, which are essential resources for local communities. This study evaluated the bioactive compounds and antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of seeds and mucilage of four non-traditional cocoa species (Theobroma subincanum, T. speciosum, T. bicolor and Herrania nitida). Physico-chemical properties, minerals, vitamin C, organic acids, phenolics, and carotenoids were analysed by spectrophotometric and chromatographic techniques. The antioxidant activity was measured by ABTS and DPPH, along with the antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus mutans, as well as Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. T. subincanum seeds scored high in titratable acidity, magnesium, sodium, syringic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and quercetin. In contrast, the mucilage scored high in calcium, m-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, kaempferol, quercetin glycoside, and antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans. T. speciosum mucilage excelled in malic acid, tartaric acid, naringenin, and antioxidant capacity. T. bicolor seeds excelled in lutein and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, and mucilage in iron, potassium, vitamin C, citric acid, gallic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, zeaxanthin, β-carotene, and antioxidant capacity by ABTS. The mucilage of H. nitida has a high soluble solids content. These results highlight the potential of these species as sustainable sources of functional compounds and nutraceuticals. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Campgrounds and climate change: An extreme weather event study for nature-based entrepreneurship,"Entrepreneurship researchers have focused primarily on climate change mitigation. The physical effects of climate and weather on venture performance remain understudied. Accordingly, we introduce climatology to the entrepreneurship literature to quantitatively investigate the impacts of extreme weather events (i.e., tropical stormforced winds) on nature-based entrepreneurial performance. We operationalize our extreme weather event study at three coastal, entrepreneurial campgrounds that observed 12 tropical storm-forced events between 2007 and 2016. When controlling for institutional and other fixed effects, there were short-term but no long-term performance disruptions. Findings suggest adaptive and mitigative capacities are possible among nature-based entrepreneurial ventures experiencing extreme weather events. Thus, a key insight is the resilience of RV campgrounds to tropical-storm forced winds, the focal weather extreme. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency

Using a combination of interview, survey, and participant observation data, we find that government officials emphasize economic growth and many support shale development. While most government leaders claimed that there was not a major division in their communities about shale development, we found the public to be split, with a large countercoalition to shale development in existence. © Pacific Sociological Association. © The Author(s) 2015.",Not About Sufficiency
A social critique of corporate reporting: Semiotics and web-based integrated reporting,"In the critically acclaimed first edition of A Social Critique of Corporate Reporting, David Crowther examined the perceived dialectic around traditional and environmental reporting to show it to be a false dialectic. Corporate reporting continues to change rapidly to incorporate more detail and especially environmental and social information. At the same time the mechanism for reporting has changed and the internet now enables more information to be provided to an ever wider range of stakeholders and interest groups. The perceived conflict between financial performance representing the needs of investors and other dimensions of performance representing the needs of other stakeholders still however continues to exist. In this updated edition, this perceived conflict is re-examined along with the wider purposes of corporate reporting. These are examined in the context of web based reporting and a greater concern for all stakeholders. The conclusion is that, although recent developments have produced changes, the essential conflict is still professed to exist, but remains a largely imaginary one. The analysis in this book makes use of both statistics and semiotics and in so doing develops a semiology of corporate reporting that offers an alternative to other research that is largely based on econometrics. Researchers, higher level students and others with an interest in or responsibility for corporate reporting, corporate social responsibility, accounting research, or semiotics will find this book essential reading. © David Crowther 2012.",Not About Sufficiency

Indoor Environmental Quality Optimisation Model for Institutional Care Rooms of Elderly People,"It is known that the elderly usually spend the last years of their lives indoors, with little contact with others and the outside environment. Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) conditions related to lighting, air quality, thermal comfort, and acoustics directly affect their quality of life. In this study, the main focus is on the design of institutional care rooms for elderly people to create an indoor comfort. However, considering all four factors of IEQ in one model is a challenging task. A multi-objective problem is formulated based on a weighted sum of IEQ components in a parametric modelling environment using computational design methods. Several simulation tools are utilised, and a Self-Adaptive Ensemble Differential Evolution Algorithm is proposed to tackle this complex problem. The results show that optimal ranges for each IEQ component are achieved, with average values reaching 72% of the ideal benchmarks after the algorithm is converged. Results reveal strong correlations between IEQ components. This significant improvement in indoor environmental quality (IEQ) demonstrates the efficacy of the optimisation algorithm used. This study emphasises the flexibility and relevance of these findings for wider implementation in similar settings. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Policy incentives, barriers and recommendations for biogas production","Biogas is a mixture of predominantly carbon dioxide and methane that is formed from the anaerobic decomposition of organic materials. It is also a high-quality fuel that can be used in most natural gas applications such as home heating or electricity generation or scrubbed and sold into the gas grid. In the United States the production of biogas from animal manure alone represents an enormous potential energy resource, on the order of 0.9 quadrillion BTU (quad) annually, or nearly 1% of total US energy consumption. Biogas from the wastewater treatment sector in the US could provide another 1.5 billion kWh (or 5 trillion BTU). Despite the promise of this resource as a renewable, low-carbon source of energy, as of 2007 only 125 functioning biogas operations using manure exist in the US. These facilities produced 290 GWh (0.001 quad) of energy in 2007, which accounts for 0.001% of annual energy consumption in the United States and one thousandth of the nation's biogas potential. In addition, only 15% of the wastewater treatment flow in the US produces biogas that is used as a source of energy; the rest of the wastewater flows either do not produce biogas at all, or produce biogas that is wastefully flared instead of captured for heat or power. In contrast, Sweden currently produces 0.3% of their annual energy usage from biogas, primarily from the wastewater treatment sector. This report analyzes the policy incentives and barriers that exist for the production and utilization of biogas as well as the policy and institutional factors that have contributed to Sweden's relative biogas success. Based on this analysis, the authors make recommendations for policy measures that would increase biogas production in the United States. These recommendations include R&D to promote technological advancement with digesters, state and national environmental objectives, state and national renewable energy quotas, financial support for biogas operations, state biogas education and support programs, and infrastructure improvements that facilitate biogas use. Such policy incentives would promote both biogas production and use, and thereby help increase the market penetration of a domestically-produced, renewable, low-carbon fuel.

The effect of green finance and unemployment rate on carbon emissions in china,"China’s economy has developed rapidly since the reform and opening up, but under the long-term traditional extensive development model, energy consumption is excessive and carbon emissions rank first in the world. Therefore, how to reduce carbon emissions is a current hot issue in China. Although many scholars have found that green finance is the basic driving force to promote carbon emission reduction, its role path is diverse, and it still needs to be explored in width and depth. Especially in the green transformation stage of the economy, the potential unemployment risk is also a matter of concern. This study selects 30 provincial panel data from the Chinese mainland for the 2004–2019 years to investigate the impact of green finance on carbon emissions from the perspective of unemployment using ordinary least square (OLS), generalized method of moments (GMM), and mediating effect models. In addition, in order to avoid the bias of regression results caused by the cross-section dependence of the data, the feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) and the panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE) models are used for the robust test after correction. The findings show that 1) green finance has a significant inhibitory impact on carbon emissions; 2) green finance has significantly reduced the unemployment rate; 3) carbon emissions increase significantly with increasing the unemployment rate; and 4) there is regional heterogeneity in the effect of green finance on carbon emissions in eastern, central, and western China. Green finance in the eastern and central regions significantly inhibits carbon emissions, especially in the central region, while insignificantly in the western region. 5) According to the OLS and mediating effect regression results, economic growth and environmental regulation play a significant positive role in promoting carbon emissions. This study has theoretical reference significance for accelerating the realization of the dual carbon goal and alleviating phased unemployment.

The impact of decentralization of health services at the municipal level on health outcomes: evidence from China,"Objectives: Under the system of health decentralization, there are differences in the level of expenditure decentralization at different levels of government, and their impact on residents’ health may also be different. This paper is one of the first to evaluate the effect of decentralization of health services at the municipal level from a multi-dimensional health perspective. Data and methods: This paper uses the data of expenditure decentralization of health services at the municipal level to match the panel data from the China Household Panel Survey (CFPS) from 2010 to 2018, and uses the logit model, ordered logit model and two-way fixed effects model to empirically analyze the impact of health decentralization at the municipal level on health outcomes. Results: Based on the perspective of multi-dimensional health, from the three aspects of physical health, depression status and cognitive ability, the six sub-indicators of self-rated health, BMI standards, depression scores (summation method), depression scores (factor method), phrase test scores and mathematics test scores are discussed separately. The results show that the decentralization of health services at the municipal level has a significant promotion effect on the multi-dimensional health of residents. Conclusion: The decentralization of health services at the municipal level has important theoretical significance for promoting the reasonable division of medical and health powers and expenditure responsibilities between provincial and municipal governments, improving the efficiency of health expenditure funds, and establishing a fiscal system that matches financial resources.

"""Put on a jacket, you wuss"": Cultural identities, home heating, and air pollution in Christchurch, New Zealand","Central heating, insulation, and double glazing, such as you might find in many countries with colder climates in the northern hemisphere, are virtually lacking in Christchurch, in New Zealand's South Island. In this city, houses tend to be inadequately heated and rely primarily on a combination of open fires, log burners, and electrical heaters. This form of home heating, combined with local climatic and topographical factors, results in high levels of wintertime air pollution. While much research has been conducted into the air-pollution problem in Christchurch to date, this research has focused on physical contaminants and their effects on health, rather than on the ways in which air pollution is socially and culturally mediated and on the sense-making practices of those who create pollution and suffer its effects. Based on information drawn from focus groups, we argue that reluctance to change behaviour results partly from investments in particular cultural identities which are tied into hegemonic masculinities and understandings of national identity, such as the masculine pioneer heritage established during the colonial period. We also explore the spatial relationships that air pollution plays out within and on the 'body'and how it transcends and weakens the bounded body. We believe that analyses which draw on theories of hybridisation, embodiment, identity, and discourse, and which highlight the links between modes of behaviour, identity and sense of place, and the interactions between humans and nonhumans, are able to shed new light on our understandings of public perceptions and responses to air pollution in Christchurch. © 2007 a Pion publication printed in Great Britain.",Not About Sufficiency
Herpes zoster in older adults: Impact on carbon footprint in the United States,"We provide estimates for (I) annual herpes zoster (HZ) cases, (II) carbon costs related to healthcare utilization, and (III) annual carbon emissions due to HZ among ≥50 years of age (YOA) United States (US) population. We estimated the annual number of HZ cases in the US based on available incidence data and demographic data of individuals ≥50 YOA. Both the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) associated with HZ cases and the unit carbon dioxide equivalent (i.e. CO2e) costs associated with each type of HCRU in the US were estimated based on literature and studies available online. The carbon footprint associated with HZ annually among US adults ≥50 YOA was estimated by multiplying the unit carbon estimates by the HCRU. In the US population aged ≥50 YOA in 2020 (i.e. approximately 118 million), approximately 1.1 million cases of HZ occur annually assuming no vaccination. Based on 2 sources of HCRU the average kgCO2e per HZ patient ranged from 61.0 to 97.6 kgCO2e, with values by age group ranging from 40.9 kgCO2e in patients aged 50–59 to 195.9 kgCO2e in patients ≥80 YOA. The total annual HZ associated carbon ranged between 67,000 and 107,000 tons of CO2e in the US population aged ≥50 YOA. The impact of HZ on carbon footprint in the US results in considerable greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions. Assuming no vaccination, the burden of HZ is projected to rise over the coming years with the aging populations consequently worsening its impact on GHG emissions. (Figure 1). © 2024 GSK.

Measuring the intensity of conflicts in conservation,"Conflicts between the interests of biodiversity conservation and other human activities pose a major threat to natural ecosystems and human well-being, yet few methods exist to quantify their intensity and model their dynamics. We develop a categorization of conflict intensity based on the curve of conflict, a model originally used to track the escalation and deescalation of armed conflicts. Our categorization assigns six intensity levels reflecting the discourse and actions of stakeholders involved in a given conflict, from coexistence or collaboration to physical violence. Using a range of case studies, we demonstrate the value of our approach in quantifying conflict trends, estimating transition probabilities between conflict stages, and modeling conflict intensity as a function of relevant covariates. By taking an evidence-based approach to quantifying stakeholder behavior, the proposed framework allows for a better understanding of the drivers of conservation conflict development across a diverse range of socioecological scenarios. © 2020 The Authors.

ynamic time-domain and frequency-domain spillovers and portfolio strategies between climate change attention and energy-relevant markets,"We combine the Diebold and Yilmaz (DY) method, Baruník and Křehlík (BK) method and TVP-VAR model to explore the time-domain and frequency-domain spillover effects among climate change attention, oil, new energy, clean energy, solar energy, wind energy, technology, and finance. Empirical results demonstrate that the spillover effect of climate change attention and energy-relevant market is significant. At different time frequencies, risk transmission occurs more frequently in the short-term. On average, oil, solar energy, wind energy, and finance are net receivers. Finally, based on the DCC-GARCH t-copula model, we achieve optimal hedging ratios, optimal portfolio weights, and hedging effectiveness between climate change attention and energy-relevant markets. Empirical results suggest that investors incorporate climate change attention into their investment portfolios. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency

The Potential of Inedible Biodiesel as an Eco-Friendly and Sustainable Alternative Fuel for Marine Diesel Engines in India,"This article explores the possibilities of inedible biodiesel as a viable and environmentally friendly substitute fuel for marine diesel engines in India. This article encompasses on various crucial elements, including engine compatibility, biodiesel blends, fuel quality, emissions reduction, regulatory compliance, cost analysis, environmental advantages, and research and development. Implementing biodiesel in maritime operations within India presents favourable opportunities for mitigating carbon emissions, improving air quality, bolstering energy security, promoting sustainable agriculture, and harmonizing with international environmental objectives. Nevertheless, the effective incorporation of biodiesel necessitates a meticulous examination of multiple variables and an all-encompassing methodology that involves formulating policies, investment in infrastructure, research and development, and collaboration among relevant parties. Adopting biodiesel in India’s maritime sector offers a promising prospect for substantially contributing to sustainability and environmental stewardship. © 2023, Harbin Engineering University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying transmission dynamics of acute hepatitis C virus infections in a heterogeneous population using sequence data,"Opioid substitution and syringes exchange programs have drastically reduced hepatitis C virus (HCV) spread in France but HCV sexual transmission in men having sex with men (MSM) has recently arisen as a significant public health concern. The fact that the virus is transmitting in a heterogeneous population, with different transmission routes, makes prevalence and incidence rates poorly informative. However, additional insights can be gained by analyzing virus phylogenies inferred from dated genetic sequence data. By combining a phylodynamics approach based on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and an original transmission model, we estimate key epidemiological parameters of an ongoing HCV epidemic among MSMs in Lyon (France). We show that this new epidemic is largely independent of the previously observed non-MSM HCV epidemics and that its doubling time is ten times lower (0.44 years versus 4.37 years). These results have practical implications for HCV control and illustrate the additional information provided by virus genomics in public health. Copyright: © 2021 Danesh et al.

The Melting Snowball Effect: A Heuristic for Sustainable Arctic Governance Under Climate Change,"Climate change in the Arctic is occurring at a rapid rate. In Longyearbyen, Svalbard, the world’s northernmost city, deadly avalanches and permafrost thaw-induced architectural destruction has disrupted local governance norms and responsibilities. In the North Atlantic, the warming ocean temperatures have contributed to a rapid expansion of the mackerel stock which has spurred both geo-political tensions but also tensions at the science-policy interface of fish quota setting. These local climate-induced changes have created a domino-like chain reaction that intensifies through time as a warming Arctic penetrates deeper into responsibilities of governing institutions and science institutions. In face with the increasing uncertain futures of climate-induced changes, policy choices also increase revealing a type of “snowballing” of possible futures facing decision-makers. We introduce a portmanteau-inspired concept called “The Melting Snowball Effect” that encompasses the chain reaction (“domino effect”) that increases the number of plausible scenarios (“snowball effect”) with climate change (melting snow, ice and thawing permafrost). We demonstrate the use of “The Melting Snowball Effect” as a heuristic within a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) framework of anticipation, engagement and reflection. To do this, we developed plausible scenarios based on participatory stakeholder workshops and narratives from in-depth interviews for deliberative discussions among academics, citizens and policymakers, designed for informed decision-making in response to climate change complexities. We observe generational differences in discussing future climate scenarios, particularly that the mixed group where three generations were represented had the most diverse and thorough deliberations. © Copyright © 2020 Dankel, Tiller, Koelma, Lam and Liu.",Not About Sufficiency
Marine Heatwaves in the Mediterranean Sea: A Literature Review,"Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged periods of exceptionally warm temperatures in the ocean, which have forced profound transformations in marine biodiversity and socio-economic systems globally over the last decades.

This literature review brings together a comprehensive list of interdisciplinary research on MHW evolution in the Mediterranean basin, from the past to the future, covering the most common driving mechanisms of MHWs, known feedbacks and impacts on various marine organisms and local economies. Aiming to enhance our understanding of Mediterranean MHWs across various dimensions, we further discuss ongoing challenges in their detection and characterization, highlighting the need to improve monitoring systems and forecasting capabilities using novel approaches in the basin and beyond. © (2024), (Hellenic Centre for Marine Research).

Multi-objective optimization of a dual fuel CI engine powered with syngas and pilot diesel using TLBO algorithm: A metaheuristic approach,"The thermochemical conversion of biomass into producer gas presents an attractive alternative fuel option for compression ignition (CI) engines, making biomass gasification a critical driver for achieving sustainable development goals. Considering the application of producer gas (PG) in CI engine, the most potential gases include H2 and CO as main fuel compounds and it is crucial to comprehensively understand the impact of these two gas components on the engine behaviour. Nowadays, artificial intelligence-powered models are frequently applied for simulating engines that run on a single type of fuel. However, their usage is not as common when it comes to modeling dual-fuel CI engines run on synthetic producer gas or syngas. The present study explores the feasibility of optimizing operational parameters, such as engine load and syngas composition, in improving the efficiency and lowering the levels of pollutants emitted by a 3.5 kW CI engine operated under dual fuel (DF) mode using syngas as primary fuel and diesel as pilot fuel. The performance and emission characteristics of syngas (H2:CO) is examined by studying its behaviour in four different combinations. The compositions of syngas are prepared based on the volumetric percentage of the H2 and CO and is inducted into the combustion chamber using a novel venturi-type air-gas mixer. In the present study, an intelligent metaheuristics-based optimization algorithm i.e., Teaching-Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) is developed and introduced, to develop a predictive model within constrained range of engine operating conditions. Further, the algorithm is used to estimate multiple engine performance characteristics simultaneously viz., brake thermal efficiency (BTE), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO). The resultant findings identify the optimal engine load of 68.87% and the ideal syngas composition of 63.9% H2 and 49.5% CO as key parameters for maximizing engine efficiency while minimizing exhaust emission. At these optimized operating condition, 19.49% BTE is observed, while HC and CO emission was found to be 384.6 ppm and 445.33 ppm respectively. This shows the effective and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

The healthcare sustainable supply chain 4.0: The circular economy transition conceptual framework with the corporate social responsibility mirror,"Concern regarding the circular economy and Industry 4.0 is starting to increase in the emerging countries. This research study aims to analyze the healthcare sustainable supply chain 4.0 by proposing the circular economy transition conceptual framework with the corporate social responsibility mirror. The authors developed an observation guideline to collect empirical data from a private healthcare institution located in Rio de Janeiro, which has been promoting investment in new technologies within its operations. The research observation is between January and April 2017. The results show the glass structure can be a channel that provides the lightning resources, the solar energy with the photovoltaic panels, and the water management. The corporate social responsibility links the social role in healthcare institutions with sustainable practices and it improves smart technologies. The applicability of the internet of things and the internet of services adds value to sustainable practices. The circular economy transition conceptual framework integrates the result analyses.

"A Critical Review of Climate Change Impacts on Groundwater Resources: A Focus on the Current Status, Future Possibilities, and Role of Simulation Models","The Earth’s water resources, totalling 1.386 billion cubic kilometres, predominantly consist of saltwater in oceans. Groundwater plays a pivotal role, with 99% of usable freshwater supporting 1.5–3 billion people as a drinking water source and 60–70% for irrigation. Climate change, with temperature increases and altered precipitation patterns, directly impacts groundwater systems, affecting recharge, discharge, and temperature. Hydrological models are crucial for assessing climate change effects on groundwater, aiding in management decisions. Advanced hydrological models, incorporating data assimilation and improved process representation, contribute to understanding complex systems. Recent studies employ numerical models to assess climate change impacts on groundwater recharge that could help in the management of groundwater. Groundwater vulnerability assessments vary with the spatial and temporal considerations, as well as assumptions in modelling groundwater susceptibility. This review assesses the vulnerability of groundwater to climate change and stresses the importance of accurate assessments for sustainable water resource management. It highlights challenges in assumptions related to soil and aquifer properties, multiple stressors, adaptive capacity, topography and groundwater contamination processes, gradual sea level rise scenarios, and realistic representations of the region of study. With the advancements in hydrological modelling, including the integration of uncertainty quantification and remote sensing data, artificial intelligence could assist in the efforts to improve models for assessing the impacts of climate change on hydrological modelling. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
A cod Forsaken place? Fishing in an altered state in Newfoundland,"The collapse of cod stocks in the waters off Newfoundland in the early 1990s was widely understood as an ecological disaster and the death of a rural way of life that had endured for centuries. While many areas have remained closed to commercial cod fishing for two full decades, growing numbers of commercial fishers and some fisheries scientists now agree that stocks in several areas are finally showing signs of rebuilding. While the biological recovery of cod populations was once widely viewed as being essential to the future well-being of coastal communities, many commercial fishers now publicly express concerns about the possibility of this scenario actually coming to pass. This article explores the roots of these changing constructions of cod. I argue that making sense of the anxieties and uncertainties that presently surround the question of cod recovery requires paying close attention to the ways in which access to fishery resources has been transformed over time, as well as to the ways in which changing production chains for seafood products, shifting scientific paradigms and practices, and unexpected changes in the marine environment have converged in ways that are fundamentally challenging many previously held notions of the ecological good. © 2014 by the Institute for Ethnographic Research (IFER) a part of the George Washington University.

Two Decades of Advancements in Cold Supply Chain Logistics for Reducing Food Waste: A Review with Focus on the Meat Industry,"The current study focuses on the critical role of efficient cold supply chain logistics (CSCL) within the beef meat supply chain (SC), ensuring the timely delivery of premium products. Despite its significance, substantial food loss and waste (FLW) in CSCL pose multifaceted challenges across economic, social, and environmental dimensions. This comprehensive literature review aims to identify state-of-the-art CSCL for reducing food waste, key research themes, and their potential roles in red meat waste reduction, as well as identify future research directions. It explores four pivotal themes—management, sustainability, network design (ND), and new information technologies (IT)—each contributing uniquely to mitigating FLW. A review of papers published in the last two decades reveals management as the predominant theme, followed by sustainability, ND, and IT. The study underscores the interconnectedness of these themes and highlights gaps in current research, particularly the need for multi-objective optimisation models. These models should integrate uncertainties, sustainability dimensions, and technological advancements, while aligning strategic, tactical, and operational decisions to enhance CSCL sustainability and reduce FLW in the beef meat industry. This review informs stakeholders—researchers, policymakers, practitioners, the government, and the public—about emerging trends and opportunities in addressing food waste, thereby fostering more efficient and sustainable CSCL practices. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Global justice and the shift in property regime for plant genetic resources,"Although new technologies in plant breeding have the potential to reduce poverty and improve global food security, a shift in property regime for plant genetic resources (PGRs) prevents this potential from being realised. As the emergence of biotechnology has increased the value of PGRs, rentseeking behaviour by the plant breeding industry spurred the emergence of intellectual property rights (IPRs) for improved plant varieties. Whereas this system is globally implemented through the TRIPS agreement, biodiversity-rich developing countries increasingly use the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to protect their PGRs through state sovereignty. By using an economic perspective, this article aims to explain the appropriation of PGRs and the efficiency rationale that is used for its justification. However, as this perspective disregards the alarming consequences for smallholder farmers in developing countries, a global justice perspective is used to explore these effects. Focusing on distributional justice and the provision of the right to food, this article will demonstrate that the property regime shift for PGRs leads to decreased availability of, and access to, crops that are used by resource-poor farmers. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food Agriculture (ITPGRFA) and Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR) seem to be most promising in challenging the shift in property regime for PGRs and the global justice concerns this shift entails. © 2014, RIS.",Not About Sufficiency

Human resource management and development in construction: Strategic considerations,"The construction industry is characterised by complexity and a predominantly project-based culture, making the application of fundamental human resource management (HRM) strategies quite challenging. This study therefore seeks to elucidate our understanding of the applicability of fundamental ideas and strategies of HRM in the construction industry, as well as the difficulties of effectively implementing the traditional HRM strategies. To accomplish this aim, several essential HRM strategies were analyzed in the context of the construction industry in order to identify the obstacles that make their application challenging in the industry. Some of the strategies covered include employee recruitment, employee relations and conflict management, performance management, rewards and compensation, work-life balance, occupational health, employee safety and well-being. The study has highlighted how HRM is transitioning from antiquated and conventional practices to more innovative, technologically advanced, and efficient methods of operation particularly in the construction industry to accommodate the inherent challenges. We further discuss how HR departments in the construction industry in both developed and emerging economies are increasingly adopting modern technologies to optimise human resources operations where workforce management can be difficult. The innovative HRM strategies discussed will aid firms in the development of practical measures and mechanisms for mitigating the current and future unique challenges in the construction industry, as well as serve as a road map for addressing specific HR issues. © 2023 CRC Press.",Not About Sufficiency
Circular economy approach to reduce water–energy–food nexus,"The increase in world population and the resulting demand for food, water, and energy are exerting increasing pressure on soil, water resources, and ecosystems.

Impacts of agricultural commodity frontier expansion on smallholder livelihoods: An assessment through the lens of access to land and resources in the Argentine Chaco,"The global restructuring of productive systems in the last few decades has led to the rapid expansion of large-scale, industrial agriculture. This agricultural expansion has occurred by means of the acquisition and consolidation of vast tracts of land by agribusinesses, fundamentally changing the dynamics of land control. In order to secure access to resources, agribusinesses employ tactics of privatization and enclosure, which are supported by state-led processes of legalization and territorialization, as well as tactics of intimidation and violence. For smallholders faced with such pressures, maintaining access to land and resources is of critical importance. Here, we examine how changing access to land and resources influences what livelihood strategies smallholders are able to pursue in the Argentine Gran Chaco, a region that is experiencing high rates of deforestation for the expansion of large-scale soybean and cattle production. Our findings indicate that the ability of smallholders to engage in activities critical to their livelihoods has been impacted by changes in access brought about by the expansion of commodity frontiers in the Gran Chaco, leading to a restructuring of these activities. In particular, we found that cattle and goat herding were constrained by the spatial conditions and relational pressures associated with frontier expansion, possibly leading to a greater reliance on pig rearing, but that smallholders who deployed access mechanisms, such as working with lawyers to obtain land titles, were better able to maintain these activities. Our results demonstrate the value of adopting a disaggregated view on the different dimensions of smallholder access, and more generally highlight the need to assess smallholders’ access to land and resources, rather than merely the availability of resources, in order to better understand the impacts of agricultural commodity frontier expansion and properly target policy to reduce smallholder vulnerability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

LEARNING FROM BIOENERGY: SUSTAINABILITY DIMENSIONS OF HYDROGEN-BASED FUELS,"Biofuels, as one of the early options for sustainable fuels, have long been under the watchful eye of the public. In the process, their sustainability has also been scrutinized and questioned on many levels. In the course of this, biofuels have undergone an instructive process that also contains important lessons for newer fuels such as e fuels. An important step in addressing sustainability challenges has been the progress made in developing extensive sustainability standards. With stakeholder engagement in form of roundtable settings these efforts can serve as a role model for the adoption in other technological pathways like e-fuels. Armed with this knowledge, holistic sustainability standards can be developed at an early stage and integrated into effective and compatible regulation of the market ramp-up. This can create good governance of the technology from an early stage via policy coherence, stakeholder participation, monitoring institutions, and good communication. It will be important that forerunners in this sector test the application of such sustainability standards and prove their applicability. © 2023 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.",Not About Sufficiency
Application and Development Trends of Digital Technologies in Modern Production Management,"The study relevance is due to the fact that the global digitalisation process has affected all areas of society life. Hence, this article is aimed at revealing topical issues related to the application and development trends of digital technologies in modern production management in Malaysia. The study purpose is to identify the main modernised technologies applicable at various enterprises in Malaysia, to analyse their impact on the entire production management process. The main tasks were solved for this: the key requirements for modern digital technologies at enterprises were analysed, the current state of entrepreneurship in Malaysia as a whole was characterised, and the methods for improving the management process at enterprises were suggested. The main study areas are predetermined by the insufficiency of theoretical and methodological development of this issue, its increasing practical significance. The leading method for studying this problem is the analysis of the most popular and effective digital management technologies, determining the need for their synthesis in the management process, and analysing the prospects for the digital technologies’ development in general. The materials of foreign specialists were studied, which make it possible to comprehensively consider the importance of digital technologies introduction into production management in modern conditions. As a result of the study, the main popular digital technologies in the production management industry were considered, based on current trends in this area, scientific materials of popular specialists.

Adapting engineering education to challenges of sustainable development,"Textile and clothing industries generate a lot of waste at both production stages and in the process of wearing garments. Every inhabitant of developed countries annually wastes up to 30 kg of used but still suitable clothes, which decompose very slowly in natural conditions. The broadest possible implementation of textile waste processing technologies, such as downcycling and upcycling, is the key to ensuring the successful operation of the textile and clothing industries under conditions of sustainable development. The paper goal is to determine factors controlling students' upcycling behaviour to strengthen the educational components and meet sustainable development challenges for the garment industry. Based on interpersonal and planned behaviour models, 93 students of 1-6 years majoring in clothing technology, design and sectoral professional education were surveyed to understand their upcycling behaviour. The surveyed students are divided into similar-sized groups of optimists (practice upcycling more than once every three months) and pessimists (less than once a year). Upcycling behaviour was shown to correlate with intentions, which are, in turn, affected by social factors, attitude, and perceived behaviour control. Perceived habits and facilitating conditions have a relatively small impact. There is almost no difference between students of different years of study and specialities. Students' understanding of the benefits of upcycling is shallow and does not change with training years. Amid a highly-positive attitude towards upcycling, a low level of knowledge of the benefits and lack of progress with years indicate existing problems in developing upcycling behaviour in the learning process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Multifaceted aspects of charge transfer,"Charge transfer and charge transport are by far among the most important processes for sustaining life on Earth and for making our modern ways of living possible. Involving multiple electron-transfer steps, photosynthesis and cellular respiration have been principally responsible for managing the energy flow in the biosphere of our planet since the Great Oxygen Event. It is impossible to imagine living organisms without charge transport mediated by ion channels, or electron and proton transfer mediated by redox enzymes. Concurrently, transfer and transport of electrons and holes drive the functionalities of electronic and photonic devices that are intricate for our lives. While fueling advances in engineering, charge-transfer science has established itself as an important independent field, originating from physical chemistry and chemical physics, focusing on paradigms from biology, and gaining momentum from solar-energy research. Here, we review the fundamental concepts of charge transfer, and outline its core role in a broad range of unrelated fields, such as medicine, environmental science, catalysis, electronics and photonics. The ubiquitous nature of dipoles, for example, sets demands on deepening the understanding of how localized electric fields affect charge transfer. Charge-transfer electrets, thus, prove important for advancing the field and for interfacing fundamental science with engineering. Synergy between the vastly different aspects of charge-transfer science sets the stage for the broad global impacts that the advances in this field have.

Role of climate change in exacerbating sexual and gender-based violence against women: A new challenge for international law,"The advent of climate change era has been affirmed by various global processes including 21 May 2019 recognition by the Anthropocene Working Group of 'human impact' in bringing profound alterations on planet earth. It has emerged as the predominant 'world problematique'. Though entire populations are affected by climate change, women and girls suffer the most. Due to their traditional roles, women are heavily dependent on natural resources. As already seen, as a consequence of natural disasters and during Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, women have faced heightened real-life challenges specially being vulnerable to different forms of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). They suffer from a lack of protection, privacy, and mental trauma. Women are exposed to SGBV due to weak or absence of social, economic, political security and the culture of widespread impunity to the perpetrators. There is double victimization of women both as human beings and because of their gender. Effect of SGBV is highly injurious and perpetual. A close study of four main areas of international law does not yield any international legal instrument that deals with SGBV against women during and after the climate change induced disasters. This is more ominous when growing evidence suggests role of climate change in exacerbation of SGBV against women and girls. Even texts of the three specific climate change treaties (1992 UNFCCC, 1997 Kyoto Protocol and 2005 Paris Agreement) do not address this issue. It has been given attention only through the decisions of the Conference of the Parties in recent years. Due to serious psychological and bodily harm SGBV causes to women, it needs to be explicitly factored in respective international legal instruments on climate change and disasters. Amidst ignorance, denials and lack of adequate attention as regards impact of climate change in exacerbating SGBV against women and girls from the scholars and decision-makers in the field, this study makes a modest effort to deduce and analyze - from scattered initiatives, scholarly literature in different areas, existing international legal instruments and intergovernmental processes - the growing causal relationship between climate change and SGBV against women and girls so as to suggest a way out for our better common future. It is a new challenge for international law that needs to be duly addressed in a timely manner. © 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Mapping global hotspots and trends of water quality (1992-2010): a data driven approach,"Clean water is key for sustainable development. However, large gaps in monitoring data limit our understanding of global hotspots of poor water quality and their evolution over time. We demonstrate the value added of a data-driven approach (here, random forest) to provide accurate high-frequency estimates of surface water quality worldwide over the period 1992-2010. We assess water quality for six indicators (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, nitrate-nitrite, phosphorus) relevant for the sustainable development goals. The performance of our modeling approach compares well to, or exceeds, the performance of recently published process-based models. The model’s outputs indicate that poor water quality is a global problem that impacts low-, middle- and high-income countries but with different pollutants. When countries become richer, water pollution does not disappear but evolves. Water quality exhibited a signif icant change between 1992 and 2010 with a higher percentage of grid cells where water quality shows a statistically significant deterioration (30%) compared to where water quality improved (22%). © 2022 The Author(s).

Statistical Modelling for Ergonomic Assessment of Lathe Machine Operators: A Sustainable Approach to Assess the Impact of Occupational Health Hazards,"The most crucial element for any industry in the current situation is worker efficiency. The effectiveness of workers is directly impacted by factors such as critical positions, safe tool and equipment handling, machine control, excellent environmental practices and many more. The lathe machine plays an important role in any engineering workshop or manufacturing industries, and ergonomic posture also plays a significant role there. So, the present work is focused on lathe machine operators who work in different environmental conditions. It is critical that health and safety measures are implemented in organizations with local systems and existing environments. It is required to have a basic understanding of ergonomic evaluation using lathe machine operators and also calculating different working postures. The present work mainly focuses on statistical modeling of ergonomic assessment for lathe machine operators using multi-criteria decision making approach, that is, grey relational analysis. Different observation parameters including “standing position”, “working temperature”, “working time”, and “age” are considered for design using Taguchi orthogonal array. The analysis may be helpful to assess the impact of occupational health hazards in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance. It may provide an awareness for laboratory demonstrators and machine operators in educational institutions. © 2024 CRC Press.",Not About Sufficiency
Do commuters intend to avail electric street cars as public transport? Evidence from urban India,"Purpose: Electric street car (ESC) is a globally popular clean and safe electric transport system for urban agglomeration. India envisions achieving “all-electric transport” by 2030, yet ESC as a modal transport alternative is not distinct in the policy discussion. The emerging market for electric transportation in urban spaces requires a detailed demand study at the service user level to remove behavioural barriers and design integrated energy planning in developing economies. This paper explores the probabilistic uptake intentions of the daily public transport commuters for ESCs over e-buses from the only Indian city with operational ESCs, Kolkata. Design/methodology/approach: Using a random utility model on primary survey data from daily commuters, the authors identify demographic, psychometric and socio-economic factors influencing probabilistic uptake of ESC over e-buses. Findings: It estimates that 38% of the commuters demand ESC over e-buses, given the alternatives' comparative details. Factors like frequent availability and technological upgradation would increase the uptake of ESCs. Social implications: The study highlights that even though there are infrastructural challenges in the implementation of ESC, so does any other electric transport system; it is worth considering as a decarbonising transport alternative, given the high up-take intension of the users. Originality/value: This is the first attempt to study the demand for ESC in developing economies, identifying the factors which may be considered in the sustainable urban transportation policy perspective. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
"An ecohydrological approach to assess water provisioning and supporting ecosystem services in the Budhabalanga River Basin, India","Rivers are vital and complex natural systems that provide a wide range of ecosystem services. This study presents a methodology for assessing the riverine provisioning and supporting ecosystem services, whose applicability has been demonstrated over the Budhabalanga River Basin of India. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to generate streamflow time series at various ungauged sites, and then the streamflow is characterized for the evaluation of provisioning services. Further, the diversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates, along with the Lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE), is used to study the riverine supporting ecosystem services. The streams show intermittent behavior and strong seasonality for low flows, which limits the water availability, particularly during pre-monsoon season. The Baseflow Index (BFI) is greater than 0.6, indicating that groundwater contributes more than 60% of the total streamflow. Interestingly, despite the high BFI, the streams did not conform to the prevailing opinion that a greater baseflow contribution results in a later commencement of the low-flow period in the hydrological year. Furthermore, the study depicts significant variations in the diversity and abundance of the macroinvertebrates across the various sampling sites. However, the LIFE score across the sites remained consistent within a narrow range, i.e., 8 to 9, suggesting a steady supply of supporting ecosystem services. The results of the study can help the policymakers towards an informed decision making and the simplistic methodology proposed in this study can be replicated in other river basins for identifying vulnerable watersheds and prioritizing management actions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Post-pandemic recovery through landscape restoration,"Land degradation as one of the mega drivers of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services has affected billions globally, resulting in rampant loss of livelihoods and accelerated distress migration. India, one of the land degradation hotspots in Asia, has also been reeling under the impacts of the ongoing climate and pandemic crises, which have seriously imperiled local livelihoods and human well-being. Boosting livelihood-based social support programs can be a transformative approach to scale up Nature-based Solutions to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality and to realize global restoration, climate, and biodiversity conservation goals. In this article, we provide evidence for enhancing landscape restoration success by creating green job opportunities to achieve post-pandemic recovery. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) was initiated as a poverty alleviation program in India and can be transformative approach to achieve global climate and sustainable development goals. We use cases from diverse ecological contexts of India to demonstrate the potential of MGNREGS. To revolutionize the process, we propose developing and mainstreaming national-level landscape restoration guidelines by using locally relevant knowledge for addressing critical gaps, identifying institutions and their roles, developing local capacity, leveraging technology to facilitate decision-making, encouraging multi-stakeholder involvement, and promoting inclusiveness and community participation. © 2021 Society for Ecological Restoration.",Not About Sufficiency
Mapping the changes of CSR stakeholder perceptions in a context of economic depression in Spain: An approach from communication & governance,"The chapter addresses the use of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as an indicator of social change and progress towards sustainability by analysing how stakeholders shift their CSR perceptions in different economic conjunctures between visions that are closer to communication or to governance as structures of network interaction. A matrix is presented that defines four models of CSR perception by integrating theoretical approaches of CSR framed by market or by society, by communication or by governance. Stakeholders' perceptions are then positioned in the matrix through qualitative analysis of the diverse definitions, constructions and positions with respect to CSR made and adopted by corporate agents, social stakeholders and communicators in their discourses. The study proves that changes in how actors perceive and explain self-governed CSR do not depend so much on economic factors as on the networks of stakeholder interaction through communication and governance. Mapping CSR stakeholders' perceptions indicates changes and limiting actors, but is not enough to isolate the triggers of those changes. The maps provide a starting point for further exploration of (de)politicization, framing, and understanding of CSR communication and governance, and for the analysis of the limitations of the current model of CSR self-governance. The theoretical approach and methodology provide a framework that integrates communication and governance as relational structures of network interaction in CSR. © 2017 by Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency

CITES and the livelihoods of the poor,"In the recent past many international conservation institutions, including the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), have addressed the relationship between their work and poverty. The empirical evidence suggests that while it is not the case that large numbers of the global poor are engaged in trading CITES-listed species, in particular cases the trade in such species may be important to the livelihoods of the poor at the local level. The approach of CITES to poverty issues has evolved over time. Prompted in part by their experience of the trade in Harpagophytum spp. the Parties to CITES, at the last two meetings of the Conference of the Parties, adopted decisions that accepted an obligation to take into account the impacts of CITES listings on the livelihoods of the poor and initiated a process to assist countries that wish to do this. These decisions, while respecting the primary focus of the CITES Convention on conservation, have some affinities with the 'Do no harm' approach to the livelihoods of the poor. The process will produce guidelines and rapid assessment tools. If these guidelines and tools are to be effective they will need to take account of the context-specific nature of solutions in this area. The CITES case provides lessons for other international conservation institutions whose activities affect the livelihoods of the poor at the local level. © 2008 Fauna & Flora International.",Not About Sufficiency
Rainfall and flooding in coastal tourist areas of the canary islands (Spain),"Coastal spaces exploited for tourism tend to be developed rapidly and with a desire to maximise profit, leading to diverse environmental problems, including flooding. As the origin of flood events is usually associated with intense precipitation episodes, this study considers the general rainfall characteristics of tourist resorts in two islands of the Canary Archipelago (Spain). Days of intense rainfall were determined using the 99th percentile (99p) of 8 daily precipitation data series. In addition, the weather types that generated these episodes were identified, the best-fitting distribution functions were determined to allow calculation of probable maximum daily precipitation for different return periods, and the territorial and economic consequences of flood events were analysed. The results show highly irregular rainfall, with 99p values ranging 50-80 mm. The weather types associated with 49 days of flooding events were predominantly cyclonic and hybrid cyclonic. The Log Pearson III distribution function best fitted the data series, with a strong likelihood in a 100-year return period of rainfall exceeding 100 mm in a 24 h period. However, values below 30 mm have already resulted in significant flood damage, while intense rainfall events in the period 1998-2016 saw over 11.5 million euros paid out in damages for insured goods. Such flood-induced damages were found to be caused more by inadequate urban planning than by rainfall intensity. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
Societal sustainable development and long-run economic growth: How do we stand?,"The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development proposes the ambitious goal of an inclusive and sustainable economy. Thus, a realistic assessment of individual countries' possibilities to implement the Sustainable Development Goals might provide helpful insights. We seek to contribute to the existing literature by proposing a working framework for assessing, at the individual country level, the impact of long-run economic growth on societal sustainable development. The framework is based on composite models from the Structural Equation Modeling-SEM with a Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM) estimator. In contrast, societal sustainable development is viewed as emerging from its various dimensions (environmental protection, human development and public health). Based on the analyses of an extended sample of 99 countries, including data for thirty years (from 1990 to 2019), we find that economic growth matters in explaining societal sustainable development, and different countries have benefited unequally from this situation. The key finding reveals that countries aiming to follow the SDGs should recognize their significant disparities and engage in profound structural, institutional, functional and cultural transformations. Thus, a more holistic approach to societal sustainable development is currently needed to enhance government effectiveness as a transmission channel for the impact of growth. In addition, governments need to adjust their economic mechanisms to internalize the costs of environmental degradation and negative externalities for human development and public health. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Exploring the role of technical and financial support in upgrading the marine industrial structure in the Bohai Rim region: Evidence from coastal cities,"This study examines the role of technical and financial support in promoting the upgrading of the marine industrial structure in the Bohai Rim region. Using panel data from coastal cities around the Bohai Sea from 2006 to 2020, the study applies financial constraint theory and resource endowment theory to analyze the spatial spillover of technical and financial support on the marine industry. The results indicate that technical and financial support positively affects the upgrading of the marine industrial structure. Still, technical support negatively affects coastal cities around the Bohai Sea. The study also reveals that financial support has a threshold effect, and once this threshold is crossed, the government can promote the upgrading of the marine industrial structure through financial intervention, environmental regulation, and improving market opening. The findings also suggest that upgrading the marine industry will promote local economic growth but may have a siphon effect and inhibit economic growth in surrounding cities. However, it will optimize the local environment and show a significant positive spillover effect on the environmental optimization of surrounding cities. The study's conclusions can inform the construction of cross-regional industry-university research platforms and facilitate the high-quality development of marine-related industries in the Bohai Rim region. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Design factors promoting the benefits of an edible campus in China,"Currently, most university campuses in China are plagued by issues such as high food demand, imbalanced diets, serious food waste and poor environmental quality. Research has shown that the multiple benefits of an edible campus, which may also be referred to as a school garden or farm catering to various educational levels, can help alleviate the aforementioned problems. However, there is limited research on how to promote the benefits of an edible campus through design. Therefore, taking the South Campus of Hebei University of Technology in China as an example, this paper aims to explore the correlation between design and benefits of an edible campus. The design factors and benefit factors related to an edible campus are extracted through literature search. The design preferences and benefit predictions are obtained through 261 questionnaire surveys and interviews with 30 participants. During the statistical analysis phase, principal component analysis and multiple regression analysis are applied to analyze the correlation between design factors and benefit factors. The results indicate: (1) The design factors of an edible campus can be categorized into seven categories: spatial location, spatial carrier, size, space function, facility configuration, planting and crop varieties, and technology application. (2) The benefits of an edible campus include environmental education, physical and mental health, social interaction, ecological protection, and economic output. (3) There are significant differences in design factors that positively or negatively correlate with different benefits. Among them, the strongest positive correlation exists between planting function and the five benefits, followed by central landscape and container planting. Furthermore, the causes behind the correlation between design factors and benefit factors are analyzed, and design strategies for an edible campus under different benefit orientations are proposed. The findings of this study can contribute to the sustainable development of university campuses in China. Copyright © 2024 Ding, Zhao, Yue, Xing and Zhao.",Not About Sufficiency
Taking on climate change through green taxation,"Since environmental issues entered the global agenda, governments have directing businesses towards sustainability. The term ""sustainability"" is commonly associated with a firm's environmental attentiveness, although there are two other areas in which companies should be sustainable: social, to achieve an adequate relationship and fluid communication with their stakeholders, and economic, to accomplish transparent management and correct distribution of the wealth that is generated. The growing demand for corporate transparency encourages the publication of sustainability or corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, providing information of a non-financial nature concerning the social and environmental dimensions of business activity, namely relations with local communities, the protection of human rights, corporate governance, and adaptation to climate change. Being no exception, and following the European agenda for sustainability development, several governments have implemented tax measures that promote sustainable consumption and production patterns to reduce energy dependence on external sources and efficiently achieve international targets, among others, within a context of neutrality of the tax system. This is where environmental tax incentives come in, underlying a paradigm shift. The relationship between tax policy and environmental policy is seen by governments as an opportunity to adjust the tax system to a more energy-efficient economy in the use of resources. For instance, green tax incentives motivate investors to invest in green properties, encouraging them to opt for greener solutions. That is, tax incentives should be viewed as a tool to empower taxpayers to change actions that may reduce carbon emissions and contribute to sustainability. © 2023 by IGI Global.

Radiologic findings in cases of attempted suicide and other self-injurious behavior,"Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in multiple age groups. Therefore, it is important that radiologists be aware of this commonly encountered entity. Attempted suicide may take a variety of forms; those discussed by the authors include sharp force injury, immolation and inhalation, ingestion, hanging, firearm use, jumping from a height, and drowning. Certain radiologic findings are commonly seen in cases of attempted suicide and other self-injurious behaviors. In some cases, especially when the patient is unconscious or is unwilling to provide a history, it may not be apparent that suicide has been attempted until characteristic imaging findings are recognized. Correct identification of suicide attempts on the basis of such findings will ensure that these patients receive appropriate psychiatric treatment. When a suicide attempt is unsuccessful, it is important to be familiar with the complications that may contribute to delayed mortality and morbidity. The radiologist plays an integral role in the acute medical or surgical management of patients who have attempted suicide. In addition, imaging examinations may provide useful forensic information. © RSNA,2012.",Not About Sufficiency
Public preference for sustainable land use policies – Empirical results from multinomial logit model analysis,"Public preferences for sustainable land use policy instruments and the motivations behind such preferences are important to make appropriate policies. Based on survey data (n = 309) from northeastern Somalia, we examined preferences for a set of land use policy instruments relative to no policy (i.e. the current status quo) and how cultural worldviews predict such preferences. We used a multinomial logit model to analyze the comparative evaluation of choices due to its interpretability and robustness to violations of normality. Overall, the results show that the respondents are likely to consent to all types of land use policy instruments relative to no policy and are more inclined to market-based and informational policy instruments. Specifically, preferences for regulatory policy instruments are positively associated with hierarchy and egalitarian worldviews and are negatively associated with fatalism and individualistic worldviews with only hierarchy and fatalism are significant. The market-based policy instrument is desirable to all cultural worldviews except fatalism, but only egalitarian and individual worldviews are significant. Preferences for informational policy instruments are positively associated with all cultural worldviews but only egalitarian worldviews showed a significant effect. Although there are some contradictions, these results are broadly consistent with the proposition of the cultural theory of risk. This study highlights that preferences for land use policies are heterogeneous with cultural worldviews mainly explaining the sources of this heterogeneity. It is evident that the respondents were willing to consent to land use policies relative to the status quo of no policy and indicates the need for concerted effort to reduce land degradation and deforestation in the country. We, therefore, recommend that policymakers incorporate the different ways that humans perceive and interpret social-environmental relations into policy decisions to achieve sustainable policy outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Bioactive Silk Revolution: Harnessing Curcuminoid Dye and Chitosan for Superior Antimicrobial Defence and UV Shielding,"Background/Objectives: The use of natural colourants is gaining attention due to their biocompatibility and functional benefits. This study introduces a different approach using turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) dye extract combined with chitosan to significantly enhance the antibacterial and UV-shielding properties of silk. Methods: The turmeric dye’s chemical composition was analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), UV–visible spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The dyed silk’s colourfastness was tested through rubbing, washing, and light exposure. Results: The chitosan-mordanted silk showed strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), as well as antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger (A. niger). It also demonstrated a high ultraviolet protection factor (UPF). For comparison, alum-mordant was used, and chitosan proved more effective. Beyond its use as a dye, turmeric is renowned for its medicinal properties. Its antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties have been extensively researched, which are primarily linked to its curcuminoid compounds. Turmeric is used in traditional medication to treat digestive issues, arthritis, and skin diseases. Conclusions: This work underscores the innovative use of plant-based dye extracts and natural mordants like chitosan as a sustainable alternative to conventional metallic mordants, paving the way for the evolution of bioactive silk with improved functional properties. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Each group created a “Catchment Journey,” a graphical artwork that told a story of their land and people, and their restoration activities. Whilst each of these “Journeys” was unique, the following common elements were important for knowledge sharing: (1) the role of respected storytellers (e.g., community champions) in influencing restoration in their community; (2) recognition of responsibility to act (e.g., concern for future generations, land stewardship, prosperity and community cohesion); and (3) authenticity (e.g., true and honest stories, including weaknesses, threats and hardship). Participants recommended including each of these key elements in collective catchment storytelling to encourage large scale freshwater restoration.

"The nexus of microplastics, food and antimicrobial resistance in the context of aquatic environment: Interdisciplinary linkages of pathways","The exponential rise in plastic production since the mid-20th century has led to the widespread existence of microplastics in various ecosystems, posing significant environmental and health concerns. Microplastics, defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, have infiltrated diverse environments, including oceans, freshwater bodies, and even remote Arctic ice. Their ability to absorb toxic chemicals and serve as vectors for microbial colonization raises concerns about their impacts on aquatic organisms and human health. This review examines the pathways by which microplastics infiltrate the food chain, highlighting their presence in various food items consumed by humans. Furthermore, it explores the nexus between microplastics and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), elucidating how microorganisms inhabiting plastic surfaces facilitate the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The review underscores the urgent need for interdisciplinary research integrating environmental science, microbiology, public health, and policy to address the multifaceted challenges posed by microplastics. Standardized protocols for sampling and analysis are essential to enable meaningful comparisons across research and regions. By collectively addressing these challenges, we can strive towards a more sustainable and resilient future for ecosystems and human societies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
A Life Cycle Assessment of Reusable and Disposable Surgical Caps,"Introduction: Surgical cap attire plays an important role in creating a safe and sterile environment in procedural suites, thus the choice of reusable versus disposable caps has become an issue of much debate. Given the lack of evidence for differences in surgical site infection (SSI) risk between the two, selecting the cap option with a lower carbon footprint may reduce the environmental impact of surgical procedures. However, many institutions continue to recommend the use of disposable bouffant caps. Methods: ISO-14044 guidelines were used to complete a process-based life cycle assessment to compare the environmental impact of disposable bouffant caps and reusable cotton caps, specifically focusing on CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions, water use and health impacts. Results: Reusable cotton caps reduced CO2e emissions by 79% when compared to disposable bouffant caps (10 kg versus 49 kg CO2e) under the base model scenario with a similar reduction seen in disability-adjusted life years. However, cotton caps were found to be more water intensive than bouffant caps (67.56 L versus 12.66 L) with the majority of water use secondary to production or manufacturing. Conclusions: Reusable cotton caps have lower total lifetime CO2e emissions compared to disposable bouffant caps across multiple use scenarios. Given the lack of evidence suggesting a superior choice for surgical site infection prevention, guidelines should recommend reusable cotton caps to reduce the environmental impact of surgical procedures. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
How do pollution fees affect environmental quality in China?,"Pollution fees are an important financial tool for the government to achieve environmental protection goals. Accordingly, evaluating the emissions-reduction effect of pollution fees has important theoretical value for China's construction of an ecological civilization. Thus, using panel data of China's 30 provinces for the period 2000–2017, we examine the dynamic linkage between pollution fees and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as well as chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions. We further explore the moderating role of pollution fees in the innovation-emission nexus and regional heterogeneity. The primary findings of our study indicate that: (1) The imposition of pollution fees and technological innovation can help mitigate SO2 and COD emissions. Economic growth shows a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between SO2 and COD emissions; (2) levying pollution fees can effectively promote the technological innovation of enterprises, thus further reducing pollutant emissions; and (3) the impacts of levying pollution fees on SO2 and COD emissions differ across various regions; in other words, significant regional heterogeneity exists between regions. Only in low-fees and low-emission regions can pollution fees help mitigate SO2 emissions. Finally, we provide several policy pathways to promote energy conservation and emissions reduction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Is energy aid allocated fairly? A global energy vulnerability perspective,"The escalating climate change crisis is causing many developing countries to become more vulnerable to energy-related challenges, highlighting the issue of fairness in allocating energy aid. Given this context, it is important to ensure countries that face higher energy vulnerabilities receive a greater share of energy aid funding. This study aims to assess the impact of energy vulnerability on energy aid allocation using a double-hurdle model and a panel of 124 countries from 2002 to 2019. We rely on an index of energy vulnerability to understand the differences in the amount of aid available to different energy-vulnerable recipients, and study the transmission mechanisms underlying this relationship. Our results suggest that the allocation of energy aid has been largely fair. Specifically, energy-vulnerable countries are more likely to be selected as recipients of energy aid during the selection stage, and subsequently receive a greater share of this aid during the allocation stage. However, this effect is heterogeneous and asymmetric. Donors tend to allocate energy aid to countries characterized by relatively low quality of government, low income levels, and limited access to energy assistance. Furthermore, disparities exist in the impact of energy vulnerability on different types of energy support. Specifically, countries with higher energy vulnerability receive a greater proportion of energy policy and energy distribution aid, but are allocated a relatively small share of aid to their non-renewable energy-generation sectors. Additionally, the relationship between energy vulnerability and renewable energy generation aid is not statistically significant. Our results highlight the importance of considering energy vulnerability when allocating energy assistance, and have both scholarly and practical significance. Our findings also have important policy implications for donors by providing guidance on how to promote a fairer allocation of energy aid. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Shifting agricultural land use and its unintended water consumption in the North China Plain,"Agricultural land use (ALU) critically influences food production and water resource allocation. This study examines the dynamics of ALU in the North China Plain (NCP), a region characterized by intensive agriculture and severe groundwater over-exploitation, focusing on the multidimensional drivers and their implications for water resource management. By employing an elaborate classification scheme based on satellite imagery and extensive first-hand field data, we identified significant shifts in crop patterns. From 2013 to 2017, there was a notable transition from double crops (primarily wheat-maize) to single crops (primarily maize), covering 4600 km2 and accounting for 42% of single crops in 2013. From 2017 to 2022, there was a shift from single crops to economic forests, encompassing 3600 km2 and 22% of economic forests in 2017, including orchards, timber trees, and shelter forest belts. These shifts resulted in an 11% decrease in grain acreage (6800 km2) but an 11% increase in crop water consumption (6.3 km3) during 2013–2022. Notably, water consumption by economic forests increased by 126% (9.4 km3) during this period. This study highlights the critical need to balance competing demands for food and water security, providing valuable insights applicable to other agriculturally intensive regions worldwide. © 2024 Science China Press",Not About Sufficiency
Can intensification of temperate Australian livestock production systems save land for native biodiversity?,"Land use change associated with agriculture is arguably the greatest threat to global biodiversity. There is a need to develop management strategies and policies that meet conservation and agricultural objectives. One approach argued to have merit is intensification within productive parts of the landscape to allow increased land saving for conservation of biodiversity. To date there has been little empirical examination of this hypothesis. Livestock production has been the dominant land use across southern Australia for the last 100-200 years. This has contributed to biodiversity loss and other environmental issues associated with removal of native perennial vegetation. Livestock producers are under increasing pressure to maintain farm profits and it is argued that intensification through fertiliser application can increase profitability and allow more land to be set-aside for conservation management. We examined relationships between native vegetation composition and past and current farm management and combined this with assessments of current productivity and potential for intensification using either fertiliser application or changes in grazing management. Intensive management associated with phosphate fertiliser application results in exponential declines in native plant diversity, although intermediate levels of livestock grazing often have little impact on plant diversity when nutrient levels are low. Options for future intensification, via fertiliser application, often coincide with areas of high native plant diversity. Small set-asides, off-set by intensification using fertiliser application, are only affordable on farms currently managing below potential carrying capacity. These farms are often those that support extensive areas of native vegetation. At both the paddock and farm scale, increasing productivity via fertiliser application is likely to require intensification on even more land and could come at a cost to biodiversity. In contrast, improving grazing management across broad scales is likely to result in enhanced profitability and could also benefit native vegetation. Extensive management may be necessary to maintain biodiversity and prevent further long-term degradation of the resource base. Crown Copyright © 2006.",Not About Sufficiency
Role of the State’s Prosecution Office as a promoter of the payment for ecosystem services mechanism: case of the Oásis Brumadinho project in Brazil,"“Payment for ecosystem services” (PES) schemes have been introduced worldwide as an instrument to support the participation of multiple actors through an organizational arrangement. In Brazil, Minas Gerais State’s Prosecution Office (MPMG—Ministério Público de Minas Gerais, in Portuguese) acted as a pioneer in channeling resources from Deferred Prosecution Agreements (TACs—Termo de Ajustamento de Conduta, in Portuguese) to financially enable a PES project’s implementation. This is the first study to have analyzed the performance of the MPMG as a prominent actor in the institutional arrangement related to this project. The research mobilizes the notion of institutional design as proposed by Corbera, et al. (Ecol Econ 68:743–761, 2009), which establishes that, for the long-term viability of PES schemes, different institutional actors have fundamental roles to play, specially dedicated to the financial sustainability of the schemes. This research involved related documents’ analysis and a state-of-the-art review of the origin and implementation of the Oásis Brumadinho project in the Brazilian State of Minas Gerais. An analysis of the institutional arrangement of the Oásis Brumadinho project showed that the role of the State’s Prosecution Office was crucial in making the PES feasible in terms of transaction costs. Our reflections on alternatives to finance PES projects will be useful for future cases, especially the new legal provision of the National Policy on Payment for Environmental Services at the federal level. Overall, this study furthers our understanding of the role played by the State’s Prosecution Office and sheds light on the possibility of using TAC resources as an economic alternative to enable the implementation of PES frameworks in other locations in Brazil. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Short-term needs trump conservation in household livelihood decision-making around Saadani National Park, Tanzania","This research explores the influence of attitudes towards conservation affecting livelihood decision-making of households in rural Tanzania through a case study of three villages adjacent to Saadani National Park. Key informant interviews, focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews revealed that attitudes towards conservation were not a direct influence on livelihood decisions. Instead, people felt powerless over forces that have reduced resource productivity and undermined their ability to maintain the level of benefits from their livelihood activities. Changing environmental conditions, harmful harvesting practices, restricted access to land and impacts of other resource users were reported as the major reasons for the natural resource-based livelihood challenges that residents face. Household respondents reported the need to adapt livelihood practices to boost or restore that productivity and compensate for diminished resource access. Short-term need drives decision-making where people are vulnerable to change, not long-term considerations of resource integrity. The main barriers that impede the influence of positive conservation attitudes are low resource productivity, small-scale economies and entrenched cultural traditions. © 2017 Society of South African Geographers.",Not About Sufficiency
A comprehensive review of Maritime Bibliometric Studies (2014–2024),"A significant number of Maritime Bibliometric Studies (MBSs) have been published over the past years. The present research aims to evaluate a large amount of the relevant literature to characterize Maritime Industry Areas (MIAs). A bibliometric analysis of MBSs is conducted to evaluate important MBSs. The performed analysis examines the main features of each MBS, relationships between them, and their impact on the development of MIAs. A unique approach is developed based on a bibliometric methodology to study previously published MBSs through the performance analysis, trend analysis, statistical analysis, bibliographic coupling analysis, word clouds analysis, and conceptual thematic map analysis. To provide a high level of accuracy and reliability of mapping and analysis, various bibliometric software tools are used. The visibility and readability of the obtained results aim to establish the new pathways for bibliometric studies that could be easily applied to a broad spectrum of research areas. The outcomes of the conducted analysis confirm that MBSs present very accumulative research paths in MIAs with a continuous change in dynamics that well characterize this research domain and highlight the conceptual structure of MIAs. The findings showcase journal and publication trends, identified research topics and sub-topics, the main study attributes, and the most influential MBSs with the highest scholarly impact. Some interesting future research directions that can be explored for MBSs in the following years are comprehensively described. Last but not least, the important role of bibliometric methods for evaluation of the existing and future studies related to MIA applications is discussed in detail as well. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Risk society and anti-politics in the fracking debate,"Fracking in the United Kingdom has yet to reach full industrial development, but it is still subject to significant opposition. This study uses Beck's risk society theory and anti-politics to examine the views voiced by opponents to fracking in Yorkshire, England. A qualitative approach was used. Semi-structured interviews with protesters and local newspaper reports were evaluated to provide a thematic analysis. The study drew upon discourse analysis and framing literature to reveal discourses within the interviews. Although there are signs of post-materialist concerns with the environment, these issues did not dominate the discussion. Scientists were not held responsible for the risks involved in fracking. Instead, the economic greediness of politicians and austerity measures were perceived as putting the environment and human health at risk. Interviewees thought fossil fuel energy production was economically advantaged over more sustainable energy and jobs in the low carbon economy. Protesters' trust in politicians had been eroded, but faith in democracy remained. It is argued that the consensual post-politics of risk society have not led to a reinvigoration of democratic debate. Instead anti-politics have taken place, due to the frustration of citizens. Protesters wanted a citizen-led deliberative approach to the concerns raised. Such a process would have to go beyond the consensual, and recognise the inherently agonistic process of democracy if it is to succeed. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The Future of Work: A Research Agenda,"In this editorial, we discuss and define the “future of work” as a phenomenon and research area, and outline avenues for further research at the conceptual and empirical level. We first offer a brief review of the different streams of research that study the future of work, both in management and organization studies and in adjacent fields. We then elaborate on what we see as the most promising avenues for research on the future of work, organized around five questions of what, when, who, how, and why. That is, research on the future of work needs to clarify its assumptions about (1) the phenomena it considers within scope; (2) the temporality associated with these phenomena; (3) which future of work actors it is about and whom it is for; (4) the methods and data types used to be able to study the future empirically; and (5) desired impact and envisioned outcomes. We discuss how moving beyond techno-determinism, depoliticization, and a present-day focus could open up new and important avenues for further research on the near and distant future of work. We conclude with some specific examples of research questions and methods. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Co-development of a framework for circular economy assessment in organisations: Learnings from the public sector,"To seize the potential of Circular Economy (CE) organisations need to evaluate and communicate their progress moving away from the non-sustainable paradigm of ‘take-make-dispose’ towards circularity. Existing CE assessments for organisations focus on companies. Although the need for CE assessment is recognised in both public and private sectors, little progress has been made towards developing an approach for public sector organisations. CE assessment in public sector organisations is particularly important due to their role model, agenda setting and economic function. Therefore, this article co-develops a CE assessment framework for public sector organisations. Portuguese public sector organisations were involved as a participatory case study. The result is a framework that covers the following components: (i) a system definition; (ii) a definition of 35 CE assessment elements; (iii) CE assessment targets; and (iv) CE indicators. The framework contributes to the understanding of circularity from a public sector perspective considering three key aspects: resources, operations and processes as well as social and employee related activities. Implications for CE assessments in the public and private sector encompass the importance for an early involvement of stakeholders to get a sector specific perspective, the need to address user-friendliness and the requirement for continuous testing of CE assessments. © 2021 The Authors.

"Epidemics: Science, Governance and Social Justice","Recent disease events such as SARS, H1N1 and avian influenza, and haemorrhagic fevers have focussed policy and public concern as never before on epidemics and so-called 'emerging infectious diseases'. Understanding and responding to these often unpredictable events have become major challenges for local, national and international bodies. All too often, responses can become restricted by implicit assumptions about who or what is to blame that may not capture the dynamics and uncertainties at play in the multi-scale interactions of people, animals and microbes. As a result, policies intended to forestall epidemics may fail, and may even further threaten health, livelihoods and human rights. The book takes a unique approach by focusing on how different policy-makers, scientists, and local populations construct alternative narratives-accounts of the causes and appropriate responses to outbreaks- about epidemics at the global, national and local level. The contrast between emergency-oriented, top-down responses to what are perceived as potentially global outbreaks and longer-term approaches to diseases, such as AIDS, which may now be considered endemic, is highlighted. Case studies-on avian influenza, SARS, obesity, H1N1 influenza, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and haemorrhagic fevers-cover a broad historical, geographical and biological range. As this book explores, it is often the most vulnerable members of a population-the poor, the social excluded and the already ill-who are likely to suffer most from epidemic diseases. At the same time, they may be less likely to benefit from responses that may be designed from a global perspective that neglects social, ecological and political conditions on the ground. This book aims to bring the focus back to these marginal populations to reveal the often unintended consequences of current policy responses to epidemics. Important implications emerge - for how epidemics are thought about and represented; for how surveillance and response is designed; and for whose knowledge and perspectives should be included.

Asymmetric spatial competition and dynamics in digitalization: Will public R&D support and marketization exacerbate spatial polarization?,"This paper investigates the asymmetric spatial spillover effects of digital development across different types of cities. The results of the two-regime spatial Durbin models, using the panel data of 279 cities in China from 2011 to 2021, reveal the spatial polarization phenomenon in digitalization, where stronger cities such as smart cities, provincial capitals, and port cities become more dominant while weaker cities struggle to catch up. Increasing public R&D support leads to positive spatial spillover effects but exacerbates the spatial “Matthew effect” of digitalization. Additionally, marketization plays a moderating role by enhancing resource allocation efficiency and suppressing negative spatial spillover effects. Higher levels of marketization result in smaller digital gaps between cities. The findings provide valuable insights for decision-makers and stakeholders seeking to foster balanced and inclusive urban development in the digital age. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Life cycle cost and life cycle environmental analysis of the different waste-to-renewable natural gas pathways: An effort to identify an optimal pathway under different Multi-criteria decision-based scenarios,"Currently, due to the insufficient resources of renewable natural gas, the development of renewable pathways to integrate into the natural gas-industry portfolio can reduce many concerns about the reserves depletion and the environmental crises. In the present article a structure-oriented framework for gas networks is developed to compare and prioritize different investment scenarios for renewable natural gas production projects. In this regard, different pathways to produce renewable natural gas through the waste-to-natural gas process were discussed and compared based on different waste feedstocks. To discuss and compare different pathways, a decision-making structure and framework under life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) and life cycle environmental analysis (LCEA) is employed to choose the appropriate pathway for the waste-to-natural gas process. The optimal pathway is identified through different multi-variable decision-making scenarios (under different geographical conditions, access to different feedstocks, and different interests of stakeholders). From the outcomes, under the neutral and Pro-economic scenarios, the renewable natural gas production pathway driven by landfill gas integrated with the pressure swing adsorption- biogas upgrading unit is the optimal and desirable option. While under an Eco-friendly scenario, the pathway driven by animal manure integrated with the pressure swing adsorption-upgrading unit is an optimal and desirable pathway. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the Trade-off between Ecological Conservation and Local Development in Wuyishan National Park: A Production–Living–Ecological Space Perspective,"China’s national park establishment aims to achieve a balance between ecological conservation and regional development. This study adopts a production–living–ecological (PLE) space perspective to evaluate the park’s impact. By quantifying changes and employing a combination of geographic detector and coupling coordination degree analyses, this research explores the dynamics of habitat quality and PLE space within the Wuyishan region, alongside their interrelationships. The national park’s influence on the surrounding area exhibits spatial heterogeneity, evident both within and beyond park boundaries, as well as across different counties. Despite the concentration of PLE changes in the park’s vicinity, particularly in densely populated urban areas, the influence of the national park on the local area is random and primarily at a low level. Importantly, the ecological space exhibits substantial changes, mirroring improvements in habitat quality. Furthermore, the coupling coordination between habitat quality changes and PLE space changes exhibits remarkable spatial variations. The complex interrelationships among PLE space necessitate a coordinated approach to their development for effective national park management. Ultimately, this investigation provides a novel perspective for the assessment of Wuyishan National Park’s conservation effectiveness, contributing practical value for future endeavors. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Advances in research on the interactions among arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi，rhizobia，and plants,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi （AMF） and rhizobia play crucial roles in plant productivity，microbial community structure，and soil quality. As such，they are key organisms for achieving sustainable ecosystem development. Over time，a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship develops between AMF and rhizobia，and this relationship is essential for effective biological nitrogen fixation and nutrient absorption. Such effective symbioses reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers，thereby facilitating sustainable agricultural practices. However，studies have shown that various environmental factors can hinder the formation of symbiotic relationships between AMF and rhizobia. Therefore，it is necessary to systematically explore the mechanism of the AMF-rhizobia interaction and the factors that affect it. On the basis of a literature review and qualitative comparative analysis，we described the process and mechanism by which plant roots released exudates to stimulate rhizobia and AMF to produce nodulation factors and mycorrhizal factors，thereby activating signaling pathways involved in the establishment of symbiotic relationships between rhizobia-AMF and plants. This review summarized the results of research on the synergism and interaction between AMF-rhizobia and plants，and the biological and abiotic factors affecting the AMF-rhizobia symbiosis and interactions. We highlighted the current gaps in knowledge related to the mechanisms of the symbiotic relationships among AMF，rhizobia，and plants，and discussed the reasons for the slow development of microbial fertilizers. Finally，we discussed future research directions at the theoretical，technical，and application levels. Further research will provide novel ideas and methods for using AMF and rhizobia to promote sustainable agricultural development. © 2024 Editorial Office of Acta Prataculturae Sinica.

Environmental implications of improving global value chain participation via trade diversification: Offsetting the effects of resource rents,"This study explores the moderating effect of trade diversification on the relationship between global value-chain participation and natural resource rents for 106 nations from 2005 to 2018. The study employs an extended system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) model to address potential challenges related to endogeneity and serial correlation. The results demonstrate how natural resource rents inhibit global value-chain participation by multinational firms, deterring them from investing in resource-dependent economies and restricting their integration into global trade networks. Trade diversification serves an essential moderation role in this process; nations with more diverse trade arrangements are less vulnerable to resource rents' negative effect on global value-chain participation. Furthermore, this study unleashes the significance of employing ecologically sustainable methods to mitigate resource exploitation's detrimental environmental impacts and ensure a balanced economic development model. Diversifying trade links and export quality improvement efforts with diversifying trade can increase trade links, strengthen international value chains and facilitate adoption of new technologies and information encouraging participation in global value chains. Our findings underscore the significance of policy actions which promote trade diversification to better manage natural resources, leverage resource rents for long-term economic growth and build resilience against future economic shocks. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Igniting Sustainability Through the ‘Profit-For-Impact’ Catalyst: A Case Study,"Breaking new ground in the realm of sustainability research, this study delves into the ‘profit-for-impact’ model’s dynamics through a compelling lens – the case of TONTOTON, an innovative player in plastic neutralisation that has operationalised the model in the context of Vietnam.

Who cares for the environment? Pro-environmental and political opinions in relation to basic psychological needs. A person-centered approach,"Effective educational activities aimed at shaping pro-environmental behavior require knowledge of the characteristics of the group to which they are to be addressed and should therefore be preceded by a diagnosis of their needs. Apart from the characteristics of the individuals, the geo-political context in which we function also plays a role in human–environmental interactions. Therefore, to better understand their role, we conducted a study aimed at examining whether three basic psychological needs and political views were related to pro-environmental opinions in a unique geopolitical situation that took place in Poland in December 2021. A representative sample of 1241 adult Polish respondents, 52.7% of whom were female, took part in an anonymous quantitative survey, based on a survey questionnaire and conducted in a research panel. We found weak correlations between the basic psychological needs satisfaction and pro-environmental opinions, as well as a moderate positive correlation between left-wing political views and pro-environmental opinions. Moreover, a cluster analysis revealed a cluster of “needs satisfaction” and “needs frustration,” and these two clusters differed, given the higher pro-environmental opinions and left-wing political views in the “needs satisfaction” group. We discuss the results in the light of the basic psychological needs theory and implications for educational and sustainable development promotion practice. The beneficiaries of this study may include not only psychologists interested in the issues of human–environment relations in the context of basic needs but also people involved in the creation and implementation of educational pro-environmental policies or adult educators. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

Advanced Vehicle Systems and Technologies: Economic and Environmental Implications,"Advancement in vehicle system and technology is a continuous process which started from the steam engine era to bring human comfort and ease of operation. In the last decade, the high oil prices due to the crisis of non-renewable fossil fuel and environmental concern regarding tailpipe emission from Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) paved the emergence of hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs). Although EVs create zero tailpipe emission, but the dependency on coal fired power supply make the EVs also responsible for carbon emission in consideration of total Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The interaction of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) with vehicle to grid (V2G) in smart grid can reduce the dependency on carbon intensive power generation and alleviate the carbon footprint as well. This book article focuses on different fuel economy practiced in different countries; structure of different HEVs, EVs; economic and environmental implication of EVs and HEVs in comparison to ICEVs. Moreover it also highlights the mutual synergy between Electric Vehicles (EVs) and most advanced Automated Vehicles (AVs) to bring further fuel economy and environmental benefit. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Role of Social Capital Between Slum and Non-Slum Areas,"The Gresik Regency is a region that boasts significant potential for rapid growth within the Surabaya Metropolitan Area. It is situated in close proximity to the center of the provincial capital of East Java and is predominantly characterized by its northern coastal area. Given its strategic location, the Gresik Regency is widely recognized as a vital contributor to the national economy and is therefore included in the East Java Mainstay Area, GERBANGKERTOSUSILA. The economic potential of Gresik Regency has led to a substantial influx in population, resulting in the emergence of two distinct settlement patterns, namely slum and non-slum. The residential environment in question is believed to be shaped by the interplay of relationships and values upheld by the community. This contributes to the creation of a comfortable and high-quality living space, and is considered a form of social capital. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of social capital on the quality of residential environments in two distinct types of settlements - slum and non-slum - located in Gresik Regency. The research will employ a quantitative approach known as Social Network Analysis (SNA). This method identifies influential community members to aid in developing effective programs. The sample has two types: location (slum and non-slum) and 602 respondent samples (poverty and non poverty) with purposive sampling technique. The result showed that slum areas have higher social capital than non-slum settlements which has medium RoP (16% slum, 11,1% non-slum), high Density (0,8% slum, 0% non-slum), and high Centrality (33,3% slum, 11,1% non-slum). This happens because almost all of the people in slum area participate in institutional activities and know each other. These groups facilitate easy access to assistance programs offered by the Gresik Regency government. © 2024 Joint Journal of Novel Carbon Resource Sciences and Green Asia Strategy.

Fostering resilient agro-food futures through a social-ecological systems framework: Public–private partnerships for delivering ecosystem services in Europe,"In recent decades, various public policies have targeted agriculture and forestry's relationship with environmental protection and management. Among environmental policy communities the approach is increasingly framed through the theoretical concepts of ecosystem services (ES) or public goods (PG). Both offer useful perspectives to enhance understanding, but each only partially reflects the complex inter-linkages between productive land management and multiple environmental and social assets (biodiversity, landscapes, water, soil and air quality, rural vitality, culture and heritage), constraining their capacity for effective policy development. The Social-Ecological-Systems framework (SES), considering both natural and socio-economic elements in complex systems and interrogating these joint production relationships, offers added value in this context. The PEGASUS project1 applied an adapted SES framework to identify the potential complementary and synergistic roles of policy, private and community actors in promoting socially beneficial outcomes, strengthening ecosystem services and sustainability. Two case studies illustrate the analytical process and its ability to connect top-down and bottom-up perspectives. This generated an expanded range of options focused on social processes and market development facilitated by an enabling, responsive policy framework.

A social licence to operate legitimacy test: Enhancing sustainability through contact quality,"The social licence to operate is a notoriously ambiguous concept that encompasses a patent normative heterogeneity, making the emergence of a widely accepted standard capable of settling controversies on its legitimate use seem unlikely.

This model is tested on a case study from the minerals and energy sector (Base Titanium Mine in Kenya). Our findings show that a company can move up and down on the legitimacy scale, depending on the contact quality with company stakeholders. The interest of providing a social licence heuristic is to make sense of the theoretical controversies surrounding this concept and to offer also realistic guidance to practitioners searching to understand where a firm sits on the legitimacy scale, to enhance transparency and accountability of its social licence to operate and ultimately improve business practice. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Steering ‘green’ innovation policy toward sustainability? Lessons from implementing EIP-AGRI in Sweden,"This article critically examines the state's steering capacity of ‘green innovation’ programs using Sweden's implementation of the agricultural European Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) as a case representing part of the EU's Green Deal. The innovations should promote the competitiveness of rural areas and contribute to national environmental protection and climate goals. We found that despite expectations, implementation rests on compartmentalized networking within the agricultural sector, prioritizing increased ‘competitiveness’ before ‘green’ development, and interpreting ‘innovation’ mainly in the technical sense. The results indicate that the state´s steering capacity of ‘green innovation’ programs meets several obstacles: the overall goals from the top tend to be both too many and too vague, leaving it to the administration to interpret what kinds of features should be prioritized from below. The state's steering in the case of EIP-AGRI relies mostly on internal agricultural expertise contrary to previous research that suggests a recent ‘de-compartmentalisation’ of European agricultural policymaking. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
An empirical analysis of SMES’ triple bottom line practices,"Purpose: This study aims to examine the determinants of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) sustainability practices in New Zealand from the triple bottom line (3BL) perspective. Unlike large companies and government agencies whose sustainability practices are driven by regulations and attempts to legitimise business operations, little is known about the drivers of SMEs’ sustainability practices. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey approach was adopted for the data collection. The analysis was mainly descriptive, while the covariates’ effects were measured based on partial least squares structural equation modelling. Findings: This paper identified that SMEs’ 3BL practices are significantly influenced by local bylaws, voluntary adoption of 3BL operational policies and company size. This paper finds that the SMEs’ industry type is not statistically significant as a determinant of their 3BL practices. This implies that regulation and operational policies increase sustainability practices in the SME sector. Practical implications: These findings provide insights to SMEs’ managers on the importance of sustainability policies adoption and bylaws. Government departments and local government councils could adopt the findings in developing regulatory policies that support SMEs’ 3BL. Social implications: This study provides support for economically, environmentally and socially sustainable business practices amongst SMEs. Originality/value: A dearth of studies on SMEs sustainability practices exists in the extant literature, particularly in New Zealand. The study focusses on SMEs sustainability in the viewpoint of 3BL practices based on an empirical analysis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency

Climate change and contagion: the emerging threat of zoonotic diseases in Africa,"This article investigates the escalating occurrence of zoonotic diseases in Africa, attributing their spread to climate change and human activities. Africa’s unique combination of biodiversity, reliance on animal husbandry, and swift urbanization heightens its susceptibility. Climate change disrupts ecosystems and animal habitats, intensifying human-wildlife interactions. Urbanization, inadequate sanitation, and insufficient healthcare infrastructure further facilitate disease spread. Climate-induced displacement adds another layer of complexity. Mitigation strategies include improving surveillance systems, fostering early detection via point-of-care diagnostics and digital contact tracing, and investing in vaccines and therapeutics. Our purpose of this is to advocate for sustainable land use, robust community-level public health systems, international cooperation, and resource-sharing. We also emphasize the need for effective vector-control policies, dedicated research funding, and annual awareness, vaccination, and early detection campaigns in endemic regions. © 2024 The Author(s).

"""Here's Your Evidence"": False Consensus in Public Twitter Discussions of COVID-19 Science","The COVID-19 pandemic brought about an extraordinary rate of scientific papers on the topic that were discussed among the general public, although often in biased or misinformed ways. In this paper, we present a mixed-methods analysis aimed at examining whether public discussions were commensurate with the scientific consensus on several COVID-19 issues. We estimate scientific consensus based on samples of abstracts from preprint servers and compare against the volume of public discussions on Twitter mentioning these papers. We find that anti-consensus posts and users, though overall less numerous than pro-consensus ones, are vastly over-represented on Twitter, thus producing a false consensus effect. This transpires with favorable papers being disproportionately amplified, along with an influx of new anti-consensus user sign-ups. Finally, our content analysis highlights that anti-consensus users misrepresent scientific findings or question scientists' integrity in their efforts to substantiate their claims. © 2024 Owner/Author.",Not About Sufficiency
Purchasing's contribution to supply chain emission reduction,"Does environmental purchasing and supplier management (EPSM) help to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the supply chain and, thereby, mitigate climate change? And, if so, under which conditions? Taking these two questions as a starting point, we hypothesize that heightened environmental protection efforts targeting the upstream value chain should lead to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the buying companies' supply chain. We continue to delineate three contingency factors that might affect the relationship between EPSM and supply chain GHG emissions: The power of the buying firm over supply chain partners, prior experience in EPSM, and materiality of environmental supply chain management in a certain industry. We collect longitudinal data from 260 companies and analyze them using hybrid panel data analysis. We find that the increase of EPSM leads to a significant reduction of the GHG emission intensity of buying firms’ supply chains and that this reduction is stronger for companies operating in industries where emission management is more material. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Sleep apnea and asymptomatic carotid stenosis: A complex interaction,"BACKGROUND: Carotid arteriosclerosis and sleep apnea are considered as independent risk factors for stroke. Whether sleep apnea mediates severity of carotid stenosis remains unclear. Sleep apnea comprises two pathophysiologic conditions: OSA and central sleep apnea (CSA). Although OSA results from upper airway occlusion, CSA refl ects enhanced ventilatory drive mainly due to carotid chemoreceptor dysfunction. METHODS: Ninety-six patients with asymptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis of ≤ 50% underwent polysomnography to (1) determine prevalence and severity of sleep apnea for different degrees of carotid stenosis and (2) analyze associations between OSA and CSA, carotid stenosis severity, and other arteriosclerotic risk factors. RESULTS: Sleep apnea was present in 68.8% of patients with carotid stenosis. Prevalence and severity of sleep apnea increased with degree of stenosis (P ≤.05) because of a rise in CSA (P ≤.01) but not in OSA. Sleep apnea (OR, 3.8; P ≤.03) and arterial hypertension (OR, 4.1; P ≤.05) were associated with stenosis severity, whereas diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, BMI, age, and sex were not. Stenosis severity was related to CSA (P ≤.06) but not to OSA. In addition, CSA but not OSA showed a strong association with arterial hypertension (OR, 12.5; P ≤.02) and diabetes (OR, 4.5; P ≤.04). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep apnea is highly prevalent in asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Further, it is associated with arteriosclerotic disease severity as well as presence of hypertension and diabetes. This vascular risk constellation seems to be more strongly connected with CSA than with OSA, possibly attributable to carotid chemoreceptor dysfunction. Because sleep apnea is well treatable, screening should be embedded in stroke prevention strategies. © 2015 American College of Chest Physicians.",Not About Sufficiency
The Political Ontology of Corporate Social Responsibility: Obscuring the Pluriverse in Place,"This article examines corporate social responsibility (CSR) through the lens of political ontology. We contend that CSR is not only a discursive mean of legitimization but an inherently ontological practice through which particular worlds become real. CSR enables the politics of place-making, connecting humans and nonhumans in specific territorial configurations in accordance with corporate needs and interests. We discuss three CSR mechanisms of singularization that create a particular corporate ontology in place: (1) community engagements that form ‘stakeholders’; (2) CSR standards and certifications that produce singular sustainable environments; and (3) CSR reporting that erases ontological conflicts and enables the singularized representation (of the environment and the community) to travel to other locations of the corporate world. We argue that these ontological CSR practices obscure the pluriverse of other world and place-making practices that would create different kinds of sustainabilities based on less extractive and non-corporate ways of being in place. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

New responses to mining extractivism in the Bolivian lowlands: The role and potential of indigenous cooperatives in Self-Managing Mining Resources,"The plurinational state of Bolivia serves as role model for the implementation of indigenous peoples’ participatory rights in extractive projects. However, recent cases reveal significant deficiencies in relation to budget, corruptive practices and lacking respect for indigenous structures, customs and traditions in Chiquitano territories. This article questions the legitimacy of said processes and demands alternatives to guarantee indigenous peoples’ genuine participation in projects which affect them. Apart from hydrocarbon extraction, other natural resource sectors remain to be explored and exploited; in this case mining extraction plays an essential role. Due to high levels of institutional empowerment of indigenous peoples’ organisations in the Chiquitano lands, corporate and state-led mining exploitation has encountered opposition and led to alternative management of resources in said territories. Indigenous cooperatives that self-manage mining resource use exemplify the latest response to state and corporate extractivism. At first view, participatory rights have been ruled out due to a sophisticated and widely recognised system of indigenous cooperative mining resource exploitation. However, the consistent presence of state and corporate actors, as well as other outside pressures, jeopardise the smooth functioning and role of such new actors in extractive industries. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Using system dynamics to assess the environmental management of cement industry in streaming data context,"The cement industry can be regarded as one of the major sources of anthropogenic air pollution. It uses a significant amount of energy while creating substantial amount of potentially health-threatening carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust particles. Hence, the cement industry can be regarded as a primary area for study in the development of green manufacturing. In this study, an urban cement factory is analyzed. The major contribution of the article is the development of a holistic approach to identify the variables impacting cement production and environmental factors creating air pollution in the area, a system dynamics model has been developed incorporating streaming data. To understand the effect of a cement factory on an urban area, some strategic level decisions are also analyzed with the study in order to reveal their impact on environment. The impact of cement production on air pollution cannot be evaluated separately from other air quality factors; therefore, the contribution of each factor has to be identified in order to understand the specific issues affecting a region. With the use of the model, future implications of various air quality factors on environmental sustainability can be assessed. According to the results, PM10 value, which is currently above the World Health Organization (WHO) air pollution critical level of 50 μg/m3 for 30% of the days in a year, will climb to more than 50% in 2023. Moreover, governments can also recognize the severe impacts of location selection for cement industries, unplanned and excessive building licensing, and uncontrolled immigration on environment of an urban living. Therefore, output of the study is potentially beneficial in guiding governmental decisions to ensure the sustainability of air quality. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change: Financing global forests: The Eliasch review,"An area of forest the size of England is cut down in the tropics each year. Forestry is responsible for a fifth of global carbon emissions - more than the entire world transport sector. Urgent action to tackle the loss of global forests needs to be a central part of any new international agreement on climate change. Climate Change: Financing Global Forests is an independent report commissioned by the UK Prime Minister to address this vitally important issue. It assesses the impact of global forest loss on climate change and explores the future role of forests in the international climate change framework, with particular emphasis on the role of international finance. It also looks at the economic and policy drivers of deforestation and describes the incentives required to ensure more sustainable production of agriculture and timber in order to meet global demand while reducing carbon emissions. The report draws on a wide range of international expertise and will have significant national, EU and international interest and influence. It includes new modelling and analysis of the global economic impact of continued deforestation and provides a comprehensive assessment of the opportunity and capacity-building costs of addressing the problem. It shows that the benefits of halving deforestation could amount to $3.7 trillion over the long term. However, if the international community does not act, the global economic cost of climate change caused by deforestation could amount to $12 trillion. In this comprehensive and detailed report, Johan Eliasch makes a clear and forceful case for forests to be included in international carbon trading mechanisms. He calls for the international community to support forest nations to halve deforestation by 2020 and to make the global forest sector carbon neutral by 2030. © Crown 2008.",Not About Sufficiency
Local governance of greenhouse gas emissions from air travel,"Global greenhouse gas emissions from air travel (GHG-A) are on the rise, and projections point towards a rapid growth in the coming decades. This study aims to examine how local government (cities), addresses GHG-A in their Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAP). To fulfil this aim, over 200 SEAPs were analysed focusing on three issues: (1) Treatment of GHG-A in local emissions inventories; (2) Policy initiatives within this domain; and (3) The cities’ perceptions of the conflicts of interests. Results showed that more than half of the cities acknowledge the challenge of GHG-A, around one third include GHG-A in their emissions inventories, and more than one quarter have initiated policy interventions. To categorise these interventions, we have added a mode ‘governing by agenda setting’ to an existing analytical framework, ‘Modes of governing’. With their authority limited to the local setting, this mode of governing is a common channel for cities to push changes at higher levels. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The Role of Internet of Things on Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure and Consumer Experience,"The drive for net-zero emission and global decarbonization spurred the need for a worldwide transition towards cleaner energy options. The fossil-fuel-dominated global transportation system is a target for these initiatives, accounting for 37% of recent carbon emissions. This has accelerated the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) into the global market to cut down carbon emissions and improve efficiency in the transportation sector. In the face of this growth, limitations in EV charging infrastructure still loom large amongst EV consumers. Resolving this bottleneck requires systematic approaches to ensure seamless operation and integration into the existing transport systems. This study examines the critical role of IoT in addressing the challenges of EV public charging through reviewing the literature to understand the inter-relation and highlighting its attendant impact on consumer experience. Findings show that while IoT serves as a strong tool to foster public interest through favorable public policy, its novel and innovative nature faces developmental challenges based on existing government policies that could hinder the interest of potential investors. Therefore, governments should consider evaluating existing policies and practices to ascertain their suitability for IoT adoption in EVs, ensuring that they do not constitute unintentional barriers. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

The devil in the detail: A practical guide on designing payments for environmental services,"Payments for environmental services (PES) have become a popular approach to address environmental degradation. However, evidence on its effectiveness is scarce and rather mixed. PES is not a panacea, but there are many cases where PES can be a promising tool. Yet, poor PES design translates into poor performance of the instrument. PES design is a complex task; the devil is in the detail of a number of PES design features. The purpose of this paper is to provide guidance in dealing with this complexity through a comprehensive review of PES design that is accessible to both academics and practitioners. Practitioner guidelines on deciding whether PES is the best approach and for selecting among alternative design features are presented. PES design has to start from a careful understanding of the specific ecological and socio-economic context. We now know a lot about which design features are best suited to which context. It is time to put these insights into practice. © 2016 S. Engel.",Not About Sufficiency

Markers for meat provenance and authenticity with an account of its defining factors and quality characteristics – a review,"Provenance is becoming increasingly important in meat supply chains as it lends products higher perceived quality. However, its precise definition and interpretation along with its associated characteristics factors have remained somewhat elusive. This review meticulously defines meat provenance while dissecting the essential factors and associated quality attributes that constitute its essence and are subsequently employed to establish pertinent markers for provenance. Meat provenance emerges as a multi-dimensional construct stemming from the adept management of a constellation of factors relating to geographical origin, farm production system, traceability, and authenticity. Through intricate interactions, these factors unveil innate originality that not only forges a distinct reputation but also imparts a unique typicity to the meat product. Gaining insights into a meat product's provenance becomes attainable by scrutinizing its pertinent composition and organoleptic quality traits. Trace elements and stable isotopes stand out as provenance markers, forging a direct connection to both geographical origin and dietary sources. While somewhat less direct in linkage, other markers such as plant biomarkers, fatty acid composition, pH levels, flavour and aromatic compounds along with organoleptic characteristics contribute to the overall understanding of provenance. Additionally, the identification of animal species and breeds serves as key markers, particularly in the context of protected geographical indications. The study findings are useful for the various stakeholders of how the information for meat provenance can be linked with intrinsic and extrinsic factors for meat quality and protecting the integrity of the supply chain with special reference to traceability and authenticity. © 2024 The Authors.

What difference does one course make? Assessing the impact of content-based instruction on students’ sustainability literacy,"Composition studies, with their cross-disciplinary role in students’ academic lives, can be essential in placing sustainability at the center of students’ learning. This research assessed the impact of content-based instruction on students’ sustainability literacy in a first-year composition course through a mixed-method design. In the quantitative part of this case study, 221 students in different classes of a first-year writing course in a higher education institute in Kuwait during the Fall term of 2022 were first given a pretest to determine their sustainability literacy levels. During a 6-week period, 121 students participated in the content-based instruction emphasizing sustainability, while 100 students comprised the control group, receiving curriculum without any emphasis on sustainability. The allocation of students in these two groups was random, determined solely by the classes they were enrolled in at the beginning of the semester. At the end of the semester, both the experimental and control groups were given a posttest to measure the impact of the instruction on their sustainability literacy levels. For the qualitative component, 60 students from the experimental group and 60 students from the control group were tasked with composing an essay identifying Kuwait’s major sustainability challenges and proposing corresponding solutions. The impact of content-based instruction on students’ literacy levels was measured by conducting a qualitative and quantitative content analysis on their writing. The results showed that the experimental group students made statistically significant improvements in their sustainable literacy levels, scored better on the posttest, used more sustainability terms and concepts, and identified more sustainability-related challenges and solutions in their essays. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Processes, antecedents and outcomes of dynamic capabilities","This study addresses the following research question: what do we know about dynamic capabilities based on existing empirical research? The paper is based on a systematic synthesising review of 142 articles. The analysis focuses on three areas: the processes of dynamic capability, its antecedents, and consequences. Through its detailed analysis of factors within each of the three aforementioned domains, the study provides researchers with a stronger basis on which to explicitly position their contributions in the DC literature. With regard to the processes of dynamic capabilities, empirical studies appear to employ a continuum of conceptualisations ranging from the very specific and identifiable to a generic set of knowledge-related processes. Additionally, the antecedents were found to be either internal or external to the firm, whereas the mechanisms by which dynamic capabilities lead to performance outcomes were found to be an unresolved issue in empirical research. The study identifies numerous avenues for further research concerning each of the three focus areas. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental governance for sustainable tourism development: Collaborative networks and organisation building in the Antalya tourism region,"For more than two decades the attainment of sustainable environmental quality and the protection of environmental assets have been at the forefront of central policy issues in global tourism development. Recently, it has been argued that collaborative and associative forms of governance among tourism companies and other related agents are growing in importance in the drive for sustainable and environmentally sensitive tourism. Despite the increasing number of debates on the role of networking on tourism they are not well supported by empirical studies, and still far from explain how such networks can contribute to the sustainable development of territories. This paper aims to contribute to previous literature by analysing together governance networks and literature on sustainable development, and by providing empirical findings that highlight the importance of governance networks in sustainable tourism development, the importance of different scales of collaborative governance networks and the role of organisation building for environmentally sustainable tourism development in Antalya. The paper offers analytical findings on the networks of environmental governance among different types of tourism organisations based on a company-level survey, which reveals an increase in local collaboration and self-help networking based on local concerns and endogenous dynamics among the different actors in tourism. Unfortunately, the findings show that environmental motivations fall far behind economic considerations in networking practices. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Development of a tool to analyse what resources are needed to implement a midwife-led care framework- the MIDWIZE conceptual framework,"Background: A midwife led care project targeting to decide what to do to achieve the SDG 2030 in maternal and child health, made a project team develop a tool to analyse what health care systems need, to adopt the MIDWIZE Conceptual Framework. The MIDWIZE Conceptual Framework wish to introduce the comprehensive midwifery-managed care provided women in Sweden to other countries, regions, and units where the framework is not fully applied. Methods: In order to determine what resource needs would have to be met to improve midwife led care, a tool was developed using Delphi study technique.

Conclusion: If at some future time, a single country, region or unit, might want to use the tool for quality improvement purpose of midwife led care, then the tool might aid in taking the first step to determine what resources might be required and what changes might be recommended as concerns policy at the clinical or educational institution level that are part of already existing health care structures. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Unraveling Temporal Shifts in Drivers and Ecosystem Services in a Large Lake Ecosystem,"Freshwaters provide essential ecosystem services (ESS) to humanity. However, most studies on freshwater ESS focus on a few services and ignore temporal changes in driver–ESS relationships. Using graph-based visualization, we examine co-occurrence patterns among drivers and among ESS across characteristic sociopolitical eras in the history of the largest shallow lake in Central and Eastern Europe (Lake Balaton, Hungary). We also evaluate driver–ESS relationships to characterize whether there are distinct clusters in these relationships, which can help to better understand how the different types of drivers influence provisioning, regulating, and cultural ESS and basic ecological functions of the lake. The analyses revealed that Lake Balaton suffers from several alteration effects, which are frequently cited as top threatening drivers in the decline of the ecological integrity and ESS of lake ecosystems. Of these, eutrophication, the spread of invasive species, fishery, urbanization processes, and, recently, the effects of climate change were the most important. Despite these threats, the lake still maintains diverse ESS, which are in complex relationship with each other and their drivers. We highlight that major past environmental changes substantially influence present and forecasted future patterns of driver–ESS relationships. Based on these results, we discuss the possibilities of management to ensure the sustainability of ESS Lake Balaton provides to society. Overall, this study underscores the complex influence of various drivers on freshwater ESS and emphasizes the importance of understanding temporal changes in human-modified lakes, considering societal, ecological, and economic factors comprehensively. © 2024 Tibor Erős and András Specziár.",Not About Sufficiency
Threshold effects of economic growth on water stress in the Eurozone,"This paper empirically examines the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis using a country’s water stress as an indicator of the pressure on renewable water resources. The sample consists of 9 European countries by covering the period 1995–2013. The paper adopts a panel threshold regression model which can predict the threshold level endogenously to analyze whether income per person has an impact on water stress. The empirical findings strongly demonstrate the existence of a threshold beyond which environmental pressures of GDP (real) per capita growth on renewable water resources tend to increase. The growth below the threshold levels has no statistically significant effect on water stress, while the growth rate above the threshold increases stress on water resources. The available empirical findings obtained, albeit limited, tend not to support the EKC hypothesis, which postulates an inverted-U-shaped relationship. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
"Delivering Green Streets: an exploration of changing perceptions and behaviours over time around bioswales in Portland, Oregon","Green Infrastructure (GI) is an increasingly popular means of dealing with flooding and water quality issues worldwide. This study examines public perceptions of, and behaviour around, bioswales, which are a popular GI facility in the United States. Bioswales are highly visible interventions requiring support from residents and policy-makers to be implemented and maintained appropriately. To understand how the residents' perceptions and attitudes might develop over time, we interviewed residents of Portland, Oregon, living near bioswales installed 1–2, 4–5 and 8–9 years ago, to determine awareness, understanding, and opinions about the devices. We found no consistent patterns across time periods, but did find common issues affecting residents' appreciation and acceptance: environmental attitudes, awareness and understanding of purpose and function, plant choice and maintenance, and mess and littering. It was apparent that increased public engagement, localised maintenance strategies, and possibly even customising facilities to meet residents' needs where feasible, might improve acceptance. © 2015 The Authors.

Impacts of conservation agriculture on soil structure and hydraulic properties of Malawian agricultural systems,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces climate change and food insecurity challenges, which require action to create resilient farming systems. Conservation agriculture (CA) is widely promoted across SSA but the impacts on key soil physical properties and functions such as soil structure and hydraulic properties that govern water storage and transmission are not well understood. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of long term (10–12 years) maize-based CA on soil hydraulic conductivity, water retention and pore size distribution. Root zone (0–30 cm depth) soil total porosity, pore size distribution, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and plant available water capacity (PAWC) of conventional maize monocrop farming systems (CP) are compared with those of adjacent CA trials with either sole maize or maize intercrop/rotation with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) or velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens L) in trial locations across central and southern Malawi. Results show that maize-based CA systems result in significant changes to soil hydraulic properties that correlate with improved soil structure. Results demonstrate increases of 5–15 % in total porosity, 0.06−0.22 cm/min in Ksat, 3–7 % in fine pores for water storage and 3–6 % in PAWC. Maize monocrop CA had similar effect on the hydraulic properties as the maize-legume associations. The values of Ksat for CA systems were within optimum levels (0.03–0.3 cm/min) whereas PAWC was below optimum (<20 %). There was no significant build-up in soil organic matter (OM) in the CA systems. The results lead to a recommendation that crop residue management should be more pro-actively pursued in CA guidance from agricultural extension staff to increase soil OM levels, increase yields and enhance climate resilience of sub-Saharan African farming systems. © 2020 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Role of Enterococcus in spreading antimicrobial resistance genes and its public health significance,"Enterococci are ubiquitous Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, catalase-negative, chemo-organotrophic facultative anaerobic bacteria recognized as a significant public health concern due to their role in disseminating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and disease-causing ability. Often found in various environments, such as the intestines of humans and other monogastric animals, green plants, silage, milk, and soil, it also regularly coexists alongside insects, birds, and other wildlife. Apart from coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus, it is the second most frequent cause of nosocomial bacteremia. It is a common bacterium that is naturally resistant to various antibiotics and can also develop resistance through point mutations and gene transfer. Thus, this review aims to explore the possible way Enterococci resist antibiotics through intrinsic mechanisms like altered penicillin-binding proteins and efflux pumps and acquired mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer of resistance genes, mutations, and biofilm formation, enabling their survival and clinical persistence and also provides an overview of Enterococci general characteristics and its health implications in both human and animals. This review highlights the pressing need for intense monitoring, strict infection control protocols, and the creation of innovative therapeutic approaches to lessen Enterococcus's impact on public health by combining data on its disease burden, epidemiology, and resistance mechanisms. A multidisciplinary strategy that integrates clinical care, microbiology, and public health initiatives is needed to address these issues. © 2025 Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Investigating the role of emissions deriving from user transport in sustainable refurbishment strategies for buildings relying on low-carbon energy.,"Refurbishing existing buildings constitutes a significant role in reducing emissions from the built environment. Their optimization demands time simultaneously to the urgency to fulfill the sustainable development goals 9, 11, 12, and 13. Therefore, actions taken at the municipal level are deterministic for future outcomes as many municipalities manage large building portfolios and thus hold significant mitigation potential. This paper investigates the role existing institutional buildings have for greenhouse gas abatement when the scope is expanded from building scale to include the urban environment. The aim is to determine the importance of considering the location of buildings when evaluating refurbishment strategies. There is a potential for a more significant reduction of emissions when including user transportation. The role of travel-induced emissions from users, visitors, and employees in institutional buildings is potentially more critical than refurbishment for buildings already operating on low-carbon energy. Parts of a previously developed theoretical framework are tested to aid a Norwegian municipality in its emissions abatement strategy. The study assesses the carbon emissions deriving from refurbishment and the location of an institutional building. Inventory data from building, transport routes, and transport modes are assessed with a case study approach, while generic data derives from literature. The result indicates the importance of addressing locations of institutional buildings within the urban form rather than optimizing separate entities. Truncation errors can offset the benefit of building optimization in areas dependent on low-carbon electricity if travel-induced emissions are omitted from the assessment. The framework reveals that it is better to build a new building at another location in some instances when transport-related emissions are reduced. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Highlighting the legislation concerning environmental protection and the promotion of sustainability within Indonesia,"Increased economic activities in Indonesia have significantly contaminated the environment and heightened the urgency of emphasizing legal, environmental rules and sustainability issues. To research Indonesian sustainability promotion and environmental protection, the present study examined various published sources, such as books, journal articles, and legislation. The data indicate that ""Environmental Law 2009"" governs most of Indonesia's environmental protection laws. Enforcing environmental regulations to make them more resistant to environmental contaminants and harmful substances. The government and legal authorities are still attempting to control environmental damage and dangerous situations. The country's residents are required to comply with environmental laws, the violation of which can result in penalties and punishments. The study's theoretical and practical value is more significant. In addition to stressing the need to update environmental legislation, the present study poses a question regarding their successful application. In addition, this research provides vital insights to the Indonesian government by focusing on the need to effectively monitor and supervise laws to generate favorable environmental protection concerns among Indonesians © 2022 International Journal of Criminal Justice Sciences.

Energy-efficient hybrid model predictive control of mobile refrigeration systems,"Efficiency and temperature compliance of last-mile refrigerated transport suffer from more severe disturbances than stationary applications. The significant energy expenditure and diminished quality or loss of goods have been tackled recently by improved hardware design. However, standard operating strategies only partly use accompanying intrinsic potential. This article introduces an enhanced model predictive control scheme for mobile refrigeration systems with secondary loop cooling units, aiming toward energy-efficient operation complying with temperature restrictions. Its real-time capable optimization covers operational flexibilities and dynamics (storage capacities, door openings, permissible temperature range) more extensively than state-of-the-art solutions. Experimental validation on a specifically designed test rig uses a representative test run with expected and unexpected door openings and a pull-down sequence. A proportional–integral and a standard predictive controller serve for comparison. Performance assessment shows energy savings of 16.4% and improvement in temperature compliance of 3.4% of the advanced predictive over the proportional–integral scheme. If door openings are known upfront, energy consumption decreases by even 29.6%. The standard predictive algorithm shows a similar energy performance but substantially declined temperature compliance as it cannot harness the entire flexibility. Thus, the proposed advanced strategy significantly contributes to more efficient refrigerated transport with reduced environmental impact and loss of goods. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"Multi-year load growth-based optimal planning of grid-connected microgrid considering long-term load demand forecasting: A case study of Tehran, Iran","Although much efforts have been devoted to the optimal design of the energy systems, there is a research gap about the multi-year load growth-based optimal planning of microgrids. This paper tries to fill such a research gap by developing a novel method for the optimal design of the grid-connected microgrids based on the long-term load demand forecasting. The multilayer perceptron artificial neural network is used for time-series load prediction. The impacts of the annual load growth are analyzed under various cases based on the consideration and determination methods of yearly load growth. The proposed method is applied to an actual microgrid in Tehran, Iran, using HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) software. The load modeling's capabilities of HOMER software, as a well-known software for the optimal design of energy systems, are used, which have received less attention. Since most existing research works in Iran focused on the off-grid operating mode, the study of an actual microgrid under grid-connected operating mode is one of the most contributions of this paper. The comparison of the obtained results and other available methods illustrate the impacts of the adequately precise estimation of annual load growth in the design of energy systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

The impact of artificial intelligence on green innovation efficiency: Moderating role of dynamic capability,"Environmental concerns have intensified the focus on sustainable innovation, with artificial intelligence (AI) emerging as a potential driver. However, the relationship between AI adoption and green innovation efficiency, particularly in emerging economies, remains unclear. This gap is crucial to address as it could reveal pathways to enhance sustainable development in rapidly growing markets. Here, we investigate how AI impacts green innovation efficiency in Chinese firms and examine the moderating effects of dynamic capabilities. Using panel data from 26,117 firm-year observations of Chinese A-share listed companies (2008–2022), we employ a novel text-based measure of AI adoption and assess green innovation efficiency through patent applications and R&D expenditure. Our findings reveal a significant positive relationship between AI adoption and green innovation efficiency, with dynamic capabilities enhancing this effect. The impact is stronger in non-state-owned and high-tech firms. These results demonstrate AI's potential as a catalyst for sustainable development and highlight the importance of organizational capabilities in realizing these benefits. Our study contributes to the evolving discourse on technology-driven sustainability, providing insights for both theory and practice in leveraging AI for green innovation in diverse economic contexts. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Normative Influences on Carbon Offset Behavior: Insights from Organic Farming Practices,"The production of green agricultural products and carbon sink compensation play a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Farmers’ behaviors are influenced by both social norms and personal norms. This study aims to explore how these norms shape farmers’ carbon sink compensation behaviors and to provide a theoretical basis for formulating effective policies and incentive mechanisms. A mixed-methods approach was adopted in this study, involving in-depth interviews with 13 agricultural workers and a survey of 409 individuals from China, Japan, and South Korea who are or were engaged in agriculture-related work. The results indicate that the activation of personal norms is primarily driven by economic costs rather than mere moral responsibility. Subjective norms serve as a significant mediator between personal norms and behavior. Social norms indirectly influence behavior through policy guidance and community support. Based on these findings, specific strategies to strengthen personal norms, optimize social norms, and improve policy incentives were proposed to enhance farmers’ willingness to participate in carbon sink compensation and promote sustainable low-carbon agriculture. To effectively promote farmers’ participation in carbon sink compensation, it is necessary to foster a positive social atmosphere at the community level while addressing farmers’ personal needs by enhancing environmental awareness and engagement through policy guidance and incentives. This study employs grounded theory, combining open, axial, and selective coding to thoroughly analyze the interaction between social and personal norms and their positive impact on farmers’ behavior, specifically regarding green agricultural product carbon sink compensation. Concrete policy and community-level pathways are proposed, providing clear guidance for both theory and practice. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment and Solutions to Food Waste at Congress Events: A Perspective of the MagNuS Project,"Addressing global food waste is a formidable challenge, requiring comprehensive efforts across the food supply chain, particularly in sectors prone to waste like HoReCa (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering). In MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, and Exhibitions) tourism, where gastronomy is a major attraction, overlooked meal services during working meetings contribute significantly to food waste. The MagNuS (Magnitude, Nutritional value, and Sustainability) project aims to assess and address food waste during conference events at the Valencia Conference Center in Spain. This study quantifies waste, categorizes it by food groups, estimates the potential number of individuals that could be fed with discarded food, and assesses energy and nutritional values. Across three events, 104.4 kg of food waste was documented, with cereals having the highest wastage, followed by legumes, fish, and others. Acknowledging potential underestimation due to reliance on cooked values, this study suggests using residues for vermicomposting or composting as sustainable waste management alternatives. These findings have implications for future initiatives, advocating diverse strategies to minimize food waste during congress events, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals. The MagNuS project contributes valuable insights to sustainable practices in MICE tourism, informing policies and operational decisions to reduce the environmental impact of food waste. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Nature of green advertisements in India: Are they greenwashed?,"This study performs a systematic content analysis of Indian English green print advertisements for the years 2010 and 2011 to verify if greenwashing is prevalent. Green advertisements were analysed based on four dimensions - (1) claim specificity, (2) greenwashing category, (3) incidence of associative claims and (4) presence of certifications. The results indicate that 51.7% of the claims were greenwashed and most of them were vague or ambiguous (37.7%). Most claims lacked specificity (67.0%) and image claims (60.0%) were widely used. Very few advertisements (3.3%) employed certifications to substantiate their claims. Interestingly, we also found that more than half of the image-related claims (55.8%) were categorized as misleading and highly specific claims were considered acceptable. We suggest that either the self-regulatory body - the Advertising Standards Council of India - or the legal regulatory framework accommodate well-defined provisions for regulating green claims in advertisements to curb greenwashing. © 2014 AMIC/SCI-NTU.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing and evaluating human-wildlife interactions for coexistence in shared landscapes,"Land sharing strategies for conciliating biodiversity conservation and human development usually do not consider the need to deal with human-wildlife conflicts, a type of human-wildlife interaction (HWI). To measure, monitor and solve conflicts is fundamental to achieve the coexistence necessary to promote environmental and social justice. Here, we present a new approach to assess and evaluate HWI aiming to inform decision-making regarding conflicts. We developed a method to classify and map events between humans and wildlife according to their nature, context and effect for both sides, distinguishing what an encounter (unidirectional) is and what an interaction (bidirectional effect) is. We typified and categorized HWI regarding their effects (positive or negative) for both sides. We compiled opportunistic observations from events between humans and wildlife in a shared landscape (campus Luiz de Queiroz, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil) from February 2022 until April 2024. We created a standardized table, performed descriptive statistics, used Minimum Bounding Geometry and Kernel Density, a simple method idealized to assist scientists and managers in different contexts. We had a total of 570 events, of which 297 were characterized as encounters and 273 as HWI. We recorded 42 animal taxa related to the events, of which 36 interacted with humans, being Nasua nasua, Cairina moschata, and Didelphis albiventris the most frequent ones. We identified 16 types of HWI that can occur in shared landscapes, 10 were categorized as Human-Wildlife Conflict, six as Unsustainable Use, four as Wildlife Damage and three as Convivencia, with some classified in more than one category. Among them, 10 occurred in our studied landscape with Unintentional Feeding being the most frequent one. We classified for the first time Unexpected Encounter, Accident Avoidance and Chase Away as HWI. Spaces of interaction were close to main buildings, central lawn and cats’ feeding sites. Our approach was useful to prioritize species and stakeholders, and to identify the large amount of food supply due to inadequate waste disposal and domestic cat feeding as the primary reason for most of HWI in our studied landscape. We recommend a comprehensive characterization of HWI to find interconnections and guide strategies for coexistence.

Social-ecological systems and the economics of nature: A Latin American perspective,"Today, based on the best scientific knowledge available, the main concerns regarding nature are the rampant ongoing destruction of Earth's ecosystems and the increasing global warming, which threaten the very survival of the human species. The main reason is that the current functioning of the complex global socioeconomic-ecological systems of the world is driving the planet, with high certainty, towards a completely unsustainable deterioration of its natural capital, biodiversity, and atmosphere. This is the result of the manipulation of the power mechanisms within the socioeconomic-ecological systems of every country by the small powerful elites with the purpose of appropriating for themselves the enormous economic rents generated by the overexploitation of the planet's natural resources and ecosystems. The monumental challenges of climate change, global warming, and nature deterioration are just the physical symptoms of the underlying unsustainable operation of the world's socioeconomic-ecological systems (or social-ecological systems as they are generally known today). On the other side, its social and economic symptoms are the billions of people living in poverty, without water, proper education, and health services, and the prevailing enormous inequities in the distribution of the world's wealth and income. In this chapter, using the Latin American experience, we analyze why this is happening and how enormously difficult is to change the current functioning of the system. We conclude with a rather pessimistic view about the possibility of meeting the challenges that all of us, as the human species, face today. Our only hope seems to be to use the opportunity offered by the modern communication technologies to inform the people of every country about the large risks and dangers we are all exposed to, and mobilize them to take effective control of the decision-making mechanisms that today are in the hands of the small powerful elites. This is obviously a monumental task. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Acetylsalicylic Acid–Primus Inter Pares in Pharmacology,"Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is one of the first drugs to be obtained by synthesis while being the most used. It has experienced the longest lasting commercial success and is considered the most popular drug of the modern era. ASA, originally used as an anti-inflammatory medication, nowadays is predominantly used as an antiplatelet agent for prophylaxis in cardiac patients. Many studies show that the benefits of using ASA far outweigh the potential risk of side effects. With particular emphasis on the possibility of ASA repositioning for new therapies, extending the indications for use beyond the diseases from the spectrum of atherosclerotic diseases, such as cancer, requires shifting the benefit–risk ratio, although very good, even more towards safety. Interesting activities consisting not only of changing the formulation but also modifying the drug molecule seem to be an important goal of the 21st century. ASA has become a milestone in two important fields: pharmacy and medicine. For a pharmacist, ASA is a long-used drug for which individual indications are practically maintained. For a doctor, acetylsalicylic acid is primarily an antiplatelet drug that saves millions of lives of patients with coronary heart disease or after a stroke. These facts do not exempt us from improving therapeutic methods based on ASA, the main goal of which is to reduce the risk of side effects, as well as to extend effectiveness. Modified acetylsalicylic acid molecules already seem to be a promising therapeutic option. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
WHAT'S GOING on in ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY STUDIES? RESEARCH FRONTS on ORGANISATIONAL KNOWLEDGE ABSORPTION,"Absorptive capacity (ACAP) is one of the most active themes in knowledge management literature.

Greenhouse gas emissions and reduction strategies for the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters,"In the context of climate change, it is crucial to examine the contributions of leading countries in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This research provides an overview of global GHG emissions from 1970 to 2022 for the world's most polluting countries: the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Iran, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia. These countries collectively account for approximately 64% of GHG emissions. The aim is to understand the impact of various economic sectors, such as industry, energy, agriculture, and transportation, on overall emissions. The analysis highlights the disparity in per capita emissions, with smaller but major oil-producing countries in the Persian Gulf, such as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, exhibiting high per capita emission levels, while more populated countries like the United States and South Korea show lower per capita values but significant total emission volumes. The study suggests that transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency in industry, promoting sustainable agriculture, reforestation, and electrifying transportation are key methods to achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG). Recommendations include encouraging technological innovations, implementing stringent government regulations and standards, and garnering active support for GHG reduction programs from governments, financial institutions, and the business community.

Decarbonization and social justice: The case for artisanal and small-scale mining,"Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is the primary livelihood for an estimated 40 million people in 80 countries and supports an additional 130 to 270 million people in mining communities. With the emergence of critical minerals necessary for decarbonization efforts, ASM has emerged as a crucial form of production to help meet global demand. Despite its importance, ASM miners and communities are routinely ostracized and pathologized. Rather than the cause of social deprivation, this article argues that ASM reflects broader social, political, and historical inequalities. We contend with four main arguments against ASM before elaborating on three reasons that ASM ought to be responsibly supported. These reasons are ASM's ability to enable economic redistribution, meet increased global demand for critical minerals, and advance social justice. Inclusive regulation and governance rather than exclusion and plausible deniability constitute the pathway to addressing attendant social and environmental challenges associated with ASM practices. This paper identifies pathways to inclusive regulation of ASM and proposes avenues for future research and interventions. Ultimately, ASM must be understood as a central social justice issue of our time, especially in the context of global decarbonization efforts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
What Can “Promoting Sustainable Development” at a University Mean?—A Guideline from KTH,"Many higher education institutions have a policy stating that they should “promote sustainable development” or something to the effect. In order to make this operational, a definition of the term and concept “sustainable development” could be useful. It may also be necessary to have a condition for when an enterprise, activity, or technology may be regarded as promoting sustainable development. At KTH, a process was started including discussions within top management, faculty, Ph.D. students and other staff resulting in a document formally approved by the President, which can be seen as a guidance document for interpreting “sustainable development”. The document also suggests the following criteria “An activity or technology can be considered to promote sustainable development if it clearly facilitates, in a life cycle perspective, the opportunities to achieve the global sustainable development goals of Agenda 2030.” This paper will describe the process as well as the final document. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Human polyomavirus BK: Potential role in cancer,"In human cancer, a role has been suggested for the human polyomavirus BK, primarily associated with tubulointerstitial nephritis and ureteric stenosis in renal transplant recipients, and with hemorrhagic cystitis in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. After the initial infection, primarily unapparent and without clinical signs, the virus disseminates and establishes a persistent infection in the urinary tract and lymphocytes. There is correlative evidence regarding potential role of polyomavirus BK in cancer. In fact, the BK virus (BKV) DNA (complete genome and/or subgenomic fragments containing the early region) is able to transform embryonic fibroblasts and cells cultured from kidney and brain of hamster, mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey. Nevertheless, transformation of human cells by BKV is inefficient and often abortive. Evidence supporting a possible role for BKV in human cancer has accumulated slowly in recent years, after the advent of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). BKV is known to commonly establish persistent infections in people and to be excreted in the urine by individuals who are asymptomatic, complicating the evaluation of its potential role in development of human cancer. Therefore, there is no certain proof that human polyomavirus BK directly causes the cancer in humans or acts as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of some types of human cancer. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate activism and its effects,"As activism including climate strikes have become a common occurrence around the world, it is important to consider the growth in climate change-focused activism and participation in social movements as a specific type of civic engagement. Although studies have analyzed climate activism and the climate movement, there is limited research that integrates it into the broader literature on civic engagement and which considers how these forms of engagement are related to specific climate outcomes. Here, we take a first step in understanding the material outcomes of these efforts. Specifically, we provide an overview of climate-related activism as a form of civic engagement, paying particular attention to the targets of this activism and its environmental outcomes in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Then, we focus on one of the most common tactics to gain momentum in recent years: the school strike, which has mobilized a growing number of participants around the world. We discuss how the Coronavirus pandemic has changed the climate movement with much activism moving online. We conclude by discussing the overall state of the knowledge about the outcomes of climate activism, as well as highlighting the need for careful research to measure its effects across scale.

Stuck in the Middle: Indigenous Interpreters and the Politics of Vernacularizing Prior Consultation in Peru,"This article argues that, although promoted as such, consultation practices are not intercultural dialogues, but struggles over the meaning of rights. Often overlooked, not only in politics, but also in the literature, these struggles put intermediaries—here, indigenous interpreters—in the position of carrying out much more than a semantic linguistic translation. Applying Sally Engle Merry's idea of vernacularization as the translation of rights to this new ambit, the political pressure on vernacularizers becomes clear: they are political actors in positions of brokerage with regard to shaping the meaning of rights. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in the Peruvian Amazon (2013–2014), I show that indigenous interpreters are “stuck in the middle” of political tensions and must simultaneously serve as brokers of knowledge, culture, and power as they bear the weight of an (inter)national tug-of-war between state and indigenous interpretations of prior consultation.

"SUDS, LID, BMPs, WSUD and more – The evolution and application of terminology surrounding urban drainage","The management of urban stormwater has become increasingly complex over recent decades. Consequently, terminology describing the principles and practices of urban drainage has become increasingly diverse, increasing the potential for confusion and miscommunication. This paper documents the history, scope, application and underlying principles of terms used in urban drainage and provides recommendations for clear communication of these principles. Terminology evolves locally and thus has an important role in establishing awareness and credibility of new approaches and contains nuanced understandings of the principles that are applied locally to address specific problems. Despite the understandable desire to have a ‘uniform set of terminology’, such a concept is flawed, ignoring the fact that terms reflect locally shared understanding. The local development of terminology thus has an important role in advancing the profession, but authors should facilitate communication between disciplines and between regions of the world, by being explicit and accurate in their application. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
"Trace Metals and Metalloids Present in Springwater of a Mining Area: Assessment Based on Chemical and Isotopic Data (δ2H, δ18O, 3H and 87Sr/86Sr)","The Taxco mining district is a well-known international producer of silver, jewelry, and precious metal handicrafts. Inappropriate disposal wastes from anthropogenic activities have been deteriorating the hydric resources and threatening the inhabitants’ health, since they use the springwater for human consumption and domestic activities. A multi-tracer approach combining measurements of hydrochemical data, trace elements, and isotopes δ2H, δ18O, 3H, and 87Sr/86Sr ratios was undertaken for 18 springwater samples. δ18O and δ2H indicate that the springwater comes from the rain and had experienced some degree of isotopic fractionation by atmospheric evaporation in some samples at lower altitudes. 3H values on the springwater showed the existence of old and new water. Three groups of springwater were identified according to age: local flow in rhyolites, intermediate flow through red beds to the outcrop point in sandstone and shales, and deep flow in greenschist. The results of this study show the utility of 87Sr/86Sr ratios in identifying the water–rock interactions and springwater flow paths, suggesting that more widespread use of the strontium isotopic fingerprint is warranted. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Promoting cocoa agroforestry under conditions of separated ownership of land and trees: Strengthening customary tenure institutions in Cameroon,"Formal and customary land tenure can encourage the adoption of sustainable land management practices. Yet, certain forms of customary land tenure can deter farmers from practicing agroforestry. One such example is the case of cocoa agroforestry in the Centre region of Cameroon, where cocoa orchards and the fruit trees that grow inside were traditionally inherited separately to different family members. While customary land owners hesitate to allow tree cultivation in their cocoa orchards as they are afraid of losing out while sharing their land, the tree owners would often like to expand the number of fruit trees, but lack the land to do so. This study assessed how various policy instruments can enhance the adoption of agroforestry in this context. Using the Coase theorem, we analyzed seven agroforestry systems of cocoa in association with Safout (Dacryodes edulis), Bush mango (Irvingia gabonensis) and/or Ndjansang (Ricinodendron heudelotii). Land sharing with fruit producers reduced the cocoa mono-croppers' farm income by 40-80%, while fruit producers benefited especially from the cultivation of Bush mango. According to our baseline Coase theorem results, cocoa agroforestry was socially efficient when 13-60 fruit trees/ha were planted, providing a positive net social benefit (248,753 to 3,394,829 FCFA/ha). The policy intervention scenarios (cocoa certification, payment from voluntary carbon projects and reform of the current customary tenure system) led to more fruit trees being planted (14-71 trees/ha) and increased the net social benefit (266,418 to 5,753,595 FCFA/ha). Both farmer categories gained in each of the scenarios, with the fruit producers benefiting more than the cocoa croppers. Among the investigated policy instruments, a land tenure reform inducing a fair revenue sharing proved to be the most effective in encouraging tree planting in cocoa farms.",Not About Sufficiency
Modeling Energy-Efficient Policies in Educational Buildings - A Literature Review,"This work focuses on a literature review that characterizes the most prominent lines of research on energy efficiency in educational buildings, including energy use intensity (EUI); the implementation of energy efficiency measurement; the results obtained by decreasing the EUI, energy consumption, and CO2emission; and the main relationships between energy consumption incidence variables.

Airport Economics,"This book provides a comprehensive guide to the economics of airports for all managers, regulators and educators within the aviation industry. Written by three renowned experts but made accessible and relevant for all those working within the industry, or aspiring to do so, it is the perfect entry point for learning about the underlying economics of airports as a crucial component of the air transport system. It explains the cost structures of airports and then relates these to how airports determine their charges. It explains how charges at different airports vary, whether this is due to different types of traffic, different input prices, ways of producing outputs or different levels of efficiency. Most airports are publicly owned or regulated, and there has been a trend towards privatisation. The book explains how airports have been regulated and assesses how well the regulatory structures have performed; it discusses the trend towards light-handed regulation and the reliance on competition where this exists. The book examines the problems of limited capacity at airports and how these are resolved through slots and charging systems, and the long-term solution of investment in airports—why it is controversial, and how it can be achieved effectively. It also considers the environmental impacts of airports and the issues these pose for managers, from the well-known problems of airport noise to the growing recognition of the impacts of air transport on climate change, and the roles airports play in mitigating these consequences. Written for airport and airline managers, regulators and students, this book will suit Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes on air transport management. © 2023 Peter Forsyth, Cathal Guiomard and Hans-Martin Niemeier.",Not About Sufficiency
Strategies to improve sustainability and offset the initial high capital expenditure of wave energy converters (WECs),"Wave energy is a nascent industry characterized by high capital costs, which impede technological development and industry expansion. For this reason, new strategies are required to improve sustainability, reduce cost and enable wave energy harnessing even in low energy seas. Six new strategies that can make commercialization of wave energy more appealing are studied. These comprise the integration of wave energy converters (WECs) in coastal defence; tourism; desalination technology; offshore aquaculture; energy security; and power plants. WECs can axe erosion by half, or even more, in sandy beaches by creating wave shadows in their lee. Therefore, an innovative way to offset WEC high initial capital expenditure is their incorporation in coastal defence, with the added benefit of electricity production. Also, WECs can directly provide pressurized seawater for reverse osmosis desalination plants, thus achieving significant energy, cost and environmental footprint reductions. The touristic trade could also benefit from educational and interpretive displays of the wave energy technology, whilst ecotourism opportunities may arise that could address tourism seasonality. Combined offshore aquaculture facilities with WECs would benefit for reduced installation, operation, and maintenance costs, as well as addressing fossil fuel dependence in aquaculture. Moreover, WECs could be used for mitigating the intermittency of established renewables (solar and wind) and advance their penetration; while a combined WEC- pump hydropower storage scheme could secure the energy supply in remote coastal areas and islands. Finally, WECs could directly supply cooling water intake structures, such as power plants, with the huge amounts of seawater they require for cooling purposes.

Achieving Responsible Management Learning Through Enriched Reciprocal Learning: Service-Learning Projects and the Role of Boundary Spanners,"Through its focus on deep and experiential learning, service-learning (SL) has become increasingly popular within the business school curriculum. While a reciprocal dimension has been foundational to SL, the reciprocality that is emphasized in business ethics literature is often on the relationship between the service experience and the academic content, rather than reciprocal learning of the service providers (students) and the recipients (organizations and their managers), let alone other stakeholders. Drawing on the notion of enriched reciprocal learning and on Aristotle’s typology of modes of knowing, we (1) revisit reciprocal learning by illustrating what kinds of learning occur for server and served in four SL projects from a project course in CSR, and (2) emphasize the role of boundary spanners from the project organizations in making this reciprocal learning happen and translating the various types of student learning in ways that are useful for their organizations. We find that when boundary spanners are particularly engaged at making the projects impactful, they contribute to making the learning experiences of students, managers (including themselves) and sometimes other stakeholders useful, multidimensional, and ultimately rewarding. © 2019, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

"Socio-technical modelling of UK energy transition under three global SSPs, with implications for IAM scenarios","The potential for using findings from socio-technical energy transition (STET) models in integrated assessment models (IAMs) has been proposed by several authors. A STET simulation model called TEMPEST, which includes the influence of societal and political factors in the UK’s energy transition, is used to model three of the global shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) at the national level. The SSP narratives are interpreted as inputs to TEMPEST, which drive scenario simulations to reflect varying societal preferences for mitigation measures, the level of political support for energy transition, and future economic and population trends. SSP1 and SSP2 come close to meeting UK net zero targets in 2050 but SSP5 does not reach net zero before 2080. An estimate of the total societal, political, and economic cost of scenarios indicates that while SSP1 achieves the best emissions reductions it also has the highest total cost, and SSP2 achieves the best ratio between rate of emissions reductions and total cost. Feasibility appears to be highest for SSP2 since it is the least different to historical precedent. Current UK government energy strategy is closer to the narrative in SSP5, however, which has the highest total cost and exceeds an estimated carbon budget by 32%. Three key TEMPEST findings are recommended for use in IAMs: (i) the uncertainty in emissions savings due to variability in political and societal support for energy transition, (ii) the influence of negative societal pushback to policies in achievement of expected policy outcomes, and (iii) the combined influence on energy service demand of disposable income, public willingness to participate, and user impacts from measures. © 2022 The Author(s).

Biocultural Community Protocols: Making Space for Indigenous and Local Cultures in Access and Benefit Sharing?,"This chapter addresses biocultural community protocols and their potential to enable IPLCs’ political and legal empowerment for community-based implementation of ABS provisions and development aspirations. The chapter concludes that the attributes of BCPs, including their outward-facing character to inform external stakeholders, their forward-looking or proactive potential to outline communities’ visions and their inward-looking potential to contribute to community building and the construction of collective action beyond the legal realm, mean that BCPs can contribute to creating legal spaces for ensuring IPLCs’ rights. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Charles Lawson, Michelle Rourke and Fran Humphries; individual chapters, the contributors",Not About Sufficiency
Reducing vehicle cold start emissions through carbon pricing: Evidence from Germany,"A large proportion of local pollutants originating from the road transport sector is generated during the so-called cold-start phase of driving, that is, the first few minutes of driving after a car has stood inactive for several hours. Drawing on data from the German Mobility Panel (MOP), this paper analyzes the factors that affect the frequency of cold starts, approximated here by the number of car tours that a household takes over the course of a week. Based on fixed-effects panel estimations, we find a negative and statistically significant effect of fuel prices on the number of tours and, hence, cold starts. Using our estimates to explore the spatial implications arising from fuel price increases stipulated under Germany's Climate Programme 2030, we find substantial impacts on the number of avoided tours even for modest fuel price increases of 20 cents per liter, particularly in urban areas. This outcome lends support to using carbon pricing as a means to improve both global climate and local air quality, pointing to a co-benefit of climate policy. © 2021 The Author(s).

Government- and Individual-Led Residential Relocation and Social Integration: Evidence from a Partially Shrinking City,"The partial shrinkage of a resource-based city has created a special paradigm of intraurban relocation. Partial shrinkage characterizes the loss of population in certain areas of a city due to resource depletion, industrial decline, and so forth, while other areas maintain growth. The outflow of population from partially shrinking areas is mostly resettled in other areas within the city. The social integration characteristics and impact mechanisms of intraurban relocation of residents in the context of partial shrinkage are the core issues in this study. This research takes Jiutai District of Changchun City, a typical partially shrinking city in Northeast China, as an example, and constructs a theoretical framework for the interaction between residents' relocation and social integration in partially shrinking cities. Based on the field research and interviews, the study uses spatial interpolation and path analysis to explore the characteristics of government-led and individual-led relocation behaviors, and tries to explain the influence mechanism of relocatees' social integration. The results show that the relocation behavior of residents presented a one-way divergent spatial feature with a shrinking core area as the center. In government-led relocation, most residents were relocated to resettled communities, and the timing of relocation was closely related to the timing of partial shrinkage. Individual-led residential relocation came later than government-led relocation, and the destination communities were relatively scattered. The overall level of social integration in individual-led relocation was higher than that in government-led relocation. The relocatees' age, job, income level directly affected the degree of social integration. Facilities closely related to residents' lives, such as education and culture, sports and entertainment, and government agencies all indirectly affected the level of social integration by influencing the residents' life satisfaction. Government behaviors play a key role in promoting the resettlement of residents in partially shrinking cities. However, it is still necessary to accelerate the social integration of relocatees through rebuilding facilities, improving social security, and other methods. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Not About Sufficiency
Economic Complexity for Sustainability : From the linear economy to the Circular Economy,"In a context in which environmental sustainability has been discussed as a need for global public policy, the forms of production have been put into debate. As one of the possible solutions to environmental problems, the circular economy highlights because it points towards the efficient use of the resources that are part of the value chain. In this sense, the objective of the article is to analyze the relationship between the Energy Transition Index and the Economic Complexity Index, considering that the energy transition can be categorized as one of the fundamental principles of the circular economy and, on the other hand, because economic complexity is a measure of knowledge that could enable the transition to cleaner energy. The results suggest that the most complex economies tend to venture into an environmentally friendly energy transition and, therefore, participate in the path of sustainability that the planet demands. The study is developed with the use of econometric techniques with data from a panel of 101 countries in the study period from 2012 to 2019. © 2023 ITMA.",Not About Sufficiency
"Effect of the application of water hyacinth compost/vermicompost on the growth and flowering of Crossandra undulaefolia, and on several vegetables","The impact of the application of compost/vermicompost obtained from water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes, Mart. Solms) on plants was assessed in terms of growth and flowering of the angiosperm crossandra (Crossandra undulaefolia). Overall nine morphological, size, and yield attributes were studied in crossandra saplings raised on water hyacinth compost or vermicompost as compared to the untreated saplings. Application of vermicompost led to statistically significant improvement in the growth and flowering of crossandra compared to the untreated plants. The impact of compost was also beneficial but a little less distinct than the positive impact of vermicompost. Qualitative studies were simultaneously conducted in five kitchen gardens owned by farmers near Pondicherry. In three of these locations water hyacinth vermicompost was applied - and no other fertilizer - for months to different species of vegetables. Water hyacinth compost was similarly applied in another two locations. In all the locations no adverse effect on any of the plant species was observed. We believe these studies would help in dispelling the apprehension of farmers that compost/vermicompost obtained form a pernicious weed like water hyacinth may have deleterious effect on other plants. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Sarcoptic mange and cheetah conservation in Masai Mara (Kenya): Epidemiological study in a wildlife/livestock system,"The sanitary control of threatened wild animals is of pivotal interest for their conservation. This task, however, is highly complex in wildlife/livestock systems. In this paper we report findings from a 2-year cross-sectional study of the epidemiology and attempted control of a Sarcoptes mite infestation in the threatened cheetah population in Masai Mara (Kenya), and discuss its interaction with sympatric wild (lion, wildebeest and Thomson's gazelle) and domestic (dog, cattle and sheep) animals. Sarcoptes scabiei was isolated from cheetahs, Thomson's gazelles, wildebeests, lions, cattle, goats and dogs; Psoroptes ovis, on the other hand, was only isolated from sheep. The prevalence study revealed 12·77% infection rates in cheetahs, 4·7% in dogs, 0·8% in Thomson's gazelles, 0·8% in sheep, 0·09% in cattle, and 0·09% in goats, while it opportunistically affected lions and wildebeest. Our study revealed that prevalence of Sarcoptes mite in cheetah population was not associated with the studied geographical blocks, animal sex or the presence of affected domestic animals. Cheetah infection with S. scabiei was associated with the climatic conditions (dry more than wet season) and the balancing between the total number of Thomson's gazelles and the prevalence of infected individuals. Apparently the high prevalence of mangy gazelles has a negative effect on cheetah; this negative effect was reduced when the number of healthy gazelles was increased. Treatment with injectable ivermectin of the clinically affected wild and domestic animals during the first year of this study was associated with much lower incidence of sarcoptic mange during the second year. © Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2012.",Not About Sufficiency
Selenium characterisation of the Portuguese bread-wheat archival collection,"Following the first morphological and taxonomic inventory of Portuguese wheat in 1933, an archival collection of representative varieties has been maintained, replanted and documented by the National Institute of Agricultural and Veterinary Research (INIAV), specifically by its division formerly known as the National Station for Plant Improvement (ENMP-Elvas, now INIAV-Elvas). The INIAV-Elvas wheat collection has always been an invaluable asset in studies of agronomic and/or genetic development of wheat lines, as well as providing a frame of reference for the nutritional evolution of Portuguese wheat crops. This work addresses the status of selenium (Se) in a pool of 46 accessions of bread wheat. Special attention is paid to the (low) levels of Se, for which wheat acts as an important source in human diets, with a view to curbing its deficiency in Portuguese cultivars through biofortification strategies. All grain samples were irradiated at the Portuguese Research Reactor, and total Se was determined through cyclic neutron activation analysis. Our results indicate that the best candidates for an improvement of Se contents in mature grains are cvv. Ideal, Ribeiro (b) and Ribeiro (a), and the worst candidates are cvv.

Environmental performance in countries worldwide: Determinant factors and multivariate analysis,"The aim of this study is to analyze the environmental performance of countries and the variables that can influence it. At the same time, we performed a multivariate analysis using the HJ-biplot, an exploratory method that looks for hidden patterns in the data, obtained from the usual singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix, to contextualize the countries grouped by geographical areas and the variables relating to environmental indicators included in the environmental performance index. The sample used comprises 149 countries of different geographic areas. The findings obtained from the empirical analysis emphasize that socioeconomic factors, such as economic wealth and education, as well as institutional factors represented by the style of public administration, in particular control of corruption, are determinant factors of environmental performance in the countries analyzed. In contrast, no effect on environmental performance was found for factors relating to the internal characteristics of a country or political factors. © 2014 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
A sustainable approach in deep hole drilling of Ti6Al4V: Effect of cryogenic cooling on hole parameters and its evaluation,"Deep-hole drilling (DHD) on Ti6Al4V has been a long-standing area of research for many researchers and manufacturers and has faced challenges such as frequent resharpening or complete replacement. DHD's benefits make it appropriate for applications such as gun barrels, fuel lines for fuel injectors, lubricant feeds for gears and crankshafts, and aircraft components such as landing gear. Cutting fluids (CFs) are used in machining to provide cooling and lubrication to the machining zone. Conventional CFs can cause respiratory and skin disorders in workers. The conventional coolant is replaced by cryogenic coolants, which are considered eco-friendly and overcome problems in the machining process. To investigate alternative cooling techniques in depth and to change the use of mineral-based CFs, this study investigated the performance of DHD under various cooling conditions, namely flood cooling, liquid carbon dioxide (LCO2), and liquid nitrogen (LN2). The output parameters considered in this study were hole wall temperature, surface roughness, tool wear, chip morphology, circularity, and cylindricity. The Taguchi L27 OA was used in the design of the experiments, and the COPRAS optimization technique was employed to optimize the machining parameters. The cryogenic coolants exhibited improved performance in all the machining parameters. The surface roughness was reduced using LN2; the reductions observed when compared with flood conditions, and LCO2 were in the range of 44–70 % and 30–60 %, respectively. The hole wall temperature recorded under flood conditions ranged from 37 to 34 °C, whereas the temperatures recorded in LCO2 and LN2 ranged from 72–55 °C and 50–45 °C, respectively. The optimal cutting conditions for performing DHD on Ti6Al4V were a spindle speed of 1100 rpm and a 25 mm/min feed rate under LN2 cooling condition. Furthermore, the study was extended by applying the Pugh matrix approach to assess the sustainability of selected cooling conditions. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was also conducted for the machining process, revealing insights into machining efficiency. The LN2 cooling condition outperformed the other cooling conditions, considering all the parameters contributing to sustainability. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Not About Sufficiency
Economics of small-scale biomass-to-X systems for advanced biofuel production – A case study from India,"The abundance of lignocellulosic biomass like agricultural and forest residues presents an opportunity to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and create local employment. However, the adoption of biomass-to-X (BtX) systems over fossil-fuel based systems is challenging due to cost constraints. The economics of BtX systems are impacted by the distributed biomass resources and low bulk densities, necessitating dependence on distributed small-scale systems. This work, using an Indian case study, explores small-scale [1.5 tonnes per hour (tph)] fixed-bed downdraft gasification BtX systems to produce hydrogen [biomass-to-hydrogen (BtH)] and methanol [biomass-to-methanol (BtM)]. The Minimum Selling Price (MSP) is evaluated at a 12% discount rate for single output (BtH and BtM), and hybrid [biomass-to-hydrogen and methanol (BtHM)] systems. The significance of the syngas composition, system capacity, capacity utilisation factor, discount rates, operating costs, and the source of energy inputs on the system economics are highlighted in the work. The system heat and electricity inputs have been assumed to be either sourced externally or produced internally through an additional air gasification unit or produced internally by diverting a part of the syngas obtained in the main gasification unit. The MSP of hydrogen and methanol are in the range of INR 263–310/kg ($3.19–3.75) and INR 71–132/kg ($0.86–1.60), respectively, depending on the energy input source. BtH systems could achieve economic parity with conventional systems if about 80% of its depreciable investment is funded through grants, or if the feedstock costs drop below INR 2.44/kg ($0.03/kg, or $1.73/GJ). BtM systems require multiple policy interventions to become economically viable. The cost of methanol could be reduced through BtHM hybrid systems by introducing hydrogen as an additional product. The growing global energy prices could make the BtX system a lucrative alternative soon. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
“Oltrepò BioDiverso” Project: Rural Network Development Supporting Local Apennine Economy,"The European Union, for many years, has been working to resolve disproportion between urban and rural areas, through policy interventions based on socio-economic and territorial conditions.

The main purpose of this study is to implement the local environmental biodiversity, transfer of knowledge and support the development of innovative agricultural, productive and research activities, to combat depopulation, isolation and stagnation of production of these marginal internal areas. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental risk assessment by using disability adjusted life year via constructing of a generalized linear model for morbidity estimation of waterborne pathogens,"The Environmental burden of disease (EBD) quantitatively evaluates the health impacts of pathogens by using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) method. The life loss due to morbidity is a general expression for the EBD outcome and, thus, morbidity analysis is indispensable. Considering the deficiency of previous morbidity analysis methods, the objective of this study was to construct a linear morbidity model by using a generalized linear model (GLM) as a template and introducing exposure dose, pathogen toxicity and human immunity as impact variables. Human experimental data were collected for model fitting, and the results indicated a good fit of the majority of the pathogen data. Consequently, two practical cases of water reuse in Xi'an Siyuan University (Case 1) and Lake Cui, Kunming (Case 2) were selected for model validation. Results for case 1 indicated the major EBD to be attributed to rotaviruses (5.57 × 10−7 DALYs, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.46 × 10−7-1.72 × 10−4 DALYs) and sprinkling irrigation (5.12 × 10−7 DALYs, 95% CI: 1.95 × 10−7-1.47 × 101 DALYs). Conversely, that for case 2 is mainly attributed to noroviruses (1.42 × 10−7 DALYs, 95% CI: 7.51 × 10−11-2.67 × 10−4 DALYs) and road flushing (1.62 × 10−7 DALYs, 95% CI: 1.16 × 10−7-2.67 × 10−4 DALYs). However, comparison with the suggested threshold of 10−6 DALYs indicated the EBDs for both cases are acceptable and, thus, water reuse is confirmed to be safe. The methodology for morbidity modelling proposed in this research can effectively compensate for missing data in DALY calculation and, thereby, help to optimize the process for EBD evaluation. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency

Environmental regulation: An enhancing or burden for social welfare and public health?,"Public health has been associated with environmental pollution and regulations. With the increasing awareness of environmental protection, the real effects of environmental regulations and mechanisms on public health remain uncertain. We develop a theoretical model of individual utility and investigate how environmental regulations affect public health from a social welfare perspective. By using the panel data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019, we find that environmental regulations positively influence public health. This positive effect is attributable to a boost in employment and an improvement in individual happiness. Furthermore, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that environmental regulations are more likely to affect groups with low education, middle-aged, living in eastern China and rural areas. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous effects of environmental regulation on health and offer a new perspective for policy-makers to balance social welfare with environmentally sustainable development. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Human capital development: Comparative analysis of BRICs,"The goal of this article is to conduct macrolevel analysis of human capital (HC) development strategies, pursued by four countries commonly referred to as BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China). This analysis is based on comparisons of macro indices of human capital and innovativeness of the economy and a review of related academic literature and government publications. The study results suggest that in terms of present human capital capacity Russia and Brazil are ahead of China and India. However, during the last decade the governments of the latter two countries have initiated impressive national programs of HC development, which include significant investment and targeted government regulation in such areas as primary and secondary education, vocational education and training, and higher education, especially in science and technology fields. Russia and Brazil have targeted programs in some of the above areas, but lack comprehensive longterm strategies, covering all the above areas and coordinating effort of various agencies and constituencies.

Promoting fluvial geomorphology to “live with rivers” in the Anthropocene Era,"Is geomorphology at the forefront of river management? The aims of this article are to explore potential answers to this question in terms of role, barriers, motivation and prospects for river management in the Anthropocene Era. We justify and execute our analysis, first through the growing interest in applied geomorphology and its role to improve river ecology and river policy design; second, by interviewing 24 specialists (researchers (i.e., biologists, ecologists, geomorphologists), engineers, river managers, planners) from different countries. We detected three barriers (academic, management and social) that prevent geomorphology from being more involved in river policy. We then propose three principles for living with rivers, considering geomorphology one of the key factors: (i) working across disciplinary frontiers, (ii) promoting integrated approaches, and (iii) improving fluvial education. Our conclusions look to rivers as natural and dynamic systems where geomorphological knowledge can improve the skills of engineers, ecologists and embrace a transdisciplinary approach. The new riverscape that we propose for the Anthropocene Era must be conceived using negotiation and discussion between an interconnected network of actors, regulators, scientists (sometimes), and natural and cultural values, where management objectives are raised and designed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"A comprehensive study on spatio-temporal distribution, health risk assessment and ozone formation potential of BTEX emissions in ambient air of Delhi, India","The hazardous air pollutants like benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) are considered as toxic because of their role in ozone formation and adverse effects on human health. Owing to this, the present study was carried out at six spatially distributed sites in Delhi from November 2017- June 2018. Activated charcoal tubes were used to collect samples of BTEX and were further analyzed using GC-FID. The minimum BTEX concentration was found at institutional site (9.94 μg/m 3 ) and maximum at roadside site (103.12 μg/m 3 ) with the average of 46.66 μg/m 3 . Also, the levels of BTEX were 1.18–1.74 times higher during rush hours as compared to non-rush hours. The high T/B ratio (2.26–3.41) observed is the indication of the traffic-originated sources of emission. The cancer risks calculated for benzene at probability 0.50 ranged as 1.29E-06 – 1.80E-05, whereas 4.09E-06 – 3.40E-05 at probability 0.95, which were higher than the acceptable value of 1.0E-06. The non-cancer health risks in terms of hazard index were observed less than unity i.e. within acceptable limit. The total ozone formation potential (OFP) was obtained as 207.51 ± 123.40 μg/m 3 with maximum potential by toluene. Such high levels of BTEX, cancer risks and OFP obtained in the study especially at roadside and connectivity hub are harmful for people residing near these areas, and also to large commuters, who are exposed to such emissions during travelling. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Weak and strong sustainability assessment in fisheries,"The present paper analyzes the suitability of weak and strong sustainability assessment in the context of fisheries management. This topic is a mainstream issue in the field of ecological economics, but its application to fisheries is rather unexplored, even though fisheries have been the focus of many pioneering studies related to natural resource management. An overview of the current debate in the topic together with an application of a multi-disciplinary technique designed to assess fisheries sustainability (Rapfish) allows the closing of this gap. This is achieved by looking to the potential trade-offs among the multiple dimensions of fisheries sustainability and by analyzing the role of critical thresholds in such an assessment. The study of the Basque trawl fisheries operating in the North East Atlantic in the period 1996-2005 shows that the utility of weak sustainability is limited to the comparison of sustainability between fisheries. In contrast it is found that it is the strong sustainability concept together with the definition of critical thresholds that provides management with the tools for improved management and policy within a fishery. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Tragedy of the commons, business growth and the fundamental sustainability problem","This paper reviews the major issues involved in Hardin's [1] tragedy of the commons, written over 44 years ago, and examines whether these issues are still relevant today. We assert that this model still provides important insight to aid in the solution to our global problems. In particular, we maintain that the underlying issues of growth against limits and bounded rationality are still not adequately recognized and addressed; this underlies many of the reasons for our unsustainable world. Examples from fisheries management are used to examine potential solutions and reveal weaknesses in current approaches. We show how our current, restricted mental models promote social injustice and blind us to developing sustainable solutions. Both the neo-liberal economic view of business that directly seeks growth and the new sustainable development view that indirectly supports growth are leading our global economy in the wrong direction and away from prosperity and sustainability. Current thinking has not realized Hardin's message that sustainability is of the class of no technology solution problems. We conclude with recommendations to radically advance a new world view and business paradigm. © 2012 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Contextualizing Scenarios to Explore Social-Ecological Futures: A Three Step Participatory Case Study for the Humboldt Current Upwelling System,"In the face of global change, the exploration of possible futures of marine social-ecological systems (MSES) becomes increasingly important. A variety of models aims at improving our understanding of ecosystem dynamics and complexities by assessing how systems react to internal and external drivers of change. However, these models are often built from a natural-science perspective through a reductionist and top-down knowledge production process that does not engage with the interests, concerns and knowledge of stakeholders. Our work explores different futures of the Peruvian MSES tied to the Humboldt Current Upwelling System (HCUS) through a sequential integrative participatory scenario process. The methodology used opens novel ways to explore, at different contextual levels, the uncertainties of the future and, in doing so, to include diverging world views of different actors. This approach implies a broader social processing of scientific projections about the future and encourages the articulation of different notions of sustainability. We thereby contribute to current scientific discussions on scenario planning in MSES by exploring potential futures through the analysis of narratives, a process that helps to identify plausible future development pathways that can inform different types of ecosystem modeling or policy making. © Copyright © 2020 Garteizgogeascoa, Kluger, Gonzales, Damonte and Flitner.",Not About Sufficiency
"Environmental Impacts of Rice Intensification Using High-Yielding Varieties: Evidence from Mazandaran, Iran","This article aims to show the potential contribution of high-yielding rice varieties to achieve sustainable intensification in paddy farming, by focusing on a developing country. A comparative life cycle assessment of traditional vs. high-yielding varieties is carried out by comparing the area-based and yield-based results. Primary data are collected through a farm survey (49 farms in the Mazandaran province, Iran; spring 2018). The results highlight that high-yielding varieties can reduce the yield-scaled impacts. However, area-scaled impacts are subject to increase for most impact categories. Statistically significant trade-offs involve global warming potential (+13% per ha and −28% per t in high-yielding varieties) and fossil resource depletion (+15% per ha and −26% per t in high-yielding varieties). Pesticide management is the most alarming practice. High-yielding varieties increase pesticide consumption and related toxicity impacts both per t and per ha. This study is a new contribution to the literature by improving and broadening the mainstream productivity perspective of current life cycle assessment research about crop varieties. The lessons learnt from this study suggest that the trade-offs between yield-scaled and area-scaled impacts should be carefully considered by decision-makers and policymakers, especially in developing countries that, like Iran, are affected by the overexploitation of natural resources. Targeted policy and the development of farmer education and advisory services are needed to create the enabling conditions for farm management changes, including conscious use of production inputs while avoiding heuristics. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
INTEGRATED URBAN TRANSPORT PLANNING IN THE ERA OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES,"Apart from the challenges related to vehicle technology, the wide-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in cities is linked to unprecedented opportunities and unforeseen impacts. These refer to mobility conditions, infrastructure, land use, wider socio-economic factors, energy use and environmental and climate effects. AVs may affect all these in positive or negative ways, promoting or obstructing the promotion of specific aspects of sustainable urban development. An integrated planning framework is needed to maximise the positive impacts and mitigate the negative ones. The main obstacle in the process of developing such a framework is the absence of empirical data and experience from the implementation of this emerging technology. This chapter outlines the possible impacts of AVs and discusses their uncertainty and trade-offs in relation to sustainable urban development. The categorisation of impacts derives from the priorities of the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The chapter also highlights the lack of data for the development of an evidence-based planning approach and suggests relevant recommendations to planners. In contrast to the current lack of data, the future abundance of Big Data collected by autonomous road transport systems is discussed in the context of future urban planning purposes. Based on the above, the chapter concludes by stressing the importance of an integrated urban transport planning approach that ensures a positive contribution of AVs to sustainable urban development. Hence, it offers valuable recommendations for policymakers in a range of fields. © 2024 by Nikolaos Gavanas.",Not About Sufficiency
Making the invisible count: Factors influencing small e-waste recycling intentions in the age of rapid electronics consumption,"The extent of e-waste is exponentially rising as the lifetime usage of electrical and electronic device items is getting shorter. In particular, household waste comprising small electrical and electronic items (small e-waste) is becoming an emerging yet substantive category of e-waste globally. Small e-waste is becoming a growing concern because of its presence across households, smaller size, stockpiling behaviour, improper disposal and inefficient management. Thus, it becomes interesting and worth examining to study the behavioural intention towards management of the small e-waste. This is more so in India given the contextual reality that India is the most populous and one of the fastest growing economies. In order to explore the phenomenon, the current study extends the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to empirically investigate the residents’ attitudes, intentions and behaviours, along with the extrinsic factors such as producers and government's intervention towards recycling of small e-waste. The main findings point out that attitude, subjective norms, producers intervention and perceived data security have significant positive influence on residents’ intention to recycle small e-waste. The study would make theoretical contribution to the literature on TPB. Furthermore, contribution would be made regarding the practical aspects of extended producer responsibility. This occurs because of identifying the significant factors influencing Indian residents’ small e-waste recycling behavioural intention. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Focus rural land policies on ecosystem services, not agriculture","Land policies around the world tend to focus on support for agricultural output.

Did carbon dioxide emission regulations inhibit investments? A provincial panel analysis of China,"Investments, especially fixed asset investments, greatly affect carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. When investments are concentrated in regions with high CO2 emissions and high fossil energy consumption, the CO2 emission reduction targets in these areas are difficult to reach in the short term, and the cost of CO2 emission abatement is high. The current CO2 emission regulations focus on existing production activities and consumption behaviors. However, whether an investment, which may affect CO2 emissions in the long term, is effectively inhibited by CO2 emission regulations has not been investigated in previous studies. Using panel data from 30 provinces in China between 2003 and 2012, we tested whether the amount of provincial investment was constrained or promoted by the provincial CO2 emission regulations by creating a panel model with provincial samples. The results revealed that CO2 emission regulations did not inhibit the growth of an investment, but they stimulated investments to varying degrees in different provinces. A relatively positive result is that provinces with stronger CO2 emission regulations exhibited a relatively small contribution to investment promotion, while provinces with weaker CO2 reduction policies demonstrated a relatively large contribution to investment growth. We also found that investment was correlated with the growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the northeastern and western provinces. Finally, we proposed policy implications based on the utilization of policy tools from the perspectives of investment, energy structure, and local protectionism. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Food and Environmental Virology: Use of Passive Sampling to Characterize the Presence of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Viruses in Wastewater,"Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 leads to a renaissance of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as additional tool to follow epidemiological trends in the catchment of treatment plants. As alternative to the most commonly used composite samples in surveillance programs, passive sampling is increasingly studied. However, the many sorbent materials in different reports hamper the comparison of results and a standardization of the approach is necessary. Here, we compared different cost-effective sorption materials (cheesecloths, gauze swabs, electronegative filters, glass wool, and tampons) in torpedo-style housings with composite samples. Despite a remarkable variability of the concentration of SARS-CoV-2-specific gene copies, analysis of parallel-deposited passive samplers in the sewer demonstrated highest rate of positive samples and highest number of copies by using cheesecloths. Using this sorption material, monitoring of wastewater of three small catchments in the City of Dresden resulted in a rate of positive samples of 50% in comparison with composite samples (98%). During the investigation period, incidence of reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the catchments ranged between 16 and 170 per 100,000 persons and showed no correlation with the measured concentrations of E gene in wastewater. In contrast, constantly higher numbers of gene copies in passive vs. composite samples were found for human adenovirus and crAssphage indicating strong differences of efficacy of methods concerning the species investigated. Influenza virus A and B were sporadically detected allowing no comparison of results. The study contributes to the further understanding of possibilities and limits of passive sampling approaches in WBE. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
"Climate and security: Evidence, emerging risks, and a new agenda","There are diverse linkages between climate change and security including risks of conflict, national security concerns, critical national infrastructure, geo-political rivalries and threats to human security. We review analysis of these domains from primary research and from policy prescriptive and advocacy sources. We conclude that much analysis over-emphasises deterministic mechanisms between climate change and security. Yet the climate-security nexus is more complex than it appears and requires attention from across the social sciences. We review the robustness of present social sciences analysis in assessing the causes and consequences of climate change on human security, and identify new areas of research. These new areas include the need to analyse the absence of conflict in the face of climate risks and the need to expand the range of issues accounted for in analysis of climate and security including the impacts of mitigation response on domains of security. We argue for the necessity of robust theories that explain causality and associations, and the need to include theories of asymmetric power relations in explaining security dimensions. We also highlight the dilemmas of how observations and historical analysis of climate and security dimensions may be limited as the climate changes in ways that present regions with unprecedented climate risks. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of changes in temperature and precipitation as climate factors that influence the spread of climate-related diseases: a systematic review,"Climate change is an environmental problem that leads to extreme flood and drought events in various geographical regions. The review seeks to establish pertinent issues around changes in temperature and precipitation as climate factors which have been under-researched. It will be established whether the spread of disease and other human risks have been reported under various temperature and precipitation levels; whether sound adaptation measures are in place; communities are provided with awareness toward adaptation methods; and educated on how to deal with mental problems and anxiety caused by climate change. The review has established that little research has modeled variation in human characteristics like age group differences and health fluctuations with climate change, under a wide spectrum of temperature and precipitation. Southern African countries’ research also lacks projection of climate change impacts and risk distribution maps for vector borne diseases under RCP2.6, RCP4.4, RCP6.0 and RCP8.0. In addition, there has been bias in previous studies regarding a combination of temperature and precipitation, as well as non-climatic factors that may be favorable for spread and transmission of specified VBDs. Recommendations from this review could be adopted by countries in order to protect communities’ health. © 2024 The African Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers.",Not About Sufficiency
Application of the precautionary principle to taxa of uncertain status: The case of the Bellinger River turtle,"Legislative and regulatory frameworks for conserving biodiversity often focus on the species as a fundamental unit for protection. In cases where the taxonomic or conservation status of a species is uncertain, the precautionary principle may be invoked in listing suspected but as yet undescribed taxa as vulnerable or endangered. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the taxonomic status of what has been regarded as a distinctive but as yet undescribed species of freshwater turtle, declared endangered in the Action Plan for Australian Reptiles and vulnerable in the schedules of state and federal conservation acts. Using mitochondrial sequence variation, we show that the Bellinger River turtle is an unremarkable population of a common and widespread species, Emydura macquarii. In addition, we present evidence suggesting that it may have been recently introduced to, or may be a recent invader of, the Bellinger River (New South Wales, Australia) where it may come to compete with Myuchelys georgesi, an endemic found only in the Bellinger River. Our study illustrates the need to couple fundamental research with on-ground action early in an adaptive management context, particularly where taxonomic status of the target species is uncertain. Short-term cost savings of failing to do so may come to be greatly exceeded by longer-term opportunity loss where conservation dollars are limited. © Inter-Research 2011.",Not About Sufficiency
The advantages of owning a palaeolithic dog,"Pleistocene wolves are the single ancestors of dogs. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the initial steps in the domestication process of the wolf. We favour a human-initiated model in which wolf pups were adopted by Upper Palaeolithic people. Captive wolf pups could then have been raised at Upper Palaeolithic camps for several motives and it is likely some pups, the most docile and less fearsome ones, could have survived until adulthood and reproduced, permitting a new selection on every next generation, ultimately leading to Palaeolithic dogs. We propose that the initial beginning of the wolf domestication process was linked with the cultural traditions of some Upper Palaeolithic societies. We review here the close relationships that existed between prehistoric humans and the first domestic canids. It can be expected that the presence of Palaeolithic dogs at camp sites and gathering localities conveyed some selective advantage to their owners. The Palaeolithic dogs could have been very useful as guards, by warning of the approach of predators or unfamiliar humans through vocalisations; this would have provided protection to the inhabitants of the camps and to the gatherers away from the settlements when accompanied by Palaeolithic dogs. Furthermore, Palaeolithic dogs could potentially have been suitable to increase the level of mobility of their people, helping with the transportation of firewood, lithics, gear, body parts of prey, etc. In addition, the anthropogenic manipulations of several Palaeolithic dog skulls, such as the perforation of the brain case or the insertion of objects in the mouth cavity, testify of the special social standing these canids held within some Upper Palaeolithic societies. © the individual authors and Archaeopress 2023.

Effectiveness of protected areas in the Caucasus Mountains in preventing rangeland degradation,"As land use intensifies globally, it increasingly exerts pressure on protected areas. Despite open, nonforested landscapes comprising up to 40% of protected areas globally, assessments have predominately focused on forests, overlooking the major pressures on rangelands from livestock overgrazing and land conversion. Across the southern Caucasus, a biodiversity hotspot extending over 5 countries, we conducted a broadscale assessment of the extent to which protected areas mitigate land-use pressure on rangelands in them. Using satellite-based indicators of rangeland vegetation greenness from 1988 to 2019, we assessed the effectiveness of 52 protected areas. This period encompassed the collapse of the Soviet Union, economic crises, armed conflicts, and a major expansion of the protected area network. We applied matching statistics combined with fixed-effects panel regressions to quantify the effectiveness of protected areas in curbing degradation as indicated by green vegetation loss. Protected areas were, overall, largely ineffective. Green vegetation loss was higher inside than outside protected areas in most countries, except for Georgia and Turkey. Multiple-use protected areas (IUCN categories IV–VI) were even more ineffective in reducing vegetation loss than strictly protected areas (I & II), highlighting the need for better aligning conservation and development targets in these areas. Mapping >10,000 livestock corrals from satellite images showed that protected areas with a relatively high density of livestock corrals had markedly high green vegetation loss. Ineffectiveness appeared driven by livestock overgrazing. Our key finding was that protected areas did not curb rangeland degradation in the Caucasus. This situation is likely emblematic of many regions worldwide, which highlights the need to incorporate degradation and nonforest ecosystems into effectiveness assessments. © 2024 The Author(s).

Fabrication and characterization of chitosan/gelatin scaffold with bioactive glass reinforcement using PRP to regenerate bone tissue,"In this study, the purpose of this study was to fabricate a porous nanocomposite chitosan-gelatin along with different weight percentages of bioglass using the freeze-drying method. In this study, the Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) technique was used for the first time to strengthen bone grafting. Tensile strength, elastic modulus, and percentage of porosity were evaluated. Also, the samples were examined in simulated body fluid (SBF) and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to study bone growth and bone dissolution rate. Also, the porosity percentage was about 54% with 39% bone-like apatite formation for the third sample. The early absorption and late absorption rate of bone substitutes and the main volume of bone substitutes can be used for orthopedic approaches. The specimen were abalysized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique. Porous membranes were examined under SEM tools to estimate pore size and morphological behavior. The pore diameter can be controlled by adjusting the ethanol percentage in the range of 10-30 micrometers. The formation of needle bioglass crystals on the membrane surface after 7 days of immersion in biological solution was also evaluated using SEM images. In general, the third sample can be used to repair the bone tissue of the knee with the PRP technique. © 2022 International Journal of Health Sciences. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the paradigm shift towards sustainability: A systematic literature review on circular economy and eco-innovation,"Amidst the adverse effects of the existing linear model on economic, social, and environmental aspects, the circular economy has emerged as a more sustainable alternative for economic growth and environmental sustainability. Further, the increasing significance of the circular economy as a means to achieve sustainability has prompted researchers to suggest various approaches. In this study, we employed a systematic literature review to present a unified perspective on the concept of circular economy and emphasize the connection of it with eco-innovation. We found that the last three years have witnessed a sudden rise in the publications related to a circular economy, stating the rise in interest of researchers towards a circular economy. While in its nascent phase of execution, much research has been carried out on the importance of adopting a circular economy for achieving sustainability. However, most researchers have failed to explore the contribution of the circular economy in the UN sustainable development strategies (SDGs) and the role of eco-innovation in the circular economy. Therefore, this research is novel, and we explored the role of circular economy and eco-innovation towards sustainability through a systematic literature review. This research indicated that while developed countries have shifted to a circular economy, developing countries need to transition to a circular economy for sustainable benefits. A correlation was also found between the circular economy and some SDGs. The results emphasized that the incorporation of eco-innovations can help in mitigating the environmental consequences of production and consumption activities. It also sheds light on notable instances of eco-innovations that have been developed for deployment in the circular economy. This research will be helpful to industries, universities, and other major sections of society in developing circular economy practices in their core processes and ensuring the attainment of sustainable development goals. © 2024 the Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

The commons: an innovative basis for transnational environmental law in the era of Anthropocene? The case of Latin America,"The purpose of the present paper is to find a theoretical-legal basis for the recent innovative decisions by the Colombian Supreme Court of Justice and by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the issue of environmental justice. In order to pursue this aim, we will proceed as follows. First of all (Par. 1), we will outline the general framework in which the considered case law are situated. The contemporary environmental degradation of our planet – especially of the so-called (environmental) commons – caused by human activity has led to a new term coined to describe a “human-made” geological era: the Anthropocene. The increasing detrimental conditions of most natural ecosystems has elicited the birth in recent decades of a new category of fundamental human rights – strictly coupled with the natural environment – the so-called “environmental rights”. In the central part (Par. 2 and 3) we will illustrate and comment on the content of the judicial decisions by the Supreme Court of Colombia (STC 4360-2018) and by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Notably, we will try to underline the most innovative shifts that these judgements have brought in the theme of environmental justice. The following part (Par. 4) will deal with the question: what is the theoretical-legal basis for the innovative case-law set out earlier? We argue that this basis actually already exists, and it can be found in the theory of the environmental commons (henceforth, simply “commons”). To do this, we will first identify five core points characterising the new environmental justice approach of the considered jurisprudence. After this, we will show how these five points are almost completely mirrored by the main features of the commons, so that they can offer – we believe – a valid theoretical-legal basis for this innovative case law. Lastly (Par. 5), we will consider two theoretical objections, that can legitimately arise, and how we propose to overcome them. © 2019 Sciendo. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Cultural Economy: Achievements, Divergences, Future Prospects","This paper reflects on two decades' scholarship in geography on cultural economy, assessing strides made against some of the expectations of early proponents. Cultural economy continues to be a polysemic term. In some quarters, it refers to a type of economic geography into which matters of 'culture' are absorbed. This work frequently focuses on the empirics of the so-called 'cultural and creative industries'. Others see cultural economic research as an opportunity to move beyond the epistemological constraints of 'culture' and 'economy', questioning their status as foundational categories. This latter approach has been used in a broader set of empirical projects encompassing technology, knowledge, and society. Contrasting threads of cultural economic research have helpfully moved geographical scholarship beyond paradigmatic limitations, but jostle somewhat uncomfortably within existing (and increasingly specialised) disciplinary and subdisciplinary fields. The risk is that by questioning the categorical underpinnings of much specialised research, cultural economy struggles to 'belong' in the increasingly coded and compartmentalised university setting. I conclude with a discussion of future prospects. Some measure of vitality could be achieved through incorporation of a cultural economy perspective into the pressing issues of climate change, human sustenance, and urban infrastructure planning. These are issues for which the polysemy of cultural economy could prove constructive, transcending technocentric market 'fixes' and bland assumptions about how best to 'green' our cities - promoting instead ethnographic interrogations of how humans access, use, exchange, and value financial and material resources as moral and social beings. © 2011 The Author.

Affluence and influence: Economic inequality and political power in America,"Can a country be a democracy if its government only responds to the preferences of the rich? In an ideal democracy, all citizens should have equal influence on government policy--but as this book demonstrates, America's policymakers respond almost exclusively to the preferences of the economically advantaged. Affluence and Influence definitively explores how political inequality in the United States has evolved over the last several decades and how this growing disparity has been shaped by interest groups, parties, and elections. With sharp analysis and an impressive range of data, Martin Gilens looks at thousands of proposed policy changes, and the degree of support for each among poor, middle-class, and affluent Americans. His findings are staggering: when preferences of low- or middle-income Americans diverge from those of the affluent, there is virtually no relationship between policy outcomes and the desires of less advantaged groups. In contrast, affluent Americans' preferences exhibit a substantial relationship with policy outcomes whether their preferences are shared by lower-income groups or not. Gilens shows that representational inequality is spread widely across different policy domains and time periods. Yet Gilens also shows that under specific circumstances the preferences of the middle class and, to a lesser extent, the poor, do seem to matter. In particular, impending elections--especially presidential elections--and an even partisan division in Congress mitigate representational inequality and boost responsiveness to the preferences of the broader public. At a time when economic and political inequality in the United States only continues to rise, Affluence and Influence raises important questions about whether American democracy is truly responding to the needs of all its citizens. © 2012 by Princeton University Press and the Russell Sage Foundation.

"A review of marine stressors impacting Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, with an assessment of the major threats to English stocks","Atlantic salmon Salmo salar is a socio-economically important anadromous fish species that has suffered synchronous population declines around the North Atlantic over the last five decades. Reduced marine survival has been implicated as a key driver of the declines, yet the relative importance of different stressors causing mortality at sea is not well understood. This review presents a synopsis of the principal stressors impacting Atlantic salmon in estuarine and marine environments. It also applies a semi-quantitative 2-D classification system to assess the relative effects of these stressors on English salmon stocks and their likely development over the next decade. Climate change and predation were identified as the biggest threats at present and over the next decade. Poor water quality and bycatch were classified as relatively high impact stressors, but with a lower likelihood of becoming more prevalent in the future due to available mitigation measures. Other, less influential, stressors included tidal barrages, artificial light at night, impingement in power-station cooling waters and thermal discharges, pile-driving noise pollution, invasive non-native species, electromagnetic fields, salmon mariculture, and tidal lagoons. Salmon fisheries exploitation was not regarded as an important stressor currently because effective exploitation rate controls have been implemented to substantially reduce fishing pressure. Future research priorities include addressing knowledge gaps on expanding stressor impacts from climate change, predation, renewable energy developments, and artificial light at night. Local management actions directed towards improving freshwater and estuarine habitats to maximise ecosystem resilience to stressors and minimise their cumulative impacts are recommended. © 2022, Crown.",Not About Sufficiency
"Organizational change and everyday health system resilience: Lessons from Cape Town, South Africa","This paper reports a study from Cape Town, South Africa, that tested an existing framework of everyday health system resilience (EHSR) in examining how a local health system responded to the chronic stress of large-scale organizational change. Over two years (2017–18), through cycles of action-learning involving local managers and researchers, the authorial team tracked the stress experienced, the response strategies implemented and their consequences. The paper considers how a set of micro-governance interventions and mid-level leadership practices supported responses to stress whilst nurturing organizational resilience capacities. Data collection involved observation, in-depth interviews and analysis of meeting minutes and secondary data. Data analysis included iterative synthesis and validation processes. The paper offers five sets of insights that add to the limited empirical health system resilience literature: 1) resilience is a process not an end-state; 2) resilience strategies are deployed in combination rather than linearly, after each other; 3) three sets of organizational resilience capacities work together to support collective problem-solving and action entailed in EHSR; 4) these capacities can be nurtured by mid-level managers’ leadership practices and simple adaptations of routine organizational processes, such as meetings; 5) central level actions must nurture EHSR by enabling the leadership practices and micro-governance processes entailed in everyday decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Household debt: The missing link between inequality and secular stagnation,"How do inequality and growth evolve in the long run and why? We address this question by analyzing the interplay between household debt, growth and inequality within a monetary, stock-flow consistent framework. We first consider a Goodwin–Keen model where household consumption, rather than investment by firms, is the key behavioural driver for the dynamics of the economy. Whenever consumption exceeds current income, households can borrow from the banking sector. The resulting three dimensional dynamical system for wage share, employment rate, and household debt exhibits the characteristic asymptotic equilibria of the original Keen model, namely the analogue of Solow's balanced-growth path, where all state variables converge to an interior point, in addition to deflationary equilibria with explosive debt and collapsing employment. We then extend this set-up by separating the household sector into workers and investors, obtaining a four-dimensional system with analogous types of asymptotic behaviour. Our main result is that long-run increasing inequality between these two classes of households occurs if and only if the system approaches one of the equilibria with unbounded debt ratios. More specifically, we find that one essential channel of increased inequality is the wealth transfer from workers to investors due to interest paid on debt from the former to the latter. Finally, when properly rewritten, the celebrated inequality r > g turns out to be a necessary condition for the asymptotic stability of long-run debt-deflation. Our findings shed new light on the relationships between fairness and efficiency, and have implications for public economic policy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Land degradation neutrality: Will Africa achieve it? Institutional solutions to land degradation and restoration in Africa,"Land has gained stature as a natural resource to be protected since the 2012 Rio+20 Summit. The decision to ""strive to achieve a land-degradation neutral world in the context of sustainable development"" (United Nations 2012, p. 54), along with the understanding that ""this should act to catalyze financial resources from a range of public and private sources,"" served as the foundation for further discussions about land. In 2015, land was included in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development as target 15.3 of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15). Land has been defined as a global strategic resource that is under stress due to rapidly growing demand for biomass production to accommodate increased food and energy consumption and population dynamics. More than half of the additional two billion people who will live on Earth by 2050 will be born in Africa. The population of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is predicted to grow from 900 million to about 1.4 billion by 2030. However, the region leads the world in poverty, hunger and food insecurity, youth unemployment, agricultural vulnerability to climate change, land degradation, resource-based conflicts, and migrations leading to economic, social, and political instability. Africa has the resources to respond to the exploding global demand for food, energy, and water. The region accounts for 60 % of the world’s uncultivated arable land and more than one third (715 million ha) of the world’s degraded land with potential for restoration. It is already a global hotspot for successful land restoration projects due to innovations in technology and social engineering, which mostly occur at a local level. The institutional aspects relating to the establishment, management and support of restoration projects, however, are one of the major obstacles to scaling up these projects. Achieving land degradation neutrality will be key for the economic, social, and environmental transformations SSA needs to accomplish, given the challenges and potentials of the region, such as climate change, population dynamics, and globalization. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",Not About Sufficiency
"Increased bioavailability of mercury in the lagoons of Lomé, Togo: The possible role of dredging","Surface sediments of the lagoons of Lomé, Togo, were analyzed for mercury, methylmercury, and trace elements. Concentrations were greater than typical for natural lagoon sediments, and with greater variability within the Eastern lagoon compared to the Western one. The Eastern lagoon is larger and has been dredged in the past, while the Western lagoon, which also receives major waste inputs, has not been dredged and shows less tidal flushing. Accordingly, one naturally believes that the Eastern lagoon is cleaner and probably safe to use due to its natural resources, including fishes to eat. Unexpectedly, we describe here that mercury methylation was greater in the Eastern lagoon, indicating increased bioavailability of mercury, as probably facilitated by past dredging that decreased solidphase retention of inorganic mercury. Urbanization has historically been more developed in the southern part of the lagoons, which is still reflected in contamination levels of sediment despite dredging, probably because sources of contamination are still more important there today. Such urban contamination emphasizes the need to regulate waste discharges and possible airborne contamination in growing cities of developing countries, and implements environmental and public health monitoring, especially in relation to misbelieves systematically associated with the cleansing effect of dredging activity. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2010.",Not About Sufficiency
Moving Paradigms - Conservation Agriculture with Alternative Agronomics to Minimize Inputs,"The African Union Malabo Declaration outlines goals to achieve sustainable production practices for economic growth in the agriculture sector by 2025. Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices represent a climate smart and resource friendly sustainable production system, and these need to be adopted and refined. This will be a paradigm shift for academics, experts and farmers who are embedded in the intensive external-input monoculture tillage systems. From our review of literature, recent history has shown that CA systems are successful and profitable while using less external inputs and expending less energy. Energy use can be reduced by 40% and labour needs by 50%-90%. Research has shown that CA farming is superior in terms of enhancing soil functions, biodiversity, beneficial insects, energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and resilience to extreme climate events. Nitrogen and other essential elemental crop needs can be reduced by 10%-70% through CA systems. African research and farm testing have shown integrated CA cropping systems can control insect and weed pests while providing more diverse economic crops. For the paradigm shift to occur quickly, efficiently and economically, institutions need to lead change. Policy makers need to start strategic changes to research and institutions by initiating support programmes identified by innovative researchers and agricultural leaders that can move the Malabo dial towards the 2025 goals. © CAB International 2022.",Not About Sufficiency

Invisible and unequal: Unincorporated community status as a structural determinant of health,"Despite increasing awareness of the importance of political determinants of health, place-based research has not interrogated one of the most common political statuses: the impact of living in a community without municipal incorporation. In 2010 an estimated 37% of the U.S. population lived in an unincorporated area; despite their ubiquity, unincorporated communities are largely absent from the public health literature. Residents of unincorporated areas typically do not have their own local (e.g., city or municipal) government. This lack of representation leads to political exclusion and diminished access to resources, especially for low-income communities of color, Furthermore, by not disaggregating health data to unincorporated communities, residents are subsumed into county or census tract data that may not be reflective of their community's composition or context. Without jurisdictional distinction in research, there is no accountability for the manufacturing of health inequities in unincorporated communities. In the absence of empirical research on unincorporated communities, this paper uses the Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) Framework of the World Health Organization to argue that lack of municipal status is a structural determinant of health responsible for social conditions which generate cumulative health risks for residents. This includes using existing evidence on social conditions typical of unincorporated communities to describe patterns of residential segregation, neighborhood disadvantage, and environmental hazards that may increase residents' exposure to unhealthy environments in unincorporated communities. Finally, we provide an agenda for future public health research that can begin to address this health and racial equity gap for low-income unincorporated communities of color who have, until now, been absent in health equity discourse. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

"Environmental Paucity and Anthropocentrism in Textbooks on the Occupation of Araucanía, and a Solution from the Fields of Environmental History and Environmental Education","There will be no progress in the interculturality of textbooks associated with the topic of the military occupation of the Araucanía region if attention is only paid to political or social matters. The environment should also be included. This study provides an environmental analysis of secondary education textbooks that cover this content on the history of Chile. A mixed research strategy and a multiple research design were employed. The sample was composed of eight textbooks used in the secondary school subject of History and Geography from 2008 to 2021. The data were subjected to a quantitative content analysis and a documentary analysis. The results show that there is only limited representation of biodiversity and ecosystems, as well as a lack of didactic activities that foster environmentally friendly behavior and attitudes among students. More importantly, the environment is addressed from an anthropocentric perspective, which does not consider the biocentric environmental relationship that tends to characterize aboriginal peoples and, in this case, the Mapuche people. A more effective link with the tenets of environmental history and environmental education could correct these biases. This would foster methodologies that are more focused on human diversity, the role of the environment in human history would be highlighted, and the content of textbooks would be aligned with the sustainability that is required in the modern world. © 2022 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

Emotional creativity in art education: An exploratory analysis and research trends,"The emotions that human beings experience have a key role in the environments in which they operate. In art education, creative processes are influenced by the emotions and experiences lived by the individual, enabling a more emotional and creative design to make life more pleasant. The aim was to examine the research during the period 1917–2020 on the development of emotional creativity in art education. Mathematical and statistical techniques were applied to 984 articles carried from Elsevier’s Scopus database. The findings yielded data on the scientific productivity of the journal, authors, research institutions, and countries/territories that promoted this field. The data showed an exponential trend, mostly in the last decade. Five lines of research stand out: emotion, higher education, education, art, and leadership. Moreover, five future research directions related to visual art education, affective paradigm, metacompetency, expressive arts therapy group, and cognitive empathy were detected. This study establishes the link between psychology, neuroscience, and artistic education to constitute the decision-making of the promoters of this topic of research. The analysis of international research allowed us to focus the future publications of academics and researchers, in addition to guaranteeing an adequate approach to the objectives of the institutions and funding centers. © 2021 by the authors.

Conflict and peacebuilding in Sri Lanka: Caught in the peace trap?,"The period between 2001 and 2006 saw the rise and fall of an internationally supported effort to bring a protracted violent conflict in Sri Lanka to a peaceful resolution. A ceasefire agreement, signed in February 2002, was followed by six rounds of peace talks, but growing political violence, disagreements over core issues and a fragmentation of the constituencies of the key parties led to an eventual breakdown. In the wake of the failed peace process a new government pursued a highly effective 'war for peace' leading to the military defeat of the LTTE on the battlefields of the north east in May 2009. This book brings together a unique range of perspectives on this problematic and ultimately unsuccessful peace process. The contributions are based upon extensive field research and written by leading Sri Lankan and international researchers and practitioners. The framework of 'liberal peacebuilding' provides an analytical starting point for exploring the complex and unpredictable interactions between international and domestic players during the war-peace-war period. The lessons drawn from the Sri Lankan case have important implications in the context of wider debates on the 'liberal peace' and post conflict peacebuilding - particularly as these debates have largely been shaped by the 'high profile' cases such as Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. This book is of interest not only to Sri Lanka specialists but also to the wider policy/practitioner audience, and is a useful contribution to South Asian studies. © 2011 Jonathan Goodhand, Jonathan Spencer and Benedikt Korf.

International Organizations and Biodiversity,"Biodiversity is an inherently international concern, and a complex network of international organizations has evolved to study, regulate, develop, and conserve the organisms and ecosystem services that biodiversity comprises. Both intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations have developed to foster international cooperation to address issues such as wildlife conservation, agricultural and forestry development, and biodiversity and ecosystem data. As global economic development has led to more complex connections among far-flung social-ecological systems, the interests and roles of these international organizations have become more intertwined. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Framing analysis of news coverage on renewable energy in the star online news portal,"Malaysia, despite being recognised as the suppliers of oil and natural gas in the world is having a hard time fulfilling the high demand of both domestic and international energy sector. Hence, in recent years, Malaysia has in addition ventured into alternative energy in reducing the dependence on the natural energy resources. This study aimed to look at the news framing of renewable energy in The Star Online from 2011-2017 in line with the introduction of the Renewable Energy Act (RE Act 2010), which was enacted in 2011. Utilising content analysis, a total of 45 articles were analysed. Finding shows that the main issues discussed are focused on biomass, not surprising as Malaysia is the world’s largest exporter of palm oil. The newspaper mostly used industry/industry spokesperson as the main sources in its news reporting. The main frame used in the news is on economic concerns that include trade and investment. This research concludes that more coverage needs to be given to individuals, NGOs and experts who are in addition important stakeholders in renewable energy to position various concerns especially on low-risk efforts in RE or food security. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.",Not About Sufficiency

Greening airports II: Transforming an airport into a true multimodal transport node,"At many large airports, traffic growth has caused an increase of airside and landside congestion and airline and air passenger delays, noise, local emissions of greenhouse gases, and waste. Consequently, transforming such airports into true multimodal transport nodes is considered one of the long term alternatives for mitigating some of these impacts. What does this imply? Airports are, by definition, multimodal transport nodes, which enable air passengers and air cargo to transfer from the airports' ground access systems/modes to the air transport system/mode, and vice versa, as will be described in more detail in chap 7. Under such circumstances, developing such airports into true multimodal transport nodes implies connecting them to ground transport systems/modes, providing similar services to/from them as the air transport system/mode over the specified short- to medium-haul inter-city and inter-airport travel distances (routes). In this respect, air passengers can be transferred at the airport on two levels: (a) firstly, between the airport ground access systems and one of the longer distance transport systems/modes; and (b) secondly, between two inter-city and inter-airport transport systems/modes. By simultaneously providing transport capacities through at least two either competing or complementing modes APT (Air Passenger Transport) and HSR (High-Speed Rail), the airports in question could be considered to operate as true multimodal transport nodes.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of climate finance beyond renewables: Behavioural insights,"The paper contributes towards filling a ‘blind spot’ in the field of climate finance by investigating the role of climate finance for behavioural insights in developing countries. The evidence review synthesises 71 high-quality studies and focuses on clean fuel adoption and household energy-saving behaviour in developing countries. The synthesis finds that there is a need for climate finance from developed countries that is more targeted towards interventions and measures that support household decision-making in developing countries by engaging with stakeholders that understand local attitudes, constraints and knowledge levels governing the perception of health and environmental risks associated with energy-consuming technologies. © 2022 The Authors.

An environmental social marketing intervention in cultural heritage tourism: a realist evaluation,"Following Pawson and Tilley's principles of realist evaluation and the context–mechanism–outcome (CMO) framework, this paper conducts a process evaluation of an environmental social marketing intervention in a heritage tourism organisation. Social marketing and employee environmental interventions have received relatively scant attention in tourism. Additionally, prior literature mostly focused on the evaluation of intervention outcomes (i.e. how far the intervention produces precise targeted outcomes) and ignores the importance of process evaluation (i.e. identifying what works, for whom, under which circumstances and how, plus issues of intervention maintenance). This paper fills this literature gap using realist evaluation theory and academic perspectives, as well as via the reflections of practitioners involved in intervention design and delivery. Findings suggest that a good understanding of the tourism and organisational context (regarding the dimensions of structure, culture, agency and relations) and the use of tailored, action-focused mechanisms (for each context dimension) are critical to achieving transformational outcomes in environmental interventions in cultural heritage organisations. Based on these findings, it is concluded that the CMO is a useful framework for assessing environmental social marketing interventions in tourism (both for heritage and other tourism organisations). Implications for tourism practice and further research directions are also discussed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Water for agriculture: Challenges and opportunities in a war zone,"Wars, drought and social collapse have greatly impaired land management and agriculture production systems in the southeastern Afghanistan provinces of Khost, Paktika and Paktya. This region has long existed with limited central government influence and remains particularly unstable. A complex physical and social geography, on-going warfare, severely limited mobility and policies poorly adapted to regional realities hamper development and reconstruction. On-farm water efficiency improvement, watershed-scale work restricted to small, socially homogeneous watersheds and word-of-mouth Afghan-to-Afghan technology dissemination are particularly important development strategies in this environment. © 2011 Copyright 2011 International Water Resources Association.",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptive capacity and human cognition: The process of individual adaptation to climate change,"Adaptation has emerged as an important area of research and assessment among climate change scientists. Most scholarly work has identified resource constraints as being the most significant determinants of adaptation. However, empirical research on adaptation has so far mostly not addressed the importance of measurable and alterable psychological factors in determining adaptation. Drawing from the literature in psychology and behavioural economics, we develop a socio-cognitive Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPACC). MPPACC separates out the psychological steps to taking action in response to perception, and allows one to see where the most important bottlenecks occur - including risk perception and perceived adaptive capacity, a factor largely neglected in previous climate change research. We then examine two case studies - one from urban Germany and one from rural Zimbabwe - to explore the validity of MPPACC to explaining adaptation. In the German study, we find that MPPACC provides better statistical power than traditional socio-economic models. In the Zimbabwean case study, we find a qualitative match between MPPACC and adaptive behaviour. Finally, we discuss the important implications of our findings both on vulnerability and adaptation assessments, and on efforts to promote adaptation through outside intervention. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhanced adsorption of phosphate onto zinc ferrite by incorporating cerium,"To develop a stable and easily separable adsorbent for the efficient removal of phosphate from water, Ce-incorporated zinc ferrites (ZnCexFe2−xO4, x = 0 ∼ 0.48) were synthesized and investigated. Results indicated that, though introduction of Ce decreased saturation magnetization, the ferrites were magnetically separable with saturation magnetization exceeded 32.0 emu/g when x ≤ 0.12. On the other hand, increasing Ce content greatly boosted the adsorptive capacity of phosphate, with Langmuir adsorption maxima increasing from 5.2 mg/g to 41.6 mg/g at 25 °C when x increased from 0 to 0.48. However, P/Ce molar ratio was found to be the highest when x = 0.12, enabling the most efficient use of Ce. The adsorption of phosphate was the most favorable within the middle pH range and the increase in both ionic strength and temperature enhanced adsorption. The material showed good affinity for phosphate in the presence of common anions. Experimental results also showed that NaOH or KOH were applicable for the purpose of adsorbent regeneration. In conclusion, Ce-incorporated zinc ferrite with the composition of ZnCe0.12Fe1.88O4 has the potential for the removal of phosphate from water. © 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Not About Sufficiency
Geodesign processes and ecological systems thinking in a coupled human-environment context: An integrated framework for landscape architecture,"Scholars from a variety of disciplines have been working to unravel the complexities of geodesign as an approach to tackling a host of problems. We argue that a mature understanding of geodesign requires a systemic perspective to organize the interconnections between ecological, social and economic conditions at multiple spatial and temporal scales. We reviewed definitions and perspectives of geodesign and key concepts of ecological systems thinking to develop a new framework for landscape architecture. We provide the state-of-the-art in geodesign within the context of systems thinking and coupled human-environmental resilience. We show that geodesign is capable to encourage public participation and interdisciplinary collaboration through its systemic planning processes and synergetic technologies. The thrust of geodesign-related research is the emerging paradigm of landscape-based sustainability. While landscape architecture is complex in many aspects, the integrated framework promotes our understanding about its social-ecological potential, spatial-temporal association and resilience of coupled human-environment systems. Based on the findings, we outline key contributions, implications, challenges and recommendations for future research. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Economy's tension: The dialectics of community and market,"Why are we obsessed with calculating our selections? The author argues that competitive trade nurtures calculative reason, which provides the ground for most discourses on economy. But market descriptions of economy are incomplete. Drawing on a range of materials from small ethnographic contexts to global financial markets, the author shows that economy is dialectically made up of two value realms, termed mutuality and impersonal trade. One or the other may be dominant; however, market reason usually cascades into and debases the mutuality on which it depends. Using this cross-cultural model, the author explores mystifications of economic life, and explains how capital and derivatives can control an economy. The book offers a different conception of economic welfare, development, and freedom; it presents an approach for dealing with environmental devastation, and explains the growing inequalities of wealth within and between nations. © 2008 Stephen Gudeman.

Application of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model in the development of evidence-informed interventions for drowning prevention: A mixed-methods study protocol,"Introduction Drowning is a global public health threat, disproportionately impacting low-income and middle-income countries. In the Philippines, it is estimated that more than 5200 people die from drowning per annum. This number is likely to be higher than currently estimated with the inclusion of disaster-related and transportation-related drowning. Drowning is preventable if appropriate preventive interventions are put in place which redress known risk factors. Methods and analysis This study uses the PRECEDE-PROCEED model (PPM), an eight-step health promotion planning and evaluation model for building and improving intervention programmes. This mixed-methods study, which can be used in any location, will be implemented in Los BaÅ os, Laguna, Philippines, identified as an area of concern for drowning. Using the PPM, data on drowning will be collected from death records, community observation, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and community survey. A range of analytical methods will be used to explore drowning data including univariate and χ 2 analyses, analysis of variance, relative risk and calculating rates using population data. The quantitative data and themes drawn from qualitative data will be used to populate the first four phases of the PPM. Following the data collection, the remaining stages of the PPM will be designed and implemented in the barangay (village) with the highest drowning rate. Ethics and dissemination This study has obtained ethical clearance from the University of the Philippines Manila Research Ethics Board (UPMREB 2017-425-01). Study findings will be disseminated through workshops and presentations to the local community as well as through peer-reviewed literature and conference presentations. The PPM has rarely been applied to drowning prevention and it is the aim that the study described in this protocol is expanded across other areas of the Philippines and to other countries with a high drowning burden to inform prevention efforts. ©",Not About Sufficiency
"Promoting the potential of flux-measuring stations in urban parks: An innovative case study in Naples, Italy","Urban forests and parks are living systems integrated in highly anthropic areas, where they establish close interactions with all the other systems around. Thanks to those interactions, urban forests provide many ecosystem services to people and to the whole urban environment. One of the most important is the absorption of chemically and radiatively-active trace gases and thus the effect on local air quality. Beyond the main greenhouse gases (CO2, H2O and CH4), in urban areas a relevant role is played by the photochemical pollution mainly constituted by O3 and particulate matters. Despite their importance, experimental sites monitoring trace gases fluxes in urban forest ecosystems and parks are still scarce. In this paper, we present for the first time the experimental station of Real Bosco di Capodimonte, located within the city of Naples. The vegetation is mainly composed by Quercus ilex with some patches of Pinus pinea and meadows. The site is equipped with state of the art instruments to measure concentrations and exchanges of CO2, H2O, CH4, O3, PM, VOCs and NOx by the eddy covariance technique. It represents an interesting and rare opportunity to investigate the interactions between urban vegetation, anthropogenic pollutants and secondary photochemical compounds. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental issues as drivers for food choice: study from a multinational framework,"This work intended to explore some motivations that influence people’s eating habits towards sustainability. This was an observational, cross-sectional study, carried out by questionnaire survey on a non-probabilistic sample of 10,067 participants from 13 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, Romania and United States). Results indicated that people prefer fresh local foods from the season, being important because it allows transportation and storage to be reduced, which in many cases implies refrigeration systems and consequent energy expenditure. Although people avoid food waste at home, the awareness for the waste at restaurants still needs to be improved. Consumers seem to prefer foods that have been produced and packed in sustainable ways but still give importance to the package— understandable for food products. The results also indicated significant differences in the food choice motivations between groups for all sociodemographic variables tested (age, sex, marital status, education, professional area, living environment and country), but the association was high only for variable country. Additionally, a tree classification analysis allowed to identify the relative importance of the influential variables on the sustainable food choices, with country being the most important, followed by age and sex. Additionally, discriminant function analysis allowed establishing a model for the relation between country and six variables accounting for preservation of biodiversity, respect for life, save natural resources, save energy, reduce industrial pollution and minimal packaging. Although with some limitations, this study brings valuable insight into some aspects linked with sustainable food choices on a number of countries and how people shape their food choices according to some sustainability issues. © 2021 by the authors.

A sociology of “climatage”: the appeal and counterproductivity of property destruction as a climate change strategy,"Calls for the use of property destruction as a climate change strategy are understandable given social conditions that make such ‘climatage’ appealing, including the chronic failure of institutions to address climate change and the widespread sense that these institutions are illegitimate and will continue to fail to act (post-legitimacy); the inability of atomized individuals to successfully transform the forces driving climate change (real helplessness); the virtualization of politics into inconsequential moralism (hyper-politics); and widespread despair about the environmental crisis and future of the world. Despite the appeal, property destruction as a climate change strategy will likely prove counterproductive for at least three reasons, deduced from research on social movements: (1) property destruction will likely decrease public support for climate activists and climate policy, (2) property destruction will almost certainly increase state repression, a fight that climate activists will likely lose, and (3) alternative tactics that do not involve property destruction will likely prove more effective. In addition to our pragmatic intervention, we make a theoretical contribution to our understanding of social movements and strategy. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the adequacy of the global response to the Paris Agreement: Toward a full appraisal of climate ambition and action,"This commentary places the international climate governance assessment offered in this Special Issue in the broader context of a comprehensive framework for assessing the adequacy of the global response to meet the Paris Agreement long-term goals. It suggests ways to further advance global governance assessments in supporting the dynamic process of progressively strengthening collective ambition and action. It finds that the sectoral systems approach enables the operationalization of multidimensional adequacy assessments. It also identifies the need to further improve the integration of multiple levels of governance and short- and long-term time horizons. Lessons from the discussion on sectoral granularity, multi-scale considerations and short-long term coherence are finally synthetized as guiding principles for the design of key processes and instruments of the Paris Agreement. This leads to highlighting priorities for the design of the Global Stocktake and the further elaboration of the instrument of countries’ Long Term Strategies. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
Farming households’pro-environmental behaviors from the perspective of environmental literacy,"Agricultural non- point source pollution has become one of the most significant and prominent environmental problems in China, which directly threatens the quality and safety of China’s agricultural products, human health, and ecological safety, and has become an important factor restricting the sustainable development of China’s national economy. Under this background, it is urgent to change the existing agricultural production mode, encourage farming households to implement green and sustainable pro-environment agricultural production behaviors, reduce agricultural environmental pollution, and ensure food safety and ecological security. To alleviate the agricultural environmental problems, this study examined farming households’pro-environmental behaviors from the perspective of environmental literacy, which is divided into three dimensions environmental cognitive, environmental responsibility, and environmental knowledge and skills, and the moderating effect of the situational factor social norm on farming households’ pro-environmental behaviors. It used the field survey data of 1023 farming households in Jiangsu, Anhui, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi Provinces. The results show that: (1) Environmental responsibility and environmental knowledge and skills can promote farming households’pro-environmental behavior, and the promoting effect of environmental knowledge and skills are stronger; environmental cognition, however, has no significant effect on farming households’pro-environmental behavior; after considering endogenous problems caused by reverse causation and missing variables, the above conclusions remain valid. (2) Social norm can positively regulate the role of environmental responsibility and environmental knowledge and skills in promoting farming households’pro-environmental behaviors. (3) Farmers with more education, higher family income, and lower land fragmentation are more likely to engage in pro- environmental behaviors. Meanwhile, compared with men, multiple occupation farmers, and farmers who rent land from others, women, professional farmers, and farmers who grow their own land are more likely to engage in pro- environmental behaviors. On this basis, some policy recommendations are put forward, including cultivating farming households’environmental responsibility, establishing field schools, and establishing models and benchmarks for the implementation of pro- environment behaviors, among others. © 2020 Editorial Department of Resource Science.

"Multi-level governance of low-carbon tourism in rural China: policy evolution, implementation pathways, and socio-ecological impacts","Low-carbon rural tourism development presents a critical challenge for environmental governance in emerging economies, yet the multi-level dynamics of policy implementation remain underexplored. This study examines China's approach to this challenge, employing a mixed-methods approach including analysis of 16 central and 559 provincial policy documents, case studies in 15 rural villages across five provinces (Hunan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shanxi, and Hainan), and a survey of 637 stakeholders. Our findings reveal a complex policy landscape characterized by evolving national frameworks, varied provincial adoption patterns influenced by economic, environmental, and institutional factors, and three distinct local implementation pathways: technology-driven, community-based, and policy-led. We uncover significant variations in stakeholder perceptions and socio-economic impacts across different contexts, highlighting the critical role of adaptive governance mechanisms and local contextual factors in determining policy effectiveness. This study contributes to policy diffusion and multi-level governance theories by demonstrating the intricate interplay between top-down directives and bottom-up innovations in shaping sustainable tourism outcomes. Based on these insights, we propose evidence-based policy recommendations emphasizing flexible, context-sensitive approaches and improved stakeholder engagement to enhance low-carbon rural tourism governance. This research provides valuable guidance for policymakers and practitioners working towards sustainable rural development and environmental conservation in China and other developing countries.",Not About Sufficiency
Research on risk assessment of coal and gas outburst during continuous excavation cycle of coal mine with dynamic probabilistic inference,"Coal and gas outbursts are a major dynamic hazard in underground coal mining, and predicting these events is challenging due to their complex mechanisms. This study introduces an advanced multistate dynamic probabilistic system designed to evaluate the risk of outbursts prior to each excavation cycle. Through the development of a Bayesian network (BN), we establish a dynamic model that captures the complex interactions among essential variables. The novel integration of time slices facilitates the continuous assessment across successive mining cycles. This study tackles the challenge of maintaining network parameter reliability in the static prediction conditions of outburst-prone coal mines. Specifically, in order to overcome the asynchronism of all variables testing process, the expert knowledge integration of expectation-maximization parameter learning and fuzzy set theory (FST) is built inside the system. Finally, we present a case study illustrating the application of this system across fifty-one consecutive cycles, with regular updates to variable states, showcasing the enhanced predictive capability of Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) over traditional BNs for ongoing risk evaluation in mining operations. Additionally, by integrating backward diagnosis with sensitivity analysis, our approach simplifies the identification of key risk factors, offering valuable insights for improving outburst prevention measures and ensuring the safety of coal mining activities. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers",Not About Sufficiency
"Global water governance in the context of global and multilevel governance: Its need, form, and challenges","To complement this Special Feature on global water governance, we focused on a generic challenge at the global level, namely, the degree to which water issues need to be dealt with in a centralized, concentrated, and hierarchical manner. We examined water ecosystem services and their impact on human well-being, the role of policies, indirect and direct drivers in influencing these services, and the administrative level(s) at which the provision of services and potential trade-offs can be dealt with. We applied a politics of scale perspective to understand motivations for defining a problem at the global or local level and show that the multilevel approach to water governance is evolving and inevitable. We argue that a centralized overarching governance system for water is unlikely and possibly undesirable; however, there is a need for a high-level think tank and leadership to develop a cosmopolitan perspective to promote sustainable water development. © 2013 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
The Lion and the Sun: Environmental History and the Formation of Modern Iran,"Why did the place of formerly powerful Eurasian land empires, like that of Iran, change so dramatically in global affairs over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries? This book explores this critical transitional period in Iranian history from an environmental perspective. It argues that severe ecological challenges dating to the late seventeenth century, and deepening during the post-Safavid crisis of the eighteenth century, drove a decline in the population and resource base of the Iranian plateau. This in turn shaped ongoing environmental challenges in the Qajar period and on into the 20th century. Presenting a new set of perspectives on key sources with new questions in mind, The Lion and the Sun relies upon scientific evidence such as Geographic Information System data and tree-ring analysis, as well as a careful re-engagement with existing sources. Re-interpreting court chronicles, administrative orders, local histories, geographical texts, and endowment deeds, the book reveals the way in which the relationship between imperial systems and the rest of nature formed the modern state of Iran. An important and original contribution, it will be essential reading for scholars and students of global environmental history and the modern Middle East. © James M.

Commitment to sustainability in large European banks and its relationship with board gender diversity: A 2030 Agenda perspective,"Ensuring a sustainable future by meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be achieved without women's empowerment and gender equality. This study aims to determine whether there are differences between European banks in terms of their commitment to SDGs and the intensity of this commitment depending on their board gender diversity. A sample of the 50 largest European banks from 2016 to 2020 was used to perform hypothesis testing for differences in means. The results provide robust support for the assertion that banks with greater female representation on the board of directors have a greater commitment to the 2030 Agenda. The originality of this research lies in the use of indicators of commitment to SDGs corresponding to each of the five SDG pillars. This study thus provides the first evidence of the importance of distinguishing between these pillars when examining the relationship between commitment to SDGs and board gender diversity. This evidence advances the scant literature on this relationship. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND ITS IMPACT ON ORGANISATIONAL PERFORMANCE IN THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW,"This paper aims to systematically review the existing studies of corporate governance with organisational performance in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and put forward theories, research methods, topics, and variables that emerge from the review. The systematic literature review is based on 42 peer-reviewed journal articles on the topic written by reputable academics on the Science Direct Database focused on corporate governance, board characteristics, and ownership structure. This study’s conceptual framework is based on agency theory, which is the most widely used to analyse corporate governance (Fama & Jensen, 1983; Jensen & Meckling, 1976). The majority of results show a positive correlation between corporate governance and organisational performance (Pucheta-Martínez & Gallego-Álvarez, 2020) with agency theory being the most utilised theory of choice (Bergh, Ketchen, Orlandi, Heugens, & Boyd, 2019; Panda & Leepsa, 2017). This paper undertakes a significant thorough systematic review of corporate governance with firm performance and the Fourth Industrial Revolution literature. It gives an 11-year review with a reference index from 2011 to 2021, useful for both academics and professionals. This study recommends more evidence-based systematic reviews for different aspects and within different regions. It is further recommended to expand geographical spread across all continents to cover corporate governance area and to improve studies related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and its impact on corporate governance.

Drought, food shortages, and government settlement policy affecting both rural and urban populations has yielded a national human rights crisis. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in Mutare, southeast Zimbabwe, in 2005-2006, the authors illustrate the flow-on effects of drought and government policy on the livelihoods of households already suffering as a result of the social impacts of AIDS, and how people in a regional city responded to these factors, defining and meeting their basic food needs in diverse ways. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the impact of renewable energy on economic growth and carbon emissions: Evidence from partial least squares structural equation modeling,"The concern for environmental sustainability comes along with sustainable energy for consumption. Therefore, this study aims to explore the direct and indirect effects of renewable energy on economic growth and carbon emissions by employing Partial Least Square Structure Equation Modeling and Granger Causality Test and the data for this study is from 1990 to 2021. The results from the Partial Least Squares Structure Equation Modeling indicate that renewable energy consumption causes carbon emissions and has no effect on economic growth. Financial inclusion and foreign direct investment have positive effects on carbon emissions. However, renewable energy has an indirect negative effect on carbon emissions through economic growth. Foreign direct investment affects economic growth positively. Furthermore, the results from the Granger causality test indicate that renewable energy has a unidirectional causality relationship with financial inclusion and foreign direct investment and has a feedback causality relationship with economic growth. In addition, there is a feedback causal effect between financial inclusion and carbon emissions, a unidirectional effect running from carbon emissions to foreign direct investment, and a causal effect from economic growth to foreign direct investment. This study has suggested comprehensive policy recommendations for policymakers based on the findings. © 2023 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Unraveling the impact of travel time, cost, and transit burdens on commute mode choice for different income and age groups","It is well known that faster and less-expensive transit systems with shorter walking distances, as well as less transfers, are associated with transit use. In this regard, recent studies have focused on estimating transit's competitiveness and further suggested possible policy interventions. However, there were not much attention on measuring travel time and cost differences between transit and auto by considering the temporal variability. In addition, only a limited study have focused on the impact of either walking during transfers on mode choice or the stage of walking that most affects mode choice. This paper provides additional insights into the impact of travel time, cost, and transit burdens on commute mode choice based on the analysis in a transit-oriented mega city, Seoul, Korea. Together with the 2016 household travel survey data, we utilize the web-based route guide information to measure time, cost, and transit burdens for both chosen and non-chosen modes. The results reveal that commuters are significantly affected by the travel time and cost difference between modes. Additionally, the results indicate that the odds of driving increases by 4.7% and 24.3% when commuters have to transfer once or more than once, respectively. Also, commuters were mostly disinclined to walk longer distances during transfer and egress. The effect of time, cost, and transit burdens on mode choice also varied by income and age groups, further implying the group of people that should be focused when devising policies to encourage transit use. To conclude, this paper suggests potential levers for transportation policies to trigger modal shifts toward sustainable modes by using advanced data sources that better estimate the travel characteristics by departure time based on a point-to-point travel survey data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Greenwash and green brand equity: The mediating role of green brand image, green satisfaction and green trust and the moderating role of information and knowledge","This work examines the impact of greenwash on green brand equity and analyses the mediation effects of green brand image, green satisfaction and green trust as well as the moderating effect of information and knowledge based on the legitimacy theory and signalling theory. This study adopts a questionnaire-based survey design to gather data from 445 respondents using a cluster random sampling technique. Data collection focuses on Vietnamese consumers who had purchased electronic products in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The findings show that although greenwash is not significantly related to green brand equity possibly due to the halo effect, greenwash is adversely related to green brand image, green satisfaction and green trust, which would positively influence green brand equity. In other words, green brand image, green satisfaction and green trust play a full mediation role in the relationship between greenwash and green brand equity. In addition, information and knowledge actually moderate the relationship between greenwash and green brand equity, and it strengthens the adverse relationship between greenwash and green brand equity. This research is the first to combine green brand image, green satisfaction and green trust as mediators to shed light on the understanding of different impact mechanisms in the greenwash–green brand equity relationship. Furthermore, this research is also the first to study information and knowledge as a moderator in the greenwash–green brand equity relationship. This provides a better insight into the process and context by which greenwash affects green brand equity. Taken together, the findings of this study extend and advance the understanding regarding the different mechanisms and the dynamics in which green brand image, green satisfaction, green trust as mediators and information and knowledge as a moderator can play in the emerging market context of consumers of electronic products in Vietnam. The findings enrich the growing body of green marketing literature and contribute significantly towards a unified theory of brand equity. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Green innovation dynamics: the mediating role of green intellectual capital and open innovation of SMEs in Vietnam,"This study investigates whether and, if so, how efficiently government support (GS) and environmental regulations (ER) affect green innovation (GI), with a focus on the mediating roles of green intellectual capital (GIC) and open innovation (OI), using the natural-resources-based view (NRBV) and knowledge-based theory (KBT). Utilising a questionnaire-based survey of 508 respondents and partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) for data analysis, the research finds that GS and ER positively relate to GI. The study demonstrates that OI and green human capital (GHC) mediate the impact of GS and ER on GI, respectively, advancing empirical evidence on the complex dynamics of green innovation in the context of Vietnamese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam. This research enriches the understanding of green innovation dynamics and offers insights into leveraging government support and environmental regulations for enhancing green innovation through intellectual capital and open innovation strategies. © 2023 Inderscience Publishers.

Ecology and applied environmental science,"Ecology and Applied Environmental Science addresses the impact of contemporary environmental problems by using the main principles of scientific ecology. It offers a brief yet comprehensive explanation of ecosystems based on energy, populations, and cycles of chemical elements. The book presents a variety of scientific ecological issues and uses these to examine a range of environmental problems while considering potential engineering, scientific, and managerial solutions. It takes an engineering approach and avoids excessive biological detail, while introducing ecology with a systemic approach. The book examines categories of organisms as well as the physical and chemical processes that affect them. It refers to the dynamics of populations and analysis of their major mutual influences, elaborates on the roles of primary production, limiting factors, energy flow, and circulation of chemical substances in the ecosystems, and presents the basic functions of aquatic ecosystems. The author considers important issues related to environmental degradation of forests, aquatic habitats, coastal zones, other natural landscapes, and urban areas, includes a survey of problems related to waste and toxic and radioactive substances, and presents the greenhouse effect and impacts from climate change. He discusses environmental management prospects and the potential for technological control of pollution from liquid, solid, and gaseous waste. He also highlights existing tools for environmental management, ecological and social aspects of biodiversity and landscape protection, and the contrast between development and environment in combination with ideas about sustainability. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysis of El Niño Southern Oscillation and its impact on rainfall distribution and productivity of selected cereal crops in Kembata Alaba Tembaro zone,"El Niño Southern Oscillation could likely distort the hydro climatological processes and adversely affect agricultural production at various magnitudes. This study explored the manifestations of ENSO-induced rainfall variability and its impact on selected cereal crops in Kembata Alaba Tembaro Zones of southern Ethiopia. Accordingly, precipitation, temperature, crop, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data were collected from the National Meteorology Agency of Ethiopia, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Rainfall variability was analyzed using the Coefficient of Variation and various anomaly indices. Spatial and temporal relationships between SST and yield of selected crops were established using the person correlation method. Mann-Kendal trend test was also used for trend analysis. The results revealed a statically significant (P < 0.05) decreasing trend and highly variable spring and summer rainfall. Global SSTs strongly influence both summer and spring rainfalls. El Niño and La Niña events were shown to influence the local rainfall distribution and crop production at varying magnitude over different spaces and times. The yield reduction due to ENSO increases from wheat, barley, maize to Sorghum, respectively, while Enset (ventricosum) was found to be less influenced by ENSO-caused rainfall variability. This implies that sorghum and maize crops are more sensitive to El Niño and La Niña events in the study area compared to the other crops considered in this study. The conformity of Enset yield with rainfall variability could be attributed to its tolerance to moisture stress. From the results, one can conclude that the overall cereal crop productivity was adversely, but differentially, affected by ENSO-induced climate variability. © 2021 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
A Ponzi scheme on the environment? Failures of fiduciary duty and the challenges of climate governance,"This conclusion presents some closing thoughts on the key concepts discussed in the preceding chapters of this book. The book distinguishes the exclusivist nature of fiduciary duty and the inclusivist way in which public law addresses the use of power by the Executive and the Legislature. FoxDecent's fiduciary theory of human rights has some parallels to Finn's approach of protection of the public's environmental interests in the same way as fundamental rights. It complements and provides support for Wood's Atmospheric Trust Litigation (ATL) strategy. Mankind's interest in the protection of the environment in the same way as fundamental rights, argued by Finn, clearly fits neatly within the framework. The fiduciary theory of human rights framework can be used by parliamentarians to argue much more strongly when seeking support for effective domestic and complementary international policy instruments. © The editors and contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
Toxicological evaluation of exhaust emissions from light-duty vehicles using different fuel alternatives in sub-freezing conditions,"Background: Emissions from road traffic are under constant discussion since they pose a major threat to human health despite the increasingly strict emission targets and regulations. Although the new passenger car regulations have been very effective in reducing the particulate matter (PM) emissions, the aged car fleet in some EU countries remains a substantial source of PM emissions. Moreover, toxicity of PM emissions from multiple new types of bio-based fuels remain uncertain and different driving conditions such as the sub-zero running temperature has been shown to affect the emissions. Overall, the current literature and experimental knowledge on the toxicology of these PM emissions and conditions is scarce. Methods: In the present study, we show that exhaust gas PM from newly regulated passenger cars fueled by different fuels at sub-zero temperatures, induce toxicological responses in vitro. We used exhaust gas volume-based PM doses to give us better insight on the real-life exposure and included one older diesel car to estimate the effect of the new emissions regulations. Results: In cars compliant with the new regulations, gasoline (E10) displayed the highest PM concentrations and toxicological responses, while the higher ethanol blend (E85) resulted in slightly lower exhaust gas PM concentrations and notably lower toxicological responses in comparison. Engines powered by modern diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) yielded the lowest PM concentrations and toxicological responses. Conclusions: The present study shows that toxicity of the exhaust gas PM varies depending on the fuels used. Additionally, concentration and toxicity of PM from an older diesel car were vastly higher, compared to contemporary vehicles, indicating the beneficial effects of the new emissions regulations. © 2020 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Pandemics, transformations and tourism: be careful what you wish for","Disease outbreaks and pandemics have long played a role in societal and economic change. However, the nature of such change is selective, meaning that it is sometimes minimal and, at other times, and change or transformation may be unexpected, potentially even reinforcing contemporary paradigms. A comprehensive overview of pandemics and their effects is provided. This is used to help contextualise the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on tourism and government, industry and consumer response. Drawing on the available literature, factors that will affect tourism and destination recovery are then identified. Some measures will continue or even expand present growth orientations in tourism while others may contribute to sustainability. It is concluded that that the selective nature of the effects of COVID-19 and the measures to contain it may lead to reorientation of tourism in some cases, but in others will contribute to policies reflecting the selfish nationalism of some countries. However, the response to planetary limits and sustainable tourism requires a global approach. Despite clear evidence of this necessity, the possibility for a comprehensive transformation of the tourism system remains extremely limited without a fundamental transformation of the entire planet. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
The wretched atom: America’s global gamble with peaceful nuclear technology,"After the Second World War, the United States offered a new kind of atom that differed from the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This atom would cure diseases, produce new foods, make deserts bloom, and provide abundant energy for all. It was an atom destined for the formerly colonized, recently occupied, and mostly non-white parts of the world that were dubbed the “wretched of the earth” by Frantz Fanon. The “peaceful atom” had so much propaganda potential that President Dwight Eisenhower used it to distract the world from his plan to test even bigger thermonuclear weapons. His scientists said the peaceful atom would quicken the pulse of nature, speeding nations along the path of economic development and helping them to escape the clutches of disease, famine, and energy shortfalls. That promise became one of the most misunderstood political weapons of the twentieth century. It was adopted by every subsequent US president to exert leverage over other nations’ weapons programs, to corner world markets of uranium and thorium, and to secure petroleum supplies. Other countries embraced it, building reactors and training experts. Atomic promises were embedded in Japan’s postwar recovery, Ghana’s pan-Africanism, Israel’s quest for survival, Pakistan’s brinksmanship with India, and Iran’s pursuit of nuclear independence. As The Wretched Atom shows, promoting civilian atomic energy was an immense gamble, and it was never truly peaceful. American promises ended up exporting violence and peace in equal measure. While the United States promised peace and plenty, it planted the seeds of dependency and set in motion the creation of today’s expanded nuclear club. © Oxford University Press 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
How does family involvement affect environmental innovation? A socioemotional wealth perspective,"The purpose of this study was to examine how family involvement affects the environmental innovation of firms. While prior studies have shown that family involvement can enhance environmental performance, these environmental performances have been portrayed as firm activities to prevent environmental issues, such as air pollution, CO2 emissions, etc. We maintain that environmental performance should be more proactive and enable firms to transform their activities more fundamentally towards environmental protection. In this sense, we consider environmental innovation, i.e., technological development to address environmental issues, as a proactive measure enacting firm activities to address environmental issues. Furthermore, we determine whether and how family involvement can motivate firms to develop technologies for environmental performance. To illuminate this relation, we utilized a socioemotional wealth perspective, which provides useful insights into how family-controlled firms behave differently in comparison to non-family firms. Building on this socioemotional wealth approach, we suggest that family involvement helps firms engage in environmental innovation. In this study, we also explore how the positive link between family involvement and environmental innovation is dependent on family interlocks—the circumstance wherein a firm’s family directors are affiliated with the boards of directors of other firms. Specifically, we suggest that an increase in a firm’s family interlocks would strengthen the positive relationship between family involvement and environmental innovation. To test our ideas, we used a sample of 623 US public firms ranging from 1996 to 2010, which yielded 5047 firm-year observations. We find that family involvement facilitates the environmental innovation of firms. We also find that family interlocks intensify the positive effect of family involvement on environmental innovation. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and empirical implications of our results. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental sustainability in health care: An empirical investigation of US hospitals,"Unlike industrial sectors, quality of care is of critical importance in the healthcare sector. Accordingly, incorporating environmental sustainability into healthcare services poses a unique challenge since hospitals must strike a balance among service quality (i.e., clinical quality and patient experience), cost efficiency, and environmental footprints. However, much prior research has focused primarily on the financial benefits of environmental sustainability, mainly in industrial sectors. Environmental sustainability in relation to service quality remains an underexplored topic in literature. As such, it is still unclear whether a hospital's efforts toward environmental sustainability will pay off since the environmental sustainability mantra of “reduce, reuse, and recycle” may not be suitable for healthcare settings. Drawing upon the premise of a practice-based view, we investigate environmental sustainability in relation to service quality and financial performance in the U.S. healthcare setting. Specifically, this study examines how a hospital's environmental practices impact its service quality and financial performance. Additionally, we examine whether a hospital's continued efforts toward environmental sustainability can generate enduring performance benefits. Overall, our analysis demonstrates the service quality and financial benefits of environmental sustainability in healthcare. However, persistent efforts only lead to enduring financial benefits, not service-quality benefits. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Does environmental decentralisation improve ESG performance? Evidence from listed companies in China,"Environmental management systems are essential for promoting sustainable development. Rational distribution of environmental management responsibilities among governmental entities is a fundamental requirement and institutional framework. China's Direct Reporting of Environmental Statistics for National Key Supervision Enterprises (DRES) policy is a reform initiative that is intended to recalibrate environmental decentralisation to intensify environmental oversight. Using manually-collected data from key A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2021, this study employs a difference-in-differences model to evaluate the impact of the DRES policy on corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. The main findings are as fourfold. (1) The DRES policy significantly enhances corporate ESG performance. (2) Regarding policy transmission pathways, it empowers enterprises to systematically improve their ESG performance through concept, terminal, source and voluntary governance. (3) Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the policy's efficacy is particularly pronounced in resource-based regions, among enterprises with low managerial myopia and limited analyst attention and within non-state-owned enterprises. (4) Economic consequence testing indicates that enterprises' improved ESG performance can enhance total factor productivity but concurrently increases enterprises' risk. Finally, the study proposes corresponding policy recommendations such as improving the incentive and restraint mechanisms of environmental management and implementing differentiated environmental governance strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability analysis of marine ecotourism management for preserving natural resources and coastal ecosystem functions,"Ecotourism very support for conservation. Ecotourism may assist with preservation of natural resources and ecotourism functions in comparison to other alternatives, such as mass tourism. This study aims to analyze the sustainability status of ecotourism management for preserving natural resources and ecosystem functions. This study is a survey on ecotourism destinations Clungup Mangrove Conservation (CMC). To analyze the level of sustainability, 9 dimensions were analyzed based on theoretical and empirical studies. The dimensions consisted of (1) conservation, (2) participation, (3) recreation and education, (4) economy, (5) control, (6) government, (7) ecotourism center, (8) academics/researchers, and (9) social media. This study employed quantitative analysis using Rapfish application with Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) to assess the status and sustainability index of marine tourism management (CMC). The result revealed that the sustainability status of marine ecotourism management in CMC was categorized as “highly sustainable”. The highest value was the conservation dimension and the lowest value was in the government dimension. Therefore, government support for improving the role of ecotourism regarding preservation of natural resources and ecosystem functions is required. The government can give its support through implementing regulations, facilitating ecotourism management, designing public policy for ecotourism, and planning government policies that benefit the development of ecotourism. © 2021, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

The Impact of Tax Avoidance and Environmental Performance on Tax Disclosure in CSR Reports,"This study explores how and why firms voluntarily discuss taxes in corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports. Using a textual analysis approach, we analyze 2,984 CSR reports from 22 countries to identify tax disclosures, including instances of firms explicitly relating taxes to CSR (“socially responsible tax disclosures”). We find that on average firms provide limited tax information and tend to use disclosures portraying tax payments as beneficial for society rather than presenting strategies to ensure socially responsible tax behavior. When examining possible influences on firms’ disclosure decisions, we find robust evidence of a negative association between socially responsible tax disclosures and environmental performance, consistent with firms using the disclosures to build or repair reputational capital. We also find some evidence of a positive association between socially responsible tax disclosures and tax avoidance, particularly among U.S. firms. Our results should be useful for standard setters and readers of CSR reports. © 2023 American Accounting Association. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy as a tool for identification of counterfeit Viagra tablets and guide for develop new identification approach of falsified product,"Counterfeit drugs are a global problem that is directly related to the safety and effectiveness of pharmacotherapy. The black market for counterfeit products is constantly growing and related to the wide availability through online shopping. Therefore, there is a constant need to develop analytical methods that would allow for the unambiguous identification of counterfeit products from the original ones. One of such techniques is solid-state NMR spectroscopy, which allows for direct registration and analysis of spectra of multicomponent solid forms of pharmaceutical formulations. The paper explores the possibility of using this technique in the identification of counterfeit Viagra tablets. In this study, solid-state NMR has been used to detect the non-pharmacopoeial cellulose present in the samples of counterfeit Viagra tablets. Besides, the NMR results allowed to develop a rapid dying technique that can be used to distinguish between the counterfeit and original drug. It has been shown that solid-state NMR spectroscopy allows for numerous analyses such as identification of counterfeit products, assessment of the composition of analyte, estimation of qualitative differences between the original and falsified product, and the development of simple analytical methods based on tablets composition differences. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Guardians of the forests: How should an indigenous community in eastern Bolivia defend their land and forests under increasing political and economic pressures?,"Many indigenous communities across Latin America depend on forests for livelihood. In eastern Bolivia, indigenous communities face increasing challenges in forest management due to insecure land tenure, lack of capacity, and state policies that favor extractivism and export-oriented agriculture. This case study examines the dilemma of forest management in the Guarayos Indigenous Territory, with a particular focus on the influence of conflictive policies under Evo Morales administration. Using a combination of literature reviews, semi-structured interviews, and land use/land cover analysis, we investigated the drivers behind the challenges that the Guarayos indigenous community is facing in the forest and land governance and explore potential solutions. We found that deforestation within the Guarayos Indigenous Territory from 2000 to 2017 was primarily driven by agricultural commodity production. Despite its promises on protecting nature and the indigenous peoples, the government weakened the Guarayos indigenous people's governance capacity through failure of forest law enforcement, prioritization of extractivism and export-oriented agriculture, and support for land titling of external entities. We presented these findings through a case narrative featuring the president of Guarayos indigenous government as the decision-maker.

Developing a new framework for conceptualizing the emerging sustainable community-based tourism using an extended interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy SWARA-MULTIMOORA,"During these years, the sustainable Community-Based Tourism (CBT) notion has received more attention in the context of the tourism industry. Sustainable CBT mainly emphasizes social, environmental, and cultural sustainability and gives power to local communities in any aspect of tourism management. This manuscript aims to propose a novel approach to examine the current status of sustainable CBT in the Indian Himalayan region context. In this regard, a comprehensive framework was developed using experts’ opinions, and the relevant literature in tourism studies was reviewed based on sustainable CBT. To this end, this study proposed an integrated decision-making method using Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and MULTIMOORA (Multiple Objective Optimization based on the Ratio Analysis plus Full Multiplicative Form) under Interval-Valued Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (IVPFSs). Additionally, some comparisons were discussed with the outcomes obtained from the developed approach and those of extant ones to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model. To confirm the applicability of the proposed IVPF-SWARA-MULTIMOORA approach to real-world decision-making problems, a sustainable CBT problem was considered as a case study. The final results confirmed the efficiency of the proposed approach as well as its consistency with the existing ones. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Beyond catching fish: exploring community-based management efforts to restore a subarctic lake in Norway,"Across the world, local communities are actively engaging in management and monitoring of natural resources. The underlying driver of most community-driven efforts goes beyond the utilizations of natural resources to entail a deeper relation to the place or ecosystem they are managing. The aim of this study was to understand what motivates a local volunteer group to spend considerable amount of time and resources to manage and restore a subarctic lake. We used a case study approach combining analysis of documents, participant observation and semi-structured interviews to explore their narrative. The findings show that values, such as care, responsibility, and stewardship, were the primary motivation of this effort and its ultimate goal. The project also promoted relational values like social cohesion, cultural identity, and knowledge-sharing. Despite no longer being essential for subsistence, the lake retains cultural and social significance, highlighting the need to document informal community-based monitoring and management practices for understanding ecological dynamics. The implications include the importance of recognizing relational values in shaping behavior toward nature for achieving sustainability. © 2025 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Transformative research and education in Living Labs using the SDGs as a compass,"Purpose: This study aims to investigate how Living Labs of Van Hall Larenstein UAS perform as sustainability-oriented, transdisciplinary learning environments. It shows how the sustainable development goals (SDGs) can be used as a compass and debates the sustainability impact of applied research. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach was adopted, including a literature review, scoping visits, online workshops and peer-to-peer inter-vision/learning, using the SDGs as a compass and framework for analysis. Findings: Most Living Labs use a “silo-approach” on the SDGs and are designed from a technological-expert perspective. This results in blind spots, particularly on SDGs related to reducing socio-economic inequality and just institutions. Debating unsustainable systems, cultures and practices is avoided. To contribute to sustainability transitions, universities need to invest in developing transformative capacity. This refers to SDG-transition competences such as collaborative communication, constructively engaging with diversity and conflicts, discussing values, norms and ethics and encouraging reflexivity. Research limitations/implications: Mainly lecturer-researchers were involved in the study. COVID-19 travel restrictions hindered the research at the grassroots level in India and Indonesia. Originality/value: The study revealed the importance of creating Living Labs as safe and brave inter- and transdisciplinary learning environments to practice reflexivity: encouraging students, researchers and stakeholders to look at sustainability issues from plural perspectives and questioning unsustainable practices, which combined lead to changing perceptions, practices and relations and a deeper understanding of how change happens.

Investing in wetland restoration: Practical guidance and looking ahead,"Ramsar sites and other wetlands around the globe have been degraded by various anthropogenic activities and would benefit from targeted wetland restoration efforts. Although the Ramsar Convention has stressed the ‘wise use’ of wetlands and has published many documents on the principles and importance of wetland restoration, some Ramsar site managers and their restoration practitioners may lack guidance on the applied techniques they need to effectively restore wetland systems. The planning, design, and implementation of projects that restore the processes needed to sustain healthy wetlands require a thorough understanding of the site, watershed, and needs of stakeholders; clear goals and measurable objectives, with appropriate performance standards; and a detailed work plan, especially for sites requiring earthwork. The availability and systematic sharing of technical guidance for the practice of wetland restoration will improve project outcomes on Ramsar sites and other important wetlands. It also aligns with the Convention’s priority of encouraging holistic approaches to restoration, which can be bolstered by better engaging the general public about the need and benefits of restoration, making long-term commitments to restoration projects, and planning for climate change. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Trust or robustness? An ecological approach to the study of auction and bilateral markets,"Centralized markets are often considered more efficient than bilateral exchanges because information is public and the same for all the agents. On decentralized markets, where the information is private, the influence of trust on the market outcome has been underlined by many authors. We present an empirical study of the distinctive Boulogne-sur-Mer Fish Market (where both buyers and sellers can choose to trade by either bidding or bargaining), focused on the interactions between agents. Our approach is inspired by studies of mutualistic ecosystems, where the agents are of two different types (as in plant-pollinator networks) and the interactions only take place between agents of different kinds, naturally providing benefits to both. In our context, where the two kinds of agents are buyers and sellers, our study shows that not only do their interactions bring economic benefits for the agents directly involved, but they also contribute to the stability of the market. Our results help to explain the surprising coexistence of the two forms of market in the distinctive Boulogne sur Mer Fish Market. © 2018 Hernández et al.

The significance of different health institutions and their respective contributions of active pharmaceutical ingredients to wastewater,"Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have been frequently found in the environment. It is, however, still not quite clear who is mainly responsible for API emissions. Hospitals have been considered to be the main contributing point sources for wastewater (WW) discharge of APIs. However, recent studies have shown that the contribution of hospitals to the input of APIs into the aquatic environment is quite low. Due to demographic change and the increase of psychiatric diseases, health institutions (HIs) such as psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes are likely to be important sources as well, but no data is available in this respect. This study aims to assess the impact of HIs and to provide a methodology to measure their respective contributions. Drawing on pharmaceutical consumption data for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012, this study identified API usage patterns for a psychiatric hospital (146 beds), a nursing home (286 inhabitants), and a general hospital (741 beds), the latter of which comprises three separate locations. All the HIs are located in two sub-regions of a county district with about 400,000 citizens in southwestern Germany. A selection of neurological drugs was quantified in the sewer of these facilities to evaluate the correlation between consumption and emission. The API contribution of HIs was assessed by comparing the specific consumption in the facilities with the consumption in households, expressed as the emission potential (IEP). The study shows that the usage patterns of APIs in the psychiatric hospital and the nursing home were different from the general hospital. Neurological drugs such as anticonvulsants, psycholeptics, and psychoanaleptics were mainly consumed in the psychiatric hospital and the nursing home (74% and 65%, respectively). Predicted and average measured concentrations in the effluent of the investigated HIs differed mostly by less than one order of magnitude. Therefore, the consumption-based approach is a useful method to assess usage patterns of APIs in HIs and to predict their respective contributions to WW. The national contribution of HIs on total WW discharge of APIs compared to households was very low. Only the results for the sedative clomethiazole in general hospitals as well as the antidepressant moclobemide and the antipsychotic quetiapine for the nursing homes were found to deserve some attention. The regional comparison showed that in sub-regions with a comparably higher density of HIs, the allocated facilities could be seen as point sources emitting particular APIs. However, in general, the bulk of the consumed pharmaceuticals to WW discharge has to be attributed to households. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Meeting 2030 primary energy and economic growth goals: Mission impossible?,"To meet climate change mitigation objectives, international institutions have adopted targets aimed at reducing or ending growth of primary energy consumption. Simultaneously, continued economic growth is forecasted to meet human development goals. Together, declining energy consumption and rising gross domestic product (GDP)is called “absolute decoupling.” However, absolute decoupling is unprecedented for the world economy as a whole (since at least 1971). Is absolute decoupling “Mission impossible?” Given the high stakes, we need a clearer understanding of the extent of future energy–GDP decoupling. To gain that understanding, we perform societal exergy analyses using a novel Physical Supply Use Table framework to assess historical and future trends of primary energy consumption and economic growth for one medium human development index country and one very high human development index country, Ghana and the United Kingdom (UK), respectively. Three key results are obtained. First, we find that it will be very difficult to absolutely decouple primary energy consumption from economic activity. This is particularly true for Ghana's rapidly growing economy, where projected economic growth of 5.0 %/year will require growth of primary energy consumption of around 2.0 %/year. It is also true for the UK, where at best primary energy consumption appears constant into the future to provide a projected GDP growth of 2.7 %/year. Second, we find that energy efficiency is not an effective means to reduce primary energy consumption and associated carbon dioxide emissions due to economy-wide feedback effects, placing greater importance on decarbonizing the primary energy supply. Third, we find primary energy intensity is not an appropriate metric to measure energy reduction progress, because meeting primary energy intensity targets does not ensure absolute decoupling will occur. At present, absolute decoupling appears to be mission impossible. © 2019 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"Does small-scale organic farming contribute to the local environment—a case study in suburban shanghai, china","Small-scale organic farming is developing rapidly in China, especially in suburbs of megacities, and enriches the connotation of urban agriculture–. Much attention has been paid to the socio-economic aspects of small-scale organic farming and takes for granted that it contributes to the local environment and the sustainable agriculture while little has been explored regarding its actual environmental contributions and associated influencing factors, especially in those rapid developing suburb areas. Based on the case study of three small-scale organic farms in the suburbs of Shanghai, we examined uncertificated organic farming practices, focusing on the farm diversity, fertilization and pest control without chemical inputs, and the restoration of biosystems. Potential of environmental contributions were evaluated from the production perspective of input reductions. It was found that such uncertificated small-scale organic farming does contribute to the local water environment, helping improve soil quality, and gradual recovery of farm biodiversity. However, all the environmental benefits are fragile and highly dependent on the profit availability and professional knowledge of the farm as well as the availability of policy supports. © 2021 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of voluntary sustainability standards in governing the supply of mineral raw materials,"Numerous voluntary standards for minerals have been developed as a reaction to social and environmental problems in mining. These vary considerably in their requirements and the design affecting their acceptance among stakeholders. As such, the voluntary standards play a subordinate role in sustainable finance compared with environment, social, and governance ratings; yet, they have been found to be effective for managing the supply chain of minerals and its single parts. Still, despite the heterogeneity of the voluntary standards, the goals pursued by applying them can be subsumed into the following structure: 1. solving focal sustainability issues to pave the way among global mining stakeholders to 2. a particular or 3. general common ground. This tripartite distinction is used to identify potential transformation paths to make voluntary standards even more effective, especially regard ing sustainable finance and supply chain management. These components encompass harmonization and consolidation, (better) integration of (further) sustainability issues, and a broader involvement of stakeholder groups. © 2019 M.Hiete et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Social enterprise as a potential niche innovation breakout for low carbon transition,"While there is growing consensus that human behaviours need to change to a more sustainable paradigm, community driven approaches, such as social enterprise, have yet to be explored as serious instruments of sustainability transition. Social enterprises sit within the third sector of the economy, typically where market or governmental failures exist in the provision of social welfare, and have increasingly become a key driver of social progress. The autonomous nature of the social-economic model applied by such organisations can represent a viable means to reduce state social welfare dependence, and is a proven model for social change. The capability of social enterprises to create both social and economic value is considered a ‘win-win’. Yet there are clear potentials for social enterprise models to be more extensively applied to address contemporary ecological challenges of neo-liberal market economies, moving towards ‘win-win-win’ outcomes across social, economic and ecological domains. This paper investigates the value of social enterprises as drivers of low-carbon transition at the community level, with an emphasis on the energy sector. Evidence from seven organisations in the UK is presented and a socio-technical transitions conceptual framework is applied to analyse these social enterprise operations as a form of social innovation. © 2018 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Perspectives for photobiology in molecular solar fuels,"This paper presents an overview of the prospects for bio-solar energy conversion. The Global Artificial Photosynthesis meeting at Lord Howe Island (1418 August 2011) underscored the dependence that the world has placed on non-renewable energy supplies, particularly for transport fuels, and highlighted the potential of solar energy. Biology has used solar energy for free energy gain to drive chemical reactions for billions of years. The principal conduits for energy conversion on earth are photosynthetic reaction centres but can they be harnessed, copied and emulated? In this communication, we initially discuss algal-based biofuels before investigating bio-inspired solar energy conversion in artificial and engineered systems. We show that the basic design and engineering principles for assembling photocatalytic proteins can be used to assemble nanocatalysts for solar fuel production. © CSIRO 2012.",Not About Sufficiency
"Sustainable forest management in a mountain region in the Central Western Carpathians, northeastern Slovakia: the role of climate change","European forestry is facing many challenges, including the need to adapt to climate change and an unprecedented increase in forest damage. We investigated these challenges in a Norway spruce-dominated mountain region in Central Europe. We used the model Sibyla to explore forest biomass production to the year 2100 under climate change and under two alternative management systems: the currently applied management (CM), which strives to actively improve the forest’s adaptive capacity, and no management (NM) as a reference. Because biodiversity is thought to have mostly positive effects on the adaptive capacity of forests and on the quality of ecosystem services, we explored how climate change and management affect indicators of biodiversity. We found a differential response across the elevation-climatic gradient, including a drought-induced decrease in biomass production over large areas. With CM, the support of non-spruce species and the projected improvement of their growth increased tree species diversity. The promotion of species with higher survival rates led to a decrease in forest damage relative to both the present conditions and NM. NM preserved the high density of over-matured spruce trees, which caused forest damage to increase. An abundance of dead wood and large standing trees, which can increase biodiversity, increased with NM. Our results suggest that commercial spruce forests, which are not actively adapted to climate change, tend to preserve their monospecific composition at a cost of increased forest damage. The persisting high rates of damage along with the adverse effects of climate change make the prospects of such forests uncertain. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Not About Sufficiency
Determinants of renewable energy consumption in the Fifth Technology Revolutions: Evidence from ASEAN countries,"This study aims to investigate the factors of renewable energy consumption in the fifth Technology Revolution with specific evidence from ASEAN countries. The study applies an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach. The paper also uses the unrestricted fixed and random panel data methods. The manuscript identifies significant factors such as technological innovation, governmental policies, public awareness, electricity consumption, country population, foreign direct investment inflows, imports, exports, and economic growth that have influenced the renewable energy sector in these nations. This study also investigates the determinants that influence renewable energy in the context of international integration and the fifth technology revolution in ASEAN countries. The research analyzes data spanning two decades, from 2000 to 2022, through a combination of econometric modeling and machine learning techniques. Preliminary findings indicate that technological innovation, government policies, and public awareness significantly affect renewable energy consumption in these countries. The empirical results offer insights for policymakers and stakeholders in leveraging technological advancements for sustainable energy development. The findings from this study on the determinants of renewable consumption in the context of the Fifth Technology Revolution in ASEAN countries also have several important policy implications for the sustainable development goal. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Outcome-based cooperation: In communities, business, regulation, and dispute resolution","How do we cooperate - in social, local, business, and state communities? This book proposes an Outcome-Based Cooperative Model, in which all stakeholders work together on the basis of trust and respect to achieve shared aims and outcomes. The Outcome-Based Cooperative Model is built up from an extensive analysis of behavioural and social psychology, genetic anthropology, research into behaviour and culture in societies, organisations, regulation, and enforcement. The starting point is acceptance that humanity is facing ever larger risks, which are now systemic and even existential. To overcome the challenges, humans need to cooperate more, rather than compete, alienate, or draw apart. Answering how we do that requires basing ourselves, our institutions, and systems on relationships that are built on trust. Trust is based on evidence that we can be trusted to behave well (ethically), built up over time. We should aim to agree common goals and outcomes, moderating those that conflict, produce evidence that we can be trusted, and examine our performance in achieving the right outcomes, rather than harmful ones. The implications are that we need to do more in rebasing our relationships in local groupings, business organisations, regulation, and dispute resolution. The book examines recent systems and developments in all these areas, and makes proposals of profound importance for reform. This is a new blueprint for liberty, solidarity, performance, and achievement. © Christopher Hodges, 2022. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
The effect of home-based neuromuscular electrical stimulation-resistance training and protein supplementation on lean mass in persons with spinal cord injury: A pilot study,"In persons with a spinal cord injury (SCI), resistance training using neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES-RT) increases lean mass in the lower limbs. However, whether protein supplementation in conjunction with NMES-RT further enhances this training effect is unknown. In this randomized controlled pilot trial, 15 individuals with chronic SCI engaged in 3 times/week NMES-RT, with (NMES+PRO, n = 8) or without protein supplementation (NMES, n = 7), for 12 weeks. Before and after the intervention, whole body and regional body composition (DXA) and fasting glucose and insulin concentrations were assessed in plasma. Adherence to the intervention components was ≥96%. Thigh lean mass was increased to a greater extent after NMES+PRO compared to NMES (0.3 (0.2, 0.4) kg; p < 0.001). Furthermore, fasting insulin concentration and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) were decreased similarly in both groups (fasting insulin: 1 [−9, 11] pmol∙L−1; HOMA-IR: 0.1 [−0.3, 0.5] AU; both p ≥ 0.617). Twelve weeks of home-based NMES-RT increased thigh lean mass, an effect that was potentiated by protein supplementation. In combination with the excellent adherence and apparent improvement in cardiometabolic health outcomes, these findings support further investigation through a full-scale randomized controlled trial. © 2024 The Author(s).

Accessing biological control genetic resources: the United States perspective,"The USA has been actively involved in classical biological control projects against invasive insect pests and weeds since 1888. Classical (importation) biological control relies upon natural enemies associated through coevolution with their target species at their geographic origin to also provide long-term, self-sustaining management where the pest/weed has become invasive. Biological control agents are a form of genetic resources and fall under the purview of the 1993 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Nagoya Protocol (NP), which entered into force in 2014 to address equitable sharing of benefits arising from utilization of genetic resources. Safe and effective classical biological control agents have historically been shared among countries experiencing problems with invasive species. However, a feature of the Nagoya Protocol is that countries are expected to develop processes governing access to their genetic resources to ensure that the benefits are shared equitably—a concept referred to as “access and benefit sharing” (ABS). Although the USA is not party to the CBD nor the NP, US biological control programs are affected by these international agreements. Surveying, collecting, exporting and importing of natural enemies may be covered by new ABS regulatory processes. Challenges of ABS have arisen as various countries enact new regulations (or not) governing access to genetic resources, and the processes for gaining access and sharing the benefits from these resources have become increasingly complex. In the absence of an overarching national US policy, individual government agencies and institutions follow their own internal procedures. Biological control practitioners in the USA have been encouraged in recent years to observe best practices developed by the biological community for insect and weed biological control. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",Not About Sufficiency

Tube-dwelling invertebrates: Tiny ecosystem engineers have large effects in lake ecosystems,"There is ample evidence that tube-dwelling invertebrates such as chironomids significantly alter multiple important ecosystem functions, particularly in shallow lakes. Chironomids pump large water volumes, and associated suspended and dissolved substances, through the sediment and thereby compete with pelagic filter feeders for particulate organic matter. This can exert a high grazing pressure on phytoplankton, microorganisms, and perhaps small zooplankton and thus strengthen benthic-pelagic coupling. Furthermore, intermittent pumping by tube-dwelling invertebrates oxygenates sediments and creates a dynamic, three-dimensional mosaic of redox conditions. This shapes microbial community composition and spatial distribution, and alters microbe-mediated biogeochemical functions, which often depend on redox potential. As a result, extended hotspots of element cycling occur at the oxic-anoxic interfaces, controlling the fate of organic matter and nutrients as well as fluxes of nutrients between sediments and water. Surprisingly, the mechanisms and magnitude of interactions mediated by these organisms are still poorly understood. To provide a synthesis of the importance of tube-dwelling invertebrates, we review existing research and integrate previously disregarded functional traits into an ecosystem model. Based on existing research and our models, we conclude that tube-dwelling invertebrates play a central role in controlling water column nutrient pools, and hence water quality and trophic state. Furthermore, these tiny ecosystem engineers can influence the thresholds that determine shifts between alternate clear and turbid states of shallow lakes. The large effects stand in contrast to the conventional limnological paradigm emphasizing predominantly pelagic food webs. Given the vast number of shallow lakes worldwide, benthic invertebrates are likely to be relevant drivers of biogeochemical processes at regional and global scales, thereby mediating feedback mechanisms linked to climate change. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.",Not About Sufficiency
Walking the talk: The business case for sustainable development,"Ten years on from the Rio Earth Summit, world leaders will gather again in Johannesburg for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in September. As planetary anxieties about globalization, poverty and climate change grow, where does the international business community stand? Are they a barrier to change or an engine for it? One outcome of Rio was Changing Course, the hugely influential book by Swiss industrialist Stephan Schmidheiny, which argued that business needed to be part of the solution to global environmental degradation. Now, Schmidheiny has joined with fellow prime movers in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD - the key business organization focusing on policy research and development in this crucial area), Chad Holliday, Chairman and CEO of DuPont; and Philip Watts, Chairman of Shell; to spell out the real business case for addressing sustainable development as a key strategic issue. The results are ground-breaking. For the first time, leading industrialists are arguing that not only is sustainable development good for business, the solving of environmental and social problems is essential for future growth. Drawing on a wealth of case studies and personal interviews from business leaders operating around the world, Walking the Talk clearly demonstrates that the vanguard who have operationalized leading-edge environmental and social initiatives are benefiting in a myriad of ways that benefit the bottom line - and the planet. The book argues that the time for rhetoric is over. The business of business has changed. Even more remarkably, the authors insist that a global partnership - between governments, business and civil society - is essential, if accelerating moves towards globalization are to maximize opportunities for all - especially the world's poor. As Chad Holliday recently stated in an address to the United Nations: ""Given existing technology and products, for all six billion people on the planet to live like the average American, we would require the equivalent of three planet Earths to provide the material, create the energy and dispose of the waste."" Such an option is evidently not available and the book argues that far more eco-efficient and socially equitable modes of development must be pursued in order to allow poorer nations to raise their standards of living The solution provided by Walking the Talk is to mobilize markets in favour of sustainability, leveraging the power of innovation and global markets for the benefits of everyone - not just the developed world. This means a further liberalization of the market-a move that would be condemned by anti-globalization protestors. Yet, as the authors argue, business cannot succeed in failing societies. When the global market fails poor countries, where most of the world's people live, it will also eventually fail business. Subsidies for rich countries' products and tariffs against poor countries' products do not constitute a ""free"" market, or one that best serves people or business. Similarly, governments cannot subsidize fossil fuels or water and expect businesses, or ordinary citizens, to use them efficiently. So, a new, fair and equitable market is needed. A market that can work for all. The authors therefore call on protestors against globalization to stop protesting against the market and instead to campaign instead against the perverse policies that impoverish people and their environment. Walking the Talk explores the opportunities and challenges inherent in eco-efficiency (producing more with less), corporate social responsibility, and a transparent, ""wired"" world where reputations can be irreversibly damaged - or enhanced - in real time. It also devotes a chapter to ways in which corporations can and must ""learn to change"". It examines the new partnerships needed among companies, governments, and civil society to produce real change, and the ways in which these alliances can work for all concerned. And it argues that consumer choice and consumer information should be encouraged as a positive force for sustainable development. Only what is valued is carefully used and so creating markets for environmental goods and services may be the best way to protect scarce resources. This is especially true in efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change, where business-like approaches, such as the development of carbon trading, offer workable solutions to policy-makers. Whether small, medium or large, all businesses must innovate and change to meet the social and environmental challenges of the coming years. Walking the Talk provides a broad set of proven roadmaps to success as well as real-life inspiration for business to embrace the real challenge - to build a global economy that works for all the world's people. © .

Sustainable campus using concept mapping: a bottom-up approach engaging both staff and students,"Purpose: This paper aims to highlight a multidimensional model of sustainability practices that are considered meaningful and practical for implementation by higher education institutions (HEIs). Design/methodology/approach: The Concept System® Global MAX© software facilitated the bottom-up approach of this study, where 32 staff and students of a private HEI were prompted with the question, “What design features or facilities should the university building have for you to consider the building sustainable?” Their opinions were collected as statements via online brainstorming and the process was followed through with the sorting and rating of reduced statements. The software was also used to perform multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis to generate the findings of this study. Findings: An eight-cluster solution was proposed based on the themes within respective clusters. Respondents rated the importance of sustainability resource usage and sustainability and technology highly. Whilst sustainable campus facilities appeal to students, education for sustainable development were more important to staff.

Navigating the climate challenges in Africa: Exploring the synergy and threshold effects of renewable energy and foreign direct investment on climate risk,"Renewable energy is widely acknowledged as an essential response to climate change, which poses a severe threat to humanity and natural ecosystems. Drawing from the greenhouse theory of climate change and the pollution haven hypothesis, this study contributes to the literature by addressing three critical issues. First, we examine the effect of renewable energy on climate risk. Second, we explore the intervening role of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the renewable energy-climate risk nexus. Third, we determine the minimum threshold required for renewable energy to minimise climate risk. The analysis was based on 47 African countries and estimated using the generalised method of moments (GMM) and dynamic panel threshold regression techniques. The GMM technique is essential due to its ability to address endogeneity issues in the model. Also, the dynamic panel threshold technique is employed because it is built on the principles of GMM and provides an estimate of the threshold level and nonlinearities in the model. The empirical evidence presents a significant negative relationship, suggesting that renewable energy minimises the surge in climate risk in Africa. Second, the findings reveal that the weakening effect of renewable energy on climate risk is contingent on FDI. Third, the dynamic panel threshold results demonstrate that the minimum threshold required for renewable energy to reduce climate risk is 56%. Beyond this level, renewable energy presents a significant negative impact, implying that high renewable energy consumption lessens climate risk. Policy recommendations for boosting renewable energy consumption to alleviate climate risk have been provided. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"Life cycle sustainability assessment of higher alcohol: energy, environmental, and social indicators","One of the most current discussions in the transportation sector is air pollution caused by diesel engines. In fact, even with the advances in engine technologies, the combustion of diesel in internal combustion engines leads to the significant release of toxic gases into the atmosphere, such as particulate matter and nitrogen oxide, posing threats to human health and the environment. Although researchers proposed replacing petroleum-based diesel with bio-based diesel, technical, environmental, and economic challenges make their sustainability questionable. In line with that, more sustainable techniques have been introduced to reduce the toxic gas emissions from diesel combustion. Modifying diesel properties using fuel additives or reformulation is a straightforward and economical alternative among these techniques. Various additives, such as oxygenated, cetane number improvers, metal-based compounds, antioxidants, lubricity improvers, and cold flow improvers, are commercially used to improve diesel properties. Among these, higher alcohols as oxygenated additives due to their higher oxygen content and latent heat than diesel can shift the combustion process toward lower temperatures, lowering particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions. Despite the promising results offered by higher alcohols as fuel additives for diesel, the sustainability of their production from an environmental, economic, and social point of view should not be neglected. In better words, the decision-making process should not focus on the effects of higher alcohols on exhaust pollutants only, but also it should consider the principles of sustainable development in the background process of higher alcohols, that is, a cradle-to-grave approach. Life cycle sustainability assessment is a valuable tool to address this problem through systematical evaluation of environmental, economic, and social background processes or production of higher alcohols. This chapter aims to better understand the environmental, economic, and social aspects of higher alcohol production based on a life cycle sustainability assessment approach. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Challenges in adoption and wide use of agroforestry technologies in Africa and pathways for improvement: A systematic review,"In recent years, agroforestry technologies have emerged as promising alternative measures for addressing major environmental crises. However, their use in Africa remains below anticipated levels. Therefore, this systematic review aims to investigate the underlying reasons for the low adoption and limited use of such technologies in Africa. Employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses protocol (PRISMA), we conducted a comprehensive search for relevant scientific papers in databases such as Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science. A total of 351 articles were initially identified. Following the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 36 articles were selected from which data were manually extracted for inclusion in this review. Descriptive statistics were employed to assess the farmers’ perceptions of agroforestry technologies and the constraints they face when adopting them. Several constraints were identified, and the top five constraints were pests, problems of land access, lack of knowledge and skills, lack of capital and lack of seeds. To maximise the adoption of agroforestry technologies in Africa, it is imperative to introduce the technologies by considering the local context, the specific needs of farmers and the existing socio-economic dynamics. Such initiatives must include robust training and education programmes, accessible financing solutions, appropriate land tenure reforms and effective support mechanisms for access to seed and pest management. These factors could considerably improve the adoption and effectiveness of agroforestry technologies in Africa, thereby contributing to more sustainable and resilient agricultural practices. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
How's life?: Measuring well-being,"Every person aspires to a good life. But what does ""a good or a better life"" mean? This report looks at the most important aspects that shape people's lives and well-being: income, jobs, housing, health, work and life-balance, education, social connections, civic engagement and governance, environment, personal security and subjective well-being. It paints a comprehensive picture of well-being in OECD countries and other major economies, by looking at people's material living conditions and quality of life across the population. The report responds to the needs of citizens for better information on well-being and of policy makers to give a more accurate picture of societal progress. The report finds that well-being has increased on average over the past fifteen years: people are richer and more likely to be employed; they enjoy better housing conditions and are exposed to lower air pollution; they live longer and are more educated; they are also exposed to fewer crimes. But differences across countries are large. Furthermore, some groups of the population, particularly less educated and low-income people, tend to fare systematically worse in all dimensions of well-being considered in this report: for instance they live shorter lives and report greater health problems; their children obtain worse school results; they participate less in political activities; they can rely on lower social networks in case of needs; they are more exposed to crime and pollution; they tend to be less satisfied with their life as a whole than more educated and higher-income people. How's Life? is part of the OECD Better Life Initiative, launched by the Organization on the occasion of its 50th Anniversary.

Alternative to oil and gas: Review of economic benefits and potential of wind power in Pakistan,"Pakistan is one of those countries that are heavily dependent on hydrocarbon fuel for energy production. This results in severe CO2 emissions that lead to climate change. Although renewable energy resources such as wind are available in abundance, they have not been fully utilized and so energy crises in Pakistan increase every year. This study focuses on using wind energy as an alternative to thermal power sources as the main source of power generation in Pakistan. This research also helps in designing a project management tool to prioritize sources of power generation, including both renewables and nonrenewables, while also considering projects’ technical, environmental, social and economic criteria. An Analytical Hierarchy Process has been used to analyze the four main criteria and 12 subcriteria. The analysis revealed that wind energy is the best source among all options for power generation source, followed by solar. Oil, gas, and coal, the other three alternatives, were well below in a comparative analysis. Gas achieves overall better performance if only economic criteria are considered, but due to shortfalls in availability and diminishing reserves, this source is also not feasible. Relying on wind power as the only energy source will not be technically possible, but it can become a leading energy source inside Pakistan. This will reduce the burden on thermal energy sources and make the country more energy-secure, rather than relying heavily on imported oil and gas, as it currently does. Wind power generation capacity in Pakistan is increasing, so that the cumulative capacity is around 2118 MW installed and commissioned by the end of 2018.

"Exploring the relationships between attitudes toward emission trading schemes, artificial intelligence, climate entrepreneurship, and sustainable performance","The research objective of this research paper is to examine the relationships between organizational commitment to emission trading schemes, artificial intelligence, and climate entrepreneurship, as well as their impact on sustainable performance, i.e., environmental and organizational performance in organizations. This study aims to identify the key drivers and barriers to the adoption of these factors and to understand how they influence environmental and organizational performance. The study utilizes a cause-and-effect design on the sampled size of 387 subjects and employs the Smart PLS version 4.0 statistical tool to estimate the interactions between all constructs in the structural equation modeling. The research questions aim to explore the key drivers and barriers to the adoption of these factors in organization and their impact on sustainable performance, i.e., environmental and organizational performance. The study hypothesizes that organizational commitment to emission trading schemes, AI, and climate entrepreneurship has a positive impact on sustainable performances such as environmental and organizational performance. The findings suggest that attitudes toward AI and emission trading schemes have a direct impact on climate entrepreneurship, environmental performance, and organizational performance. By considering these factors together, the study seeks to uncover the synergistic effects and potential interactions between them and sheds light on their combined influence on environmental and organizational performance. Organizations can enhance environmental and organizational performance by prioritizing their attitudes toward emission trading schemes, AI, and climate entrepreneurship through resource allocation, technology investment, and fostering a climate entrepreneurship mindset. The research concludes that businesses that demonstrate high organizational commitment, positive attitude toward the ETS, and a focus on climate entrepreneurship experiences improved environmental and organizational performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Cross-domain fault diagnosis for multimode green ammonia synthesis process based on DA-CycleGAN,"Green ammonia is a crucial strategy for reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable development. However, in industrial applications, the production load of the ammonia synthesis section must be adjusted to accommodate fluctuations in renewable energy generation and hydrogen production. Consequently, the green ammonia synthesis process operates under multiple conditions with varying production loads. The operations of this multimode process introduce new challenges for process safety. Traditional fault diagnosis methods experience significant performance degradation when production conditions change. In new conditions, only a small number of normal samples can be obtained, and no fault samples are available. To address this issue, a novel transfer learning method named DA-CycleGAN is proposed for the multimode green ammonia synthesis process. This method combines a two-dimensional generation model based on CycleGAN (Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks) with domain adaptation to enhance model performance in cross-domain tasks. The feasibility of the proposed method was initially validated using the benchmark Tennessee-Eastman process for fault diagnosis. Subsequently, a case study of the green ammonia synthesis process demonstrated that it significantly enhances performance in multimode processes, ensuring process safety and reducing losses for industrial applications. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers",Not About Sufficiency
Bioprospecting and exploration of extremophilic enzymes in bioremediation of wastewater polluted,"Water, covering three-quarters of the Earth, is crucial for life and ecosystems and is also essential in industrial processes. However, most aquatic environments are polluted due to the massive discharge of wastewater with high pollutant loads, which threatens ecosystem health. To mitigate this environmental impact, humans have tried various physical and chemical strategies, but increased wastewater and reagents have the disadvantage of generating more waste, making it an environmentally unsustainable problem. Governments are now focusing on integrating living organisms or biological treatments to reduce or mitigate pollutants in contaminated matrices. Microbial biodiversity is being studied through bioprospecting strategies and the search for new microorganisms capable of biodegrading pollutants. Extremophilic microbes, which have undergone evolutionary processes and exhibited adaptive traits, have the potential to transform harmful contaminants into beneficial resources and improve their tolerance mechanisms to complex pollutants. This chapter aims to provide updated information on sustainable wastewater bioremediation processes using extremophilic microorganisms and their enzymes, considering their properties, characteristics, stability, and biodegradation capacity.

To bridge this gap, using the difference in differences method, this paper aims to provide insights on how HSR affects green innovation from the perspective of innovation factor mobility, by employing the 108 cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt of China in 2005–2016. The main findings are as follows: (1) Although the effects derived from HSR are heterogeneous, HSR significantly drives green innovation efficiency by 11.3%, which reveals that HSR is a critical variable for understanding the growth of green innovation. (2) This paper presents evidence that HSR promotes the mobility of innovative factors and then contributes to green innovation efficiency, based on which heterogeneity is explored. (3) HSR's effect on green innovation efficiency has a dynamic experience over time and shows an inverted U-shaped curve characterized by “increased first and then decreased,” which peaks in the 5th or 6th year. (4) Green innovation growth effects of HSR have spatial proximity: for every 1% increase in distance, the green innovation effect decreases by 0.0061%–0.0124%. A farther distance to an HSR station induces a lower growth effect. (5) This paper concludes with recommendations to improve green innovation through HSR construct and innovative factor mobility. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Allocation of the Carbon Emission Abatement Target in Low Carbon Supply Chain Considering Power Structure,"The proposal of China’s dual carbon strategy is not only a kind of pressure but also an opportunity for enterprises. Both upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain pay more attention to carbon emission reduction, and consumers are gradually turning to a low-carbon preference. How carbon reduction targets are allocated among supply chain members with different technical efficiency and market opportunities will directly affect supply chain performance and social welfare. Power structure is an important factor that dominates the decision-making of the supply chain, so we establish the low-carbon supply chain model under three different power structures: manufacturer-led, retailer-led, and power pairs between two parties. We study the government distribution decisions of carbon emissions reduction targets under different supply chain power structures and discuss the influence of supply chain power structures on carbon emissions reduction distribution decisions and social welfare. The study found that if the carbon emissions reduction target increases, the government will adjust the allocation strategy to increase the proportion of enterprises whose emissions cuts have less impact on market demand. The study also found that the government will allocate more emissions reduction to enterprises with higher emissions reduction efficiency, and enterprises whose emissions reductions have a greater impact on market demand. When supply chain enterprises have equal power, the supply chain will have greater social welfare and market demand, but not necessarily greater supply chain profits. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Dual-mode strategy for glyphosate detection: Leveraging competitive interaction with iron and zinc-organic frameworks,"The extensive use of glyphosate poses a potential threat to food safety, human health, and the ecological environment. Hence, detecting glyphosate residues in food is of great significance for food safety. In this work, the synthesis of zinc-organic frameworks (Zn-MOFs) was achieved through the coordination of Zn2+ with the 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (DOBDC) ligand. Upon excitation at 350 nm, these Zn-MOFs exhibited robust fluorescence emission at 533 nm. However, upon the addition of iron ions, the Zn-MOFs structure disintegrated, forming a blue Fe-DOBDC complex, resulting in fluorescence quenching. In the presence of glyphosate, the iron ions were chelated by glyphosate, causing the system to lighten in color and restore fluorescence. Further, the mechanism of this strategy was investigated, which was achieved by utilizing the competitive interaction of glyphosate and Zn-MOFs for iron ions. The binding stoichiometry and binding constant of glyphosate:Fe3+ are 1:1 and 7.59 × 103 M−1 using the Job's plot and Benesi-Hildebrand equation, respectively. To enhance glyphosate detection, this study introduced an ingenious dual-mode strategy. By analyzing the colorimetric and fluorescence changes before and after glyphosate addition, we can accurately determine its concentration in the system. The combined colorimetric and fluorescent modalities offer improved reliability and applicability, boasting simplicity, rapidity, and cost-effectiveness. This innovative method is anticipated to find widespread applications and offers novel perspectives on pesticide detection platforms based on ligand competition effects. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Additionally, the reliability and consistency assessments ensure the internal consistency of the measurement model, thereby enhancing the credibility of the results. Hypothesis testing supports the study's hypotheses, confirming the interconnectedness of key factors driving green transformation. The primary contribution of this study is its in-depth analysis of the role of green finance in facilitating the transformation of high-carbon-emitting industries, providing actionable insights for policymakers, businesses, and financial institutions. The study also offers a nuanced understanding of how financial mechanisms, regulatory frameworks, and innovation strategies can collectively drive sustainable practices in high-emission sectors, advancing the transition toward a low-carbon economy. © 2025 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
A novel workflow to a fabricate patient-specific 3D printed accommodative foot orthosis with personalized latticed metamaterial,"Patients with diabetes mellitus are at elevated risk for secondary complications that result in lower extremity amputations. Standard of care to prevent these complications involves prescribing custom accommodative insoles that use inefficient and outdated fabrication processes including milling and hand carving. A new thrust of custom 3D printed insoles has shown promise in producing corrective insoles but has not explored accommodative diabetic insoles. Our novel contribution is a metamaterial design application that allows the insole stiffness to vary regionally following patient-specific plantar pressure measurements. We presented a novel workflow to fabricate custom 3D printed elastomeric insoles, a testing method to evaluate the durability, shear stiffness, and compressive stiffness of insole material samples, and a case study to demonstrate how the novel 3D printed insoles performed clinically. Our 3D printed insoles results showed a matched or improved durability, a reduced shear stiffness, and a reduction in plantar pressure in clinical case study compared to standard of care insoles. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
"Agricultural Reform in Rwanda: Authoritarianism, Markets and Zones of Governance","International observers have lauded Rwanda as an example of an African country taking control of its own development trajectory, and as a market-friendly destination for investment. A key component of this narrative has been an ambitious programme of agricultural reform, involving private firms, NGOs, and international charities. The Rwandan government claims these reforms have been a resounding success, tripling crop yields and helping to combat hunger. Chris Huggins argues, however, that Rwanda’s liberal, modernising image sits poorly with the regime’s continuing authoritarian tendencies. Featuring in-depth case studies of the effects of agricultural reform in three different regions, and drawing on hundreds of interviews, Huggins shows that the much-vaunted ‘liberalization’ of agriculture has in fact depended on the coercion of Rwandan farmers, and in many cases has had a detrimental impact on their livelihoods. With the Kagame regime now coming under increasing international scrutiny, this work provides a timely look at the impact of ‘market friendly authoritarianism’ in contemporary Africa, making essential reading for students and scholars of development in the fields of sociology, anthropology, political science, and economics. © Chris Huggins 2017.",Not About Sufficiency
Trust in the invisible hand? The roles of the State and the markets in EU energy law,"The article analyses the European Union (EU) legal approaches that govern security of electricity supply. This legal analysis demonstrates how EU law allocates power and responsibility between the State and the markets in the electricity sector to ensure the uninterrupted availability of affordable electricity. The article argues that the allocation of roles and responsibilities has been similarly structured in respect of different timescales of security of supply in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package. This legal structure relies heavily on the invisible hand of the market, in which context the role of the State is limited to providing a fallback in the event that the market is unable to achieve the objective of security of electricity supply. © 2020 The Author(s).

Quantifying maternal investment in mammals using allometry,"Maternal investment influences the survival and reproduction of both mothers and their progeny and plays a crucial role in understanding individuals’ life-history and population ecology. To reveal the complex mechanisms associated with reproduction and investment, it is necessary to examine variations in maternal investment across species. Comparisons across species call for a standardised method to quantify maternal investment, which remained to be developed. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing the maternal investment metric – MI – for mammalian species, established through the allometric scaling of the litter mass at weaning age by the adult mass and investment duration (i.e. gestation + lactation duration) of a species. Using a database encompassing hundreds of mammalian species, we show that the metric is not highly sensitive to the regression method used to fit the allometric relationship or to the proxy used for adult body mass. The comparison of the maternal investment metric between mammalian subclasses and orders reveals strong differences across taxa. For example, our metric confirms that Eutheria have a higher maternal investment than Metatheria. We discuss how further research could use the maternal investment metric as a valuable tool to understand variation in reproductive strategies. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Investment risk and natural resource potential in “Belt & Road Initiative” countries: A multi-criteria decision-making approach,"Chinese enterprises that conduct overseas investment projects encounter diverse challenges that emerge from political, economic, social, and environmental risks in the host countries. To better assess the overseas investment risks faced by Chinese enterprises, this study introduced and assessed novel aspects and an indicator system. Moreover, the “Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution” (TOPSIS) method based on entropy weight was performed to generate a comprehensive assessment of China's foreign investment risk and natural resource potential in 63 “Belt & Road Initiative” (BRI) countries. This study aims to encourage Chinese enterprises to devise suitable overseas investment decision-making strategies concerning natural resource potential in host countries. A Geographic Information System (GIS) map was also created to assess the potential risks and opportunities for Chinese enterprises when making investment decisions in host countries. The findings indicate that the majority of countries in Central and Eastern Europe and other BRI countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, Bhutan, Russia, Armenia, and the United Arab Emirates were the most suitable choices for Chinese enterprises engaging in overseas investment. Based on these results, Chinese enterprises could manage and execute BRI projects more effectively to minimise potential risks and maximise their investment benefits. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

"The politics of insecurity: Fear, migration, and asylum in the EU","The act of violence of 9/11 changed the global security agenda, catapulting terrorism to the top of the agenda. Weapons of mass destruction grabbed public interest and controlling the free movement of people became a national security priority. In this volume, Jef Huysmans critically engages with theoretical developments in international relations and security studies to develop a conceptual framework for studying security. He argues that security policies and responses do not appear out of the blue, but are part of a continuous and gradual process, pre-structured by previous developments. He examines this process of securitization and explores how an issue, on the basis of the distribution and administration of fear, becomes a security policy. Huysmans then applies this theory to provide a detailed analysis of migration, asylum and refuge in the European Union. This theoretically sophisticated, yet accessible volume, makes an important contribution to the study of security, migration and European politics. © 2006 Jef Huysmans.

Is it possible to manage energy politics? Exploring the direct and indirect effects of political factors on the acceptance of solar energy,"Is an energy transition a rational choice? To answer this research question, this study analyzed the direct and indirect effects of political ideology and partisan support on the acceptance of solar energy by applying regression analysis and the moderation effect. The risk perception factor, energy factor, and political factor were set as the independent variables. The results showed that non-political variables such as perceived risk, perceived benefit, negative emotion, knowledge, trust, and energy insecurity influenced the acceptance of solar energy more than political variables. Negative emotion had the strongest negative effect on the acceptance. Second, support for the Moon jae-in government as a partisanship variable was associated with the acceptance of the solar energy. However, ideology had no effect on the acceptance. Third, support for the Moon Jae-in government had a positive direct effect on the acceptance and indirectly influenced it by ways of perceived benefits, trust, and negative emotion, which are key influencers of acceptance of solar energy. Progressive political ideology had no direct effect on acceptance, but indirectly suppressed the effect of negative emotion on solar energy acceptance. This study shows that partisanship, in terms of presidential support, has both direct and indirect effects on solar energy acceptance, whereas ideology has indirect effects. Given the important role of political variables, future research should focus more on various political variables, such as political leadership, preference for green politics, climate politics, and the polarization of political support as independent variables. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Network-based assessment of urban forest and green space accessibility in six major cities: London, New York, Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, and Beijing","The increasing urban population densities, coupled with the reduction and fragmentation of green spaces, have made walking an essential mode of access to urban green spaces, especially for women, children, older adults, and individuals with disabilities. Despite its importance, research on walking accessibility to urban green space is primarily limited to single-country studies, making it difficult to compare different cities across countries. This study examined street gradients in six major global cities (London, New York, Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, and Beijing) and assessed accessibility to urban forests (UFs; tree- and shrubland) and urban green spaces (UGSs; grassland and cropland, as well as tree- and shrubland). The minimum network distances to UFs and UGSs were calculated to generate pedestrian accessibility indexes (AI; UFAI and UGAI). Finally, the Gini coefficients for each city were compared to determine the spatial equality of pedestrian access to UGS and UF. Most of the areas with the highest UFAI and UGAI were located in London. New York, Tokyo, Seoul, and Beijing exhibited areas with negative UFAI (indicating poor accessibility), whereas negative UGAI values were identified in New York and Tokyo. London had the highest percentages of the population living within 5, 10, and 15 minutes of UF and UGS at the city scale, whereas Tokyo had the lowest. Additionally, the Gini coefficients of UFAI and UGAI were the highest in Tokyo at 0.48 and 0.37, respectively, whereas London exhibited the lowest values for both indices, at 0.22. Collectively, our findings could significantly contribute to the inclusive planning and management of urban forests, green spaces, streets, and populations in megacities according to their quantity and spatial distribution. © 2025 Elsevier GmbH",Not About Sufficiency
Endogenous Versus Exogenous Rules in Water Management: An Experimental Cross-country Comparison,"This paper draws on institutional and experimental economics to investigate the role of exogenous and endogenous rules in irrigation systems. The hypotheses we examine argue that despite the differences between socio-economic and political settings, (1) endogenous rule-crafting can help water users to overcome appropriation and provision dilemmas in water-scarce environments like in the East Mediterranean countries and that (2) in market-like water governance systems, institutions other than the market itself, are less influential for overcoming appropriation and provision dilemmas than in hybrid governance systems. These hypotheses are being tested comparing the results of field experiments conducted in Jordan, the Republic of Cyprus and North Cyprus with 70 farmers. Field experiments simulate asymmetric access to resources and are based on variations of the irrigation game by Cardenas et al. to model and test asymmetric distribution of investment, harvest and revenue that favours upstream users. Empirical evidence shows that externally imposed allocation rules are able to bring in more equal distribution of revenue among upstream–downstream users but is likely to reduce the volume of investment and revenue, without resolving issues of free-riding. The authors argue that given the opportunity, water users (small farmers in our experiments) are able to craft their own rules improving the overall performance of the group in terms of investment and revenue, with a parallel improvement of equity in distribution. The implications and policy relevance of such findings are briefly discussed as they contradict typical practices of top-down policy delivery in the selected cases. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Key lessons for achieving biodiversity-sensitive cities and towns,"Australia's urban landscapes offer opportunities to marry socio-economic and biodiversity conservation objectives. Yet, information is needed on what urban landscape and habitat features are important for wildlife. In this article, we draw together our research from southeastern Australia to describe key lessons for biodiversity-sensitive cities and towns. Lesson 1: The effects of urbanization on wildlife extend into adjacent habitats. We recommend retaining large, undisturbed areas of habitat away from development, avoiding intensive development adjacent to important conservation areas, prioritizing areas of ecological and social significance, screening light and noise pollution at the urban fringe and around large nature reserves, and planting appropriately provenanced locally native species for public streetscapes, parks and gardens. Lesson 2: Strategic enhancement of urban greenspace offers biodiversity gains. We recommend increasing the total amount of greenspace cover, maintaining ecological structures as habitat islands, using landscaping techniques to minimize risks to human safety, and gardening with low-flowering native shrubs. Lesson 3: Large old trees need to be managed for long-term sustainability. We recommend retaining large old trees in new developments, increasing the maximum standing life of urban trees, protecting regenerating areas and planting more seedlings, supplementing habitat features associated with large trees, and ensuring that young trees have space to grow through time. Lesson 4: Education and engagement connects residents with nature and raises awareness. We recommend education programs to enhance opportunities for residents to experience and learn about biodiversity, engaging residents in the establishment and maintenance of wildlife habitat, providing 'cues to care', facilitating access to garden plants that benefit wildlife, and encouraging cat containment. These lessons provide an evidence-base for implementing conservation and management actions to improve the capacity of our cities and towns to support a diverse and abundant biota. © 2015 Ecological Society of Australia.",Not About Sufficiency
The effect of commitment in the public goods game with endogenous institution formation,"This study focuses on the endogenous formation of institutions for the provision of public goods. Institutions that impose a contribution on their members can increase social welfare. However, without powerful executive authority, not all players become institutional members, and those who choose not to join the institution do not contribute to public goods. Endogenous institution formation-for example, international treaties to prevent global warming-may be a solution. This study examines the effect of commitment on endogenous institution formation for solving the public goods problem. We compared two rules in which participants either committed to join or did not join an institution. Under both rules, players who proposed to form an institution could withdraw from it during the formation process. Under the breakaway rule, the institution can be formed even if some proposers withdraw, whereas under the unanimity rule, the institution is never formed if at least one proposer withdraws. Thus, the unanimity rule required the commitment of proposers for institution formation. Our experimental result showed that the unanimity rule increased the contribution to public goods, whereas the breakaway rule did not. Our findings suggest that the commitment to become a member of an institution is essential for endogenous institution formation.",Not About Sufficiency
Current aspects of nanotechnology: Applications in agriculture,"The discipline of nanotechnology has gained momentum in the agriculture field and emerged to modernize the research related to agricultural practices. The use of a lot of chemicals in the agriculture field led to environment pollution, climate change, diminishing natural resources, and other ecological impacts. In recent years, nanotechnology gained attention to overcome such problems, and hence, there is an increase in the quality of food, agro-based products, and natural resources. This chapter discusses about sources of nanomaterials, various forms of nano assisted technologies to improve plant growth and crop yields such as nanocarriers, nanotubes, nanosensors, nanocomposites, nanofibers, nanoclays, and nanocapsules. Furthermore, it emphasized on application of nanotechnology in agriculture to enhance the effects on seed germination rate, plant growth, identification of plant diseases, control of weeds, control of pathogens, smart farming, and precision agriculture. Therefore, these nano-based agricultural practices are essential for food security, ecosystem balance, and sustainable agriculture as they do not affect our environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
A review of integrated multicriteria decision support analysis in the climate resilient infrastructure development,"Roads, bridges, sewer systems, and other infrastructure failures often result from climate-related incidences along with extensive socioeconomic impacts including human life losses. Infrastructures with frequent experiences are usually replaced, altered, or adopt different Low-Impact Development, Best Management Practice (LID-BMP) approaches. Adapting and recovering from the damages cost a substantial budget. This study reviewed Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) i.e., risk analysis, hydroclimatic analysis, and Life Cycle Cost-Benefits Analysis (LCC-BA) in the Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Development (CRID). It was carried out following the protocols and guidelines for systematic literature review. Throughout the review, 1D is acclaimed as the best and most suitable to identify critical flooding zones and nodes within the drainage network. The study showed that integrated GIS and 1D hydrodynamic modelling are reliable in waterlogging characterisation and locating suitable floodwater regulating areas, while 2D analysis was found ideal for appropriate damages assessment over different inundation depths, duration, return periods and different climate scenarios. Indeed, about 62.5% of the studies have analysed the LID-BMPs whereby 23.2% integrated hydrologic-hydrodynamic and LCC-BA, and identified optimum performances at different levels. The study showed that, the cost of climatic adaption in infrastructure development results in the benefits optimisation and the effects-attributed cost minimisation. Besides, several studies acclaim the rising of weather-related extremes due to a gradual climate variation. Henceforth, there is a need for adaptation, most importantly, incorporating the changes in infrastructure development, and the necessity of integrating MCDA in CRID. Further, machine learning and deep learning approaches are recommended to overcome challenges and limitations associated with the current multi-dimensional numerical models and big data era demanding huge time and computational power. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Hydroclimatic trend analysis and projection in Africa tropical urban regions: Cases of Lusaka, Zambia and Kigali, Rwanda","The global climate has significantly changed primarily due to human-induced activities. The incidences of droughts and extreme floods followed by destruction have been appearing across the globe along with extensive effects on economic and public health sectors, including the human lives losses whereby, Africa is among the greatly affected regions. Several studies aver that weather-related extremes are likely to increase due to the rising impacts. This article aims to emerge the effects of a warning climate on temperature and precipitation patterns in African tropical regions for pre-emptive adaptation practices. It was conducted using nonparametric Mann-Kendall's test and Sen's slope estimator coupled with the downscaled global climate models (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 GCMs). The study shows that the annual precipitation in Lusaka keeps decreasing though the rainfall season showed an increasing possibility. The projection under ssp245 showed a slight rainfall decrement but increased by the mid-century under ssp585. Besides, the rainfall in Kigali, presents an excess increment resulting in increased extreme events. The projection showed up to 40% annual rainfall increment by the end-century under ssp585. However, both the regions present a slight trend increment in maximum and minimum temperature. Henceforth, the results of this study may prove useful in climate change mitigation and adaptation practices on rainfed agriculture, hydroelectricity, water supply systems, and resilient hydraulic infrastructure provision in the region. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem services of blue-green infrastructure (BGI) for climate change adaptation and mitigation in an arid region,"Urban rivers are blue-green infrastructures of great importance due to their multiple ecosystem services which strengthen habitat connectivity and biodiversity. Cities in arid regions are vulnerable to climate change and face several problems: Inadequate response to floods; scarce availability of water resources; river pollution; urban landscape transformation; and urban heat island effect. Arequipa, an arid city in south Peru, has an urban section along the Chili River which flow allows the development of energy and agricultural activities; however, there is a gradual loss of the corridor due to environmental phenomena and anthropic alterations. The aim is to evaluate the ecosystem services offered by the urban river, which will allow a holistic understanding of its potential as a measure for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The main ecosystem services were determined through an evaluation (surveys) by national and international experts. Afterwards, based on a bibliographic review, the ecosystem services determined were associated with their capacity for adaptation or mitigation of climate change in Arequipa. The results of the surveys showed that the most important ecosystem service provided by an urban river is environmental education, which is considered fundamental for participatory governance involving multiple stakeholders. The main ecosystem service provided by the Chili River is the freshwater provision. Most of the ecosystem services contribute to climate change adaptation; however, air quality regulation and air purification through carbon capture and storage were identified as mitigation mechanisms. It is concluded that the preservation of the urban river and its ecosystem services contribute to increasing the overall level of resilience of the city. Management of this ecosystem, based on the recognition of the ecosystem services that urban rivers provide, will be essential considering the value of this type of blue-green infrastructure as a strategy for adaptation and mitigation of climate change. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem services and the idea of shared values,"Ecosystem services conceptualise the diverse values that ecosystems provide to humanity. This was recognised in the United Kingdom's National Ecosystem Assessment, which noted that appreciation of the full value of ecosystem services requires recognition of values that are shared. By operationalising the shared values concept, it is argued that the contribution of ecosystem services to human well-being can be represented more holistically. This paper considers current understanding of shared values and develops a new metanarrative of shared values beyond the aggregated utilities of individuals. This metanarrative seeks to conceptualise how values can be held both individually and communally, and what this means for identifying their scale and means of enumeration. The paper poses a new reading of the idea of shared values that reconciles the elicitation of pre-formed individual values with the formation and expression of shared social values. The implication is that shared values need to be conceived as normative constructs that are derived through social processes of value formation and expression. Shared values thus do not necessarily exist a priori; they can be deliberated through formal and informal processes through which individuals can separate their own preferences from a broader metanarrative about what values ought to be shared. © 2016 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

Soil quality under rotational and conventional grazing in Mediterranean areas at desertification risk,"Rotational grazing (RG) could be a valid alternative to continuous grazing (CG) in Mediterranean extensive pastures to fight land degradation. This study aimed to compare soil quality under RG and CG management, in paired RG-CG Portuguese pasture areas under strong aridity stress, with RG sites converted from CG management in 2018. Soils were sampled in 2022, at 10 cm depth, over 71 ha of RG and 37 ha of CG pastures, subdivided in 16 and 10 sampling plots, respectively. In each plot, five soil samples were taken to provide one composite sample. Physico-chemical and microbial indicators of soil quality were measured immediately after. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed a clear separation between RG and CG sites with significantly higher level of soil organic carbon (27%–67%), total nitrogen (67%–77%), cation exchange capacity (9%–36%), and, at a minor extent, water holding capacity (6%–17%), in the RG plots respect to CG plots. No significant difference was found for soil bulk density, microbial and fungal biomass and microbial diversity between sites with different management, although the latter was positively correlated with CG sites in the RDA analysis. Soil organic carbon was significantly correlated to the most relevant physico-chemical parameters for nutrient cycling and water balance and to microbial fungal biomass and N-mineralization, confirming the central role of soil organic carbon for soil health. Results support RG management as an effective choice to improve soil quality in areas under desertification risk. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Influence of chemical fertilizers on arsenic mobilization in the alluvial Bengal delta plain: A critical review,"Arsenic contamination of alluvial aquifers of the Bengal delta plain causes a serious threat to human health for over 75 million people. The study aimed to explore the impacts of chemical fertilizer on arsenic mobilization in the sedimentary deposition of the alluvial Bengal delta plain. It selected ten comparatively highly affected districts and the least affected two divisions as a referral study site. The countrywide pooled concentration of arsenic in groundwater was 109.75 μg/L (52.59, 166.91) at a 95% confidence interval, which was double the national guideline value (50 μg/L). The analysis results showed a strong positive correlation (r _ 0.5) of arsenic with NO3, NH4, PO4, SO4, Ca, and K, where a portion of those species originated from fertilizer leaching into groundwater. The results showed that PO4 played a significant role in arsenic mobilization, but the role of NO3, SO4, and NH4 was not clear at certain lithological conditions. It also showed that clay, peat, silt-clay, and rich microbial community with sufficiently organic carbon loaded soils could lead to an increase in arsenic mobilization. Finally, the study observed that the overall lithological conditions are the main reason for the high arsenic load in the study area. © 2021 Smith et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Model aspect of the study of the processes of sustainable development of socio-economic systems,"The triune concept of sustainable development takes into account environmental, social and economic issues in general. At the same time, the solution of the problems of resource conservation and socio-economic development do not contradict each other, but contribute to mutual reinforcement. The purpose of this study is to build, describe, test and analyze economic and mathematical models of the processes of self-organization of the socio-economic system within the framework of the concept of sustainable development. The considered models take into account both quantitative and qualitative characteristics. The research methodology is based on the assumption that the system under consideration is dynamic. The study makes it possible to evaluate the process of sustainable development of the socio-economic system in terms of the formation and influence of its characteristics on the overall result. Various options for formalizing the level of motivation of economic activity are described and analyzed, one of which is based on the economic interpretation of the Weber-Fechner psychophysiological law. The assumption of the continuous development of innovative technologies made it possible to reveal the existence of a ""fatigue point"", the onset of which indicates the possibility of increasing the growth rate of production activities due to its technological transformation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring local perceptions and drivers of engagement in biodiversity monitoring among participants in payments for ecosystem services schemes in southeastern Mexico,"Payments for ecosystem services (PES) are widely applied incentive-based instruments with diverse objectives that increasingly include biodiversity conservation. Yet, there is a gap in understanding of how to best assess and monitor programs’ biodiversity outcomes. We examined perceptions and drivers of engagement related to biodiversity monitoring through surveys among current PES participants in 7 communities in Mexico's Selva Lacandona. We conducted workshops among survey participants that included training and field deployment of tools used to monitor biodiversity and land cover, including visual transects, camera traps, acoustic recorders, and forest cover satellite images. We conducted pre- and postworkshop surveys in each community to evaluate changes in respondents’ perceptions following exposure to biodiversity monitoring training and related field activities. We also reviewed existing research on participatory environmental management and monitoring approaches. One quarter of current PES participants in the study area participated in our surveys and workshops. The majority stated interest in engaging in diverse activities related to the procedural aspects of biodiversity monitoring (e.g., planning, field data collection, results dissemination) and acknowledged multiple benefits of introducing biodiversity monitoring into PES (e.g., knowledge and capacity building, improved natural resource management, and greater support for conservation). Household economic reliance on PES was positively associated with willingness to engage in monitoring. Technical expertise, time, and monetary constraints were deterrents. Respondents were most interested in monitoring mammals, birds, and plants and using visual transects, camera traps, and forest cover satellite images. Exposure to monitoring enhanced subsequent interest in monitoring by providing respondents with new insights from their communities related to deforestation and species’ abundance and diversity. Respondents identified key strengths and weaknesses of applying different monitoring tools, which suggests that deploying multiple tools simultaneously can increase local engagement and produce complementary findings and data. Overall, our findings support the relevance and usefulness of incorporating participatory biodiversity monitoring into PES. © 2024 The Authors.

"Tracing nitrogen pollution from wastewater on an oceanic, touristic island: Integrating local knowledge and uncertainty into a mass balance modeling approach","Nutrient pollution from wastewater endangers coastal and marine ecosystems and contributes to health risks in many small islands in the Wider Caribbean Region. Identifying promising intervention points for management requires understanding the flows of wastewater and contained nutrients. However, on such islands data about wastewater flows is typically scarce, and knowledge is distributed among various actors and institutions. Additionally the system's complexity is high, as nutrient fate is determined by an interplay of technical, social, environmental, and ecological factors. Using multiple methods, this paper addresses these complexities, focusing on San Andrés Island, Colombia, which is subject to strong population and tourism pressure. Based on interviews with local actors, we develop a conceptual model to map the total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) fate from touristic and domestic sources to sinks in the environment. With a mass balance model that integrates diverse data sources and elicitation from local experts, we quantify TIN pathways taking into account uncertainty with parameter distributions. Based on the model, we estimate that on an average day in the dry season about 56 % of wastewater-derived TIN ends up in the ocean and 44 % in the island's land sinks. Tourists directly contribute about 13 % of TIN, though their indirect contribution is likely much higher. The main pathway of TIN to the ocean is via a centralized sewer network and to the land sink via distributed soak pits. Without additional treatment or nutrient cycling, the potential management scenarios we investigate merely shift pollution issues between environmental compartments. This research underlines the need for a systems perspective on wastewater management for small islands. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Science for segregation: Race, law, and the case against brown v. board of education","In this fascinating examination of the intriguing but understudied period following the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, John Jackson examines the scientific case aimed at dismantling the legislation. Offering a trenchant assessment of the so-called scientific evidence, Jackson focuses on the 1959 formation of the International Society for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics (IAAEE), whose expressed function was to objectively investigate racial differences and publicize their findings. Notable figures included Carleton Putnam, Wesley Critz George, and Carleton Coon. In an attempt to link race, eugenics and intelligence, they launched legal challenges to the Brown ruling, each chronicled here, that went to trial but ultimately failed. The history Jackson presents speaks volumes about the legacy of racism, as we can see similar arguments alive and well today in such books as The Bell Curve and in other debates on race, science, and intelligence. With meticulous research and a nuanced understanding of the complexities of race and law, Jackson tells a disturbing tale about race in America. © 2005 NYU Press.",Not About Sufficiency
"Unsustainable, Imperial Dreams: What India’s Blue Economy Portends for “Life Below Water”","Sustainability of Indian seas has been submerged almost entirely within a national Blue Economy discourse and politicized ambitions of limitless wealth beneath the waves. In this imaginary, shipping, fisheries, marine minerals, naval might, coastal commons, and even tourism serve to bolster national development in various ways. Such expansionary and even imperial aims, however, conjure doubts about India’s engagement with international development policy and commitments to economic, social, and ecological sustainability. In this political economic context, this chapter interrogates India’s performance at achieving the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and specifically Goal 14: “Life Below Water.” First, I historicize sustainable development in order to unsettle a concept frequently deployed as though self-explanatory, uncontested, or ahistorical. I also briefly review the SDGs and their evolution into discursive objects and exemplars of development’s fetishization of quantification. The analysis then turns to the specifics of India’s performance of the SDG process which I argue produces an abstracted, flexible notion of sustainability made available for other projects, namely, the Hindutva-infused Blue Economy agenda. Contra this development imaginary, I present evidence of actually existing unsustainability at the scale of an estuary on India’s southwestern coast. The chapter concludes with a provocation: India’s oceanic agenda—underwritten by its performative embrace of “sustainable” development—appears in the process of articulating both ethnonationalism and neoliberalism into a neoimperial dream. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Changes in the geographical distribution and abundance of the tick Ixodes ricinus during the past 30 years in Sweden,"Background: Ixodes ricinus is the main vector in Europe of human-pathogenic Lyme borreliosis (LB) spirochaetes, the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and other pathogens of humans and domesticated mammals. The results of a previous 1994 questionnaire, directed at people living in Central and North Sweden (Svealand and Norrland) and aiming to gather information about tick exposure for humans and domestic animals, suggested that Ixodes ricinus ticks had become more widespread in Central Sweden and the southern part of North Sweden from the early 1980s to the early 1990s. To investigate whether the expansion of the tick's northern geographical range and the increasing abundance of ticks in Sweden were still occurring, in 2009 we performed a follow-up survey 16 years after the initial study. Methods. A questionnaire similar to the one used in the 1994 study was published in Swedish magazines aimed at dog owners, home owners, and hunters. The questionnaire was published together with a popular science article about the tick's biology and role as a pathogen vector in Sweden. The magazines were selected to get information from people familiar with ticks and who spend time in areas where ticks might be present. Results: Analyses of data from both surveys revealed that during the near 30-year period from the early 1980s to 2008, I. ricinus has expanded its distribution range northwards. In the early 1990s ticks were found in new areas along the northern coastline of the Baltic Sea, while in the 2009 study, ticks were reported for the first time from many locations in North Sweden. This included locations as far north as 66°N and places in the interior part of North Sweden. During this 16-year period the tick's range in Sweden was estimated to have increased by 9.9%. Most of the range expansion occurred in North Sweden (north of 60°N) where the tick's coverage area doubled from 12.5% in the early 1990s to 26.8% in 2008. Moreover, according to the respondents, the abundance of ticks had increased markedly in LB- and TBE-endemic areas in South (Götaland) and Central Sweden. Conclusions: The results suggest that I. ricinus has expanded its range in North Sweden and has become distinctly more abundant in Central and South Sweden during the last three decades. However, in the northern mountain region I. ricinus is still absent. The increased abundance of the tick can be explained by two main factors: First, the high availability of large numbers of important tick maintenance hosts, i.e., cervids, particularly roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) during the last three decades. Second, a warmer climate with milder winters and a prolonged growing season that permits greater survival and proliferation over a larger geographical area of both the tick itself and deer. High reproductive potential of roe deer, high tick infestation rate and the tendency of roe deer to disperse great distances may explain the range expansion of I. ricinus and particularly the appearance of new TBEV foci far away from old TBEV-endemic localities. The geographical presence of LB in Sweden corresponds to the distribution of I. ricinus. Thus, LB is now an emerging disease risk in many parts of North Sweden. Unless countermeasures are undertaken to keep the deer populations, particularly C. capreolus and Dama dama, at the relatively low levels that prevailed before the late 1970s - especially in and around urban areas where human population density is high - by e.g. reduced hunting of red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and lynx (Lynx lynx), the incidences of human LB and TBE are expected to continue to be high or even to increase in Sweden in coming decades. © 2012 Jaenson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Multi-level policy dialogues, processes, and actions: Challenges and opportunities for national REDD+ safeguards measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV)","REDD+ social safeguards have gained increasing attention in numerous forums. This paper reviews the evolution of multi-level policy dialogues, processes, and actions related to REDD+ social safeguards (e.g., Cancun Safeguards 1-5) among policy makers, civil society organizations, and within the media in Brazil, Indonesia and Tanzania, three countries with well advanced REDD+ programs. We find that progress on core aspects of social safeguards is uneven across the three countries. Brazil is by far the most advanced having drafted a REDD+ social safeguards policy. Both Brazil and Indonesia have benefited from progress made by strong sub-national entities in the operationalization of REDD+ safeguards including free prior and informed consent (FPIC), participation, and benefit sharing. Tanzania has weakly articulated how social safeguards will be operationalized and has a more top-down approach. We conclude that in all three countries, measuring, reporting and verifying progress on social safeguards is likely to be a complex issue. Stakeholders with vested interests in REDD+ social safeguards operate in polycentric rather than nested systems, suggesting that aggregation of information from local to national-scale will be a challenge. However, polycentric systems are also likely to support more transparent and comprehensive safeguards systems. Clear direction from the international community and financing for REDD+ safeguard MRV is essential if REDD+ social safeguards are to be meaningfully integrated into forest-based climate mitigation strategies. © 2014 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

The role of energy from the aspect of economic theory,"Throughout the history of economic theory, the role of energy as one of the key factors of economic growth was not given proper and direct importance. Energy remains present and recognized in economic theory and practice exclusively as an intermediate input. Although the classical economics implicitly included energy in economic activity through land as a key production factor, neoclassical economics segregates nature (land) and its sources of energy. Namely, the land is classified ed as a part of capital as it becomes productive only when one uses labor and capital for processing it. Research interests were/are directed towards the primary inputs such as capital and labor while intermediate inputs (i.e. energy) were given indirect relevance. Energy allows continuity of the overall economic activity in the long run not only as a supplement to standard (neoclassical) production inputs. Instead, without energy production would not be possible. According to the so-called ecological economics, energy is the most important primary factor of production. From these economic standpoints on energy emerges the aim of this paper which deals with the determination of energy’s role from the aspect of economic theory. Moreover, special emphasis is placed on the criticism of the neoclassical growth theory from the perspective of various economic schools. The results of the theoretical analysis show that the standard (neoclassical) factors of production and growth are nothing but energy transformers. Therefore, opposing opinions of various economic schools and criticism of neoclassical economic paradigm could not be avoided. © 2015, Hrvatsko Drustvo Ekonomista.

Exploring smallholder farmers' open innovation capability: A structural equation modeling approach,"This study determined the capability of small vegetable farmers in the Philippines to participate in an open innovation activity. Open innovation offers numerous advantages over the closed system and adopting it provides numerous benefits for the small farmers and the agriculture sector. Using knowledge generation, conversion, and sharing as the base framework, this study is premised on the idea that open innovation is facilitated by increased access to new knowledge. Data from a survey of 266 small vegetable farmers in Region IVA of the Philippines was analyzed using descriptive statistics and partial least square structural equation modeling. The results show that vegetable farmers can generate tacit knowledge and convert it into explicit knowledge. This, together with their innovation network, positive attitude towards innovation, and financial support have a positive effect on the farmers’ ability to participate in open innovation. Considering these, the innovation platform approach can be used to leverage the knowledge process and innovation networks to enhance the collaborative innovation process. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Longitudinal trajectory of technological growth in Sub-Sahara Africa: new insights for achieving carbon dioxide emissions reduction and environmental sustainability,"Across the world, technological adoption has demonstrated capacity towards improving economic production, efficient exploration and consumption of natural resources as well as reduce CO2 emissions. Though with significant impact on CO2 emissions, technological growth has remained relatively low across countries in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). With positive projected economic growth, rising populations, urbanization and the rapid industrialization of economies, the countries in SSA are expected to witness corresponding increase in CO2 emissions. Considering the size of the sub-region, these projections remain a threat to global efforts towards decarbonizing the world. Based on trend and predictive analysis, we explored the synergies of technologies growth, and CO2 emissions in Sub Sahara Africa. The results reveal inconsistent upswing trends of technological growth and CO2 emissions across SSA. As a novel contribution, the FE model exhibits superior correspondence with the actual data trends signaling higher CO2 emission for countries in SSA. The results edify the pivotal role of country-specific peculiarities in shaping technological growth, energy consumption and environmental sustainability efforts in SSA. The study concludes that while global trends provide overarching narratives, individual countries carry their own weight of unique narratives that can spindle advance model predictions. The recommendations thus highlight the urgent need for tailored and context-specific strategies towards addressing environment and sustainability issues in Africa. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Inter-sectoral action to support healthy and environmentally sustainable food behaviours: A study of sectoral knowledge, governance and implementation opportunities","There is increasing attention to the importance of healthy and environmentally sustainable food supply and demand but little empirical research exists on how this might be achieved. This study examines the potential for inter-sectoral policy and action to support consumer adoption of healthy and sustainable food behaviours, focusing on three key themes: (1) sectoral understandings of healthy and sustainable food behaviours; (2) modes of governance for inter-sectoral action on healthy and sustainable behaviours; and (3) barriers and enablers to inter-sectoral action. We undertook 29 semi-structured interviews with representatives of key government, food industry and non-government organisations in food-related health and environment sectors in Australia. We found that while definitions of health and sustainability are still diverse and often siloed, the rationale of a combined concept was generally acknowledged. There was also consensus on the need for any action to be inter-sectoral, but diverse views on what such action should entail. The main barriers to inter-sectoral action identified included relationships between food system actors and a lack of organisational attention to the issue. Enablers included political and institutional leadership to drive action as well as sector-specific enablers such as market incentives. Overall a range of governance modes were identified that would potentially create a suite of actions across sectors, as well as opportunities to facilitate their implementation. Drawn together our findings outline a framework for action to move beyond the prevailing focus on individual-level change and develop inter-sectoral action and collaboration to support adoption of healthy and sustainable food behaviours. © Springer Japan KK 2017.",Not About Sufficiency

The Impact of Renewable Energy and Technology Innovation on Chinese Carbon Dioxide Emissions,"Understanding the influencing factors of carbon dioxide emissions is an essential prerequisite for policy makers to maintain sustainable low-carbon economic growth. Based on the autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) and error correction model (ECM), this paper investigates the causal relationships between economic growth, carbon emission, financial development, renewable energy consumption, and technology innovation in the case of China for the period 1965–2018. Our empirical results confirm the presence of a long-run relationship among the underlying variables. Our long-run estimates show that financial development has negative significant impacts on carbon emissions, whereas renewable energy and technology innovation have limited impacts on carbon mitigations. In addition, the short-run Granger causality analysis reveals that renewable energy consumption has a bidirectional Granger causality with carbon emissions and technology innovations. In the short run, we find that financial development can positively affect China’s carbon mitigation efforts indirectly via the channels of renewable energy sources and technology innovations. Our results have three following policy implications for Chinese policy makers to maintain sustainable low carbon economic development: (i) establish a green finance market to mobilize the social capital into green industry; (ii) continue the environmental law enforcement to control for carbon emissions among energy intensive industries; (iii) provide government fiscal incentives to promote renewable energy sources on both supply and demand sides of the market. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
"Effective performance management of local governments in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan","Purpose: Effective performance management of local governments is essential for efficient service delivery to the citizens.

Social implications: The implementation of the system has resulted in significant improvements in social sector service delivery. Originality/value: There is very limited literature available on successful performance management reforms in the public sector of the developing world. Therefore, this case study can be a very important resource. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Importance of fishing permits in no-take marine protected area overlapping with fishing grounds,"Public policies in marine areas are often constructed while ignoring the presence of artisanal fishing. Consequently, conflicts arise, and public policies become ineffective. Studies aimed at reducing such conflicts have been conducted worldwide. We analyzed an example, a no-take marine protected area (NTMPA) that overlaps with fishing grounds. This conflict was mitigated through an agreement that established: catch species, vessel numbers, and permitted periods. We evaluated the significance of NTMPA using fish landing data from fishery monitoring program. For this, we present the use of fishing grounds through heat maps, along with the importance of the permitted species regarding: production, via relative importance index; and profitability, through first-sale value relative to fishing days. Results showed that NTMPA has high productivity and profitability in relation to two of the three fishing resources allowed, which are among the most important local resources. Although the agreement established is valuable, it has limitations: transitory nature, and strict rules. Maintenance of this agreement and creation of permanent spaces for dialogue to adaptation on rules are recommended. Subsequently, recategorization of the NTMPA such that sustainable regulated use is allowed should be debated. © 2024, Instytut Technologii Drewna. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
The Effectiveness of Sanctions on Social Media Pornography Content,"Criminal law, which includes specific rules that regulate electronic transactions and decorum, significantly influences the dissemination of pornographic content. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of regulating sanctions for perpetrators of pornography violations on social media is a challenge. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of sanctions against individuals who post pornographic content on social media. This study applies a statutory and conceptual approach to normative juridical research. This research’s results suggest that obstacles have hindered the enforcement of these regulations, resulting in ineffective law enforcement against individuals who use technology to disseminate pornography on social media. Younger generations favor indirect and imperceptible sanctions to preserve relationships, which may not effectively communicate normative violations. On the other hand, sanctions are critical to establishing community norms regarding privacy-respecting behavior on social networking sites. A variety of factors, including structure, substance, and legal culture, ultimately influence the efficacy of investigating cyber porn perpetrators through platforms like Instagram. © (2024), (Elite Scientific Publications).

"From phenology and habitat preferences to climate change: Importance of citizen science in studying insect ecology in the continental scale with american red flat bark beetle, cucujus clavipes, as a model species","The American red flat bark beetle, Cucujus clavipes, is a wide distributed saproxylic species divided into two subspecies: ssp. clavipes restricted to eastern regions of North America and ssp. puniceus occurring only in western regions of this continent. Unique morphological features, includ-ing body shape and body coloration, make this species easy to recognize even for amateurs. Sur-prisingly, except some studies focused on physiological adaptations of the species, the ecology of C. clavipes was almost unstudied. Based on over 500 records collected by citizen scientists and de-posited in the iNaturalist data base, we studied phenological activity of adult beetles, habitat preferences and impact of future climate change for both subspecies separately. The results clearly show that spp. clavipes and ssp. puniceus can be characterized by differences in phenology and macrohab-itat preferences, and their ranges do not overlap at any point. Spp. clavipes is found as more oppor-tunistic taxon occurring in different forests as well as in urban and agricultural areas with tree veg-etation always in elevations below 500 m, while elevational distribution of ssp. puniceus covers areas up to 2300 m, and the beetle was observed mainly in forested areas. Moreover, we expect that climate warming will have negative influence on both subspecies with the possible loss of proper niches at level even up to 47–70% of their actual ranges during next few decades. As the species is actually recognized as unthreatened and always co‐occurs with many other species, we suggest, because of its expected future habitat loss, to pay more attention to conservationists for possible negative changes in saproxylic insects and/or forest fauna in North America. In addition, as our results clearly show that both subspecies of C. clavipes differ ecologically, which strongly supports earlier significant morphological and physiological differences noted between them, we suggest that their taxonomical status should be verified by molecular data, because very probably they rep-resent separate species. © 2021 by the authors.

Investigating the Mechanical and Thermal Properties of Concrete with Recycled Nanoplastics for Enhanced Sustainability,"Over recent decades, the concrete industry has experienced significant advancements, including the incorporation of recycled waste materials to enhance sustainability and various properties. However, the current literature lacks comprehensive investigations regarding the critical contributions and benefits of Nanoplastics (NPs) in improving concrete's mechanical and thermal properties, such as tensile strength, compressive strength, splitting strength, and thermal characteristics, including thermal stability and insulation. This study aims to investigate the valuable effects of integrating waste materials, particularly NPs, into concrete and to elucidate the impact of NPs on concrete's mechanical and thermal properties. Furthermore, this paper seeks to highlight the positive environmental implications of using NPs in concrete. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to address these aspects and achieve the research objectives. Academic peer-reviewed articles and recently published papers were examined to discuss the practicality and various essential benefits of incorporating NPs into the concrete mix. The review revealed that the use of NPs in concrete leads to improvements in mechanical properties, such as shrinkage, splitting tensile strength, compressive strength, shear resistance, and flexural strength. Simultaneously, the substitution of various NP ratios in concrete enhances thermal resistance, contributing to more energy-efficient structures due to the substantial thermal insulation provided by the plastic incorporation. With respect to environmental aspects, employing waste materials renders the concrete more sustainable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective compared to conventional concrete. Based on the thorough review conducted, which demonstrated the advantageous effects of NPs on concrete performance concerning mechanical, thermal, and ecological measures, it is crucial to expand the available literature on the beneficial evaluations of NPs' contributions to the efficacy and practicality of the concrete mix. © 2023 Lavoisier.

The spatial impact of socio-technical transitions – The case of phosphorus recycling as a pilot of the circular economy,"Socio-technical innovations for the recovery of phosphorus (P) from sewage sludge (ashes) and the recycling of the secondary material in the agri-food system have been gaining prominent roles in current debates on circular economy. While research has been primarily focusing on questions on technical feasibility, the impact of the innovations on the social and material structures of the underlying socio-technical wastewater and agri-food systems has been receiving less attention. Drawing on theoretical insights from transition theory and empirical data from expert interviews, our analysis of two approaches to P recycling – phosphoric acid and struvite – shows how innovations create different spatial structures of actors, institutions, infrastructure, and material flows and in doing so promote or hamper fundamental changes in the socio-technical systems. In the wastewater system, both approaches foster the incumbent socio-technical regime of centralized wastewater treatment. In the agri-food system, on the one hand, the phosphoric acid approach supports large-scale industrial structures comprising the fertilizer industry and global P flows fostering the incumbent globalized agri-food regime. On the other hand, struvite facilitates the local distribution of fertilizers between wastewater treatment plants and farmers and supports small-scale P cycling providing opportunities for a structural reconfiguration of the agri-food system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Bridging the Peace Gap in Nigeria: The Panel of the Wise as a Constitutional Essential,"Since Nigeria's return to democratic governance in 1999, violent conflicts around identities including religion, ethnicity, indigene / settler differentiation and resource control remain a challenge to peace. Thus far, government responses lack a normative framework to motivate consistent intervention and foster peace. While Nigeria's 1999 Constitution identifies peace as a common aspiration, there is a lack of a non-adversarial institutional mechanism to address violent conflicts related to identity. Despite its limited relevance, the visible institution for conflict management is the court. This article argues for the need to establish a panel of the wise, a conflict and peace intervention mechanism, as an ""essential"" element of the Nigerian Constitution. It then explores key considerations regarding the proposed panel, in terms of its composition, functions and legal status to intervene in the management of violent conflicts associated with identity and fostering peace in Nigeria.

Beyond hardship and joy: Framing home gardening on insights from the European semi-periphery,"European accounts of home gardening or food self-provisioning (FSP) typically frame these practices as primarily economically motivated and need related, and community gardening or urban agriculture as ethical sustainability strategies. Drawing on primary research on FSP in two East European countries, this paper combines analysis of socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics of food self-provisioners with analysis of their motivations. There is strong evidence that while economic reasons are present FSP is primarily motivated, even in comparatively less affluent East European societies, by the desire to obtain fresh and healthy food and engage in a pleasurable activity. Based on our findings, we thus propose that a more appropriate framing for FSP in the European East and West alike is characterised by autonomy and community care. This would provide for a reengagement with the epistemology of sustainability-compliant behaviours and attitudes beyond the joy vs. limitations dichotomy. Given the performativity of social scientific research, rooting the framing on knowledge from East European societies, where FSP is widespread in all social groups, including the affluent middle class, is important for lending credence to alternative visions and practices that can enhance the sustainability of overdeveloped societies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Airline sustainability modeling: A new framework with application of Bayesian structural equation modeling,"There are many factors which could influence the sustainability of airlines. The main purpose of this study is to introduce a framework for a financial sustainability index and model it based on structural equation modeling (SEM) with maximum likelihood and Bayesian predictors. The introduced framework includes economic performance, operational performance, cost performance, and financial performance. Based on both Bayesian SEM (Bayesian-SEM) and Classical SEM (Classical-SEM), it was found that economic performance with both operational performance and cost performance are significantly related to the financial performance index. The four mathematical indices employed are root mean square error, coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error to compare the efficiency of Bayesian-SEM and Classical-SEM in predicting the airline financial performance. The outputs confirmed that the framework with Bayesian prediction delivered a good fit with the data, although the framework predicted with a Classical-SEM approach did not prepare a well-fitting model. The reasons for this discrepancy between Classical and Bayesian predictions, as well as the potential advantages and caveats with the application of Bayesian approach in airline sustainability studies, are debated.. © 2016 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Life cycle assessment of household food waste in Zimbabwe: a systematic review,"Food waste is a significant issue worldwide, with developing countries like Zimbabwe facing unique challenges in managing household food waste. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool that can help to understand the environmental impacts of food waste and identify opportunities for reduction. The aim of this review paper is to utilize the LCA approach to examine and analyze the environmental effects of food waste produced at household level in Zimbabwe. The study also attempts to offer insights on feasible methods and interventions that can be used in Zimbabwe to lessen household food waste and the effects it has on the environment. A systematic literature search was conducted using Science Direct, Google Scholar, Springer, African Journal Online, PubMed, Scopus and Sage Publications using key words for example life cycle assessment, food waste, household food waste, sustainability, waste management and environmental impact. The review includes 41 English articles published up to 2024. The references added up to 76 because some of the references were found inside the 41 articles used to compile the review. The review established that household food waste in Zimbabwe is a significant issue. The main causes of food waste include poverty, lack of access to markets and inadequate storage and transportation infrastructure. Life Cycle Assessment has been applied in Zimbabwe to assess the environmental impacts of food waste, with a focus on land, water and greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, relevant stakeholders and the government should give priority to implementing awareness campaigns and education programs to promote food preservation techniques, minimize food loss and encourage the adoption of home composting systems in order to improve Zimbabwe’s LCA of household food waste. The review emphasizes the importance of addressing the root causes of household food waste, such as inadequate infrastructure to reduce impacts of household food waste in Zimbabwe. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

Information on selected dietary habits and sociodemographic factors of the students was gathered. Independent positive correlates of a lower fruit intake (<1 time/day) included male gender (OR=2.3, 95% CI =1.3-4.2) and a lower economic level (OR=1.5, 95% CI =1.0-2.3). Furthermore, positive independent correlates of a higher frequency of consumption of fried foods (≥1 time/day) included male gender (OR=2.2, 95% CI =1.2-4.1), urban residence (OR=1.6, 95% CI =1.0-2.6) and a lower economic level (OR=1.7, 95% CI =1.0-2.7). Conversely, excessive salt intake was positively and strongly correlated to a lower economic level (OR=3.5, 95% CI =2.1-6.0), but inversely related to students’ age (OR=0.4, 95% CI =0.2-0.9). Male gender and particularly a lower economic level were strong correlates of poor dietary habits among university students in Kosovo. Targeted interventions are needed to address dietary habits among youths, with a focus on providing support and resources to economically disadvantaged individuals. ercial use only. © the Author(s), 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Water resource management and financial performance in high water-sensitive corporates,"Water is a valuable resource in the world, and water resource management is an important aspect of corporate social responsibility. Does water resource management affect corporate financial performance? What is the influencing path? To find the potential relationship and influencing mechanism between water resource management and corporate financial performance, based on configuration thinking, we selected 259 A-share listed manufacturing corporates from 2015 to 2021 as research samples, using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis method (fsQCA) to explore the configuration and influencing path of water resource management affecting financial performance. Then we analyzed it with the configuration that CSR score (excluding “environmental responsibility”) affects financial performance. Our results show that: (1) poor water management and low CSR score will lead to bad corporate financial performance, but the former's severity of negative impact on corporate financial performance is more than that of the latter. Specific configurations indicate that companies with little water-related concrete actions implemented and technology innovation will severely hurt the financial performance. (2) Good water resources management cannot directly achieve high financial performance while high CSR score can make it, indicating that water resource management is a necessary but not sufficient condition for high corporate financial performance. Our research has unmasked the ""black box"" influencing mechanism of water resource management on corporate financial performance to some extent, which makes the configuration relationship between water resource management and financial performance clearer, therefore owns certain theoretical significance and practical value in the field of CSR and environmental management. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
The independent directors' Communist Party of China member status and firms' ESG performance: Evidence from Chinese listed firms,"Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), this study aims to explore the relationship between independent directors who are CPC members and firms' ESG (environmental, social, and governance) performance. We use a sample of 30,629 A-share firms in China for the period 2012–2021. Our main results show that CPC membership among independent directors can significantly improve firms' ESG performance, with board meetings serving as an important mechanism for this effect. We also examine the impact of CPC membership on external supervision, attention levels, “full and strict governance over the Party”, and ownership nature. The influence of independent directors' CPC membership on firms' ESG performance is greater in companies lacking external supervision, those with higher attention levels, and in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the peer effects of college students' engagement in the circular economy: Survey evidence from textbook reuse and recycling in China,"In the face of escalating environmental impacts caused by human activities, the development of a circular economy is widely regarded as a crucial sustainable solution. Identifying pivotal enablers driving the transition gains increasing significance. Scarce research has focused on how to improve public engagement in the circular economy and acceptance of circular products, especially for developing countries. Based on an interview of 2912 Chinese college students conducted in 2021, and the instrumental variable method, this paper innovatively documents positive associations of circular practices among peers. Specifically, it is found that: (1) individuals exhibit positive responses when their fellow classmates actively adopt used textbooks; (2) the impact is more pronounced among students majoring in energy and environmental fields, and for cohorts with higher participation in voluntary activities advocating sustainable lifestyles; and (3) the spillover effect is also manifested in engagement in second-hand book recycling. Given the potential of peers' beneficial influence as a promising instrument for driving circular economy practices, it is recommended that public policies consider its catalytic role. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Increased extreme hourly precipitation over China’s rice paddies from 1961 to 2012,"Rice yield have been affected by the increased extreme precipitation events in recent decades. Yet, the spatio-temporal patterns of extreme precipitation by rice type and phenology remain elusive. Here, we investigate the characteristics of four extreme precipitation indices across China’s rice paddy and their potential association with crop yields, by using hourly precipitation data from 1,215 stations and rice phenology observations from 45 sub-regions. The data indicate that hourly extreme precipitation have significantly increased in 1961–2012 for single rice and early rice in China but not for late rice. Rice were mainly exposed to extreme precipitation from transplantation to flowering stages. The frequency and proportion of extreme precipitation were significantly increased by 2.0–4.7% and 2.3–2.9% per decade, respectively, mainly in south China and Yangtze River Basin. The precipitation intensity and maximum hourly precipitation were increased by 0.7–1.1% and 0.9–2.8% per decade, respectively, mainly in central China and southeast coastal area. These extreme precipitation indices played a role as important as accumulated precipitation and mean temperature on the interannual variability of rice yields, regardless of rice types. Our results also highlight the urgencies to uncover the underlying mechanisms of extreme precipitation on rice growth, which in turn strengthens the predictability of crop models. © 2020, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
How does a single community grant multiple social licences for a problematic metro project? Reflections from a dynamic perspective,"Gaining a social licence to operate (SLO) is important to ensure a smooth-going metro project, yet few relevant studies exist. Using a small but eventful case from Nanjing, China, this study considers how a metro station construction project is assigned overlapping and fluid social licences by a local community and how these social licences interact with the project. The analytical framework is underpinned by two ‘continuum’ theories, one developed by Thomson and Boutilier and one by Dare et al., and incorporates the perspective of the project life cycle and movements of social resistance. The results reveal that a uniform, community-level SLO diverged into multiple SLOs with different characteristics. However, the changes in the SLO were decoupled from the life cycle of the metro project, as work was not only halted due to opposition but also resumed amidst such opposition. The governmental interventions, manipulative resistance and unqualified impact assessments were the main driving forces in the dynamic procedure. Based on the results and analysis, we highlight several policy implications. © 2020 IAIA.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatiotemporal variations in ozone and carbon dioxide concentrations in an HVAC system of a LEED-certified office building,"Indoor air quality (IAQ) is crucial for the health, well-being, and productivity of office occupants. IAQ is strongly influenced by occupancy and the operational mode of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. This study investigates the spatiotemporal variations in ozone (O3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations throughout the HVAC system of a LEED-certified office building. A four-month field measurement campaign was conducted at the Ray W. Herrick Laboratories, employing an automated multi-point sampling system to monitor O3 and CO2 at eight locations throughout the HVAC system. The objectives of this study are to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of these gases under different ventilation modes and occupancy levels, and to identify O3 loss mechanisms in the office and its HVAC system. Spatiotemporal variations in O3 and CO2 concentrations were observed throughout the HVAC system. Results indicate that outdoor air exchange rates (AERs) significantly impact indoor O3 levels, with higher AERs resulting in increased indoor O3 but reduced CO2 concentrations. Measurements reveal that HVAC filters and ducts contribute to O3 loss, with up to 18% O3 removal observed in the longest HVAC duct segment. Additionally, occupancy influences O3 deposition onto human skin and clothing surfaces. This research underscores the limitations of ventilation standards that focus only on CO2, highlighting the need for ventilation strategies that consider the effects of occupancy and outdoor AERs on different gases. By integrating multi-point gas sampling into building automation systems, more effective control strategies can be developed to enhance IAQ and occupant health while reducing energy consumption. © 2025",Not About Sufficiency
SDGs and port systems: New challenges and opportunities for marine protection from the EU green deal perspective,"The attention to the climate emergency leaves us facing a scenario in which public officials must take sides if they do not want to face a planet in which the conditions for human life are extreme. The public administrations, guarantors and at the service of the general interest, must attend through the formulation of intervention mechanisms to this situation of exception and implement the necessary instruments for it. This paper addresses not only a global diagnosis of the situation of a pandemic world affected by an unprecedented environmental and climate crisis, but also reviews the main lines of the policies to combat climate change implemented, and their necessary interweaving in aspects such as urban planning, or the projection in the life of our oceans. Thus, it examines the interesting opportunity that nature itself offers us, within the framework of nature-based solutions, and green infrastructures, and the circular economy, to build new integrated regulatory approaches, which for their implementation can specify the corresponding sustainable ""nudging"", and allow the qualification of circular cities. In addition, attention to our seas and oceans passes on land through the port space and its integration into the space of the city. The ports are the prelude to the care of our seas, and the spaces in which an intense economic, tourist, and environmental impact activity takes place. The action of man has proven to be the catalyst for the great natural disasters that we experience today. The effects of climate change, as well as the inevitable search for spaces not yet explored, make us think that it is necessary to review to what extent it is precisely our port spaces that should exemplify the enhancement of the sustainable development goals, such as Millennium Development Goals, in the midst of crises and emergencies such as those that occur in this first half of the twenty-first century. © The Authors.

Systematic research and quantitative approach for assessing agricultural green development,"Research on agricultural green development (AGD) is a scientific direction of integrating multi-disciplinary knowledge. It takes the food system as the research boundary, and focuses on analyzing the relationship between different sectors in the food system to achieve the targets of food security, human health, resource conservation and environmental protection. It also devotes attention to the coordination of ""green"" and ""development"" in agriculture production system. Previous methods often neglect systematically thinking and quantitatively analyzing of the AGD, and cannot coordinate multiple objectives of AGD. In this study, we firstly defined the research boundary of AGD, which considered ""soil-crop production-animal production-food processing-household consumption-environmental impacts"" systems; secondly, we developed the quantitative research approaches of ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up"", combining the whole food chain and multi-scale characters in AGD studies; thirdly, we developed the new modelling system for AGD (NUFER-AGD), including a core model (the food system nutrient flow model, NUFER), three quantitative analysis modules (water, atmosphere and land use modules) and one index module (linked to Driving force-Pressure-States-Impacts-Response, DPSIR; Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs; and Planet Boundaries, PBs); and last, we reviewed several case studies of quantitative research on AGD. Here, case studies were conducted by following 3 steps: (1) coordinating the overall goals AGDs at national level by nexus analysis approach and multiple indicators evaluation; (2) designing AGDs solutions quantitively by using green environment and resource limits as thresholds at the watershed scale; (3) analyzing the technical pathways of AGD systemically in the whole industrial chain. This research can not only provide systematic thinking and quantitative methods for the research of AGD, but also provide scientific support for the national strategy of AGD in China. © 2020, Science Press.

Dynamically evaluating the comprehensive efficiency of technological innovation and low-carbon economy in China's industrial sectors,"Technological innovation and low-carbon economy are significant for the high-quality development of China's industrial sectors. However, few scholars combine the two stages closely and discuss their coordinated development. This paper establishes an evaluation index system of technological innovation and low-carbon economy in China's industrial sectors. The technological innovation efficiency, low-carbon economy efficiency, and comprehensive efficiency of technological innovation and low-carbon economy are dynamically investigated by the two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and the DEA window analysis with 35 subsectors panel data during 1996–2018. The inter-industrial differences in the technological innovation efficiency and low-carbon economy efficiency are considered, and the influencing factors of the comprehensive efficiency of technological innovation and low-carbon economy are studied by the bootstrap truncation regression. The results show that: (1) The development of the technological innovation and low-carbon economy is uncoordinated, and the low-carbon economy efficiency needs improvement; (2) There is heterogeneous of the technological innovation efficiency and low-carbon economy efficiency in the 35 subsectors; (3) The density of science and technology institutions, and the average enterprises scale are positive to the comprehensive efficiency of technological innovation and low-carbon economy, while excessive reliance on technology introduction has a negative impaction. The corresponding suggestions are provided for promoting technological innovation efficiency and low-carbon economy efficiency of industrial sectors. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of environmental regulation on green TFP：A quasi-natural experiment based on China's carbon emissions trading pilot policy,"The carbon emissions trading pilot policy in China serves as a crucial market-oriented regulation tool to achieve green development. This study explores the impact of this policy on Chinese green TFP (GTFP). We utilize the provincial panel data from 2000 to 2017 and employ the GNDDF-Luenberger model to characterize GTFP. The results show that the carbon emissions trading pilot policy significantly improves GTFP. The effects are more pronounced in regions with more foreign direct investment, smaller technological gaps and higher levels of marketization. The carbon emissions trading pilot policy improves GTFP by promoting practical innovation. Furthermore, the promotion of GTFP through the carbon emissions trading pilot policy primarily relies on the enhancement of technological efficiency, rather than technological improvement. Our study provides policy implications for establishing an effective carbon emissions trading market in China. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Overview of the low-cost technologies for household water treatment in developing countries,"This study explored various low-cost water treatment technologies that are used to minimize levels of pathogens and contaminants in raw water. The paper focused on techniques such as cloth filtration, boiling, chlorination, and solar water disinfection. In the communities, cloth filtration is applied as the initial step of treating raw water with the proper choice of cloth fabrics followed by either boiling, chlorination or solar water disinfection. In low-income communities with unclean burning fuel sources, boiling was found to be the preferred method. Chlorination was also a popular technique associated with the challenges of low or high levels of free chlorine at the point of use and disinfection by-products. Solar water disinfection required optimal residence time and detection sensors for microorganism inactivation. Overall, the paper provided valuable insights into the different low-cost water treatment techniques that are commonly used for household applications, particularly in developing countries. © 2024 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Democratic illusion: Deliberative democracy in Canadian public policy,"The theory of deliberative democracy promotes the creation of systems of governance in which citizens actively exchange ideas, engage in debate, and create laws that are responsive to their interests and aspirations. While deliberative processes are being adopted in an increasing number of cases, decision-making power remains mostly in the hands of traditional elites. In Democratic Illusion, Genevieve Fuji Johnson examines four representative examples: participatory budgeting in the Toronto Community Housing Corporation, Deliberative Polling by Nova Scotia Power Incorporated, a national consultation process by the Canadian Nuclear Waste Management Organization, and public consultations embedded in the development of official languages policies in Nunavut. In each case, measures that appeared to empower the public failed to challenge the status quo approach to either formulating or implementing policy. Illuminating a critical gap between deliberative democratic theory and its applications, this timely and important study shows what needs to be done to ensure deliberative processes offer more than the illusion of democracy. © University of Toronto Press 2015.",Not About Sufficiency
"The transference of marine protected area management authority in Indonesia: Problems encountered, consequences and ways to move forward","Indonesia has adopted the establishment of regional (sub-national) marine protected areas (RMPAs) as a key strategy for achieving ambitious national marine spatial management targets. Under Act No. 32 of 2004, regency governments were given a mandate to autonomously manage marine resources, including RMPA establishment and management. Under the direction of these local governments, management strategies established through a co-management framework were providing good management systems in terms of personnel capacity, financing and monitoring. However, in 2014 the authority of the regency governments was revoked and transferred to the provincial governments under Act No. 23 of 2014. To date, the authority transference process is still incomplete for many of Indonesia's RMPAs. This paper identifies and analyses the problems faced by regency and provincial governments in undertaking this transition process using case studies from South Sulawesi Province and South-East Sulawesi Province. Problems identified at the local scale include limited funds, limited number and capacity of personnel and a strong sense of ownership of regency governments towards their assets. These hamper management, asset and document transfer, and zoning processes. The transfer of management authority has also severed partnerships with local communities previously playing important roles in RMPA management. At national scale, we found the national government has paid little attention to the problems occurring in the provinces and regencies. A strong willingness from the provincial and regency governments to co-manage the RMPAs is arguably vital and can become the point of departure for creating authority-sharing models that work under the new legal framework. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Inhalation exposure of nano-scaled titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles alters the inflammatory responses in asthmatic mice,"Context: Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) are regarded as relatively non-toxic in concentrations occurring in occupational environments. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that adverse health effects may develop in sensitive populations such as individuals with respiratory diseases. Objective: We investigated whether single or repeated exposure to TiO 2 could aggravate inflammatory responses in naïve mice and mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation. Methods: Exposure to aerosolized TiO2 was performed during OVA sensitization, before, or during the OVA challenge period. The effects on respiratory physiology, inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and inflammatory mediators in BAL and serum were assessed 24h after the last OVA challenge or TiO2 exposure. Results: A single exposure of TiO2 had a marked effect on responses in peripheral airways and increasing infiltration of neutrophils in airways of naïve animals. Marked aggravation of airway responses was also observed in animals with allergic disease provided that the single dose TiO 2 was given before allergen challenge. Repeated exposures to TiO 2 during sensitization diminished the OVA-induced airway eosinophilia and airway hyperresponsiveness but concomitant exposure to TiO2 during the OVA challenge period resulted in neutrophilic airway inflammation and a decline in general health condition as indicated by the loss of body weight. Conclusion: We conclude that inhalation of TiO2 may aggravate respiratory diseases and that the adverse health effects are highly dependent on dose and timing of exposure. Our data imply that inhalation of NPs may increase the risk for individuals with allergic airway disease to develop symptoms of severe asthma. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Performance of Ontario's Benthos Biomonitoring Network: Impacts on participants' social capital, environmental action, and problem-solving ability","The Ontario Benthos Biomonitoring Network (OBBN) is a collaborative initiative that monitors bottom-dwelling aquatic invertebrates to assess ecological condition. The Network is led by Ontario's Ministry of Environment and Environment Canada's Ecological Monitoring and Assessment Network Coordinating Office, and is part of the Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network. This paper evaluates OBBN performance, emphasizing impacts on participants' social capital, environmental action, and problem-solving ability. A questionnaire was used to characterize participants' reasons for joining, their experience and degree of involvement, their satisfaction with the Network, and their socio-economic status and demography. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) that participants' social capital has increased as a result of Network involvement; (2) that OBBN involvement has catalyzed an increase in participants' civic environmental action, or the effectiveness of that action; and (3) that Network members' problem-solving abilities have improved as a result of their participation. Evidence supports all three hypotheses, and participants' subjective assessments suggest that the Network is performing well. New participants join the Ontario Benthos Biomonitoring Network for a variety of water-management-related and social reasons. Most participants categorize the government-participant relationship in the OBBN as a voluntary partnership or collaboration, with an acceptable distribution of funding burden among partners. Participants are generally satisfied with the OBBN, and most believe it to be credible, relevant, legitimate, and inclusive.",Not About Sufficiency

Assessing U.S. County Sustainability: Accounting for Heterogeneous Human Capital Flows and Health Quality Within the Inclusive Wealth Framework,"Policy needs for more inclusive development measures than GDP have prompted numerous efforts, including those by the World Bank and United Nations, to comprehensively value market and non-market capital assets at a national level. In particular, the Inclusive Wealth (IW) index is an aggregate social value of all capital assets within a country, and non-declining values of IW over time provide an empirical test of weak sustainability. However, the approach ignores the fundamental openness of regions, which implies an interdependence in the flows of people across regions and is therefore limited in its applicability to sub-national scales. I address this critical gap in the IW framework by drawing on key concepts from regional economics, accounting for regional population flows and the resulting change in human capital (HC) within a region. I account for the effects of heterogeneous population change through changes in human capital, health quality, and social capital. I apply this new regional human capital accounting at the county level in the US from 2010-2017 using novel US county health quality data. In contrast to previous studies that proxy health capital with life expectancy, I use novel health data including self-reported number of healthy days per month, to focus on the factors impacting individuals’ health quality. I find that 47% of counties are declining in HC compared to 5.1% of counties using the traditional methods in the literature, implying that not accounting for regional differences vastly overstates sustainability. The main driver of declining HC is declines in health quality that are capitalized into declining productivity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Modelling Public Intentions to Use Innovative EV Chargers Employing Hybrid Energy Storage Systems: A UK Case Study Based upon the Technology Acceptance Model,"The current study investigates public intentions to use an innovative, off-grid renewably powered EV charging technology called FEVER (Future Electric Vehicle Energy networks supporting Renewables). We report the findings of a questionnaire-based survey (QBS) conducted at a zoo in the south of England, exploring the prospect of demonstrating FEVER. The QBS was designed around a context-specific technology acceptance model (TAM) and administered both face-to-face (n = 63) and online (n = 158) from April to May 2023. The results indicate that most participants were willing to pay to use FEVER, particularly where revenue would benefit the zoo. The participants agreed they intended to use the chargers, and that they would be useful and easy to use. The participants agreed that there would be normative pressure to use the chargers, but that their use would be enjoyable. Of greatest concern was that the chargers would be blocked by others. The participants were ambivalent about concerns over charging duration and charge sufficiency. Structural equation modelling confirmed that the context-specific TAM explained 58% of people’s use intentions. The core relationships of the TAM were confirmed, with ‘perceived usefulness’ additionally predicted by subjective norms and ‘perceived ease of use’ additionally predicted by anticipated enjoyment. Of the other variables, only concern that the chargers would be blocked was retained as a marginal predictor of ‘perceived ease of use’. The implications of these findings for the co-design and demonstration of FEVER are discussed. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Time-series of vegetation indices (VNIR/SWIR) derived from sentinel-2 (A/B) to assess turgor pressure in Kiwifruit,"For more than ten years, Central Chile has faced drought conditions, which impact crop production and quality, increasing food security risk. Under this scenario, implementing management practices that allow increasing water use efficiency is urgent. The study was carried out on kiwifruit trees, located in the O'Higgins region, Chile for season 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. We evaluate the time-series of nine vegetation indices in the VNIR and SWIR regions derived from Sentinel-2 (A/B) satellites to establish how much variability in the canopy water status there was. Over the study's site, eleven sensors were installed in five trees, which continuously measured the leaf's turgor pressure (Yara Water-Sensor). A strong Spearman's (ρ) correlation between turgor pressure and vegetation indices was obtained, having -0.88 with EVI and -0.81 with GVMI for season 2018-2019, and lower correlation for season 2019-2020, reaching -0.65 with Rededge1 and -0.66 with EVI. However, the NIR range's indices were influenced by the vegetative development of the crop rather than its water status. The red-edge showed better performance as the vegetative growth did not affect it. It is necessary to expand the study to consider higher variability in kiwifruit's water conditions and incorporate the sensitivity of different wavelengths. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy transition in Poland and Spain against changes in the EU energy and climate policy,"The European Union climate policy and the subsequent energy transition are expected to cause fundamental changes in individual EU countries, their economies, and industrial sectors. Furthermore, in order to achieve them, high financial outlays are essential. The main purpose of the article is to present a comparative analysis of the pace, directions, and main factors of the energy transition in Poland and Spain against the changes in the EU energy and climate policy. In particular, the subject of the study is the changes in the fuel structure of electricity generation (energy mix) and the changes in the concentration of energy generation. The analysis concentrates on Poland and Spain against the background of the group of EU27 countries. The study adopted a long-term perspective (1990–2020). The methodology used taxonomic measures of variability of structures and measures of concentration, as well as measures of descriptive and mathematical statistics. The result of the research proves that the EU common climate and energy policy has explicitly accelerated changes in the energy mix, both in the EU27 and in the studied countries, including those traditionally based on coal. The concentration analysis demonstrated an increase in diversification resulting in a significant increase in the share of renewable and low-carbon sources. The taxonomic analysis additionally proved that there was a parallel process towards making the energy mix of the studied countries more similar to the EU27. The limitation of the research is the adopted triangulation arrangement of the studied structures (EU27, EU15, countries that accessed the EU after 2004), enforced in this pilot research, but possible to expand the field of perception in subsequent research. What serves as a proof of the originality of the study is the fulfilment of research gaps in the long-term study of the degree of changes in the concentration of the energy mix structure of EU countries, and especially the study of the degree of intensity of its similarity. The application value of the study is its use in the energy policies of countries traditionally based on coal for the indication of the taken position, the goals, and ways to achieve them based on the experience of other countries. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Unveiling the dynamic nexuses between foreign investment, trade openness, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions in South Africa: A vector error correction model approach","Amidst the rising carbon emissions posing significant challenges for the global environment, there exists an inadequate recognition of the profound implications associated with foreign investment, trade openness, and energy consumption in South Africa. This study investigates the dynamic relationship among foreign investment, trade, energy, and the interactive effect of foreign investment and trade openness on environmental pollution in South Africa using time series data from 1990 to 2020. The results from the Johansen cointegration analysis and vector error correction model confirm a sustained long-term relationship among foreign investment, trade, energy, and CO2 emissions. This suggests that any deviations from CO2 emissions equilibrium would gradually self-adjust autonomously. This study reveals the long-run positive effects of trade openness and energy consumption on environmental pollution, while foreign investment exhibits a persistent negative impact on environmental pollution in the long run. Economic growth reduces CO2 emissions, while population growth and inflation are detrimental to the environment in the long run. The interaction between foreign investment and trade reduces environmental pollution in the short and long run. The Granger causality tests show a two-way causal relationship between population growth and CO2 emissions and a one-way causal connection among other variables, enlightening the linkage among these critical factors. The study offers several policy suggestions including environmentally friendly trade practices, investing in energy efficiency and transition, and promoting sustainable foreign investment in South Africa to achieve long-term economic sustainability while curbing environmental impact. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Put an eye on the future: Rethinking the theoretical price of fossil energy based on the perspective of intergenerational equity,"Discovering the true value of fossil energy resources can make full use of the price regulation leverage to adjust the energy structure, relieve carbon emissions, and gain more time for renewable energy to replace fossil energy. As exhaustible resources, the exploitation and consumption of coal, oil, and natural gas can directly affect the environment and resources reserve of future generations, which will directly destroy the fairness of intergenerational transmission. To make the price of fossil resources work better, the theoretical energy prices composed of production costs (PC), user costs (UC), environmental costs (EC), and especially intergenerational compensation costs (IC) are taken into consideration in this study. In addition, the study probes the impact of the theoretical and actual prices of fossil energy resources on carbon intensity with the path analysis method and detects the key paths. Results show that the theoretical price of natural gas is compensated the most, followed by coal and oil. From the result of intergenerational equity, the theoretical prices of coal and oil have higher impacts on carbon intensity than their actual prices, while the condition of natural gas is not the same. It is necessary for decision-makers to fully consider the characteristics of environmental damage, scarcity, and especially intergenerational compensation when repricing coal and oil price. Fortunately, the actual price of natural gas is the most effective for realizing the intergenerational equality target. It is crucial to put an eye on the future in reexamining fossil energy prices and formulating relevant emission reduction policies. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
VIRAL BELIEF: The Psychology of COVID Conspiracy Theories,"The COVID-19 pandemic induced an unprecedented stress around the world. The fear of illness, death, and the loss of loved ones profoundly impacted mental health and produced feelings of helplessness. Simultaneously, measures to contain the virus reshaped social life and created extreme forms of isolation. Moreover, the pandemic engendered a climate of uncertainty, driven by rapidly evolving and conflicting information. These conditions provided fertile ground for the development and rapid dissemination of health-related conspiracy theories, including the belief that COVID-19 was deliberately created and spread, that the virus was being deployed to track people, and that 5G technology was implicated in disease transmission. This chapter reports findings from a multinational survey of American, Mexican, and Canadian respondents, examining individual and social factors associated with belief in COVID conspiracy theories. The study identified three key predictors of conspiracy theories: mistrust in scientific authorities, psychotic-like symptoms, and right-wing political orientation. These three factors collectively accounted for up to a third of the response patterns in in our COVID conspiracies questionnaires, with the American context exhibiting the most pronounced correlation. We propose a model in which these determinants interact as components of a pathway to conspiracy beliefs. In this model, psychological properties of an individual interact with social conditions and cultural influences to engender conspiracy beliefs. Our model aligns with a “situated cognition” approach which emphasizes the pivotal role of an individual's environment in understanding their mental states. The situated approach points to the need for an interdisciplinary dialogue between historical and psychological approaches. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Luke Ritter; individual chapters, the contributors.

Enhancing sustainable soybean production in Indonesia: evaluating the environmental and economic benefits of MIGO technology for integrated supply chain sustainability,"Adopting MIGO Bio P 2000 Z in soybean cultivation in Indonesia has yielded significant advancements in sustainable agriculture. This innovative technology has demonstrated substantial potential in enhancing agricultural productivity. Environmental impacts of using MIGO Bio P 2000 Z include reduced reliance on chemical fertilizers, improved soil quality, positive contributions to greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and support for biodiversity conservation. Economically, implementing MIGO Bio P 2000 Z has increased soybean production, reduced fertilizer costs, higher incomes for soybean farmers, export opportunities, and investments in agricultural technology. While the primary focus is on economic impact, reducing chemical fertilizer use also benefits the environment by preventing pollution and soil degradation. Further, integrating MIGO Bio P 2000 Z into the soybean supply chain has bolstered supply sustainability, decreased dependency on soybean imports, and improved food security. Its positive effects include enhanced agricultural productivity, reduced environmental impact, and support for the well-being of farmers. Collaborative efforts, including government support, training, diversified markets, and strict monitoring, are essential for optimizing the technology's potential. Adopting MIGO Bio P 2000 Z in Indonesian soybean cultivation offers a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to bolstering economic growth, food security, and the agricultural sector.

Comparative Analysis of Electrification Technologies in Heavy-Duty Vehicles: A Case Study of Thailand,"This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of three potential electrification technologies for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) in Thailand: charging, battery swapping, and hydrogen fuel cells. The research began by developing an energy consumption model for heavy-duty vehicles HDVs and their corresponding electrification stations. A scenario was then created using parameters associated with a commonly used HDVs route in Thailand. The goal was to minimize the number of stations, ensuring that a charger would be available for any HDVs upon reaching its destination. The simulation results reveal the energy consumption patterns of HDVs along this route, the scheduling for various types of HDVs, and a cost analysis highlighting both advantages and disadvantages. © 2024 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
"Status of knowledge, ongoing research, and research needs in Amazonian wetlands","Exploitation and exploration of the Amazon basin by Europeans started in the 17th century, but only since about 1970 has the Brazilian government given priority to the connection of the Amazon basin to the industrialized southern part of the country. This new policy required scientific research on the natural resources of the area. Wetlands cover about 20% of the Amazon basin. Inland fishery, fertile floodplain soils, and hydroelectric energy offer a large potential for economic development. Research concentrates on major wetlands and water bodies near the large cities. The Amazon River floodplain belongs to the best studied tropical river floodplains in the world. However, studies in other areas suffer from lack of wetland inventory and classification. Accelerated economic development is not adequately accompanied by wetland research. Insufficient knowledge about distribution, size, structure and function of many wetlands leads to increasing degradation and loss of biodiversity, for instance, by the construction of hydroelectric power plants, large scale deforestation for cattle ranching and agro-industrial projects, mining activities, the construction of navigation channels (hidrovias), etc. The low number of scientists working in the area and lack of funding require close cooperation in problem-oriented multidisciplinary projects (scientific clustering) to optimize scientific outcome. Intensive, long-term cooperation and scientific exchange with institutions from southern Brazil and from abroad is recommended to improve the scientific infrastructure in Amazonian institutions, to accelerate the transfer of new scientific methods and technology, and to intensify the training program for local human resources. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Not About Sufficiency
International conflicts related to energy: A case study of lithuania’s opposition to the construction of russian nuclear power plants near its,"The chapter explains Lithuanian motives to oppose the construction of Ostrovets and Baltic nuclear power plants (NPPs) and examines the opposition process itself. By analyzing Lithuanian attempts to stop the construction of the NPPs mentioned above, it exposes the effectiveness of Lithuanian efforts in using international legal mechanisms and memberships in international organizations as tools for opposing them. Contrary to the conventional explanations that associate Lithuanian opposition to Russian NPPs with their closeness, safety flaws, and legal issues, the study argues that Lithuania opposes them because it perceives these nuclear power plants as tools of Russian policy that aim to hinder the development of Lithuanian strategic energy projects and to slow down its infrastructural integration into the European Union. Moreover, it shows that Lithuania managed to secure favorable political declarations from international organizations regarding Russian NPPs, but it was the national measures that had the most impact on their development. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

"A Review of Field Measurement Studies on Thermal Comfort, Indoor Air Quality and Virus Risk","People spend up to 90% of their time indoors where they continuously interact with the indoor environment. Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ), and in particular thermal comfort, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), and acoustic and visual comfort, have proven to be significant factors that influence the occupants’ health, comfort, productivity and general well-being. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the need for real-life experimental data acquired through field measurement studies to help us understand and potentially control the impact of IEQ on the occupants’ health. In this context, there was a significant increase over the past two decades of field measurement studies conducted all over the world that analyse the IEQ in various indoor environments. In this study, an overview of the most important factors that influence the IAQ, thermal comfort, and the risk of virus transmission is first presented, followed by a comprehensive review of selected field measurement studies from the last 20 years. The main objective is to provide a broad overview of the current status of field measurement studies, to identify key characteristics, common outcomes, correlations, insights, as well as gaps, and to serve as the starting point for conducting future field measurement studies. © 2022 by the authors.

Effects of turning frequency on compost stability and some chemical characteristics in a rotary drum composter,"Effect of turning frequency on quality, namely some chemical characteristics (temperature, moisture content, pH, electrical conductivity, total organic matter, nitrogen dynamics, phosphorus and trace elements) and stability of compost (biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, rate of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide evolution) in a rotary drum were studied. Composting was stimulated by three turns of rotary drum at different time intervals i.e. at the gap of 6 h (Run A), 12 h (Run B), 18 h (Run C) and 24 h (Run D) for 15 d. It was observed that Run D (24 h turning frequency) caused longer thermophilic phase (4 d) with a higher rise at temperature 58 °C; consequently, peak of maximum temperature was shifted along with the increase of turning frequency. Around 23% of available carbon in Run D was utilized by micro-organisms and contained lower final electrical conductivity (1.32 dS m-1) possibly causing lesser phytotoxicity effects on the growth of plants. The percentage increase in total nitrogen and total phosphorus (organic and inorganic) in Run D was found to be 45% and 37% as compared to 7% and 17%, 6% and 32% and 18% and 30% in Run A, B, and C, respectively, indicating higher mineralization. The final values of respiration rates (CO2 evolution and oxygen uptake rate) for Run D was found to be the lowest, nevertheless, other runs also provided relatively stable compost. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Geo-Economic Importance Index for Doubling the Efforts by 2030,"The Association of Southeast Asian Nations have been working towards ‘doubling the efforts’ of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. It is strategically important to make an assessment of member countries for their “regional integration contributions” to improving the trans-boundary macroeconomic effects on achieving SDGs. In this context, this study has developed a performance measure – ‘Geo-economic Importance Index’ (GEII) – by incorporating the major components of the important subset of both the ASEAN community Vision 2025 and the UN2030 Agenda. The subset is: (i) Poverty Reduction (SDG 1) (ii) Infrastructure and Connectivity (SDG 9) (iii) Natural Resource Management (SDG 15) (iv) Sustainable Consumption and Production (SDG 12) and (v) Resilience Capacity (SDG 13). The results of the empirical analysis indicate that the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) cooperation enables more ASEAN members to accelerate their ‘doubling the efforts’ strategy by 2030. The channels through which relatively more acceleration can happen are improving labour productivity and human capital development. Political commitments not to decrease education and health expenditure will be necessary given the migration and population aging, which will increase the demand for education and healthcare services. There is potential to organize select education and healthcare services regionally to improve competency and efficiency in delivery. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Silica aerogel added lightweight cement-based composite mortars for thermal insulation purposes in sustainable structures: A comprehensive study,"It has been discovered in recent years that the use of silica aerogel in cement-based materials contributes to the thermal insulation properties of the materials, and studies on this subject have gained importance. However, it was determined that the studies mostly remained at the level of the thermal conductivity coefficient and the main physical and mechanical properties of the materials. In this study, a comprehensive research was carried out with the replacement of micro-sized aerogel particles with quartz sand in different ratios (0, 1, 1.6, 2.4, 3.2, 4 and 4.5 wt%) in lightweight cement-based composite mortar (LCCM) combinations. Specifically, the effect of silica aerogel granules (SAG) on flowability, fresh and hardened densities, porosity, water absorption, compressive strength, macro/microstructural properties (by optic microscope, SEM, XRD analysis), thermal conductivity, specific heat, thermal diffusivity and heat storage capability of LCCMs were investigated. While SAG could increase the flowability (up to 8.4 %) at low using rates, it decreased it at higher rates. It is very effective in reducing fresh and hardened densities. However, it highly increased porosity and water absorption, and greatly decreased compressive strength. On the other hand, generally the poor interfacial properties of the cement matrix and the aerogel were moderately improved in this study. The lowest thermal conductivity was determined as 0.155 W/mK in the highest SAG usage. SAG increased specific heat, decreased thermal diffusivity and decreased heat storage capability of LCCMs up to 45.23 %, 63.49 % and 46.32 %, respectively. As a result of the study, aerogel has been identified as a very suitable material that can be used to highly improve thermal properties in LCCMs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Transforming Aviation’s Impact on the Climate: Rethinking the Research Strategy,"Aviation is under tremendous pressure to mitigate its impacts on the climate, but the best response strategies are unknown today due to deep uncertainties. How low-emission fuels will scale to levels relevant for the industry, along with the best strategies for managing contrails and other non-CO2 effects, are unknowable today with unknown cost and disruption. A conventional risk-based approach that involves investment across a known set of options is unworkable; instead, we argue that an experimentalist approach is needed that addresses deep uncertainties head on. This hinges on four key factors: a critical mass of actors facing strong incentives to identify solutions, a wide search for alternatives through experiments, periodic assessments, and adjustment of goals and strategies. Present strategies do not give enough attention to higher-risk alternatives with disruptive potential, because those approaches have few political and organizational supporters. Small groups of highly motivated actors─such as the nascent coalition of first movers on clean aviation already forming in Europe and the U.S.─could initiate an experimentalist program. The challenges of the aviation sector mirror other hard-to-abate sectors, making this framework potentially applicable to a wider set of sectors where technological, business, and investment choices are shrouded in deep uncertainty. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental movements in Turkey from the perspective of commons,"Enclosure movements on the commons continue without slowing down especially in the developing countries; as well as the grassroots movements against them. Enclosure movements frequently contain several foreign investments and appropriations to other uses on natural resources and/or assets such as pastures, forests, rivers, agricultural lands and seashores, which are crucial income sources for rural households. Among other factors, the shortcomings in the common management processes, cooperatives and self-organization capacity of the stakeholders ease the enclosure process. The study investigates the environmental movements as commoning practices in Turkey in the last decade through media analysis and surveys. The study aims to constitute a scientific basis to enhance the EIA processes in order to encourage proactive responses to environmental crises, prevent enclosure movements on the commons and maintain the local sustainable development. Hence, firstly the environmental movements in Turkey are spatialized by GIS analyst tools to constitute an environmental inventory including time, types, frequency and location of the movements; secondly, an online survey is conducted with the environmental NGOs; thirdly, two possible scenarios are suggested through a triple-scale scoring system; and finally, several recommendations are proposed in order to sustain the commons. © 2021 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Attitudes toward Wind Power in Norway–Solution or Problem in Renewable Energy Development?,"Wind power has become an increasingly important source of renewable energy in Norway. Current demand and production capacity have exceeded expectations stipulated in energy policies a few years back. Wind power affects landscape characteristics, and the rapid development has created considerable public conflict. However, knowledge to date about public attitudes toward wind power development in Norway is limited. We surveyed a representative sample of the Norwegian public to examine relationships between wind power development and place attachment, localization, and policies. We also examined if attitudes toward wind power are linked to broader environmental attitudes and meaning of place. Public attitudes range from strong support to strong opposition. We found limited support for NIMBY effects. Support versus opposition correlates with attitudes toward place attachment, localization of wind power plants and energy policies. We found evidence of a dichotomy between the more fundamental world views of eco-modernism versus de-growth influencing the more specific wind power attitudes. We argue that policy institutions have underestimated the power of attitude diversity in the wind power debate, and that social acceptability of future wind power development will depend on improved understanding of how social values of landscapes are impacted. © 2023, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Green synthesis of rice straw-derived silica nanoparticles by hydrothermal process for antimicrobial properties and effective degradation of dyes,"Rice straw is considered a major agricultural waste that has become a major threat to the environment. However, waste valorization of rice straws is a major challenge for the whole world. Therefore, this research aimed to utilize the different varieties of rice straw including Parmal rice straw (PRS), and Basmati rice straw (BRS) for the synthesis of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) using hydrothermal autoclave method to precisely modify the particle size, and distribution, morphology and purity. This method uses water as a reaction medium under high temperature and pressure, which results in energy savings and reduced chemical waste compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, SiNPs were characterized using different analytical techniques. SEM showed the rough, compact, and highly ordered surface for both samples, while the SNP exhibited irregular shapes and rough surfaces. Rice straw powder revealed major functional groups at 787 cm−1, 1461 cm−1, and 2919.10 cm−1. BRS and PRS showed thermal stability up to 380 ℃ and 250 ℃, respectively. The particle size of BRS and PRS were found to be 112.47±1.23 nm and 114.98±1.23 nm, respectively. PRS-SiNPs showed the effective dye reduction ability for anthraquinone (96.79%± 0.39) and alizarin yellow (92.63%± 0.17) in 30 min. Additionally, the SiNPs exhibited potential bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in terms of zone of inhibition. Overall, the SiNPs synthesized from PRS demonstrated superior photocatalytic efficiency in the reduction of dyes compared to those synthesized from BRS. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers",Not About Sufficiency
Contribution to the measurement of digital financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Despite the notable progress made in the development of digital financial services in sub-Saharan Africa, no comprehensive measure is currently available to quantify this progress. Therefore, we constructed a digital financial inclusion index using a parametric approach. Our findings show an upward trend in digital financial inclusion from 2014 to 2021, with a notable increase observed in this index in 2021. Based on the instrumental variable approach, we found that COVID-19, growth product per capita, and quality of governance were the main drivers of digital financial inclusion. Furthermore, findings reveal that not all sub-Saharan African countries have benefited equally from the digital financial revolution. Some countries, including Kenya, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire, have benefited substantially because of their high degree of digital financial inclusion. However, other countries—such as Malawi, Guinea, Burkina Faso, and Mali—have fallen behind in terms of digital financial inclusion and are reaping fewer benefits from the revolution in digital banking. We interpreted this observation as symptomatic of inequality. Using the Shapley decomposition analysis, we found that 33% of the disparities in digital financial inclusion among the examined countries were attributable to differences in the use of digital financial services and 13% to the differences in access to those services. We identified the legal origin as a driver of inequality in both access to and use of digital financial services. Moreover, access to the internet has contributed to inequality in the use of digital financial services. In terms of economic implications, countries with the lowest digital financial inclusion must revise their legal systems and invest in internet infrastructure. © 2024 Borsa İstanbul Anonim Şirketi",Not About Sufficiency
Role of Stakeholder Communication in Sustainability of Indonesia’s Conservation Area,"Indonesia's environmental policy in the conservation area is carried out by establishing the nature reserve as the highest conservation area in addition to wildlife reserves. The high level of damage in the nature reserve area requires collaboration integrated multi-party. Therefore, preservation activities of nature reserves require stakeholder involvement and multi-stakeholder communication in conservation area management. This study aims to: 1) identify the roles and relationships of stakeholders in preserving the nature reserve area 2) formulating a communication model suitable for conservation of the nature reserve. The research method uses survey methods with qualitative and quantitative descriptive approaches obtained from secondary and primary data sources. Data collection techniques carried out by interviews, observation of documentation and questionnaires. The population in this study is the government, business, and society. This research produces two main points, first the party that has the biggest role in the preservation and sustainability of the nature reserve area that is the government. The relationship between government and society shows the pattern of democratic relations with critical partnerships and reciprocal models. The relationship between the government and the business world (Pertamina Geothermal) shows a form of collaboration. The relationship between the community and the business world (Pertamina Geothermal) shows forms of conflict and corporate relations. Second, to synergize communication between stakeholders, we propose a stakeholder communication model for the sustainability of nature reserves that emphasizes partnership, collaborative work, mutual respect, and assertive communication. The more synergy of stakeholder communication, the more effective the preservation of nature reserves. © 2019. All Rights Reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Do sustainable supply chain practices mitigate carbon emissions? The role of supplier environmental, social and governance training","Over 75% of a firm's carbon footprint is attributed to logistics activities and transportation related to the acquisition, production, and distribution of materials and goods. Green supply chain management is considered a way to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change concerns. Accordingly, this study aims to investigate whether sustainable supply chain practices reduce carbon emissions and whether supplier environmental, social, and governance (ESG) training further enhances this effect, thereby reinforcing the negative association. We collected data for an international sample of manufacturing firms from Thomson Reuters Eikon for the period between 2002 and 2021 and ran a country–year fixed-effects regression. To address endogeneity, we also utilized two-stage least squares regression, propensity score matching, and entropy balancing. Our findings indicate that sustainable supply chain practices alleviate carbon emissions. Furthermore, we found that supplier ESG training strengthens this relationship, leading to even higher reductions in carbon emissions. Specifically, this training reinforces the negative association between sustainable supply chain practices and carbon emissions, resulting in a more pronounced decrease in carbon emissions. These results are robust to alternative proxies, samples, and endogeneity concerns. Our study highlights the importance of policy development and collaborative interorganizational actions among supply chain partners in developing solutions to climate change issues. As supply chain activities generate high levels of emissions and regulatory press is mounting, our findings may help firms take proactive actions for greener supply chain management and avoid regulatory sanctions. Additionally, we found that institutional strength stimulates firms' clean supply chain practices. Therefore, we advise policymakers to develop and implement necessary policies in less developed countries with weak public environmental regulations. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Species diversity and coexistence of mosquito larvae breeding in phytotelmata microhabitats; a cross-sectional study from Kalutara district, Western Province, Sri Lanka","Phytotelmata are used by many insects for breeding. This study was designed to identify mosquito species breed in phytotelmata available in the Kalutara district. A larval survey was carried out once every two months from January 2019 to April 2021 in thirteen Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas. For each survey, 20 premises including houses, institutions, public places, roadsides, open areas, and plantations were examined in one randomly selected Grama Niladari (GN) division in each MOH area. According to the study, 18 mosquito species belonging to 6 genera were identified in 8 types of phytotelmata namely; tree holes, bamboo stumps, leaf axils, tree trunks, fruit husks, fruit shells, fallen leaves, and fallen spathes. Species richness was highest in tree holes and species diversity was highest in fallen leaves. Similarly, 17 types of coexistence could be observed. The coexistence of four species Aedes chrysolineatus, Ae. downsiomyia, Ae. w-albus, and Ae. krombeini were observed in Dillenia suffruticosa fallen leaves. Species richness and species diversity of mosquitoes that breed in phytotelmata were highest in Walallawita. The correlation between the volume of water in phytotelmata and the number of larvae in the phytotelmata habitat was statistically insignificant. Although phytotelma is a hidden aquatic habitat, this study indicated that it is an important breeding place for a variety of mosquitoes including vector mosquitoes such as Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. © 2022, University of Peradeniya.

Sustainable Sanitation as a Tool to Reduce Land Degradation,"Although a fundamentally unappealing topic, human excreta management has long been, and remains, one of humankind’s most significant dilemmas. Human excreta is one of the few resources that is increasing with the growth of the population. The highly organic, nutrient-rich nature of human excreta makes it a valuable resource; however, without adequate processing, it can pose a risk to environmental quality and human health through the presence of pathogens, pollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals) and high concentrations of mobile nutrients. Sustainable innovation of sanitation technology is required to address this management issue. Another issue of growing global concern is the loss of productive agricultural land and with it the loss of food security, which has further implications for human health and environmental quality. The diversity of causes and the growing extent of land degradation means that there is no ‘silver bullet’ solution and a range of location- and environment-specific solutions are required to address the issue. This chapter will explore the use of sustainable human excreta management practices for the provision of a solution to two global needs: Sustainable human excreta management and improvement of degraded lands. There are a range of sanitation solutions designed to suit a diversity of environments and needs, but in order for a sanitation system to be considered sustainable, it must address social, economic and environmental needs for the community it serves. Meeting the three requirements for sustainability remains a common issue globally, but particularly in low- and middle-income countries where access to sustainable sanitation is one of the leading barriers to improved health in the general population and where reliance on the productivity of agricultural and urban garden lands is high. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability of community-owned mini-grids: Evidence from India,"Background: Community-owned solar mini-grids (SMGs) are increasingly promoted to provide communities access to reliable electricity, empowering local actors as they become active stakeholders in projects. However, early failures and difficulties in building local capacity have raised questions regarding their long-term sustainability and ability to be replicated to provide socio-economic benefits to the communities. This study assesses the sustainability of 24 community-owned SMGs in India operating over extensive periods of time using a novel scoring framework using mixed methods to derive its conclusions. Results: The study found that institutional, financial, and technical capacities, central for the SMG's long-term sustainability, could be achieved through community engagement from early stages, if communities are allowed freedom to develop governance procedures while at the same time clarifying roles and responsibilities. This creates strong sense of ownership that is key for effective and inclusive governance. User satisfaction, ensured through provision of usable supply in line with users' expectations, motivates actors to make regular payments, thus leading to economic sustenance. While social and environmental benefits were observed, energy consumption and engagement in productive activities remained marginal. Conclusions: The study reports an example of community-owned SMG model that has been replicated sustainably over many cases, overcoming key challenges related to appropriate financial and technical management and producing positive social impact. Low engagement in productive activities was more a factor of the local socio-cultural contexts, rather than limited paying capacities of the users. To increase energy utilization and create environments for sustainable rural living, the study recommends implementation of systems that link energy with other rural development needs such as agriculture or water provision. The study also recommends more use of qualitative and quantitative data for impact analysis to ensure that conclusions are generalizable and provide rich contextual explanations for the observed phenomena. © 2019 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

Towards a healthy Ganga-Improving river flows through understanding trade offs,"Scores of Indians living worldwide, since the times immemorial have revered river Ganga. The very presence of Ganga is not only critical from a socio-cultural perspective; but it contributes to various economic and livelihood activities for the people residing in the basin. It is one of the most complex river basins in the world, in terms of the number of people residing in its basin space and the pressure on its water resources. Thus, the river is facing multiple challenges. There is a growing debate in India for improving the health of the Ganga River, mainly at two fronts, i.e., its water quality and quantity. WWF-India along with its partners is working towards the conservation of Ganga since last decade. Whilst the work has been multi-dimensional, ranging from the issues of flows in the river to water pollution, climate change adaptation and habitat and biodiversity conservation; however, in this paper the aspect of adequate flows in the river Ganga is discussed. During 2015-16, along with partners, WWF-India conducted an action research study in over 2 million hectares of culturable command area of two irrigation systems taking off from River Ganga, to understand the barriers to implement Environmental Flows (E-Flows) in the critical stretch of river Ganga (between Haridwar and Triveni Sangam Allahabad). Under this initiative, the team tried to bridge the knowledge gap about potential trade-offs for implementation of E-Flows in a critical stretch of Ganga. The team made an attempt to understand the surface water allocation and water use scenario in western and central part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, where the Ganga water is used for agricultural purposes through major irrigation infrastructure. The E-Flows recommendations for critical locations downstream of two barrages, i.e., headworks of two major irrigation schemes, were developed. This paper discusses approaches for management of trade-offs to restore E-Flows in this stretch of Ganga and includes various management options-like (i) promotion of irrigation water use efficiency and (ii) institutional aspects. The paper argues that, whilst there is a widespread apprehension that, from the Ganga river water resources use, any curtailment in the allocation quota for irrigation would lead to an adverse impact on the farming community. However, actually after assessing the trade-offs, it can be inferred that although the E-Flows implementation in this stretch of Ganga would require enhancement of water in the river, but that requirement may not be substantial. Toward the end of the paper, challenges and opportunities for E-Flows implementation in the Upper Ganga are discussed. © 2019 Kaushal, Babu, Mishra, Ghosh, Tare, Kumar, Sinha and Verma.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of off-farm employment in promoting sustainable farm development through integrated pest management technology adoption,"This study explores the impact of off-farm employment on the adoption of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technology among farmers in rural China, with a focus on sustainable farm development. Utilizing micro-survey data and applying an endogenous switching Probit model within a counterfactual analysis framework, the research examines how off-farm employment influences the likelihood of adopting IPM technology. The findings reveal that 67.84% of farmers have adopted IPM technology, while 32.16% have not. The counterfactual analysis indicates that if farmers with off-farm employment did not engage in off-farm activities, their probability of adopting IPM technology would decrease by 71.57%. Conversely, if farmers without off-farm employment were to engage in off-farm activities, their probability of adopting IPM technology would increase by 76.95%. Key factors influencing off-farm employment include age, education level, number of elderly in the household, membership in a cooperative, number of land plots, village topography, and the number of family members and relatives working in government or public institutions. In addition, age, personal health status, number of household laborers, membership in a cooperative, number of land plots, village topography, and ecological cognition significantly affect the adoption of IPM technology. The study suggests that optimizing industrial structure, improving the rural employment market, enhancing the role of farmers’ professional cooperatives, strengthening education and training efforts, and increasing publicity efforts can collectively improve the adoption of IPM technology. These strategies contribute to sustainable farm development and better environmental outcomes. Copyright © 2025 Ke, Dan, Wang and Razzaq.",Not About Sufficiency
Abandoned mine land program: Examining public participation in decision-making,"For centuries, coal extraction and production provided low-cost energy that powered the American economy.

The site remediation has been funded and promoted by the AML program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) of 1977, and public engagement has been required. However, little is known about the AML program and the public engagement requirement for site remediation decision-making. Relying on State and Tribal Reclamation Plans and community surveys, we investigate how AML states and tribes engage the public and which barriers limit successful participation in the AML program. We found that AML states and tribes rely heavily on traditional methods of public engagement, such as public meetings, hearings, and comment periods, rather than nontraditional methods that could include more diverse stakeholders. We also found (1) lack of information on public participation opportunities and (2) unclear project selection and awards processes as key barriers limiting public engagement. Three recommendations specific to AML program are suggested. © 2023 The Authors.

"Saving Our ""Common Home"" Through Them: A Critical Analysis of the ""For Our Common Home"" Campaign in Alberta","The recent years have witnessed a fast-growing wave of new social collaborative mobilizations and demands for a more aggressive fight against climate change, as well as climate justice around the world. Such climate justice solidarity is gaining momentum not only in the North-South axis, but also among non-traditional climate justice entities such as religious groups. This article, based on the case analysis of one of those collaborative and solidarity struggles known as the ""For our Common Home"" campaign, contributes to the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the religious motives for addressing climate in terms of integral ecology and ecological conversion. Implemented by Development and Peace-Canada, this multi-year faith-inspired climate justice initiative aimed at pushing Canadian companies operating in the Amazon to be more environmentally responsible in their activities in the Amazonian basin, and to respect the voices of local Indigenous environmental activists. However, as I argue in this article, this form of climate justice activism is based on the assumption that global North institutions' solidarity with persecuted climate justice activists and communities in the global South can bear positive results for the fight against global warming. Using the combined research approach involving both direct participatory observation and participation in virtual meetings and events, we explore the following questions: How can a faith-inspired movement like Development and Peace-Caritas Canada, through a religious environmental campaign involving Indigenous communities in Canada and Brazil, participate in the development of social cohesion, and the advancement of social justice? What change can the campaign's solidarity with persecuted climate justice activists and communities in the Amazon bring to the climate fight against climate change?",Not About Sufficiency
On occupant behavior and innovation studies towards high performance buildings: A transdisciplinary approach,"With ever-increasing population and urbanization, it is crucial to decrease energy density in the built environmentwithout sacrificing occupants' comfort andwell-being. This requires consideration of technological developments along with the human factor in order to achieve environmental and social sustainability. Two major contributors to the development of conceptualizations for human-centric technologies are behavior and innovation (B & I) studies. Behavior studies aims to explain individualistic or society-based dynamics of human behavior whereas the innovation studies focuses on social, economic, organizational, and regulatory dimensions and processes of inventive activity. If these studies are incorporated into the hardcore architecture and engineering disciplines with a transdisciplinary approach, the orchestration of occupant behavior and the innovative technologies would be possible, which in turn significantly enhance the comfort and energy efficiency in built environments. This paper aims to provide an overview of interdisciplinary dialog between B & I studies and underlines the role of their collaboration to leverage transdisciplinary research on human-building interaction for energy efficiency. The approach presented here is structured as a conceptual framework and named the 'socio-technical core' (STC). STC is to lead to more organic articulation of energy efficiency innovations with real life and pave the way for higher level of acceptance. In order to have a 'big-picture' for the well-accepted conceptualizations and the current status of interdisciplinary dialog, we provide a review of (B & I) theories and models along with network analysis of key concepts. Then we investigate the potential directions of future transdisciplinary efforts by discussing the influences of B & I studies to each other for application to energy efficiency studies. In order to put the analysis in a firm background, we provide a case study for thermostat, which can be considered as a product improved with B & I approaches during last decades. We also discuss the benefits of B & I based transdisciplinary research perspective by referring to few examples in literature and the points emerged in this study. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Understanding the Diversity and Roles of the Ruminal Microbiome,"The importance of ruminal microbiota in ruminants is emphasized, not only as a special symbiotic relationship with ruminants but also as an interactive and dynamic ecosystem established by the metabolites of various rumen microorganisms. Rumen microbial community is essential for life maintenance and production as they help decompose and utilize fiber that is difficult to digest, supplying about 70% of the energy needed by the host and 60–85% of the amino acids that reach the small intestine. Bacteria are the most abundant in the rumen, but protozoa, which are relatively large, account for 40–50% of the total microorganisms. However, the composition of these ruminal microbiota is not conserved or constant throughout life and is greatly influenced by the host. It is known that the initial colonization of calves immediately after birth is mainly influenced by the mother, and later changes depending on various factors such as diet, age, gender and breed. The initial rumen microbial community contains aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria due to the presence of oxygen, but as age increases, a hypoxic environment is created inside the rumen, and anaerobic bacteria become dominant in the rumen microbial community. As calves grow, taxonomic diversity increases, especially as they begin to consume solid food. Understanding the factors affecting the rumen microbial community and their effects and changes can lead to the early development and stabilization of the microbial community through the control of rumen microorganisms, and is expected to ultimately help improve host productivity and efficiency. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Microbiological Society of Korea 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Unveiling the relationship of ESG, fintech, green finance, innovation and sustainability: case of Gulf countries","Technological advancement and innovations not only transformed businesses but also optimize numerous functional areas of financial services. Besides, green finance and fintech are also essential tools to achieve sustainable development agendas. Thus, it is imperative to document the evidence that how conducive such factors are to achieve 2030 sustainable development goals. The study, in this regard, is aimed to scrutinize innovation, green finance, financial technologies, and ESG factors altogether in order to determine their effectiveness on sustainable development in Gulf countries in the time span of 2000–2020. The study opts for methods of moments quantile regression (MMQR) and claim that green finance, green innovation, and fintech helps in achieving sustainable development goals. However, among ESG factors, social and governance role is negative in the sampled economies. Findings are interesting for policy makers and government institutions because it assists them to improve governance evaluation system and classification standards so that countries may no longer experience hindrance when indulging in sustainable development actions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
WILD HEARTS: Exploring the Connection between STEM Learning and Conservation Psychology in Zoos and Aquariums,"As informal learning institutions, zoos and aquariums offer a multitude of societal benefits, including opportunities for social bonding, pro-environmental skill and behavior development, and the chance to forge emotional connections with animals. Zoos and aquariums also serve as potential venues for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and provide opportunities for visitors to engage in learning centered on wildlife and habitat conservation. Zoo and aquarium visitors, however, often do not see these facilities as explicit in their STEM learning opportunities. We examine this convergence in three key areas: first, we discuss inquiry-based education as a viable approach for informal learning. Then, we examine empathy as a lens and a framework through which we can curate rich experiences. Finally, we look at the generation of conservation solutions through empathy-based inquiry as a critical task of conservation education. As zoos and aquariums continue to redefine their relevance in modern society, the nexus of STEM education and conservation psychology can offer a new role for these institutions to fill. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Judy Diamond and Sherman Rosenfeld; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Progressive Correlation Between Carbon Emission, Economic Growth, Energy Use, and Oil Consumption by the Most Prominent Contributors to Travel and Tourism GDPs","Travel and tourism have glimpsed a significant and promising implication for economic development. Despite the commendatory implication of tourism, it levies a stringent environmental cost such as environmental degeneration. Hence, this study will incorporate the 18 countries out of the top 20 travel and tourism contributors to economic growth to assess the progressive correlation between tourist arrival, economic growth, energy consumption, and oil consumption on carbon emission by applying panel ARDL spanning from 1995 to 2019. The outcome of the panel ARDL reveals that both periods have witnessed that the endogenous variables have a substantial and positive impact on environmental degradation except for tourism as it indicates −0.22 and −0.48% in the long and short run, having a rate of adjustment as −0.52 toward the equilibrium. The simultaneous quantile regression reveals that in the 50 and 75 percentiles, the effect of tourism has a negative impact, which contradicts the PMG findings. These determinations suggest that the policymakers look for more manageable and environmentally sound tourism and economic growth procedures to safeguard the sustainable environment in the studied countries.

"Green banking practices, bank reputation, and environmental awareness: evidence from Islamic banks in a developing economy","Fulfilling the international considerations of environment, societal, and governance challenges, the financial industry, especially banks, has initiated “Go Green” practices to help sustain the environment and enhance “banking” across the globe. Amidst the green and climate-friendly drives, there is scarce literature highlighting the banks’ green practices, environmental awareness, and their effects on bank reputation, especially the reputation of Islamic banks. This study aims to investigate the green banking practices of Islamic banks in a developing Islamic country. Focusing on the greening ambitions of banks, this study argues that the reputation of Islamic banks can be better enhanced through adopting green banking initiatives that will beget better climatic outcomes in Muslim societies. Therefore, the study illumes green banking practices and their impact on the reputation of Islamic banks in Pakistan. Moreover, this study checks the moderation effect of employees’ environmental awareness on banks' reputation. The study used deductive rationale and quantified the employees' data to unravel their go-green perceptions and bank green activities. In this regard, the 390 response data, collected through a survey from the employees of Islamic banks, were analyzed through Smart-PLS, using structural equation modeling technique. The study finds that banks’ employees-related practices (ERPs), daily operations-related practices (DORPs), customers-related practices (CRPs), and banks’ policy-related practices (PRPs) have a significant positive influence on bank reputation. The authors also find that there is a significant moderating impact of environmental awareness between the relationships of ERPs, DORPs, CRPs, PRPs, and bank reputation. The study might increase understating and enlighten regulators and bank management to sustainably transform their operations to green banking practices, particularly adding to the environmental sustainability in Pakistan. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
"Examining the relationship between technological innovation, economic growth and carbon dioxide emission: dynamic panel data evidence","Raising economic growth is the primary concern of most of countries especially the developing and emerging economies in order to enhance the living standard of people. However, increase in economic activities increases energy demand which rise carbon dioxide emissions and leads to environmental degradation. Technological innovations might be the remedy to overcome the issue of increased carbon dioxide emission by reducing energy use, raise energy efficiency and also push economic growth activities efficiently. In this regard, this study explores the interrelationship of technological innovation, carbon dioxide emissions, and economic growth from 1985 to 2019 in 35 Belt and Road countries. The study uses ordinary least squares, two-step system generalized method of moments, two-step difference generalized method of moments, seemingly unrelated regression, and three-stage least square models for analysis. The results indicate that technological innovations increase economic growth and enhance environmental quality. Foreign direct investment also increases economic growth while degrading environmental quality. Economic growth increases technological innovation while exerting harmful effects on the quality of the environment. The impact of trade on economic growth is positive, while financial development reduces economic growth. School enrollment has a significant and positive effect and increases technological innovation, while foreign direct investment and research and development reduce it. The results also confirm that research and development expenditures significantly reduce carbon emissions and enhance environmental quality. The findings of this study have considerable policy implications for the sample countries with respect to economic growth, technological innovations, and environmental quality. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Review on design and development of cryogenic machining setups for heat resistant alloys and composites,"Cryogenic machining is becoming a sustainable choice due to its extraordinary performance (such as non-toxic and environmentally friendly) superiority to other traditional coolants and lubricants to produce products with superior quality. This paper also critically reviews improvements in designing the cryogenic delivery setup used by researchers for machining low machinability materials like titanium alloys, nickel alloys, ferrous alloys, composites, and other difficult-to-cut materials. It also briefs the economic and sustainable perspective of this state-of-art technology. The aim is to maximize the usage of sustainable cryogenic and hybrid machining technologies in the global manufacturing industry by highlighting their advantages. An overview of in-house developed cryogenic and hybrid machining techniques is presented. Various challenges and future needs related to cryogenic and hybrid-machining techniques are also discussed in the articles. Although remarkable results are obtained with the available literature's delivery methods, there is still no consensus regarding the best cryogenic delivery methods for machining the aforementioned materials. In addition, further hybridization of cryogenic delivery techniques with near dry machining techniques such as minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), electrostatic-MQL (EMQL), and nanofluid based MQL (nMQL) can be beneficial for machinability improvements of difficult-to-machine materials. © 2021 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Business orientation and sustainable development: A systematic review of sustainability orientation literature and future research avenues,"This study aims to systematically identify, review, and assess the progression of sustainability orientation literature and provide an agenda for future research.

Household-Level Strategies to Tackle Plastic Waste Pollution in a Transitional Country,"As one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, Vietnam is tackling environmental pollution, particularly plastic waste. This study contributes to the literature on environmental culture and practical solutions by better understanding households’ behaviours and motivations for (i) sorting waste, (ii) contributing to the environmental fund and (iii) relocating. The questionnaire-based interview method was used to randomly collect information from 730 households in 25 provinces in Vietnam during February 2022. Bayesian regression models, coupled with the mindsponge mechanism, were applied to analyse the data. The results showed that people’s strategies and responses to plastic waste pollution vary: 38.63% of respondents were sorting waste at home, 74.25% of households agreed to contribute to the environmental fund, and 23.56% had a plan to relocate for a better living place. The households’ strategies and intentions were driven by several structural and contextual factors such as age of household head, income, care about the environment, and the perceived effects of polluted waste. More importantly, communication was a robust variable in sorting waste decisions, which suggested that better communication would help increase people’s awareness and real actions in reducing plastic waste and ultimately improving the environment. These findings will benefit the ongoing green economy, circular economy, and green growth transition toward more sustainable development, particularly in developing and fast-population-growing countries. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Preoperative Lung Function Is Associated With Patient-Reported Outcomes After Lung Cancer Surgery,"Background: Patient quality of life (QOL) is a critical outcomes measure in lung cancer surgery. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide valuable insight into the patient experience and allow measurement of preoperative and postoperative QOL. Our objective was to determine which clinical factors predict differences in QOL, as measured by patient-reported physical function and pain intensity among patients undergoing minimally invasive lung cancer surgery. Methods: PRO surveys assessing physical function and pain intensity were conducted using instruments from the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. PRO surveys were administered to patients undergoing minimally invasive lung cancer resections at preoperative, 1-month, and 6-month postoperative time points, in an academic institution. Linear mixed-effects regression models were constructed to assess the association between clinical variables on PRO scores over time. Results: A total of 123 patients underwent a thoracoscopic lung resection for cancer. Mean age of the cohort was 67 ± 9.6 years, 43% were male, and 80% were White. When comparing clinical variables with PRO scores after surgery, lower diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was associated with significantly worse physical function (P < .01) and greater pain intensity scores (P < .01) at 6 months, with no differences identified at 1 month. No other studied clinical factor was associated with significant differences in PRO scores. Conclusions: Low preoperative DLCO was associated with significant decreases in PRO after minimally invasive lung cancer surgery. DLCO may be of utility in identifying patients who experience greater decline in QOL after surgery and for guiding surgical decision making. © 2021 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",Not About Sufficiency
"The temporal sequence between gentrification and cycling infrastructure expansions in Montreal, Canada","Increases in cycling infrastructure might be linked to gentrification. However, there is little empirical evidence investigating the existence and directionality of this possible relationship. This study examined the temporal sequence involved in the relation between gentrification and increases in the cycling infrastructure in Montreal, Canada. We analyzed changes in cycling infrastructure between 2006, 2011, and 2016, considering cyclist-only paths, multi-use paths, and on-street bike lanes. The Ding measure was used to identify gentrified census tracts (CTs) using census data. We implemented logistic regression models with and without geographically weighted regression specification at the CT level to test three scenarios; whether an increase in cycling infrastructure (2006–2011) was associated with subsequent gentrification (2011–2016); whether gentrification (2006–2011) was associated with subsequent increase in cycling infrastructure (2011–2016); or if these phenomena happened simultaneously (2011–2016). Increase in cycling infrastructure was not linked to subsequent gentrification, nor did these two phenomena happen simultaneously. However, gentrified CTs had a 44% greater chance of a subsequent increase in cycling infrastructure, with varying strengths of associations across the study area. When planning increases in cycling infrastructure, it is crucial to take an equity-based approach that underlying sociodemographic dynamics of urban CTs. To achieve this, cities need to engage in broad upstream community engagement, ensuring the inclusion of a diverse range of voices in the decision-making process. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Wetlands and rice development in West Africa,"Inland valleys, which are seasonally to permanently flooded stream valleys, provide a range of ecosystem services (ESS). These landscapes play a strategic role in the regional efforts to attain food security and alleviate poverty. Besides agricultural production (mainly rice), inland valleys are also important suppliers of water, forest, forage, hunting and fishing resources to local communities and these ecosystems often harbour a high degree of plant and animal biodiversity, worthy of conservation. Only a fraction of the total inland valley area in West Africa should suffice to provide enough rice to feed the entire region and the remaining part could then be managed with other ESS as a priority, thereby addressing the needs for biodiversity conservation, protection against downstream flooding, natural buffers for excess water or for other livelihoods like pastoralism. This chapter describes approaches to achieve this, based on 40 years of experience of AfricaRice and partners, in particular through the work carried out under the umbrella of the Inland Valley Consortium (IVC) (currently Inland Valley Community of Practice). It is essential to use a systematic analysis approach for the selection of ‘bestbet’ inland valleys for rice production and to implement conservation regulations, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, for the protection of those valleys that are either too vulnerable or too valuable for agricultural development. Selection criteria for such ‘best-bet’ production valleys should include economic, social and biophysical characteristics and the selection of valleys should be broadly supported by the local communities depending on them. The same approach could be used to identify locations within the valley that could be used for crop production and those that should continue to fulfil other ecosystem functions, so that a specific valley has a multifunctional pattern of land use which will help ensure sustainability. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
"Waste segregation and potential for recycling -A case study in Dar es Salaam City, Tanzania","Waste segregation is an important component in the waste management chain as it makes it possible to realize effective Reuse, Recycling and Recovery (RRR). Unfortunately, it has received little attention and is normally informally practiced in most developing countries (DC). It is also affected by lack of awareness, weak regulatory frameworks and enforcement, lack of economic incentive and a low priority in planning. This study was conducted in Kimara ward in Dar es Salaam city in Tanzania. It employed interviews, household surveys and waste measurements, to establish the potential for RRR as well as the underlying factors that are related to the community perspectives and strategies for enhancement of RRR. Results show that the generation rate was 0.53 kg/Cap.day and the main type was food waste (>60% of the composition by weight). The study revealed further that reuse and recycling of plastics, electronics and metals are informally practiced and the selling chain is from household to waste collectors to recycling centers and finally to industries. The potential for RRR was found to be high but, it is affected by lack of facilities, inadequate enforcement of the policy as well as lack of awareness and strategies for its promotion. Community perceptions on what could be done to improve segregation include the provision of facilities for waste segregation and financial returns to the community from recycling business could promote RRR. Formulation of strategies to formalize and mainstream RRR into training programmes and adequate enforcement mechanisms are some of the recommended policy actions. © 2021 The Author(s).

Addressing the challenge of wood mobilisation through a systemic innovation lens: The Irish forest sector innovation system,"In the face of growing demand for sustainable sources of biomass, the challenge of mobilising non-industrial private forest landowners (NIPF) with varying management objectives, to actively manage their forests and increase the supply of wood biomass, is an area of growing research and policy focus. While innovation and knowledge exchange is increasingly viewed as a means of promoting sustainable wood mobilisation, structural weaknesses in the sector such as deficiencies in the institutional and infrastructural setting or capacity of stakeholders, can negatively influence innovation processes. Addressing these overarching challenges requires a systemic analysis of the barriers to innovation across the forest sector as a whole. This case study of the Irish forest sector develops a comprehensive innovation systems framework, integrating structural and functional streams of innovation systems research. This `coupled structural–functional’ framework is applied to identify a number of interconnected systemic problems that hinder the functioning of the forest sector innovation system and negatively influence the potential for co-innovation and wood mobilisation in the sector. Three sets of key systemic wood mobilisation problems are identified, among which there is negative feedback. These so called `blocking mechanisms' have developed over time as a result of historical patterns of practice, prevailing culture, attitude and regulation and are defined here as (i) weak networks blocking capacity development of new forest owners, (ii) infrastructural problems blocking the reach and effectiveness of knowledge networks, (iii) rigid institutional structures and policy blocking co-innovation. To address these deficiencies in the current forest policy and institutional environment, this study makes a number of policy recommendations to promote co-innovation and tackle the multi-dimensional challenge of wood mobilisation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Ecological valuation in a transportation project: value transfer and spatial decision support systems,"The main purpose is to identify the possibility of calculating ecological impact as an opportunity cost to estimate total costs of each alternative and to test the feasibility of the high-speed rail routes designed with different variables. If ecological impact can be accounted for as economic costs are, would it be safe to say a route with the shortest physical (Euclidian) distance is the most economically viable option? If the difference in construction and operation costs, the two most commonly used cost elements in conventional feasibility studies, is compensated by ecological benefits, is it reasonable choose a route that is environmentally beneficial, albeit slightly more circuitous than the shortest route? These are the main questions of this study, and the author answers using the spatial decision support system and ecosystem valuation approaches. The results imply that the saved ecological benefits may compensate for the induced losses in the long run, and thus, choosing a route with more ecological benefits could become a viable solution. © 2014, Islamic Azad University (IAU).",Not About Sufficiency
"Voluntary Carbon Disclosure (VCD) Strategy under the Korean ETS: With the Interaction among Carbon Performance, Foreign Sales Ratio and Media Visibility","While there has been a sufficient amount of research and empirical evidence on the factors that influence a company’s decisions to voluntarily disclose carbon information, little research has been done on the carbon disclosure practices of ETS-affected companies, in Asian countries, in particular. Considering this, it is essential to shed light on more diverse linkages between carbon performance and voluntary carbon disclosure (VCD) under ETSs taking into account the specific context of each individual country. Drawing on the Korean ETS-affected companies with a contents analysis of their sustainable reports from 2015 to 2019, the present research seeks to address the existing knowledge gaps in the current literature on carbon disclosure. In doing so, hierarchical ordinary least square (OLS) regression analysis is used to infer causality and assess the findings. The findings empirically prove a positive relationship between carbon performance and VCD, which means that the affected companies under the Korean ETS are likely to disclose more when they have favorable carbon reduction performance. Furthermore, this link tends to be amplified for companies with a high percentage of foreign sales, while the role of media visibility interacts differently with carbon performance in influencing VCD. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Contentious baselining: The politics of “pre-drilling” environmental measures in shale gas territory,"Ignorance about baseline conditions can be advantageous to companies that are suspected of causing environmental harm, because it allows them to claim that perhaps the degradation was a pre-existing problem. In the case of Marcellus Shale natural gas extraction in Pennsylvania (USA), gas well operators have created strategic ignorance about and through baselines in at least two ways: (1) drawing attention to weaknesses in the documentation of past environmental states and (2) controlling access to data that was collected in the past. This case further reveals that ordinary individuals and environmental organizations have taken an active interest in producing environmental baselines, separate from any formal regulatory process that might call for them. However, public participation in baselining does not occur on a level playing field, and it is a weak strategy for holding polluters accountable. © The Author(s) 2019.",Not About Sufficiency
Nurturing systems thinking among young people by developing business ideas on sustainable AI,"The complexity of sustainability challenges has exposed the limitations of solutions relying on atomistic disciplinary knowledge and linear thinking, evidencing the need for embracing holistic and transdisciplinary mindsets.

Poaching in Andaman and Nicobar coasts: insights,"Tropical marine Islands are home to rich and highly endemic biodiversity because of their geographical seclusion. The geographical isolation supports the biodiversity against anthropogenic activities despite being vulnerable to natural disasters. Marine Islands hosts invaluable marine resources such as coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves and its associated fisheries which play an important role in livelihood of the coastal communities through tourism and fishing. It is important to judiciously protect and manage these islands to conserve the rich terrestrial and marine biodiversity it hosts. Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI), India is a strategically located linear chain of 572 tropical Islands located in Bay of Bengal in close proximity to South East Asian (SEA) countries such as Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. This proximity attracts poachers from SEA countries for harvesting living marine resources in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of ANI posing significant threat to marine biodiversity and coastal security. Prudent approaches are required to address the issue of poaching by involving various stakeholders and a science-policy interface at regional level. Implementation of efficient and reliable monitoring-reporting systems could be worthy to address the issue of poaching. Mobile apps help lines, fishermen groups, aerial vehicles, Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) system and other satellite based tools can effectively deter poaching and illegal fishing. The importance of community participation and the ways through which the modern tools and community participation could compliment in curbing the incidences of poaching were discussed. Necessary precautionary approaches are essential at this point in ANI as it was understood through the review that poachers have gone down in recent years and this period could be effectively utilized towards planning and efficient management of such incidences in future. The status of poaching and its associated activities over these years and the possibilities on implementation of suitable monitoring and reporting systems in collaboration with stakeholders were discussed. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Economics of land degradation and improvement in Tanzania and Malawi,"Land degradation is a serious impediment to improving rural livelihoods in Tanzania and Malawi. This paper identifies major land degradation patterns and causes, and analyzes the determinants of soil erosion and sustainable land management (SLM) in these two countries. The results show that land degradation hotspots cover about 51 and 41 % of the terrestrial areas in Tanzania and Malawi, respectively. The analysis of nationally representative household surveys shows that the key drivers of SLM in these countries are biophysical, demographic, regional and socio-economic determinants. Secure land tenure, access to markets and extension services are major factors incentivizing SLM adoption. The implications of this study are that policies and strategies that facilitate secure land tenure and access to SLM information are likely to stimulate investments in SLM. Local institutions providing credit services, inputs such as seed and fertilizers, and extension services must be included in the development policies. Following a Total Economic Value approach, we find that the annual cost of land degradation due to land use and land cover change during the 2001–2009 period is about $244 million in Malawi and $2.3 billion in Tanzania (expressed in constant 2007 USD). These represent about 6.8 and 13.7 % of GDP in Malawi and Tanzania, respectively. Use of land degrading practices in croplands (maize, rice and wheat) resulted in losses amounting to $5.7 million in Malawi and $1.8 million in Tanzania. Consequently, we conclude that the costs of action against land degradation are lower than the costs of inaction by about 4.3 times in Malawi and 3.8 times in Tanzania over the 30 year horizon. This implies that a dollar spent to restore/rehabilitate degraded lands returns about 4.3 dollars in Malawi and 3.8 dollars in Tanzania, respectively. Some of the actions taken by communities to address the loss of ecosystem services or enhance or maintain ecosystem services improvement include afforestation programs, enacting of bylaws to protect existing forests, area closures and controlled grazing, community sanctions for overgrazing, and integrated soil fertility management in croplands. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the factors affecting the Clean Development Mechanism in the developing countries,"The primary goal of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce the costs of greenhouse gas emission abatement for Annex I countries (developed countries). Furthermore, the mechanism aims at sustainable development in the developing economies. However, there has been an uneven distribution of CDM projects among the developing countries, and a major share has gone to only a few developing economies such as India, China, Brazil and Mexico. In this paper, we explore the factors that have affected the number and scope of CDM activities in the developing countries. We use the Poisson and censored regressions as our estimation methods. Our results suggest that the quality of institutions and the size of the potential host country have been particularly important determinants of the number of CDM projects hosted so far in the developing countries. The main policy implications include the importance of increasing the pace for fulfilling the institutional requirements of the CDM, improving the government structure to become free from corruption and engaging more in capacity building in order to attract more CDM projects. But improvements also in the infrastructure, most specifically in electricity capacity, are crucial in order to make the CDM activities viable in the developing countries. © 2013 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
Borders and Catastrophe: lessons from COVID-19 for the European Green Deal,"This article considers how the European Union and Member States’ responses to the COVID-19 crisis in the first half of 2020 could inform climate action in Europe, and particularly the resumption of actions on the EGD. It first outlines the EU’s public health and economic responses to COVID-19 and Europe’s role in the global response to the pandemic. We find that, based on the challenges and successes of all these responses, a strong argument can be made for ‘more Europe’ – greater integration, and stronger EU-level institutions – to lead and govern the COVID-19 response. This has direct lessons for the governance and scope of future climate action. © 2020 Australian and New Zealand Journal of European Studies.",Not About Sufficiency
The Language of Managerialism: Organizational Communication or an Ideological Tool?,"This book explains how management became Managerialism and how the language of managerialism was developed.Providing a comprehensive discussion of the managerialism-language interface, the book argues that firstly, managerialism itself has developed its distinctive language; and secondly, the two concepts of managerialism and language mutually depend upon each other. Written from the critical media studies perspective of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory, the book reaches beyond simple business communication, illustrating how the language of managerialism is colonising the non-corporate lifeworld. The book concludes by offering fresh ideas on how to move beyond the language of managerialism. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of Life Cycle Risks of Deconstruction in Urban Regeneration Projects,"Deconstruction is the eco-friendly alternative to demolition. It can help reduce the waste stream from urban regeneration projects (URPs) to landfills. The literature, however, does not provide a sufficient theoretical basis in terms of life cycle and life cycle risks of deconstruction. This lacking presents a major roadblock to its implementation in URPs. Thus, this paper introduces the deconstruction life cycle and a risk management framework to guide construction practitioners. Initially, the deconstruction life cycle, comprising 9 phases and 55 risk factors, was identified through a literature review and a focus group discussion. Then, a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was conducted to assess the impact of each risk on deliverables of deconstruction. Results showed that risk management in deconstruction should be a cyclic process and cover the entire life cycle. Risks related to inaccurate estimations, quality, health and safety issues, insufficiency of building components to reuse and recycle, unavailability of deconstruction contractors, and lack of infrastructure were among the most significant risks of deconstruction. By revealing the life cycle and life cycle risks of deconstruction, this study highly contributes to theory as well as significant managerial implications. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Not About Sufficiency
An ecosystem approach to human health,"The health and well-being of humans are intricately linked to the natural environment, which provides both sustenance and hazards. Not all risks and threats to the health of the population arising from the degradation of the environment are the result of human activities.

Health solutions: Theoretical foundations of the shift from sectoral to integrated systems,"The current fragmented framework of health governance for humans, animals and environment, together with the conventional linear approach to solving current health problems, is failing to meet today’s complex health challenges and is proving unsustainable. Advances in healthcare depend increasingly on intensive interventions, technological developments and expensive pharmaceuticals. The disconnect grows between human health, animal health and environmental and ecosystems health. Human development gains have come with often unrecognised negative externalities affecting ecosystems, notably loss of resilience, mostly through biodiversity loss and land degradation. Reduced capacity of the ecosystem to serve humanity threatens to reverse the health gains of the last century. A paradigm shift is urgently required to de-sectoralise human, animal, plant and ecosystem health and to take a more integrated approach to health, One Health (OH). The sustainable development goals (SDGs) offer a framework and unique opportunity for this and we argue the need of an OH approach towards achieving them. Feasibility assessments and outcome evaluations are often constrained by sectoral politics within a national framework, historic possession of expertise, as well as tried and tested metrics. OH calls for a better understanding, acceptance and use of a broader and transdisciplinary set of evaluation approaches and associated metrics, which is a key objective of NEOH. We need to shift our current sectoralised, linear focus to a more visible balanced health investment with more global benefits to all species. This is encapsulated in the movements for OH, EcoHealth, Planetary Health and Ecological Public Health, which are essentially converging towards a paradigm shift for a more integrated approach to health. © Wageningen Academic Publishers The Netherlands, 2018.",Not About Sufficiency
Mobility perspective for a local city in Japan,"Japan is now heading toward a population decrease and a highly aging society. The nationwide automobile dependency established over the past 50. years has affected the country's road building policy and the formation of urban structure based on automobile usage. Now, Japan is facing serious mobility problems, especially among the elderly. This tendency is more prominent in local cities throughout the country. The solutions to improve mobility are found in three areas: the promotion of public transportation, bicycles, and compact cities.Utsunomiya City, a regional capital heavily dependent on automobile transportation, suffers from severe traffic congestion, a high traffic accident rate, high carbon dioxide emissions, and urban sprawl. In order to achieve the long-term objectives of becoming a sustainable city, it launched an ambitious mobility strategy. Utsunomiya City has been one of the front-runners in introducing a new light rail transit (LRT) system. The prospect of building the first modern LRT system in Japan is very promising at present. This paper attempts to look back at the history of LRT planning efforts and analyze the circumstances and background of various stakeholders and the perceptions of citizens. It also attempts to sort out the various issues and challenges that the city needs to solve in order to achieve the objective of becoming the first city to build a new LRT in Japan.Another solution to excessive automobile dependency is bicycles, which are a convenient and inexpensive transportation mode all over the world. In Japan, however, automobile-oriented transportation and urban policies have prevailed, leaving the bicycle long neglected. Still, recent years have seen the bicycle gain recognition as a healthy, environmentally friendly alternative to the automobile, especially after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. Utsunomiya City has been actively pursuing a mobility policy of bicycle utilization since 2003 and is regarded as one of the leaders in its promotion. The potential success in Utsunomiya to overcome automobile dependency will make it a model for many local cities in Japan that suffer from similar problems. © 2014 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences.",Not About Sufficiency
"Plankton Assemblages and Water Quality in Kirulapone, Wellawatte, and Dehiwala Canals, Colombo, Sri Lanka","Plankton are significant bioindicators that can be employed in water quality assessments. However, there is a notable scarcity of plankton-based water quality studies in the Colombo South canal system. The present study was carried out to assess water quality in three selected canals belonging to the Colombo South canal system with special reference to the plankton community. Plankton and water samples were collected from November 2022 to February 2023 from twelve locations along the three canals of the Colombo South canal system. During the study, nine physiochemical parameters were measured and the biotic indices were calculated. Pollution status and the suitability of the canals for aquatic life were assessed using the water pollution index (WPI) and the weighted arithmetic water quality index (WAWQI), respectively. Overall, forty-six phytoplankton species and seventeen zooplankton species were recorded during the study. Chlorophyceae (48%) and Rotifera (59%) were the dominant plankton groups. More than 50% of the total recorded plankton species were pollution indicators. According to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), plankton abundance showed a weak positive correlation with nitrate, phosphate, TDS, BOD5, salinity, electrical conductivity, and temperature while negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen. The Shannon-Weiner diversity index and WPI revealed a moderate pollution level in the canals. WAWQI indicated that the canals were unsuitable for aquatic life. Moreover, moderate and high pollution-tolerant organisms were more dominant in the canals. Hence, the proper measures must be taken to restore the canal ecosystem. This study could significantly guide future research and highlight the importance of plankton in water quality assessments. © 2024 by King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Thailand.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable development: Is an impartial equilibrium between human needs and natural resources existent?,"Social-economic plans are originally illusive under growing repetition/activity/duration of unexpected atypical weather phenomena recently occurred. The paper discusses conceptually this aspect of the sustainable development taking into account the limits of good-for-human-activities reproduction of a local seasonal weather pattern depending on directions of the dynamics evolution in the corresponding climate system. The discussion is developed from the fundamentals of the theory of nonlinear dynamics. This view clarifies indicators to existence/absence of sustainable development grounded on the insuperable physical laws. The corresponding novel method of identification of these indicators (denoted by the method of transients) is formulated and potentiality of its realization is investigated by processing the meteorological data of temperature observation. It is illustrated that a way to consider soundly non-stationary nonlinear dynamics opens once the perverted partition onto ""weather"" and ""climate"" is eliminated and nonlinear, regulatory and inertial properties of dynamical processes in local climate systems become analyzed integrally. Finally the conclusions are summarized. © 2023 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",Not About Sufficiency
"Exploring Integrated Ocean Management Policy in China: Evolution, Challenges, and Prospects","Integrated ocean management (IOM) aligns with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and serves as a crucial strategy for promoting the enduring health of marine ecosystems and the sustainable utilization of marine resources. An analysis of the evolution of China’s integrated ocean management policy (IOMP) is crucial for providing valuable guidance in achieving sustainable growth in marine management and the marine economy for both China and other coastal nations worldwide. This paper studies the evolution characteristics, challenges, and prospects of IOMP in China since 1978 using content analysis. The findings indicate that the evolution of IOMP can be categorized into four stages: the germination period (1978–1998), the construction period (1999–2009), the systematization period (2010–2017), and the strategization period (2018–present), based on the state of international marine management. The IOMP has transitioned over time from its initial emphasis on resource development during the germination period to a strategization period that prioritizes the full development of all parts of the system. However, the ultimate goal has consistently been to achieve harmonious coexistence between people and the sea. China’s IOMP has experienced a progressive development; nevertheless, it continues to encounter obstacles such as the pressing requirement to revise sea-related policies and the absence of policy alignment. The objective of this paper is to explore the evolution, challenges, and prospects of China’s IOMP to better improve the land–sea coordination policy, strengthen international judicial cooperation. and provide effective policy reference for other maritime countries. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Why partner? Harnessing value from collaborative sustainable business models to restore coral reefs at scale,"Tropical coral reefs provide a wide range of ecosystem services that benefit millions worldwide. However, the current scale of coral reef restoration is a long way from matching the extent needed to protect coral reefs globally, and this implementation gap presents a complex challenge to overcome. Cross-sectoral collaborative sustainable business models (CSBMs) present an interesting opportunity to scale up coral restoration, though this area is yet to be explored in the literature. In this paper, we use the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program in the Great Barrier Reef as a case study to examine potential collaborators, their roles, and what benefits motivate them to partner for scaling coral restoration. We identified a diverse range of potential collaborators from 10 sectors offering different combinations of physical, human and organisational capitals. Participants described nine roles they could play in such a partnership, and many of these roles relate to ecosystem growth scaling strategies. Benefits that motivate collaboration fall into seven categories: environmental benefit, business opportunity and value, employment opportunity, knowledge and technology, innovation, hope, and reputation. Our findings contribute to designing CSBMs for coral restoration by enriching our understanding of collaborators, value creation and their potential roles in alternative pathways to scale up coral restoration beyond reducing unit cost and increasing funding. © 2024 Kong et al.

Politically Contested Beliefs: Support for Trump Better Predicts Having Inaccurate Beliefs About COVID-19 Than Conservative/Republican Political Identity,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented risk to society. Studies suggested that people’s beliefs about COVID-19 are divided depending on partisan affiliations. Building on the belief gap hypothesis, this study adopts a nationally representative survey (N = 1,119) to examine whether political identity or support for Trump is more strongly related to having false beliefs about COVID-19. Results showed that support for Trump is a better predictor of having false beliefs about COVID-19 than conservative/Republican political identity. Support for Trump predicted having false beliefs, and such a tendency increased when they were more educated. Trust in scientific and news media institutions and conservative news use mediated the relationship between support for Trump and having false beliefs. Our findings bear implications on belief gap studies by introducing new mediators such as different dimensions of institutional trust and shed light on why people who support Trump are more susceptible to false claims about COVID-19. © 2022 Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.",Not About Sufficiency

LAND USE LAND COVER CHANGE MAPPING FROM SENTINEL 1B & 2A IMAGERY USING RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE,"Monitoring crop condition, soil properties, and mapping tillage activities can be used to assess land use, forecast crops, monitor seasonal changes, and contribute to the implementation of sustainable development policy. Agricultural maps can provide independent and objective estimates of the extent of crops in a given area or growing season, which can be used to support efforts to ensure food security in vulnerable areas. Satellite data can help detect and classify different types of soil. The evolution of satellite remote sensing technologies has transformed techniques for monitoring the Earth’s surface over the last several decades. The European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU) created the Copernicus program, which resulted in the European satellites Sentinel-1B (S1B) and Sentinel-2A (S2A), which allow the collection of multi-temporal, spatial, and highly repeatable data, providing an excellent opportunity for the study of land use, land cover, and change. The goal of this study is to map the land cover of Côte d’Ivoire’s West Central Soubre area (5°47′1′′ North, 6°35′38′′ West) between 2014 and 2020. The method is based on a combination of S1B and S2A imagery data, as well as three types of predictors: the biophysical indices Normalized Difference Vegetation Index “(NDVI)”, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index “(MNDWI)”, Normalized Difference Urbanization Index “(NDBI)”, and Normalized Difference Water Index “(NDWI)”, as well as spectral bands (B1, B11, B2, B3, B4, B6, B7, B8) and polarization coefficients VV. For the period 2014–2020, six land classifications have been established: Thick_Forest, Clear_Drill, Urban, Water, Palm_Oil, Bareland, and Cacao_Land. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm with 60 numberOfTrees was the primary categorization approach used in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results show that the RF classification performed well, with outOfBagErrorEstimates of 0.0314 and 0.0498 for 2014 and 2020, respectively. The classification accuracy values for the kappa coefficients were above 95%: 96.42% in 2014 and 95.28% in 2020, with an overall accuracy of 96.97% in 2014 and 96 % in 2020. Furthermore, the User Accuracy (UA) and Producer Accuracy (PA) values for the classes were frequently above 80%, with the exception of the Bareland class in 2020, which achieved 79.20%. The backscatter coefficients of the S1B polarization variables had higher GINI significance in 2014: VH (70.80) compared to VH (50.37) in 2020; and VV (57.11) in 2014 compared to VV (46.17) in 2020. Polarization coefficients had higher values than the other spectral and biophysical variables of the three predictor variables. During the study period, the Thick_Forest (35.90% ± 1.17), Palm_Oil (57.59% ± 1.48), and Water (5.90% ± 0.47) classes experienced a regression in area, while the Clear_Drill (16.96% ± 0.80), Urban (2.32% ± 0.29), Bareland (83.54% ± 1.79), and Cacao_Land (35.14% ± 1.16) classes experienced an increase.

"A general method for multi–hazard intensity assessment for cultural resources: Implementation in the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece","The protection of cultural resources from natural and human–induced hazards has been an area of intense scientific interest over time. The literature highlights that, despite the intensive research efforts to date, there is a lack of a commonly accepted hazard assessment framework that supports decision–making to limit their negative effects and contribute to the protection of cultural heritage. In this paper a general method for assessing the intensity of multiple hazards on cultural resources is developed and applied. The proposed method utilizes a) the capabilities of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), b) open geospatial hazard data and c) an original 7–step integrated method developed in this research. Key features of the proposed method are its ability to consider and synthesize intensities of both quantitative hazards such as earthquake, flood and hazards expressed on a qualitative scale, such as wildfire and landslide. The proposed method is applied to assess the exposure of 918 cultural resources of the Region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece, to earthquake, flood, landslide, sea level rise, wildfire, soil erosion and industrial–technological accident and develop an aggregate multi–hazard intensity index (mhii) for each of the cultural resources in this region. The proposed method can be applied to hazard intensity assessment for resources other than cultural, such as the human capital of a region, infrastructure, environment, and economic facilities. This provides researchers, scientists, and managers of cultural sites with a tool to set priorities for the design of appropriate mitigation strategies to reduce the negative impacts of hazards. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Business climate risk management: international perspectives and strategic determinants,"In recent years, climate change, environmental, social and governance factors, and their multidimensional impacts have become dominant topics of discussion. This study investigates the determinants of corporate climate risk management based on the theories of legitimacy, agency, and stakeholder. We utilize a diversified sample of multinational companies from Brazil, France, and the USA listed on stock exchanges, focusing on exposure, disclosure, and the implementation of climate projects. We conducted rigorous statistical analyses, including both classical and advanced robust models. Our methodology involved the use of robust covariance matrix estimation, robust Newey‒West estimation, and robust estimation by Driscoll and Kraay. Preliminary results reveal that a significant proportion of companies in these countries have not disclosed climate risks with business impacts, raising questions about awareness and recognition of these risks. Our analysis also highlights the predominant concern about regulatory risks, suggesting the need for companies to navigate a complex regulatory landscape. Furthermore, we identified the influence of factors such as size, industry profile, climate regulation, creditor power, auditor power, and profitability on climate risk management. Evidence suggests that companies of all sizes and backgrounds should recognize the importance of climate risk management and engage all stakeholders, including creditors and auditors, who play a crucial role in perceiving climate risk exposure. This involves the proactive assessment of risks associated with climate change and the implementation of strategies to mitigate them. This study provides valuable insights for business decisions aligned with sustainability and the transition to a low-carbon economy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
The Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in International Climate Policy1,"Global climate change is one of the main challenges of our time. Rising temperatures threaten the stability of the ecological, socio-economic, and political systems around the globe. Countries in the Global South have the greatest material losses from climate change without having a significant impact on it. The high vulnerability of the group of least developed countries (LDCs) to climate change, coupled with social and economic challenges poverty, and lack of means for adaptation, determine its special rank and status in international climate policy. In it, the LDCs act as a single actor. Over the course of more than 30 years of climate policy, LDCs have initiated the adoption of a number of important documents and the creation of fundamental structures for international climate policy. At the same time, noticeable transformations have taken place to adapt and decarbonize the national structures of LDCs. The purpose of this article is to show the role of the LDC group in the formation of the United Nations (UN) climate agenda, institutional structures, and international mechanisms, to highlight their efforts to restore global climate justice, and to characterize modern national climate policy according to the legal documents adopted by the LDCs. The methodological basis is formed by historical, comparative approaches. The main objective of the article is to study the trajectories of the climate policy of the LDC group, highlight the stages of its evolution, demonstrate centre-peripheral relations to restore climate justice, and examine the internal policies of the LDCs. Policy initiatives of the LDCs played a direct role in the formation of climate finance funds, the group of experts on the least developed countries (LEG), and national programmes and plans for the adaptation of states to climate change. The article concludes that there are two stages in the development of climate policy in LDCs; it is assumed that the use of international mechanisms for adaptation and decarbonization could become a tool for the economic and technological modernization of LDCs and their achievement of the sustainable development goals of 2030. The main obstacles to this are the insufficient financing of available funds from countries of the Global North, high interest rates on loans, and the indebtedness of LDCs.",Not About Sufficiency

AMOC-forced southward migration of the ITCZ under a warm climate background,"Northern northeastern Brazil (NEB) is a climate change hotspot due to its high biological and social vulnerability to ongoing and future hydroclimate changes. Precipitation in this region is influenced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which is largely controlled by the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Accordingly, the projected weakening of the AMOC due to anthropogenic global warming may substantially change NEB hydroclimate. Heinrich Stadials (HS), past millennial-scale events during which the AMOC was significantly weaker, provide important insights into the AMOC-ITCZ dynamics. This is especially true for those HS that occurred under similar to modern boundary conditions. HS10 (ca. 110 thousand years ago) was the first HS of Marine Isotope Stage 5, providing an ideal target for investigating AMOC-ITCZ dynamics under relatively warm climate conditions. Here we investigate the response of the surface and deep western equatorial Atlantic (WEA) circulation, as well as NEB precipitation to HS10. Therefore, we use foraminiferal carbon and oxygen stable isotopes and bulk sediment major elemental data from a marine sediment core retrieved from the WEA. Our results record a weakening of the AMOC during HS10 and show a concurrent increased WEA upper stratification and precipitation over NEB. We suggest that the mechanism controlling the WEA upper ocean stratification during HS depends on the background climate. Furthermore, we infer that the southward shift of the ITCZ during HS10 was more limited if compared to the shifts that occurred under colder climate background. Our findings provide useful insights into how a weakening of the AMOC under a relatively warm climate can impact the ITCZ and tropical South American precipitation. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
A Comparison of the Macroeconomic Effects of Increased Defence Spending in Poland and Germany,"The aim of the article is to quantify and compare the macroeconomic effects of defence spending in the Polish and German economies. Estimating these effects is of particular importance in the context of the substantial increase in defence expenditures in Poland and Germany resulting from the war in Ukraine. The research is based on a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that takes into account both demand-side and supply-side mechanisms. The impulse response functions calculated based on the models estimated for the two economies show that the impact of defence spending on GDP is much stronger in Poland than in Germany. Furthermore, the empirical results indicate that in the Polish economy, defence spending also stimulates labour and consumption to a greater extent than in the German economy. © 2023 Sciendo.

Sustainable higher education teaching approaches,"The goals of public higher education are to generate knowledge and transfer knowledge and skills to students to prepare them for making the world a better place. Given current severe threats to human well-being from climate change impacts, biodiversity loss, and global trends of inequality, we will need a strong commitment to sustainability education to achieve that ""better place."" This chapter focuses on several key concepts and teaching approaches that can engage students in sustainability challenges and give them some of the necessary knowledge and tools to become thoughtful leaders and followers, problem-solvers, and active citizens. It discusses how key concepts such as intrinsic and extrinsic values help students understand the role of values in human decision-making about addressing bigger-than-self sustainability challenges (e.g., global poverty). The concepts of overconsumption, social commodity chain, metabolic rift, the commons, polycentricity, and resilience allow instructors to traverse disciplines and help students recognize the complex, interdependent nature of social-environmental problems and solutions. The chapter also describes teaching approaches that help students understand how people, problems, and ecological conditions are interconnected and encourage them to move from individual to collective approaches to sustainability. These approaches include place-based experiential learning, project- or problem-based learning, case study conflict studies, collaborative learning, social learning, and community service learning. To effectively engage higher education students in sustainability, educators must provide interdisciplinary and experiential learning experiences and put students in positions where they imagine themselves using innovation, experimentation, trial-and-error social learning, and adaptive management to become future problem-solvers and change agents. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

Eutrophication governs predator-prey interactions and temperature effects in Aedes aegypti populations,"Background: Mosquito population dynamics are driven by large-scale (e.g. climatological) and small-scale (e.g. ecological) factors. While these factors are known to independently influence mosquito populations, it remains uncertain how drivers that simultaneously operate under natural conditions interact to influence mosquito populations. We, therefore, developed a well-controlled outdoor experiment to assess the interactive effects of two ecological drivers, predation and nutrient availability, on mosquito life history traits under multiple temperature regimes. Methods: We conducted a temperature-controlled mesocosm experiment in Kruger National Park, South Africa, with the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. We investigated how larval survival, emergence and development rates were impacted by the presence of a locally-common invertebrate predator (backswimmers Anisops varia Fieber (Notonectidae: Hemiptera), nutrient availability (oligotrophic vs eutrophic, reflecting field conditions), water temperature, and interactions between each driver. Results: We observed that the effects of predation and temperature both depended on eutrophication. Predation caused lower adult emergence in oligotrophic conditions but higher emergence under eutrophic conditions. Higher temperatures caused faster larval development rates in eutrophic but not oligotrophic conditions. Conclusions: Our study shows that ecological bottom-up and top-down drivers strongly and interactively govern mosquito life history traits for Ae. aegypti populations. Specifically, we show that eutrophication can inversely affect predator-prey interactions and mediate the effect of temperature on mosquito survival and development rates. Hence, our results suggest that nutrient pollution can overrule biological constraints on natural mosquito populations and highlights the importance of studying multiple factors. © 2019 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
``It is the theory which decides what can be observed'': Managing the complexity of social problems at the organisational and individual level,"he worldwide increase in societal challenges, such as climate change, political instability, and economic volatility, puts pressure on institutions, organisations, and individuals to develop means to address social problems. Unfortunately, many organisations fail to adequately formulate social problems and even solve the wrong ones, which is due to their inherent complexity. Consequently, this dissertation adopts a 'complexity lens' to interpret the intertwined forces driving social problems within organisational and environmental contexts. Problem complexity requires different governance modes, as solutions cannot be developed in the typical linear and hierarchical process that commercial products follow. To this end, this dissertation entails two studies that explore how the complexity of social problems can be managed at the organisational and individual level. In particular, study 1 employs Procedural Action Research and mixed methods together with a humanitarian organisation to qualitatively develop and quantitatively validate a theory-guided bottom-up search process for surfacing solutions to reoccurring floods in Indonesia. In a similar vein, study 2 investigates and compares the individual innovation processes of 20 social entrepreneurs from Ethiopia and Germany. © Logos Verlag Berlin GmbH 2022.

Long-term lifetime trends of large appliances since the introduction in Norwegian households,"Longer lifetimes of consumer products are promoted as an element of sustainable consumption, yet there is a widespread notion that lifetimes are currently in decline, often attributed to planned obsolescence or throwaway mentality. However, empirical evidence is inconclusive and often subject to high uncertainties. Here, we explore long-term trends in the lifetimes of large household appliances using dynamic material flow analysis. We investigate the sales and ownership of these products since their introduction in Norwegian households and use this co-evolution to estimate the lifetimes. By combining two model types with uncertainty analysis, we show that a significant lifetime decrease was likely experienced only by washing machines (–45%) and ovens (–39%) around the 1990s–2000s. This finding challenges the narratives about planned obsolescence despite their prevalence decreasing consumer incentives for longer product use and repair. We suggest multiple technical, economic, and social factors that could be responsible for the decrease, for example, a reduction in relative prices of appliances or changes in habits surrounding laundry and kitchen use. Our results suggest that factors affecting product lifetimes are not uniform but context-dependent, which has implications for lifetime extension policy. The presented method could help monitor the long-term effectiveness of such a policy.

The future value of ecosystem services: Global scenarios and national implications,"We estimated the future value of ecosystem services in monetary units for 4 alternative global land use and management scenarios based on the Great Transition Initiative (GTI) scenarios to the year 2050. We used previous estimates of the per biome values of ecosystem services in 2011 as the basis for comparison. We mapped projected land-use for 16 biomes at 1 km2 resolution globally for each scenario. This, combined with differences in land management for each scenario, created estimates of global ecosystem services values that also allowed for examinations of individual countries. Results show that under different scenarios the global value of ecosystem services can decline by $51 trillion/yr or increase by USD $30 trillion/yr. In addition to the global values, we report totals for all countries and maps for a few example countries.

One such region is Eastern Europe, where political and socio-economic conditions changed drastically over the last three centuries, but forest trends have not yet been analyzed in detail. We present a new assessment of historical forest change in the European part of the former Soviet Union and the legacies of these changes on contemporary carbon stocks. To reconstruct forest area, we homogenized statistics at the provincial level for ad 1700-2010 to identify forest transition years and forest trends. We contrast our reconstruction with the KK11 and HYDE 3.1 land change scenarios, and use all three datasets to drive the LPJ dynamic global vegetation model to calculate carbon stock dynamics. Our results revealed that forest transitions in Eastern Europe occurred predominantly in the early 20th century, substantially later than in Western Europe. We also found marked geographic variation in forest transitions, with some areas characterized by relatively stable or continuously declining forest area. Our data suggest extensive deforestation in European Russia already prior to ad 1700, and even greater deforestation in the 18th and 19th centuries than in the KK11 and HYDE scenarios. Based on our reconstruction, cumulative carbon emissions from deforestation were greater before 1700 (60PgC) than thereafter (29PgC). Summed over our entire study area, forest transitions led to a modest uptake in carbon over recent decades, with our dataset showing the smallest effect (<5.5PgC) and a more heterogeneous pattern of source and sink regions. This suggests substantial sequestration potential in regrowing forests of the region, a trend that may be amplified through ongoing land abandonment, climate change, and CO2 fertilization. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Indoor air pollution and its impact on women in Delhi,"The present study aims at investigating the indoor air quality (IAQ) in selected households in the urban slums and an institutional campus in Delhi, the capital city of India. The study includes indoor air quality monitoring and assessments of associated respiratory health effects alongwith sick building syndrome (SBS) in the women living in inefficiently designed houses in urban slums. The comparative analysis of concentrations of indoor air pollutants in urban slums and the institutional campus reveals that the respiratory health of the women, primarily living indoors, in both the sites are affected by the indoor pollutants, for example the respirable suspended particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), the carbon monoxide (CO), the sulphur dioxide (SO2) and the nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In addition, the spirometry tests on the women, comprising of womenfolk and children have been performed to determine the incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARI). Interview surveys have also been conducted in the households during the study period to investigate the sick building syndrome (SBS). The results show maximum concentration of indoor air pollutants in households during winters associated with aggravated respiratory problems, like cough, phlegm, wheezing and breathlessness among women particularly in urban slums. Decrement in lung function indices (that is FVC and/or FEV1) due to increased concentrations of RSPM indoors during winter period has also been observed in the women. The study concludes that women and children staying indoors are most vulnerable to respiratory problems compared to men. Alongwith higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms, high SBS scores have been observed in these households because of inefficient ventilation, poorly designed houses and usage of biomass fuels for cooking. © 2012 - Kalpana Corporation.",Not About Sufficiency
Farm level rainwater harvesting across different agro climatic regions of India: Assessing performance and its determinants,"Rainwater harvesting and its utilization have a very important role to play in harnessing the production potential within dryland systems. This study assesses the performance of small rainwater harvesting structures (farm-ponds) in 5 major rainfed states of India over the period 2009-2011 using data from multiple sources and stakeholders. Rainwater which is harvested using structures of varying types and sizes was used for either supplemental irrigation or recharging open-wells. In many cases, the farm level rainwater harvesting structures were highly effective for rainfed farming and had a multiplier effect on farm income. In some situations however, it was viewed by farmers as a waste of productive land. The use of farm ponds in Maharashtra, for example, resulted in a significant increase in farm productivity (12-72%), cropping intensity and consequently farm income. In the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, farm pond water was profitably used for supplemental irrigation to mango plantations, vegetables or other crops and animal enterprises with net returns estimated to be between US$ 120 and 320 structure-1 annum-1. Despite such examples, the adoption of the farm ponds was low, except in Maharashtra. A functional analysis of the reasons for high adoption of water harvesting structures indicated that factors such as technical support, customized design, level of farmer participation, age, existing ownership of open wells, annual rainfall and household assets were the major determinants of performance of farm-level rainwater harvesting structures. Based on this countrywide analysis, different policy and institutional options are proposed for promoting farm-level rainwater-harvesting for dryland agriculture. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
From focal sepsis to periodontal medicine: a century of exploring the role of the oral microbiome in systemic disease,"The oral microbiome is established within a few minutes after birth and consists of stable multi-species communities that engage in a dynamic equilibrium with the host immune system. Dental caries, endodontic infections and periodontal diseases are bacterially driven diseases that are caused by dysbiotic microbiomes. Over a century ago, the focal infection theory implicated these infections in the aetiology of several systemic diseases, ranging from arthritis to neurodegenerative diseases. However, a lack of concrete evidence, combined with the urgency with which clinicians embraced this approach without regard for appropriate case selection, led to its demise within 30 years. In the last decade of the 20th century, the concept of periodontal medicine was introduced to explain the correlations that were being observed between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, pulmonary disease, pre-term delivery of low birth weight infants and metabolic disease. It was proposed that periodontal pathobionts played a causal role in the initiating or exacerbating certain diseases either by direct invasion or by stimulating a florid immune-inflammatory response that extended into the systemic circulation. This review will examine the strength of current evidence in establishing a causal link between oral pathobionts and systemic disease. (Figure presented.). © 2016 The Authors.

pH-sensitive semi-interpenetrating network of microcrystalline cellulose and methacrylic acid hydrogel for the oral delivery of insulin,"Insulin is commonly administered to diabetic patients subcutaneously and has shown poor patient compliance. Due to this, research has been carried out extensively to find molecules that could deliver insulin orally. In this context, a new type of pH-responsive hydrogel, composed of microcrystalline cellulose and methacrylic acid-based hydrogels, has been developed and studied for the oral delivery of insulin. These hydrogels were prepared by free radical polymerization using potassium persulphate as initiator and N, N’-methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker. These pH-sensitive hydrogels showed swelling in distilled water as high as 5800 %. The hydrogels were investigated for swelling in saline and glucose solutions, and pH sensitivity was confirmed by swelling in solutions of different pH. The morphological shape was established by SEM, and the structure was analyzed by FTIR. Thermal degradation was investigated by TGA. In vitro release studies have confirmed pH sensitivity, showing lower insulin release at pH 1.2 than at pH 6.8. The encapsulation efficiency was determined to be 56.00 ± 0.04 %. It was further validated by in-vivo investigations for which insulin was loaded into hydrogels and administered orally to healthy and diabetic Wistar rats at 40 IU/kg, showing maximum hypoglycemic effect at 6 h, which was sustained for 24 h. In the stomach's acidic environment, the gels remained unaffected due to the formation of intermolecular polymer complexes. Insulin remained in the gel and was protected from proteolytic degradation. Thus, pH-responsive methacrylic acid-based hydrogels are promising for biomedical applications, especially oral drug delivery. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Nutrients retention of a series of small dam-impacted urban rivers in northern China,"How a series of small rubber dams distributed within urban watersheds impact nutrients transport remains less investigated. To fill this research gap, this study assesses the composition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and their retention in five urban river segments across the Qingshui-Yanghe rivers, China from March 2019 to September 2021. The upstream and downstream of the Qingshui river (QR-up and QR-city) were enriched with dissolved N and particulate P, suggesting a greater P contribution of agricultural origin. NH4-N concentrations were lower upstream but increased downstream of the Yanghe river due to the direct discharge of sewage and other human activities. N and P concentrations varied along the urban river and were relatively low at QR-city. A total of 159.2 and 8.4 metric tons/yr, corresponding to 63% and 70% of the TN and TP loading, were trapped within QR-up and QR-city, of which the dissolved N and particulate P load retention accounted for 58% and 78%. N and P retention rates within the river segments sharply decreased from 97 to -320% and were mainly sequestered in the upstream river segments (QR-up- QR-city). The retention rate of nitrate (78%) and dissolved reactive P (67%) were higher than that of TPN (9.75%) and TPP (78%) because of biological assimilation. Further, with retention rates of -320%, the upstream river segments were a net source of dissolved organic P. These results confirm that the small dams have an important nutrient retention function that is highly variable on a spatiotemporal scale similarly to large-scale reservoirs. Due to the cumulative influence of sewage discharge downstream of the Yanghe River, the nutrient load retention is significantly higher than that in the Qingshui river segments. The variations in hydrological regimes due to seasonal events and small dam regulation have a substantial impact on nutrient retention, resulting in higher loads retention in the flood period than in other periods. Overall, the results suggest that management plans must not only focus on decreasing nutrient export from the mountainous area of the Qingshui river basin but also on sewage outfalls and enhancing the hydrodynamic status of the dammed rivers with respect to eutrophication. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Trauma nutrition andmal nutrition in the andean highlands during Peru's dark age (1000-1250 C.E.),"In this study, warfare is approached as the instrumental and situational use of violence—and the strategic manipulation of institutional disparities—to achieve ideological or material objectives and is enacted by politicized participants who see themselves linked by common membership. To complement existing studies of warfare, a growing body of scholarship now focuses on structural violence, the chronic and systematic ways in which social structures harm, deprive, or otherwise disadvantage individuals and groups.

"Analysis of Green Economic Growth, Biofuel Oil Consumption, Fuel Oil Consumption and Carbon Emission in Asia Pacific","This study expands research to analyze green economy, separated energy consumption and environment to achieve sustainable development in selected countries in Asia Pacific during the period 2006-2020 by using two-stage least square. The contribution of this study is to consider the use of green economic growth, which studies are still limited in terms of energy consumption indicators that have a substitution effect. This study found that green economic growth increased due to an increase in fuel oil consumption and technological innovation, as well as decreased fuel oil consumption, carbon emission and militarization. Furthermore, biofuel oil consumption increased due to an increased in green economic growth, fuel oil consumption, carbon emission, real oil prices, foreign direct investment and trade openness. In addition, fuel oil consumption increased due to an increase in biofuel oil consumption and population, as well as a decrease in green economic growth, carbon emission and trade openness. Finally, carbon emission increases due to an increase in fuel oil consumption and poverty. The government should implement a green economy program policy to reduce fuel oil consumption and carbon emissions, as well as increase biofuel oil consumption in Asia Pacific. © 2022 WITPress.

Barriers to reducing climate enhanced disaster risks in least developed country-small islands through anticipatory adaptation,"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) classified as Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are particularly vulnerable to the projected impacts of climate change. Given their particular vulnerabilities, climate adaptation investments are being made through both national and international efforts to build the capacity of various sectors and communities to reduce climate risks and associated disasters. Despite these efforts, reducing climate risks is not free of various challenges and barriers. This paper aims to synthesise a set of critical socio-economic barriers present at various spatial scales that are specific to Least Developed Country SIDS. It also aims to identify the processes that give rise to these barriers. Drawing on theories from natural hazards, a systematic literature review method was adopted to identify and organise the set of barriers by focussing on both academic papers and grey literature. The data revealed a notable lack of studies on adaptation within African and Caribbean LDC-SIDS. In general, there was a paucity of academic as well as grey literature being produced by authors from LDC-SIDS to challenge existing discourses related to adaptation barriers. The most common barriers identified included those related to governance, technical, cognitive and cultural. Three key findings can be drawn from this study in relation to formal adaptation initiatives. Firstly, the lack of focus on the adaptive capacity needs of Local Government or Island Councils and communities was a key barrier to ensure success of adaptation interventions. Secondly, international adaptation funding modalities did little to address root causes of vulnerability or support system transformations. These funds were geared at supporting sectoral level adaptation initiatives for vulnerable natural resource sectors such as water, biodiversity and coastal zones. Thirdly, there is a need to recognise the significance of cultural knowledge and practices in shaping adaptive choices of communities in SIDS. © 2014 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Limiting of Carbon Dioxide Emissions through Rational Management of Pro-Ecological Activities in the Context of CSR Assumptions,"This article highlights the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by reducing energy consumption. Of course, this can be achieved in various ways, but inter alia, through the practical implementation of the assumptions contained in the CSR programs of individual companies, which include a component on environmental protection and counteracting global warming. The authors also describe a proposal to reduce CO2 emissions by using coke oven gas (if necessary) in exchange for natural gas. Currently, the largest sources of carbon dioxide emissions are the combustion of fossil fuels in power plants, transport—cars and planes, processes related to the production of industrial goods, and deforestation. In the preparation of the article, the analysis of the literature on the subject, analysis of documents, desk research, and two case studies were used. The main goal of the article is to present the possibilities of reducing CO2 emissions by implementing the assumptions of the CSR policy on the example of a selected company (models of such activities are also given). Therefore, the aim of the article is to present selected activities that can contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in enterprises; of course, this is specific each time and should be individually selected for each enterprise depending on financial, environmental, and any other conditions. This means that almost all enterprises, organizations, and all other institutions should be obliged to implement an individual environmental policy related to the possibility of reducing carbon dioxide emissions worldwide, and the effects of implementing the assumptions of this policy should be regularly, at least once a year, presented in the CSR reports of a given organization. How-ever, each organization should provide its own examples of how it reduces carbon dioxide emissions. For this reason, this article presents an example of the Marcel CHP plant, which, due to its capabilities, also uses coke oven gas, the use of which results in lower emissions of carbon dioxide than natural gas. Additionally, the article presents a comparative analysis of the use of coke oven gas instead of natural gas. The obtained results show the significant and real possibilities of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptation of the shoreline of urban development to special environment conditions,"This article discusses the need for an in-depth approach to studying the adaptation of the coastline of urban development to special natural conditions. In particular, to periodic repeated flooding and floods in areas of contact with the terrain. As well as the types of technologies and materials that are used to form a protective buffer territory of coastal urban development. The importance vector of water management evolves and shifts from barrier structures against floods and underground pipeline drainage to the natural habitat. Retention pools, wetlands, rain gardens and filter trenches are forming within the city. This has a beneficial effect on the state of the coastline itself and on the attractiveness of this recreational park feature of the city for recreation. In studies based on a factor and comparative analysis of the studied projects in tabular form, it was revealed that in the floodplain relief there are carefully options for barrier fencing. The coastline of the urban development as a buffer zone of land and water should meet the safety and comfort requirements of all inhabitants and be attractive in appearance on both sides. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Examining the impact of personal freedom on income inequality: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa and Western European regions,"Rising income inequality has recently garnered intensive attention owing to its significance in theory and practice. This has rendered the mechanism through which inequality can be understood, even from a microscopic perspective, to institute proper policies that curtail it important. We contribute to the literature by examining the effect of freedom on income inequality using data from 34 least-free and 18 most-free countries from 2000 to 2020 in Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Europe, respectively. A novel fixed-effects panel quantile regression econometric estimator was employed, and the findings showed a non-linear relationship between personal freedom and income inequality for both regions. Again, both regions reported an inverse relationship between personal freedom and income inequality within the medium-run quantiles. However, a positive relationship was reported in the short-run and long-run quantiles of Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Europe, respectively, whereas the inverse was the same. Finally, the significant adverse relationship was more dominant in Western Europe, implying that high levels of personal freedom in the region explain the low levels of income inequality compared to Sub-Saharan Africa, which has lower levels of personal freedom and higher income inequality. Concerning the findings, it is recommended that policymakers and governments of least- and most-free regions institutionalise personal liberties that support human capital development and establish mechanisms to implement enacted freedoms. © 2024 Ohene Kwatia et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Isolation and characterization of refuse methanogens,"Four mesophilic, irregular, rod-shaped methanogenic bacteria were isolated from decomposing refuse recovered from laboratory-scale reactors and a municipal solid waste landfill.

Growth of each isolate was enhanced by yeast extract and inhibited by anaerobic sewage sludge supernatant fluid. No isolate showed greater than 25% lysis on exposure to 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) for 24 h, as is typical of methanogens with a proteinaceous cell wall.

Nexus bioenergy-Bioeconomy,"This first chapter provides an introduction to the role that bioenergy can play in the future bioeconomy by first defining some key terms such as bioenergy, bioeconomy, circular economy and cascading use.Bioenergy is a renewable energy produced from natural sources -energy crops, biomass, wastes and by-products, macro algae, microalgae, seaweeds and aquatic plants- capable of replacing fossil energy. As such, sustainable bioenergy is called upon to play an important role in the future’s economy by contributing to decarbonise the energy systems and providing GHG emission savings.While the bioeconomy concept is still under development, it refers to the set of economic activities relating to the invention, development, production and use of biological products and processes. In a broader sense, bieconomy implies establishing connections with other industrial sectors to make the human activity more environmentally friendly, more circular, more bio-based, more inclusive, more competitive and, ultimately, more sustainable.Compared to the traditional economy which often implies “take, make and dispose”, the concept of circular economy is based on the fundamental ‘closing the loop’ that implies collecting waste from the different processes, recycling and using it to make new products. Finally, the term “Cascading use” describes the efficient utilisation of resources by using residues and recycled materials for material use to extend total biomass availability within a given system. In this sense, the cascading use of biomass may maintain the optimal value creation and resource efficiency while decreasing at the same time the GHG emissions, minimizing depletion of biomass resource and reducing the competition between different biomass uses such as food and feed, chemicals, materials, fuel and energy.As it is the case for other activities, bioenergy could lead to both positive and negative impacts depending on how, where and under what circumstances biomass and residues are produced, harvested, transported and processed. While most of the environmental studies have focused on the positive aspects related to climate change mitigation such as GHG emission savings, negative impacts have also received special attention mostly as a result biodiversity loss and indirect land use change.In any case, bioenergy sustainable assessments must cover the three sustainability pillars: social, environmental and economic so that their results can incline decision makers towards those chains that are most beneficialIn today’s globalized world, strategies have to be also interconnected. Bioenergy and bioeconomy policies should be aligned with the international initiatives devoting to protect human being and nature such as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, United Nations 2030 Sustainable Agenda (Sustainable Development Goals) or the Aichi agreement on biodiversity.Finally, one must not forget that the involvement of all actors and stakeholders is essential in the construction of the governance of the new bioeconomy. Citizens, politicians, business, consumers, policy makers, local, regional and national authorities, scientific and technological community, retailers, media, non-governmental organizations as well as development cooperation agencies have a central role to play. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Legal rights of private property owners vs. sustainability transitions?,"This paper discusses sustainability transitions from a legal rights perspective. It is widely agreed that governments need to drive a systemic change towards environmental sustainability. In order to reach sustainability, the prevailing unsustainable regime must be destabilized while more sustainable alternatives are promoted to create a new regime. An unsustainable regime should not have a legal right to exist, but transition must be just also for the private property owners that are part of the regime. Justice issues arise particularly when individual persons, entrepreneurs and companies are prohibited to use their property and when their investments become futile. Long transition periods make adjustment easier, but they do not solve all the problems, and sometimes the urgency of environmental problems makes transition periods impossible. If laws set severe limitations on property rights or if legitimate expectations are frustrated by the administrative branch, compensations may be in order. All countries driving transitions may face a two-front legal battle where powerful corporations are suing them for property rights and citizens for environmental rights. Courts and tribunals must reformulate property law as well as trade and investment law to assimilate environmental concerns. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Coordination of Value Chain Members,"The innovation-driven coordination of “green” and “growth” in enterprises’ green growth model (EGGM) requires value chain members to collaborate, to facilitate the coordination of business processes in the upstream and downstream of the value chain. Value co-creation and sharing among members in a value network drive firms to implement the green growth model and green transformation. From the perspective of the internal and external environment surrounding the green transformation of the value chain, this chapter explores the coordination mechanism among value chain members that is aimed at ensuring the sharing of value among entities. This coordination mechanism also motivates enterprises to implement the green growth model to coordinate “growth” with economic performance goals and “green” with environmental performance goals. With a better understanding of the relationship between the coordination of value chain members and an enterprise’s green growth, this chapter introduces the concepts and structure of member coordination in the green growth model, analyzes the path of members to achieve coordination, and finally evaluates the characteristics and mechanism of value co-creation in the green growth model. We show that for the internal coordination mechanism, the Shapley value method and cost sharing contract can coordinate the profits and green level of the value chain. In particular, the Shapley value method has a better coordination effect, which can address the externality effect of green transformation investment and encourage value chain members to make cooperative investments. For the external coordination mechanism, government subsidies can effectively motivate value chain enterprises to invest in green levels and increase the market share of green products. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Ideology in vicarious learning-related communication,"Organizations often learn vicariously by observing what other organizations do. Our study examines vicarious learning-related communication through which individuals share their observations with other organizational members. Most students and members of present-day organizations would expect that this communication is driven by a prodevelopment logic-that communication serves the purpose of organizational improvement and competitiveness. Our unique historical evidence on learning-related communication over multiple decades shows that the subjective and collective attitude toward prodevelopment communication may be ideologically conditioned. Prodevelopment communication is the norm in capitalist organizations, but competing ideologies may emphasize other goals higher than organizational development. Consequently, increasing challenges to capitalism as the ideological basis of economic organization can have deep impacts on how organizations learn and produce innovations in the future. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

"The institutional economics of corruption and reform: Theory, evidence, and policy","Corruption has been a feature of public institutions for centuries yet only relatively recently has it been made the subject of sustained scientific analysis. Lambsdorff shows how insights from institutional economics can be used to develop a better understanding of why corruption occurs and the best policies to combat it. He argues that rather than being deterred by penalties, corrupt actors are more influenced by other factors such as the opportunism of their criminal counterparts and the danger of acquiring an unreliable reputation. This suggests a novel strategy for fighting corruption similar to the invisible hand that governs competitive markets. This strategy - the 'invisible foot' - shows that the unreliability of corrupt counterparts induces honesty and good governance even in the absence of good intentions. Combining theoretical research with state-of-the-art empirical investigations, this book will be an invaluable resource for researchers and policy-makers concerned with anti-corruption reform. © Johann Graf Lambsdorff and Cambridge University Press, 2007.",Not About Sufficiency
Link to the land and Mino-pimatisiwin (comprehensive health) of indigenous people living in urban areas in Eastern Canada,"Mino-pimatisiwin is a comprehensive health philosophy shared by several Indigenous peoples in North America. As the link to the land is a key element of mino-pimatisiwin, our aim was to determine if Indigenous people living in urban areas can reach mino-pimatisiwin. We show that Indigenous people living in urban areas develop particular ways to maintain their link to the land, notably by embracing broader views of “land” (including urban areas) and “community” (including members of different Indigenous peoples). Access to the bush and relations with family and friends are necessary to fully experience mino-pimatisiwin. Culturally safe places are needed in urban areas, where knowledge and practices can be shared, contributing to identity safeguarding. There is a three-way equilibrium between bush, community, and city; and mobility between these places is key to maintaining the balance at the heart of mino-pimatisiwin. © 2019 by the authors.

The relation of standards and power in management and organization research: Core notions and alternative avenues,"This paper explores how management and organization research has shed light on the relation between standards and power. The narrative literature review intersects so far unconnected categorizations from standardization and power literatures to systematically map out the broad knowledge structure of the power-related literature on standardization. As a result, the paper details six power-related notions of standardization. Building on the review, the paper summarizes neglected issues and suggests new avenues for future research. The analysis reveals that research widely tends toward either/or conceptions in terms of the empowering or disempowering dynamics of standardization. To descend from this dichotomous perspective in future research, the paper finally recommends exploring the dialectics of standardization in more detail: first, by analyzing standards as a reflection of existing power structures and contestations; second, by investigating standards as subject to power logics and interests; and third, by scrutinizing standardization as the dynamic interplay of powerlessness and powerfulness. © 2022 The Authors.

Sustainable tourism value chain analysis as a tool to evaluate tourism's contribution to the sustainable development goals and local Indigenous communities,"As one of the largest industries, tourism receives substantial attention for planning and development. This attention can contribute to achieving Agenda 2030 and localising the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Over the last decades, sustainable tourism has been promoted as an economic and cultural activity that supports local communities. However, there has been limited research on evaluating sustainable tourism projects from a comprehensive perspective aligned with the SDGs. This paper introduces the sustainable tourism value chain analysis (STVCA), a tool to evaluate how sustainable tourism can contribute to advancing the SDGs at local levels. This study tested the STVCA on one Indigenous ecotourism venture in Mexico, considering economic, socio-cultural, and environmental components. Findings exposed that even though economic benefits were limited, the most significant benefits were non-economic, showing that sustainable tourism has contributed to the well-being of the community by empowering Indigenous people and, in doing so, advancing several SDGs. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency

Cultures of doing good: Anthropologists and NGOs,"Anthropological field studies of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in their unique cultural and political contexts. Cultures of Doing Good: Anthropologists and NGOs serves as a foundational text to advance a growing subfield of social science inquiry: the anthropology of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Thorough introductory chapters provide a short history of NGO anthropology, address how the study of NGOs contributes to anthropology more broadly, and examine ways that anthropological studies of NGOs expand research agendas spawned by other disciplines. In addition, the theoretical concepts and debates that have anchored the analysis of NGOs since they entered scholarly discourse after World War II are explained. The wide-ranging volume is organized into thematic parts: “Changing Landscapes of Power,” “Doing Good Work,” and “Methodological Challenges of NGO Anthropology.” Each part is introduced by an original, reflective essay that contextualizes and links the themes of each chapter to broader bodies of research and to theoretical and methodological debates. A concluding chapter synthesizes how current lines of inquiry consolidate and advance the first generation of anthropological NGO studies, highlighting new and promising directions in this field. In contrast to studies about surveys of NGOs that cover a single issue or region, this book offers a survey of NGO dynamics in varied cultural and political settings. The chapters herein cover NGO life in Tanzania, Serbia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Peru, the United States, and India. The diverse institutional worlds and networks include feminist activism, international aid donors, USAID democracy experts, Romani housing activism, academic gender studies, volunteer tourism, Jewish philanthropy, Islamic faith-based development, child welfare, women’s legal arbitration, and environmental conservation. The collection explores issues such as normative democratic civic engagement, elitism and professionalization, the governance of feminist advocacy, disciplining religion, the politics of philanthropic neutrality, NGO tourism and consumption, blurred boundaries between anthropologists as researchers and activists, and barriers to producing critical NGO ethnographies. © 2017 by the University of Alabama Press.

Corporate opposition to climate change disclosure regulation in the United States,"Extensive research shows that corporations tacitly resist climate change-related regulations even as they publicly espouse pro-climate strategies. In this study, we examine corporate responses to a major regulatory proposal by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to increase climate-related disclosures, which was made into law in March 2024. Corporate opposition to climate change disclosure regulation is measured by performing sentiment analysis, using GPT-3 from OpenAI, on comments and letters submitted by companies to the SEC on the proposed regulation. Analysis of data from 146 large corporations shows a positive average sentiment, indicating a statistically significant support for the proposed regulation. However, there are substantial variations across firms, with energy firms exhibiting the highest, and service firms the least, opposition. Opposition to climate change disclosure regulation was significantly greater in companies with higher Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions though no significant association was found for Scope 2 and 3 emissions. Companies with strong recent stock market performance, politically liberal boards, robust environmental disclosure practices, and sound sustainability governance were less opposed to the regulation. These results show that companies face mixed incentives that simultaneously increase the appeal and risk of climate change disclosures, reducing the efficacy of voluntary disclosure regimes. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Can proximity to urban green spaces be considered a luxury? Classifying a non-tradable good with the use of hedonic pricing method,"Environmental goods are sometimes considered a luxury that only the rich can afford. This is no less true in the case of green spaces. However, a typical microeconomic lens is not relevant to study the potential luxury of non-tradable goods. Typically, the distributional interpretation of the income elasticity of the willingness to pay (WTP) for such goods would involve stated preferences valuation methods. The possibility to describe the luxury of green space proximity based on revealed preferences methods has not been evaluated yet. Through this study, we would like to fill this gap. We proposed a three-step analysis of the apartment market in Lodz (Poland), based on the hedonic pricing method, to check how the marginal WTP (MWTP) for proximity to parks/forests differs among apartment price sub-segments. We discuss whether and to what extent the variability of the MWTP could be linked with the presumed luxury of green space proximity. We found that proximity does not result in increased apartment prices for all parks and forests. The estimated MWTP for the proximity to selected parks rises in consecutive apartment price sub-segments. This could be interpreted as a sign of the luxury of living close to these parks by apartment buyers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Renewable Electricity Output on Sustainability in the Context of Circular Economy: A Global Perspective,"In this article, we investigate the impact of “Renewable Electricity Output” on the green economy in the context of the circular economy for 193 countries in the period 2011–2020. We use data from the World Bank ESG framework. We perform Panel Data with Fixed Effects, Panel Data with Random Effects, Weighted Last Squares-WLS, and Pooled Ordinary Least Squares-OLS. Our results show that Renewable Electricity Output is positively associated, among others, with “Adjusted Savings-Net Forest Depletion” and “Renewable Energy Consumption” and negatively associated, among others, with “CO2 Emission” and “Cooling Degree Days”. Furthermore, we perform a cluster analysis implementing the k-Means algorithm optimized with the Elbow Method and we find the presence of four clusters. In adjunct, we confront seven different machine learning algorithms to predict the future level of “Renewable Electricity Output”. Our results show that Linear Regression is the best algorithm and that the future value of renewable electricity output is predicted to growth on average at a rate of 0.83% for the selected countries. Furthermore, we improve the machine learning analysis with a Deep Learning approach using Convolutional Neural Network-CNN but the algorithm is not appropriate for the analyzed dataset. Less complex machine learning algorithms show better statistical results. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Bridging political ecology and STS: A field analysis of the Rosgen Wars,"Since the late 1990s there have been many calls to bring critical geography into conversation with science and technology studies (STS). Although the strongest cross-fertilization to date has been ontological, political economy is another productive area for conversation between the two fields. More specifically, I argue that fully understanding the role that environmental science plays in expropriation requires expanding our focus of analysis to include not just the application of science but also its production and circulation. Through a field analysis of the Rosgen Wars, a fight that has convulsed the American stream restoration field since the mid-1990s, I demonstrate how Bourdieu's analytical framework can bridge political ecology and STS, revealing the political economic relations central to the development of scientific knowledge claims, education, authority, and policy. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
"Interactions between disaster risk reduction and intangible culture among indigenous communities in Benguet, Philippines","Intangible cultural heritage (ICH), are the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, and skills in society, handed down from generation to generation. They are of growing interest in disaster discourse, due to their various contributions to community preparedness and response, including the improvement of early warning systems and mobilisation of resources and logistics. Previous research has provided evidence on how ICH contributes to disaster risk reduction in various contexts but is often concentrated among popular cultural heritage, particularly those inscribed by the UNESCO. ICH such as local knowledge, practices, innovations, and rituals outside of this authorised cultural heritage, such as those belonging to indigenous communities, are less well articulated, despite their importance in helping build effective disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM). This research examined how ICH, particularly indigenous knowledge, practices, technologies, and rituals have helped communities in Benguet, Northern Philippines for generations to build coping strategies to better respond to the risks of typhoons and other extreme events. Adopting a qualitative mixed-methods approach with an ethnographic orientation, data was gathered using storytelling, semi-structured interviews, key informant interviews, and document review. Respondents included elders for the storytelling, households for the semi-structured interview, and officers of the local authorities for the key informant interviews. The key findings of this study highlighted that several areas of local knowledge, practices, and systems focused on social support systems, cultural technologies and innovations, local rituals, and indigenous early warning systems that are present within the Benguet community, all of which are essential in strengthening DRRM at the local level. This intangible heritage has been fundamental in helping facilitate careful planning and adjustments in local activities, catalysing preemptive measures against foreseeable risks. As such, greater effort should be made by the State to increase mainstreaming of these ICH and the participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of disaster risk reduction intervention. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Flow and sediment dynamics around structures in mangrove ecosystems-a modeling perspective,"We conducted a literature review to determine the state of the art of hydro- and sediment dynamics modeling studies. We start with a brief overview about mangrove ecosystems while showing various aspects of hydro- and sediment dynamics without claiming exhaustiveness. Since mangrove structures are commonly mimicked using cylindrical stems, papers presenting flow and sedimentation patterns around cylinders are also included in this chapter. We report a significant gap of knowledge of hydrodynamics and sediment transport around mangrove structures at small spatial scales of root systems or trees, single roots or seedlings, and surface texture. To date, most studies are based on field measurements investigating sediment transport around mangrove structures, followed by investigations using flume experiments or numerical simulations. However, Computational Fluid Dynamics appears to be a method with great potential to quantify small-scale dynamics around mangrove structures and could lead to a better understanding of these ecosystems and their processes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency

A 60-times faster digital-discovery-compatible reaction setup with enhanced safety for chemical applications,"Modern laboratory practices demand safer, efficient, and more green and sustainable solutions, especially given the often dangerous nature of the chemicals used. This study introduces a technique for addressing these challenges by encapsulating chemicals within 3D-printed polymeric cylinders designed for various chemical transformations. The studied encapsulation method not only exhibits reaction yields comparable to those of established methodologies, but also significantly increases the safety and procedural efficiency of laboratory practice. The specially designed capsules are soluble in prevalent organic solvents, facilitating the controlled release of their chemical contents when subjected to reactions. The inherent compatibility of these capsules with multiple reagents underscores their potential to be considered as a new approach in sustainable laboratory practices. Encapsulation technology presents a safer alternative to manual handling of volatile, toxic, and flammable reagents, thus mitigating potential hazards. This translates to a significant reduction in the risks associated with chemical handling while simultaneously simplifying traditional time-consuming procedures. Varying the geometric and chemical properties of the capsules allows for the encapsulation of a diverse range of substances and reactions, demonstrating their adaptability. Given its transformative potential, this technique provides new opportunities for future endeavors in the chemical domain. The approach of encapsulating chemicals could contribute to an expected digital discovery paradigm shift, ushering in an era of streamlined, safer, and sustainable chemical practices. The potential benefits, from safety to sustainability, of this approach make it appealing for a broad spectrum of chemical applications. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Not About Sufficiency
The governance of ecosystem services from tropical upland watersheds,"Upland watersheds in the tropics provide a range of crucial ecosystem goods and services. How they are governed can be crucial to human well-being and environmental sustainability. Communities, governments and firms have taken many different approaches to sharing these benefits, negotiating trade-offs between them, and allocating the risks and burdens if services are degraded or lost. This review of policies and projects draws four initial conclusions: (1) multi-stakeholder planning improves the assessment of underappreciated services and users, but does not eliminate importance of power relations; (2) regulations invariably create winners and losers with outcomes that often depend on pre-existing institutions; (3) information and incentives can change behaviours and are therefore important complement to plans and regulations; (4) monitoring is the least well developed area of governance. Many challenges in integrating ecological and social understanding remain. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Where women in agri-food systems are at highest climate risk: a methodology for mapping climate–agriculture–gender inequality hotspots,"Climate change poses a greater threat for more exposed and vulnerable countries, communities and social groups. People whose livelihood depends on the agriculture and food sector, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), face significant risk. In contexts with gendered roles in agri-food systems or where structural constraints to gender equality underlie unequal access to resources and services and constrain women’s agency, local climate hazards and stressors, such as droughts, floods, or shortened crop-growing seasons, tend to negatively affect women more than men and women’s adaptive capacities tend to be more restrained than men’s. Transformation toward just and sustainable agri-food systems in the face of climate change will not only depend on reducing but also on averting aggravated gender inequality in agri-food systems. In this paper, we developed and applied an accessible and versatile methodology to identify and map localities where climate change poses high risk especially for women in agri-food systems because of gendered exposure and vulnerability. We label these localities climate-agriculture-gender inequality hotspots. Applying our methodology to LMICs reveals that the countries at highest risk are majorly situated in Africa and Asia. Applying our methodology for agricultural activity-specific hotspot subnational areas to four focus countries, Mali, Zambia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance, identifies a cluster of districts in Dhaka and Mymensingh divisions in Bangladesh as a hotspot for rice. The relevance and urgency of identifying localities where climate change hits agri-food systems hardest and is likely to negatively affect population groups or sectors that are particularly vulnerable is increasingly acknowledged in the literature and, in the spirit of leaving no one behind, in climate and development policy arenas. Hotspot maps can guide the allocation of scarce resources to most-at-risk populations. The climate-agriculture-gender inequality hotspot maps show where women involved in agri-food systems are at high climate risk while signaling that reducing this risk requires addressing the structural barriers to gender equality.

Taiwan’s ecological footprint and overshoot day,"This study examines Taiwan’s ecological footprint (EF) and its Overshoot Day from 2000 to 2018. The latest EF calculation method is used to determine the conversion rates and equivalent factors of bioproductive lands in each year to establish a database of Taiwan’s EF in that period. The results reveal that Taiwan’s EF was 7.69 gha/person in 2000, dropping steadily to 6.46 gha/person in 2018. Taiwan’s carbon footprint accounted for about 61% of Taiwan’s total EF, slightly higher than the world average (60%). The carbon footprint as a proportion of the total EF has been increasing annually. This study adopts social communication tools, such as the overshoot day and the earth clock, to promote sustainable development goals and climate change policy initiatives. Global Footprint Network (GFN) updates the overshoot day of each country in its database yearly, based on each country’s EF and biocapacity. Since Taiwan is not included in GFN, this study adopts the same method and finds out that Taiwan's Overshoot Day in 2018 was March 14th, meaning that on March 14th, 2018, Taiwan exhausted all of the biological resources that its bioproductive lands can regenerate in the year. If the global population lived like Taiwanese, four Earths would be required to provide the resources used. This result not only reflects the consumption of natural resources in Taiwan, but also indicates that Taiwan should focus on sustainable development and reduce that consumption. © 2021, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Tree mapping and carbon inventory on a university campus in South Korea: Case study and global review,"Campus trees have significant potential for sequestering carbon in urban environments and improving civic life quality; however, few inventories of university campus trees have been constructed worldwide (excluding North America). This study briefly overviews the current status, challenges, and prospects of inventorying campus trees and provides a case study of a campus tree inventory and carbon assessment through a student participatory program in South Korea. Campus tree maps from 25 universities in eight countries were investigated. A campus tree inventory usually consists of various data on the tree species, dbh, and biomass, and it is often prepared through a capstone or student project in the university. This review identified the following challenges: (1) Few cases have been reported outside North America, (2) publications and data sharing are limited, and (3) participants' experiences have not been evaluated. The case study on inventorying and mapping campus trees was performed by integrating drone-based orthographic images and field censuses of tree data (species, diameter, GPS coordinates, etc.). A total of 2341 individual trees belonging to 73 species were surveyed over 28.7 ha of green spaces on campus, and various thematic maps were created online. In 2021, the aboveground carbon storage was 263.9 Mg C, and it increased annually by 5.62 Mg C. This study presents the first attempt to evaluate and report a campus tree carbon inventory at an East Asian university. Additional advancements in monitoring techniques and practices for campus trees may contribute to the sustainability of university campuses and local communities. © 2025 The Author(s).

Unleashing the spillover potential: Exploring the role of technology-seeking investment in driving green innovation of host countries,"The integration of green development and innovation has become a critical strategy for transforming China's energy-intensive economic growth model. This study investigates the heterogeneous impact of technology-seeking outward foreign direct investment (TSOFDI) for promoting green innovation development (GID) by examining Chinese provinces as the empirical units. Our study extends the measurement models of GID by considering both productivity and output, proposing a novel method for selecting TSOFDI projects. The empirical findings indicate significant regional disparities in the GID, with the eastern region leading in both green productivity and green output. Significantly, our study establishes a non-linear correlation between TSOFDI and GID, suggesting that the green spillover effect is contingent on the level of fiscal autonomy and environmental regulation. In conclusion, it is necessary to increase TSOFDI projects and improve investment quality. The government should guide the innovative achievements and high-quality talents from the eastern regions to flow into the central and western regions. Additionally, governments at all levels should dynamically adjust revenue and expenditure, maintaining a reasonable fiscal autonomy and a stringent environmental regulation to fully unleash the promoting role of outward investment in green innovation. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the connections between Microbiome and Dementia: systematic review,"Introduction: disturbance in the balance of the intestinal microbiota, as an ecosystem, determines states of dysbiosis and dysregulation of the immune system, which are crucial for the onset of gastrointestinal and systemic diseases. Dementia is defined as an acquired syndrome, characterized by cognitive impairment and changes in mood or personality, which are severe enough to hinder social and occupational performance. Objectives: to describe the scientific evidence on the relationship between the gut microbiome and the onset/progression of dementia, and how it influences the underlying pathological mechanisms of different types of dementia. Methods: a search was conducted in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science from January 2000 to October 2022. Selecting abstracts of cohort and case-control studies evaluating the relationship between the gut microbiome and the onset/progression of dementia. Results: the results of this review suggest that there is a significant interaction between gut microbiota and mental health, supporting the idea that the gut and brain are bidirectionally connected through the gut-brain axis. However, it is important to note that many of these studies have limitations, such as small sample sizes and varied research designs, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Therefore, more research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and clinical relevance of these relationships. Conclusions: this systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the interaction between gut microbiota and mental health in diverse populations. The results suggest that gut microbiota may play an important role in mental health, but further studies are needed to confirm and better understand these relationships. These results have significant implications for research and the development of interventions targeting the gut microbiota as a potential approach to improve mental health in various conditions. © Autor(es); 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability and subjective well-being: How students weigh dimensions,"Sustainability and SubjectiveWell-Being (SWB) are strongly interrelated domains. The way students view them and prioritize their dimensions should be factored into curricular developments in education for sustainability. Instruments developed to examine sustainability and SWB preferences typically use rating scale items to measure dimensions as separate entities. In contrast, the question format used in this study forces the students to rate variables in relation to each other. The sum of both SWB and sustainability variables was fixed, which means that increasing the weight of a priority automatically meant a decrease in the weight that could be allocated for the remaining elements. Two-block Partial Least Squares (PLS) modelling was used to examine how pre-defined SWB and sustainability dimensions behave when handled within the same model. It was found that those who ordered the three sustainability dimensions as Environment > Society > Economy tended to rank SWB dimensions as (Relations with others, Inner peace) > (Health, Close to nature) > (Good job, Leisure). Our research proved that the use of question formats resembling real-life resource allocation dilemmas and the treatment of SWB and sustainability as one system can yield invaluable information for the educational process. © 2019 by the authors.

The multilevel governance of immigration and Ssettlement: Making deep federalism work,"This study addresses the question of how best to ensure that national immigration policies are appropriately adjusted to meet the disparate requirements of different communities. We argue that this is the core objective of multilevel governance, which, however, has become freighted with competing ideological objectives, objectives that are perhaps best expressed in Hooghe and Marks's distinction between type I and type II governance, the former oriented to collective decision making and the latter embodying market-oriented approaches to governance. Our argument is that these competing sets of ideologically driven objectives divert multilevel governance away from its core objective of appropriateness to community circumstances. An accompanying article (Leo and Enns, 2009) explores problems posed by ideologically driven, type II multilevel governance in Vancouver. The current article takes up a contrasting case, that of the Canada-Manitoba Agreement on Immigration and Settlement, focusing especially on Winnipeg. We find that in this case the provincial government chose an approach to multilevel governance that did not hew to either type I or type II governance templates, but drew on both to build an impressively successful system of immigration and settlement, carefully tailored to meet the requirements of disparate Manitoba communities. Success was built not on the application of a preconceived template for good governance but on resourcefulness and flexibility in working out ways of making national policies fit local circumstances. © 2009 Canadian Political Science Association.",Not About Sufficiency
Bird richness and Ecosystems Services across an urban to natural gradient in south-eastern Brazil: implications for landscape planning and future scenarios,"In natural and altered environments, the Ecosystem Services (ES) provided by the presence of vegetation, especially regulating ES such as climate regulation and air pollutant removal, are essential to improve human health and well-being. In this study, we focused on a tropical-subtropical river basin which covers urban, peri-urban and rural landscape types of a Brazilian municipality located in the ecotone between the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado (Brazilian savannah). The research aimed to assess the current state of ES and bird richness (as a biodiversity indicator) and their relationships across an urban-rural-natural gradient. We assessed the cooling effect (as microclimate regulation indicator), air pollutant removal (PM10), nature-based recreation opportunities and bird richness and analysed the variations associated with a shift in the prevailing land-cover types along a gradient of urbaniszation. The results indicated a higher bird richness in periurban and rural landscapes, as well as greater pollutant removal and cooling effect provided by vegetation. However, recreation opportunities provided mainly by human infrastructure were higher inside the urban zone and in some peri-urban areas. The landscape type significantly influenced the availability and intensity of these four variables (p < 0.001). Bird richness, air pollutant removal, and cooling effect were positively correlated (r > 0.539; p ≤ 0.048);, however, a trade-off between them and recreation opportunities (r =-0.59, R2 = 0.348, p < 0.001) was found. We simulated possible scenarios of reforestation actions in urban areas to predict the ES values when vegetation cover area is increased. According to the results, the urban planning and efforts to improve nNature-based solutions in the studied river basin should consider the observed trade-off to promote sustainable nature-based recreation opportunities in places with higher values of ES (cooling effect, air pollutant removal, and bird richness) and/or to increase the ES values in urban landscape through environmental policies, such as reforestation. © Lessi B et al.",Not About Sufficiency
An Evaluation of Health Service Impacts Consequent to Switching from Brand to Generic Venlafaxine in New Zealand under Conditions of Price Neutrality,"Objective To study the health impact on adult New Zealand patients who switch from originator brand to generic venlafaxine. Methods The national pharmacy database was used to select patients using venlafaxine for at least 6 months. Switchers and nonswitchers were identified, and switch behavior was compared for a 12-month follow-up period. Change in health service use following switching was also compared between switchers and nonswitchers including use of the emergency department, hospital, and specialist outpatient services over the same period. Results Approximately 12% of all originator brand users switched to generic venlafaxine, at least half of whom continued to use the generic throughout the follow-up period to August 1, 2012. Almost 60% of new users of the generic venlafaxine, however, switched to using the originator brand. Aside from a slight reduction in the use of outpatient services among switchers, there were no significant differences in health services use between switchers and nonswitchers for either existing or new venlafaxine users. Conclusions Although both products remain fully subsidized and available, there is little incentive for prescribers, pharmacists, or patients to switch to the less expensive generic brand. If savings to the national New Zealand budget are to be realized, additional policy measures should be implemented to minimize incentives for multiple and reverse switching, and prescribers, as key opinion leaders, could take the lead in promoting generics to their patients. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Value methodology in public engagement for construction development projects,"Purpose: The use of public engagement (PE) has been encouraged by the Hong Kong government in recent years, with the construction industry under particular pressure to employ it. However, society as a whole has been suffering as a result of various levels of discontent and conflict in many construction development projects. The logical paths to analyze public need and resolve conflict in the PE process are vague. Value methodology (VM), a logical method, is thus proposed as an initial framework to support PE activities in construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to enhance PE performance for the complicated construction development projects with the application of VM principles. Design/methodology/approach: Based on an extensive literature review, PE logical team process factors and PE outcomes were identified. A questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the relationships between the logical PE team decision-making process (VM application in the logical process and team behaviors) and final PE outcomes. Findings: The results showed that the PE team process with the application of VM, especially information and analysis phases, influenced PE outcomes positively. Conflict (both destructive conflict and constructive conflict) influenced PE outcomes in different directions. Practical implications: It is recommended that the information and analysis phases of VM are applied to PE process in order to achieve consensus, cultivate team spirit, improve project performance, and enhance organizational reputation. Originality/value: This paper innovatively proposes the application of VM into the PE team process in order to analyze the project logically and subsequently improve holistic PE project performance and finally promote social cohesion. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
"Corporate entrepreneurship, informal ties, and firm performance: Evidence from China","How can a firm achieve superior performance through corporate entrepreneurship in a transition economy? To address this question, we draw upon the resource-based view and the institutional theory to explore distinct roles of business ties and political ties in fulfilling resource needs confronted by different corporate entrepreneurial activities (i.e., internal innovation, venturing and strategic renewal). Using data of 228 firms from the Pearl River Delta area in China, our empirical findings reveal that corporate entrepreneurial activities do not always positively lead to performance in transition economies. Furthermore, the possession of high levels of business ties is more beneficial to the success of internal innovation and strategic renewal, while the possession of high levels of political ties contributes more to the success of venturing. © 2013 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",Not About Sufficiency
Land use change and soil carbon sequestration in China: Where does it pay to conserve?,"This paper estimates the impact of land use change on soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in China from 1985 to 2005 using a nationwide, georeferenced database on land use, soil, and climate. The method presented here is capable of incorporating site-specific information on soil, climate, and land use change into a national-level analysis. We find that grassland restoration contributed to the largest increase in SOC in China from 1985 to 2005, while grassland degradation caused the largest decrease. Overall, land use change resulted in only a small net increase in SOC, by 7.5 TgC (0.02 %), which is statistically insignificant at the 95 % confidence level. A cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that it is important to consider SOC when assessing land conservation programs. Restoring degraded grassland is more cost-effective than returning dry farmland to grassland. Inner Mongolia is a key region for dense grassland restoration. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental Benefits of the Central China Rise Strategy; Empirical Analysis Based on the PSM-DID Model,"Background: The Central China Rise Strategy is one of China’s important regional development strategies, and it has been officially implemented since 2006. Despite the obvious economic development resulting from the strategy, its impact on the environment remains unclear. Objective: Previous studies have focused more on the economic benefits of the Central China Rise Strategy while ignoring its environmental impact. This paper focuses on the environmental benefits and aims to promote the coordinated development between the economy and the environment. Methods: Panel data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2000 to 2017 were selected to construct a propensity score matching-difference-in-difference (PSM-DID) framework for systematic research that includes benchmark modeling, as well as dynamic effect and mechanism analyses. Results: 1) The benchmark model and placebo test proved that the Central China Rise Strategy had increased environmental pollution. 2) Dynamic effect analysis revealed that the impact of the Central China Rise Strategy on environmental pollution has gradually increased in the short-and medium-term, with 2012 exhibiting the greatest augmentation, significantly reducing from 2016 on-wards. 3) The mechanism of action considers three mechanisms. The level of economic development is a path through which the Central China Rise Strategy leads to the aggravation of environmental pollution while the city size is not. Foreign direct investment has improved environmental pollution. Conclusion: The Central China Rise Strategy has aggravated environmental pollution, especially in the short and medium-term. In view of the mechanism path, we put forward three targeted suggestions. In the future, we will study some of the limitations of this paper: more mechanisms of action will be considered, and the use of new technologies, such as neural networks, will be compared with our results. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying the Critical Supply Chains for Black Carbon and CO2 in the Sichuan Urban Agglomeration of Southwest China,"Black carbon (BC) and CO2 emissions are the two major factors responsible for global climate change and the associated health risks. Quantifying the impact of economic activities in urban agglomerations on BC and CO2 emissions is essential for finding a balance between climate change mitigation and pollution reduction. In this study, we utilized a city-level environmental extended multi-regional input–output model (EE-MRIO), integrated nexus strength (INS), and structural path analysis (SPA) to quantify the BC and CO2 footprints, nexus nodes, and supply chains of 21 cities in the Sichuan urban agglomeration (SUA) from 2012 to 2017. The results revealed that approximately 70% of the BC and CO2 footprints come from inter-city transactions, with Chengdu being the largest importing city, while the supply of other cities was greater than their consumption. The SUA has transitioned from a supply-side city cluster to a consumption-oriented city cluster in its trade with other domestic regions. The SPA analysis highlighted that the construction sector was the largest emitter of downstream BC and CO2, while the electricity supply, metal/nonmetallic manufacture, oil refining and coking, transportation, and extraction industry sectors were the main nexus nodes for BC and CO2 emissions in the SUA. Notably, the reduction in BC emissions was due to decreased indirect emissions from oil refining and coking, while the decrease in CO2 emissions was a result of reduced indirect emissions from electricity supply. This article presents, for the first time, a quantification of the heterogeneous impacts and emission supply chains of BC and CO2 emissions from economic activities in the SUA, providing valuable insights for developing climate mitigation policies tailored to different urban clusters. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Employee green behavior: a study on the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on employee green behavior, green culture: the moderating role of green innovation","This study adopts the natural resource-based view (NRBV) of the firm to investigate the relationships between corporate social responsibility (CSR), employees’ green behavior (EGB), green culture, environmental performance (EP), and green innovation (GI) in China’s automobile manufacturing industry. A survey of 465 employees was conducted. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results showed that CSR positively influences EGB and GC, which in turn improves EP. CSR also directly impacts EP. Furthermore, GI enhances the positive effect of CSR on EP through the mediators EGB and GC. The findings contribute to the literature by elucidating the mechanisms linking CSR and EP. They provide an integrated framework incorporating direct, mediated, and moderated effects. For practice, the study highlights the importance of CSR, EGB, and GC for manufacturers aiming to improve environmental sustainability. It suggests managers should promote green values, foster eco-innovation, and encourage employees’ discretionary green actions. The moderating effect of GI implies embedding sustainability in corporate culture and operations to magnify the gains from CSR.

However, the underlying mechanism in the relationship between digital transformation and environmental performance remains unclear. Through the lens of IT-enabled organizational capabilities, this study develops a moderated mediation model to examine the mechanisms and boundary conditions through which digital transformation affects environmental performance. Using a sample of Chinese agriculture firms, our findings reveal that digital transformation positively environmental performance through green capability, and this indirect effect is stronger when green culture is higher. Moreover, green culture moderates the relationship between digital transformation and green capability. Our theoretical explanation and empirical evidence contribute significantly to the literature by providing insights on how to leverage digital transformation initiatives to improve environmental performance. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Does digital finance favor firms in supply chains? Roles of green innovation and bargaining power,"In the digital economy era, the disruptive technologies have boomed and reshaped firms in supply chains by finance digitalization towards a more sustainable way, while how digital finance (DF) affects firms’ performance in supply chains remains still unclear. Meanwhile, the balance between environmental protection and economic benefits has become pivotal for firms to achieve sustainable development. As an effective means to promote green development, green innovation (GI) can provide opportunities for firms to establish a good image and gain competitive advantages. Besides, bargaining power (BP) determines the firms’ profit allocation ratio in the supply chain. Firms with higher bargaining power can pressure suppliers to improve product quality or reduce wholesale price, and thus enhance corporate profits. Given that these two variables are crucial for stimulating firms’ development in supply chains from a long-term perspective, we aim to investigate how these two variables are affected by DF and the influence mechanisms of DF on firm performance based on the data of Chinese listed companies from 2011 to 2018. Results indicate that DF can be regarded as a useful tool for firms to improve corporate performance. We adopt instrumental variable method to solve potential endogeneity concerns, and conduct a series of robustness tests to ensure the reliability of the findings. We also find DF can significantly enhance GI and BP, which in turn improve firm performance in supply chains. This paper advances the literature on innovation and purchasing management by drawing attention to the potential role of DF and by shedding new light on how DF contributes to sustainable development of firms, thus providing managerial insights for governments, firms, financial institutions to develop digital technologies and ensure the healthy development of firms in the supply chains. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Financial report comment letters and greenwashing in environmental, social and governance disclosures: Evidence from China","In the context of the “double carbon” target, the issue of corporate greenwashing in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures has become more prominent as ESG reports spring up. Subsequently, this study examines the relationship between financial report comment letters and greenwashing in companies' ESG disclosures using OLS regression on A-share-listed companies. We found that greenwashing in companies' ESG disclosures increased after they received financial report comment letters. The higher the number of financial report comment letters and the total number of words, the higher the intensity of the comment letter regulation and the greater the greenwashing in companies' ESG disclosures, which verifies the crisis management hypothesis. Simultaneously, greenwashing in ESG disclosures is mainly carried out by companies through “talk more and work less” and “tone management.” Further analysis revealed that financial pressure can increase greenwashing in ESG disclosures in response to comment letters, and improvements in internal and external governance environments can reduce greenwashing in ESG disclosures owing to the receipt of comment letters. Our findings provide a new perspective for understanding greenwashing in ESG disclosures from the insights of financial report comment letters and have important reference value for preventing ESG greenwashing risk and promoting high-quality economic development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Uneven ores: Gold mining materialities and classes of labor in Indonesia,"Behind farming, small-scale mining is one of the most important sources of rural livelihoods in the Global South. A significant body of research has detailed the interlinkages between these activities. More recently, scholars have used the tools of agrarian change to interpret small-scale mining livelihood dynamics. I build on this trend by introducing an emphasis on the materiality of mining. As with small farmers, small-scale miners’ livelihoods depend directly on the land—its material qualities are a prime factor in their choices, successes, and failures. Extending this comparison, I consider how the nature of gold ore shapes small-scale mining labor practices, dynamics, and outcomes. To do so, I examine small-scale gold mining in the Pongkor region of West Java, Indonesia. In Pongkor, an array of people with diverse social positionings participate in mining using different techniques and at different scales. I connect this diversity to the variable characteristics of the ore they mine, including the quality of the ore, the depth where it is found, and the methods required to process its various forms. I argue that these multiple materialities have made small-scale mining both a flexible and an unequal livelihood. The particularities of gold's occurrence enable it to support many people, but simultaneously structure inequalities into small-scale gold production. The interplay of these material conditions and broader political-economic dynamics has ultimately resulted in the differentiation of various “classes of labor.” Like farming, small-scale mining is thus experienced, and incorporated into broader commodity exchange, unevenly. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Addressing global environmental externalities: Transaction costs considerations,"Is there a way to understand why some global environmental externalities are addressed effectively, whereas others are not? The transaction costs of defining the property rights to mitigation benefits and costs is a useful framework for such analysis. This approach views international cooperation as a contractual process among country leaders to assign those property rights. Leaders cooperate when it serves domestic interests to do so. The demand for property rights comes from those who value and stand to gain from multilateral action. Property rights are supplied by international agreements that specify resource access and use, assign costs and benefits including outlining the size and duration of compensating transfer payments, and determining who will pay and who will receive them. Four factors raise the transaction costs of assigning property rights: (i) scientific uncertainty regarding mitigation benefits and costs; (ii) varying preferences and perceptions across heterogeneous populations; (iii) asymmetric information; and (iv) the extent of compliance and new entry. These factors are used to examine the role of transaction costs in the establishment and allocation of property rights to provide globally valued national parks, implement the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, execute the Montreal Protocol to manage emissions that damage the stratospheric ozone layer, set limits on harvest of highly-migratory ocean fish stocks, and control greenhouse gas emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
Unmanned aerial vehicles for biodiversity-friendly agricultural landscapes - A systematic review,"The development of biodiversity-friendly agricultural landscapes is of major importance to meet the sustainable development challenges of our time. The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), i.e. drones, has opened a new set of research and management opportunities to achieve this goal. On the one hand, this review summarizes UAV applications in agricultural landscapes, focusing on biodiversity conservation and agricultural land monitoring, based on a systematic review of the literature that resulted in 550 studies. Additionally, the review proposes how to integrate UAV research in these fields and point to new potential applications that may contribute to biodiversity-friendly agricultural landscapes. UAV-based imagery can be used to identify and monitor plants, floral resources and animals, facilitating the detection of quality habitats with high prediction power. Through vegetation indices derived from their sensors, UAVs can estimate biomass, monitor crop plant health and stress, detect pest or pathogen infestations, monitor soil fertility and target patches of high weed or invasive plant pressure, allowing precise management practices and reduced agrochemical input. Thereby, UAVs are helping to design biodiversity-friendly agricultural landscapes and to mitigate yield-biodiversity trade-offs. In conclusion, UAV applications have become a major means of biodiversity conservation and biodiversity-friendly management in agriculture, while latest developments, such as the miniaturization and decreasing costs of hyperspectral sensors, promise many new applications for the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring perceptions of sustainable development in South Korea: An approach based on advocacy coalition framework's belief system,"The concept of sustainable development has been criticized for its broadness and ambiguity that permits different interpretations in separate views. However, the prior studies on sustainable development generally relied on survey data, so they have some limitations that preclude congruent conclusions. In contrast to prior studies, we used Q methodology, which is designed to investigate subjective perceptions as it is. This study aims to explore the South Koreans' perceptions of sustainable development among various stakeholders such as experts, bureaucrats, legislatures, civic groupmembers, company employees, and journalists. Based on the hierarchical belief system of the advocacy coalition framework, we classified all statements into three categories: core value, policy core, and secondary aspects. Using Q methodology, we extracted five types: (1) democrat; (2) idealist; (3) green growth advocate; (4) skeptics; and (5) elitist. We examined the distribution of the five types according to a hierarchical belief system, and discussed implications of the findings. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Preliminary study of the influence of the spatial arrangement of urban parks on local temperature reduction,"As more of the population resides in urban areas, the magnitude of the urban heat island effect may increase accordingly. Parks can create a cool island effect, adjust the urban microclimate, and improve the urban thermal environment. In the past, many researchers have utilized field measurements and numerical simulations to study the cooling effects and influential factors of parks. The current study is based on previous research on park cooling effects and utilizes an ENVI-met model to characterize the influence of the spatial arrangement of urban parks on local temperature reduction. The results indicated that different spatial arrangements of parks exhibited significant differences in outdoor cooling effects. A larger total park area, a greater number of parks, a greater area of the largest park, more evenly distributed park spaces, and more park diversity led to more dramatic outdoor cooling effects. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH",Not About Sufficiency
"Transportation, Environmental Degradation, and Health Dynamics in the United States and China: Evidence From Bootstrap ARDL With a Fourier Function","Transportation and environmental degradation, with indirect and direct effects, play a significant role in determining the health of a nation's citizens. This study uses bootstrap ARDL with a Fourier function to examine transportation, environmental degradation, and health dynamics in the United States and China. In the long run, the results support the cointegration relationship between transportation, environmental degradation, and health in both countries. The results show the contingency of the causality where a negative impact of transportation on environmental degradation exists in the United States while a positive impact exists in China. The effect of environmental degradation on health is negative in the United States while a positive effect exists in China.

"Role of sustainable finance, geopolitical risk and economic growth in renewable energy investment: Empirical evidence from China","The global economic recession caused by COVID-19 has posed a severe threat to the feasibility of renewable energy projects, hampering the United Nation (UN) sustainable development goals. Sustainable financing (SF) is a crucial instrument for promoting investment in renewable energy (IRE) sources, as it is regarded as a crucial aspect in achieving long-term sustainability. This study sheds insight on the impact of SF, geopolitical risk (GPR), economic growth (EG), and environmental regulation (ER) on IRE sources by evaluating 10 years of data from 35 Chinese energy businesses from 2012 to 2021. The data analysis is done by utilizing quantile regression and dynamic analytic techniques, demonstrating that SF, EG, and ER have a significant positive effect on IRE sources. However, GPR has a significant detrimental impact on IRE in China. This is one of the early studies to examine the crucial role of SF, GPR, EG, and ER in IRE, which is critical for environmental sustainability. In addition, it provides policymakers and environmentalists with crucial insights for developing and executing environmental strategies that can deliver long-term benefits and meet SD goals. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Exploring the ""Double-Edged Sword"" effect of the digital economy on sustainable agricultural development: Evidence from China","The prolonged reliance on excessive resource utilization and unsustainable production methods has resulted in significant environmental issues in China, posing serious challenges to the sustainable development of agriculture. While the digital economy offers new opportunities for enhancing agricultural sustainability, its rapid and unregulated growth could also lead to negative effects. Therefore, exploring the relationship between the digital economy and sustainable agriculture development (SAD), along with clarifying the mechanisms involved, is of paramount importance. This study uses the EBM-GML index to calculate AGTFP as a representation of SAD and empirically tests the impact and mechanism of the digital economy on SAD. Additionally, it explores the moderating role of government behavior, specifically Agricultural fiscal support and digital policies. The main findings are as follows: (1) During the observation period, SAD showed a steady upward trend, but regional disparities widened, forming a contiguous agglomeration pattern. The decentralization of the digital economy weakened, trending towards unipolarization and homogenization, with a north-to-south diffusion. (2) The impact of the digital economy on SAD presents an inverted ""U"" shape, indicating a ""double-edged sword"" effect. This relationship remains significant after robustness and endogeneity tests. Additionally, the digital economy exhibits significant spatial effects, maintaining an inverted U-shaped relationship with SAD in neighboring areas. (3) Regional heterogeneity shows that coastal provinces are in digital economy suppression or alert areas, while inland regions are in enhancement areas. During the study period, the number of suppression and alert areas did not significantly increase, but there was a trend of shifting from coastal to inland regions. (4) When below the threshold, the digital economy promotes agricultural green technology innovation, optimizes resource allocation, and fosters synergetic agglomeration of agriculture with the secondary and tertiary industries, enhancing SAD. However, surpassing the threshold negatively impacts these mechanisms. (5) Fiscal support for agriculture smooths the inverted ""U"" curve, mitigating the negative impact of excessive digital economy growth on SAD. Conversely, digital policies steepen the inverted ""U"" curve, exacerbating these negative effects. The findings highlight the need for balanced digital economic development to support sustainable agricultural growth. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency

Co-designing vacant lots using interactive 3D visualizations - Development and application of the Land.Info DSS,"Collaborative processes of co-production between end-users and designers can be an effective means to produce shared understanding about a system and has been shown to improve the quality of, and support for, design outcomes. In spatial design and planning, co-production usually involves engaging community members in the design and planning of their local environment (co-design). However, to support co-design of landscapes it has been recommended that decision support systems (DSS) be developed for both the specific decision setting, and in conjunction with meaningful public guidance and input, to transition professional practice to working with rather than for the public. The research presented here responds to these recommendations by developing and evaluating a process for involving end user residents in the co-production and application of the Land.Info DSS in the design of multifunctional landscapes within their communities. The research used participatory workshops incorporating a structured elicitation process, agile software development, and user evaluation to design and test a video game-based DSS in context of two real-world design settings in Detroit, MI, USA. In this paper, we describe and evaluate the process and outcomes, with the results showing improved evaluation over the course of development and overall positive outcomes from this type of collaboration. We also found that residents required additional information to orient themselves in the DSS. In addition, visualization realism and ease of use of the DSS contributing to dialogue during co-design sessions.

Lethal Interactions of Atomically Precise Gold Nanoclusters and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus Bacterial Cells,"Ultrasmall metal nanoclusters (NCs) are employed in an array of diagnostic and therapeutic applications due to their tunable photoluminescence, high biocompatibility, polyvalent effect, ease of modification, and photothermal stability. However, gold nanoclusters' (AuNCs') intrinsically antimicrobial properties remain poorly explored and are not well understood. Here, we share an insight into the antimicrobial action of atomically precise AuNCs based on their ability to passively translocate across the bacterial membrane. Functionalized by a hydrophilic modified-bidentate sulfobetaine zwitterionic molecule (AuNC-ZwBuEt) or a more hydrophobic monodentate-thiolate, mercaptohexanoic acid (AuNC-MHA) molecule, 2 nm AuNCs were lethal to both Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The bactericidal efficiency was found to be bacterial strain-, time-, and concentration-dependent. The direct visualizations of the translocation of AuNCs and AuNC-cell and subcellular interactions were investigated using cryo-soft X-ray nano-tomography, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning TEM energy-dispersive spectroscopy analyses. AuNC-MHA were identified in the bacterial cytoplasm within 30 min, without evidence of the loss of membrane integrity. It is proposed that the bactericidal effect of AuNCs is attributed to their size, which allows for efficient energy-independent translocation across the cell membrane. The internalization of both AuNCs caused massive internal damage to the cells, including collapsed subcellular structures and altered cell morphology, leading to the eventual loss of cellular integrity. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Understanding scale in wicked problems of sustainable development: Who needs dedicated courses in higher education?,"Many universities have developed and established systems to teach engineers about societal aspects of their work. Such approaches should be mandated as it enables engineers to contribute to any transdisciplinary challenge faced by humanity. These major problems human society faces can be addressed by using the frame of the Sustainable Development Goals. Achieving these goals depends on humanity’s ability to manage our self-inflicted interconnected climate- and biodiversity-loss-crisis. Public discourse, discussions at university, or student’s work-assignments often lack an understanding of the scale of specific tasks and technical approaches needed. Scale is understood as any physical dimension involved in a human activity, or the implementation of a technical solution for aforementioned problems regionally or globally; examples of such physical dimensions are mass of resources used, amount of energy invested, or Ricardian land covered. This dearth of understanding usually results in a disregard for the environmental impact or an overestimation of benefits, it hinders realistic approaches, and can lead to irresponsible discounting of the human future. This paper addresses the interrelated questions of how to teach relevant competences and methods at university, specifically: What are the major hindrances to grasping scale in a meaningful way? Are there significant differences between students of technical and non-technical studies in understanding scale? Who would gain from learning such skills? What could be the content of a meaningful course? The paper draws on student’s assignments from engineering and from interdisciplinary courses addressing SDGs. All these courses tend to demand from the students the inclusion of comparable concepts with respect to scale.

Forest degradation and food security,"Deforestation and forest degradation, however, are impairing the capacity of forests to contribute to food security and other needs. This article focuses on tropical forests, which are currently experiencing the highest rates of clearing and degradation. From 1980 to 1990, an estimated 146 million ha of natural forests in the tropics were cleared, with an additional loss of 65 million ha between 1990 and 1995 (FAO, 1997). The area of degraded forest (defined below) is estimated to be even greater (WRI, 1994). Tropical forests are located in the areas of the world with the highest concentration of the food insecure. They are home to approximately 300 million people who depend on shifting cultivation, hunting and gathering to survive (FAO, 1996a); many are at risk of not consuming enough food to meet their daily energy requirement on a chronic, transitory or seasonal basis. In addition to these forest inhabitants, millions of people living adjacent to forest areas depend on forests for some aspect of their food security.",Not About Sufficiency
"Epidemiology and quality of care of acute intoxication in people over 65 years of age in Alicante, Spain","Introduction: The objective of this study was to examine the epidemiology of acute poisonings in the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary center and to analyze the compliance level with quality indicators (QIs) in patients 65 years and older compared rest of adults. Materials and methods: This was an observational and retrospective study that included diagnosed cases of acute poisoning in patients over 14 years old treated in the ED of a tertiary hospital. Demographic variables, type of toxic substances, and cause of poisoning were collected, along with 19 QIs and patient outcomes, with the main outcome variable being the degree of compliance with the QIs. Results: A total of 1144 cases were recorded, with 10.4% (n = 119) being patients 65 years and older. Patients 65 years and older were more likely to be female (72.8% vs. 60.9%; p = 0.015), experience more accidental poisonings (37.6% vs. 25.7%; p = 0.006), and fewer intentional poisonings (35.0% vs. 49.6%; p = 0.003). There were fewer cases of alcohol poisoning (5% vs. 17.8%; p < 0.001), and no cases of illegal drug poisoning (p < 0.001) in this age group. Most QIs showed a high degree of compliance (>85%) in both patients 65 years and older and rest of adults. However, there were differences in the indication of oxygen therapy in cases of carbon monoxide poisoning (64.2% vs. 40.9%; p = 0.005). Conclusions: The epidemiological profile of poisoning in patients 65 years and older differs from that of adult patients, with a similar degree of compliance with QIs. Based on the results obtained, there does not appear to be significant differences in the management of poisoned patients based on their age. © 2023 Elsevier España, S.L.U. and Sociedad Española de Medicina Interna (SEMI)",Not About Sufficiency
Climate and energy politics in Poland: Debating carbon dioxide and shale gas,"limate and Energy Politics in Poland: Debating Carbon Dioxide and Shale Gas presents a new, object-oriented perspective on the challenge faced by Poland, the largest post-socialist EU member state from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), to produce knowledge about its energy system in the context of climate change. Drawing on data from five different research projects and two hundred interviews, Lis reflects on how EU accession forced Poland to mobilize their resources and produce expertise on carbon dioxide and shale gas, in order to actively participate in the debates around EU climate change ambitions and goals. A significant lack of capacity and expert institutions made it difficult for Poland to quickly assess the impacts of EU legislation or to propose new solutions for itself, and it is precisely this struggle for knowledge production that will be examined during the course of the book.

"Tuning the interactions among Ce, Pd and Rh over Ce-modified Pd-Rh three-way catalyst for exhaust treatment of natural gas vehicles","Three Ce-modified Pd-Rh bimetallic catalysts for exhaust purification of natural gas vehicles (NGVs) under stoichiometric conditions were prepared by deposition-precipitation (DP), stepwise impregnation (SI) and co-impregnation (CI) methods, respectively. It demonstrated that before and after aging the catalyst prepared by DP technique displayed much higher activity for the conversions of CH4 and NO than the other two catalysts, especially at high temperatures (about 410-550 °C). X-ray diffraction, CO-chemisorption, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyzes demonstrated that there were smaller CeO2 particles, higher metal dispersion, stronger reducibility and more surface metallic Pd species over the catalyst prepared by DP method. This might be due to the stronger Pd-Ce but weaker Pd-Rh interactions over the catalyst prepared by DP mean. Moreover, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy of CO adsorption analysis implied that the electronic structures of Pd in the three catalysts were different, which may be also induced by the different interactions among Rh, Ce and Pd in these catalysts. The results indicated that the performance of Pd-Rh three-way catalyst for NGVs exhaust purification can be enhanced by modulating the interactions of Pd-Rh and Pd-Ce. Our work may provide a new strategy for the preparation of three-way catalyst with high efficiency for NGVs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Treatment of synthetic zinc and nickel wastewater and identification of its crystallization products by fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization technology,"Heavy metals such as zinc and nickel can be found in wastewater from steel electroplating trace concentrations. These heavy metals harm the ecosystem and human health, which must be addressed.

"Government subsidy, asymmetric information and green innovation","Purpose: The presence of asymmetric information exists between firms and the government about the firms' green innovation; this may lead to the firm's moral hazard problem of misusing the government subsidy on the green innovation. Such a problem is not fully considered by the existing literature. The purpose of this study is to explore how government subsidy affects green innovation when the information of firms' innovation cannot be completed observed, and figure out the mechanisms that can alleviate the negative impact of information asymmetry, which helps to explain the factors that motivate the firms to actively engage into the green innovation with the government subsidy. Design/methodology/approach: In a theoretical model under imperfect information in which the firm's activity on green innovation may not be fully observed, the firm could be either altruistic or not; an altruistic firm has stronger incentive to engage into corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities such as green innovation. With the presence of asymmetric information, the authors analyze the possibility of a firm's moral hazard and try to find out the condition on the information quality that can avoid such problem. To examine the results of theoretical analysis, the authors use the data of Chinese listed companies in a corresponding empirical analysis. On the basis of both theoretical and empirical the authors try to figure out the effect of the government subsidy on the green innovation by enterprise and the role of firm's characteristics of social responsibility and information quality in the green innovation with the government subsidy. Findings: The results show that the government subsidy can promote the firm's green innovation, especially for those that are more socially responsible. The asymmetric information, however, leads to inefficiency on the green innovation. This is because that the low-quality information about the firm's behavior raises the possibility of a moral hazard. Moreover, the analyst coverage could be an efficient way to improve the quality of information, alleviating the moral hazard problem of the firm's green innovation. The main contribution is to fill the gap in the study of the government subsidy on green innovation under asymmetric information and to provide the mechanism to improve the efficiency of the subsidy to motivate green innovation by enterprise. Practical implications: A crucial implication to policymakers is to complete and improve the system of information in the market, which can form an efficient incentive compatibility between the enterprises and the public. Such incentive compatibility can attract the enterprises to better use the government subsidy into green innovation and receive a long-run return from the public's positive feedback for their contribution on the social good. Originality/value: Existing studies are concerned about antecedents of green innovation do not completely focus on the relationship between government subsidy and green innovation. The present paper considers that information asymmetry between the government and firms may affect the impact of government subsidy on the firms' green innovation. This conjecture is studied by the theoretical model and verified by an empirical analysis using the data of Chinese listed companies. Additionally, the empirical analysis explores the moderating effect of CSR characteristics of firms, and the analyst coverage can positively affect the promotion of the government subsidy on the firms' green innovation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Water resource recovery facilities as potential energy generation units and their dynamic economic dispatch,"The dynamic nature of wastewater treatment and the significant number of energy conversion and recovery technologies applicable to the process, require a modelling framework that can be used for optimization and planning. This paper introduces a dynamic energy dispatch optimization framework with a combination of energy recovery and reserve options for water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs). Energy potentials, including biogas, electricity, and heat, were assessed for 15 large-scale WRRFs, which serve approximately 80% of the Irish population. The framework was applied by simulation of the national electrical system on an hourly basis for 2030 using mixed-integer programming (MIP) for eight scenarios. The simulation enabled automatic operational command scheduling for the production, conversion, storage, and supply over a year at an hourly time resolution. Meanwhile, the significance of several energy resources was assessed, and the impact of dynamic energy dispatch examined. A total potential cost saving of €46.35 M was possible through implementation of dynamic economic dispatch optimization (54% from biogas cogeneration, 40 %from thermal energy recovery, and 6% from micro-hydropower electricity). In addition, reductions in carbon emissions (2%), fossil fuel consumption (3%), startup costs (18%) and outsourcing dependency (5%) were possible. Up to 0.5% of whole system power demand and 90% of considered heat demand at peak periods could be provided by the proposed framework through dynamic economic dispatch. Therefore, this study suggests that WRRFs can participate into energy system through the dynamic economic dispatch of recovered energy, and provide potential energy flexibility, as well as adding value to overall sustainability of energy system. © 2022 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Dynamics of global dryland vegetation were more sensitive to soil moisture: Evidence from multiple vegetation indices,"The prominent role of drylands in the global ecosystem calls for a deeper understanding of the responses of dryland vegetation to ongoing environmental drivers in the context of global climate change. Here, we first investigated the spatial and temporal trends of global dryland vegetation based on multiple satellite- and model-based indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), vegetation optical depth (VOD), and gross primary productivity (GPP) during 1988–2018. Then, the impacts of a set of environmental drivers (i.e. mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), soil moisture (SM), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)) on vegetation dynamics were quantified using partial correlation analysis and structural equation model. All four indices increased strongly before 2000 but slowed afterward. The variation in dryland vegetation was more related to SM anomaly in comparison with other environmental drivers. The variation induced by SM was amplified by high VOD in some continents. Furthermore, MAT contributed similarly as SM to vegetation dynamics in North America. The four vegetation indices exhibited divergent responses to environmental drivers due to their characteristics. At the continental scale, NDVI was only relevant to variation in VPD in North America. In contrast to NDVI, LAI, and VOD, GPP was more closely associated with the variation in SM and VPD. Roughly half of the GPP variation was attributable to the combination of SM and MAT in North America and Australia, whereas they have low predictive power (∼30%) in Eurasia, Africa, and South America. SM was closely linked to the vegetation changes in grasslands and shrublands; however, this impact varied among the continents. Our results advance the current understanding of dryland vegetation dynamics and shed new light on improving dryland carbon flux simulation by fully considering the role of soil moisture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
HOW WILL RURAL HOUSES GO GREEN? EXPLORING INFLUENCING FACTORS OF VILLAGERS’ PARTICIPATION IN GREEN HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IN RURAL COMMUNITIES,"Traditional rural houses are characterized by high energy consumption, low energy efficiency, waste of energy resources, and high carbon emissions, which are detrimen-tal to China’s energy consumption as well as to the environment. It is therefore important to promote green rural housing construction. However, rural villagers’ low level of participation has led to a dearth of successfully implemented green rural housing projects, a situation that a lack of relevant research has no doubt contributed to. This paper therefore studies the factors influencing villagers’ participation in green rural housing projects based on Bourdieu’s theory of practice. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted in Yancheng, China, and descriptive analysis, analysis of variance and multivariate ordered logistic regression analysis were performed to understand the participation behavior of villagers and influencing factors of villagers’ participation in green rural housing construction. Results indicate that participation of the surveyed villagers is generally not high, and most villagers participated superficially. No differences were detected in villagers’ total participation in terms of gender, leisure time, housing type, government propaganda, government management, and government role orientation. Moreover, social network, social economy, construction cost, interest appeals, attention to current affairs, awareness of green environmental protection and total family population are found to affect villagers’ total participation. The findings will help the government devise measures to encourage villagers to actively participate in the construction of green rural housing, and thereby realize the goal of low carbon sustainable development of rural communities. © 2023, College Publishing.

Can the energy transition drive economic development? Empirical analysis of China's provincial panel data,"With the rise of global environmental awareness and increasing concern about the impacts of climate change, the energy transition has become a pressing issue worldwide. However, in existing studies, the conclusions on the impact of the energy transition on economic development are not consistent. Given these discrepancies and the complexity of the influencing factors in the process of energy transition, the study of the relationship between energy transition and economic development has important theoretical and practical significance for energy policy and economic planning in China and globally. By utilizing provincial panel data from 2000 to 2019 in China and constructing an econometric model, this study empirically examines the influence of the energy transition on economic development. The results show that the energy transition is beneficial for China's economic development. Furthermore, regional heterogeneity significantly stimulates economic development through the upgrading of industrial structure, technological innovation, and environmental regulation. This study provides important empirical evidence and a quantitative basis for actively and steadily promoting the energy transition while considering economic growth. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Research Progress of Cartography Highlighted by the 31st International Cartographic Conference,"The 31st International Cartography Conference (ICC) was held in Cape Town, South Africa from August 13 to August 18 in 2023. This paper first introduced the overview of the 31st ICC, the participation of Chinese experts and enterprise. Secondly, based on the technical reports during the ICC2023, new research hotspots of cartography were analyzed and summarized from eight aspects including the basic theory of cartography and technologies of cartography, map data, map products, and Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) construction, public applications, sustainable development applications and historical and cultural ethics. We concluded some obvious hotspots that the traditional mapping fields have paid more attention to multi-element fusion mapping, user and scenario experience enhancement and rapid mapping capabilities; On the other hand, the emerging geographical information fields have focused on multi-modal ubiquitous sensing, big data fusion processing, artificial intelligence analysis, knowledge construction and services which have been deepened continuously; In addition, government agencies, scientific research institutions, industrial enterprises across the world have continuous passion on global, regional, national and urban sustainable development cartographic applications for resource management, ecological protection, social development. Subsequently, the new characteristics of map visualization methods from the award-winning maps were explored as well which incorporate more modern elements and cultural imprints, and emphasize people-map interaction. Afterwards, in the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the development trend of theoretical systems, technical methods and application services for cartography in the next few years are discussed. That is, the theoretical system of cartography becomes more professional and refined. In the era of artificial intelligence, the technical content of cartography becomes more knowledgeable. Cartography application services become more ubiquitous driven by big data. Cartography plays a more profound role in supporting the sustainable development of the United Nations. In the last place, some suggestions were put forward for the development of the cartography discipline in China. For example, in the future, we must make full use of the ICA international platform to continuously establish and improve a new theoretical system of cartography in the intelligent era, break through the key core technologies of cartography, and promote the high-quality development of cartography in our country with a global perspective. Meanwhile, we should pay more attention to the international frontier developments in important and emerging research fields such as geospatial data fusion, knowledge construction, spatial analysis, ubiquitous mapping, geographic intelligence, and data quality, and strengthen scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation between relevant domestic and foreign research institutions. A more proactive and proactive opening-up strategy should be implemented to promote the continuous improvement of the international influence of cartography research. © 2024 Science Press.

Leveraging Environmental Regulation: How Green Innovation Moderates the Relationship Between Carbon Information Disclosure and Firm Value,"As global concerns over climate change intensify, carbon information disclosure has emerged as a critical factor influencing firm value. However, the relationship between carbon information disclosure and firm value remains inconclusive in the existing literature, particularly within the context of China’s evolving environmental policies. This study investigates the impact of carbon information disclosure on firm value while examining the moderating role of green innovation and the moderating moderated effect of environmental regulation. Drawing on stakeholder theory, resource-based theory, and institutional theory, this study constructs a comprehensive research framework and employs panel data regression analysis on a sample of 1753 firm ten-year observations from A-share listed companies in China between 2013 and 2022. The results reveal that carbon information disclosure significantly enhances firm value, and green innovation positively moderates this relationship. Furthermore, environmental regulation strengthens the moderating effect of green innovation, acting as a leverage effect that amplifies the financial benefits of carbon information disclosure. These findings highlight the importance of integrating regulatory policies with corporate sustainability strategies. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the synergistic effects of carbon information disclosure, green innovation, and environmental regulation, offering insights for sustainable corporate development. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Investigating the impact of tropical deforestation on Indian monsoon hydro-climate: a novel study using a regional climate model,"This study uses a state-of-the-art regional climate model (RCM) to examine how tropical deforestation affects the meteorology of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). Incorporating insights from existing research on deforestation by climate scientists, alongside evidence of environmental deterioration in semi-arid, hilly and tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this research seeks to elucidate the critical influence of anthropogenic reasons of climate change on the hydroclimate of ISM. Employing “tropical deforestation” design experiments with the ICTP-RegCMv4.4.5.10 RCM the study evaluates the effects on meteorological parameters including precipitation, circulation patterns and surface parameters. This experimental design entails substituting vegetation type in the land use map of RegCMv4.4.5.10 model, such as deciduous and evergreen trees in Southeast Asia with “short grass” to mimic tropical deforestation. Findings reveal that deforestation induces abnormal anti-cyclonic circulation over eastern India curtails moisture advection, diminishing latent heat flux and moisture transport, leads to a decrease in precipitation compared to control experiment scenario. Alterations in albedo and vegetation roughness length attributable to deforestation impact temperature, humidity, precipitation, consequently exacerbating drought and heatwave occurrences. Additionally, the study also explores deforestation-induced feedback on ISM precipitation variability. The study concludes that deforestation substantially alters land-surface characteristics, water and energy cycle, and atmospheric circulation, thereby influencing regional climate dynamics. These findings offer foundational insights into comprehending land-use and land-cover changes and their implications for climate change adaptation strategies. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Prospects of crambe for the bioeconomy of the Swabian Alb in southwest Germany,"Crambe (Crambe abyssinica Hochst. ex R.E.Fr.) is a drought-tolerant, non-edible annual oil crop with low fertilization needs, and there are compelling opportunities for crambe to capitalize on market growth in natural cosmetics and the regional sustainability. It is therefore proposed for cleaner biomass production on marginal land, and the development of novel value chains and webs in rural areas. Therefore, this study assesses the prospects for growing and processing crambe in the Swabian Alb, a rural area in southwestern Germany large parts of which are characterized by marginal shallow stony soil. A literature review, stakeholder questionnaires, and a SWOT analysis were used to assess crambe's potential in the region. This informed a locally adapted value web, which combines multiple value chains and stakeholders into one interlinked diagram showing present potential valorization opportunities for crambe in the region. However, it was found that it is not currently possible to implement a value web for crambe in the Swabian Alb. Instead, a single value chain involving farmers, cosmetics companies, and biogas plants is possible. To expand this value chain opportunity into a value web, more information is needed for all stakeholders. European Innovation Action projects could help by providing more information about crambe cultivation and by ensuring ecologic and social sustainability. Economic sustainability, however, will require the involvement of other stakeholders in the value web, so that supply matches demand. Local institutions and networks can share knowledge to grow the currently possible value chain into a broader value web. This approach could also be used in other regions to assess the sustainability of novel biobased value chains across social, economic, and environmental dimensions. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the economic crisis from a transition management perspective,"This article explores the current economic crisis from a transition management perspective. We argue that it is a symptom of underlying persistent unsustainability in socio-economic systems which may result in profound systemic changes, i.e. transitions. Dominant regime responses to the economic crisis so far seem to focus primarily on restoring the old equilibrium. Adopting a transition management perspective, we argue that we can see the economic crisis as an accelerator in a process of fundamental systemic change and need to identify options to increase the chance that it will lead to sustainability. We note that general patterns and mechanisms can be identified in distinct transition domains (currencies, resources and governance) that enable and help scale-up sustainability alternatives. Transition management research and practice should focus on identifying and providing the necessary generic-'glocal governance'-conditions under which the unsustainable regimes are discouraged and emerging sustainability transitions accelerated. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Transformative innovation and translocal diffusion,"This paper develops a conceptual understanding of transformative innovations as shared activities, ideas and objects across locally rooted sustainability initiatives that explore and develop alternatives to incumbent and (perceived) unsustainable regimes that they seek to challenge, alter or replace. We synthesize empirical work from two European research projects (TRANSIT and ARTS), in which initiatives and networks were empirically studied, to develop a broader conceptual understanding of the emergence of transformative innovation. The development of initiatives can occur through growing, replicating, partnering, instrumentalising and embedding. This is supported through translocal networks that connect initiatives by sharing ideas, objects and activities across local contexts. This translocal characteristic of transformative innovations harnesses an enormous potential for sustainability transitions, but requires further understanding as well as governance support. The perspective we present provides a conceptual starting point to further explore the development and diffusion of transformative innovation as well as transition governance strategies. © 2020 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
How a transformation towards sustainable community catering can succeed,"Community catering or to use another common term especially in the American literature institutional foodservice plays a central role in changing our food system towards sustainability. Community catering establishments can bring about changes in this context at various levels. Hence, in the context of menu planning, they have a direct influence on the level of meat consumption. Indirectly, however, they can also support changes in eating habits by offering the guest an equally attractive alternative, thus giving him or her a sense of how tasty a low-meat cuisine can be. On the basis of this experience, the consumer may possibly change in turn his or her own purchasing behavior and menu planning at home. With the increasing importance of catering for day-care centers and schools, community catering also has a considerable influence on the nutritional status as well as on the development of people's individual diet and the later eating habits of young people. By understanding socio-technical systems as embedded in ecological systems this paper takes a systemic view on innovations in transformation domains as the objects of desire for governance towards sustainability. The framework developed in the context of the BMBF-funded research project ""Governance model for socio-ecological transformation processes in practice: development and testing in three areas of application"" known by its acronym TRAFO 3.0 was applied to examine innovative approaches and actors in community catering and their contributions to more sustainable food systems. A number of studies show that a very large environmental relief potential can be achieved by reducing the quantity of meat and other animal products offered. However, the concrete implementation of this goal is associated with a multitude of challenges, since meat-containing meals are an important part of German food culture. How the transformation towards meals with fewer animal products in German community catering can succeed is an important question in the context of the transformation to sustainable food systems. To answer this question, we analyzed the status quo of the socio-technical system of German community catering using a developed governance model. One of the central results was that community catering stakeholders who have successfully reduced their offer of animal products died fundamental changes in meal planning. Cooks had to ""reinvent"" meals completely to be successful. © 2019 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Land use determines Mediterranean ecosystems' multifunctionality more than plant richness or habitat composition,"Local and landscape diversity loss, habitat fragmentation and land-use changes commonly co-occur and impair ecosystem multifunctionality, yet they are often studied in isolation. Therefore, we ignore the relative importance of these drivers of ecosystem change or whether or not they interact to determine ecosystem functioning. We measured how changes in local (plant richness) and landscape (different land uses) diversity, land use (orchards, shrubland, pine, oak and mixed forests) and habitat sise, and their interactions, affected the functioning of Mediterranean ecosystems. At 49 plots, we measured 17 above- and below-ground functions, related to nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration and biotic interactions. Additionally, we generated different combinations of plots to compose artificial landscapes where multifunctionality and biodiversity conservation can be maximised, in order to aid land managers to preserve or design functional and diverse areas. The relative importance of local and landscape attributes varied slightly depending on the target function, yet land use was by far the strongest predictor of most functions and multifunctionality above local plant biodiversity, habitat sise or landscape diversity. Oak and mixed forest were the most multifunctional land uses but were functionally wcomplemented by other land uses that maximised some individual functions. The relative proportion of each land use within optimal landscapes varied if the target was biodiversity conservation (with an even dominance of land uses), carbon stocks or multifunctionality (highly dominated by native oak and mixed forests). Synthesis and applications: Our results highlight the importance of remnant native forest to provide multiple ecosystem functions and the potential to restore them and complement these uses with sustainable agriculture. By merging landscape and ecosystem approaches we provide specific numbers regarding the proportion that each land use should have in order to maximise biodiversity conservation and/or functioning in these charismatic environments. © 2024 The Authors.

Application of Dynamic Programming Models for Improvement of Technological Approaches to Combat Negative Water Leakage in the Underground Space,"The article solves an urgent problem, which is to develop a new approach to finding solutions to improve technological methods to combat negative water leakage in underround spaces. We propose the use of dynamic programming methods to select the optimal technology to secure such spaces. In accordance with the algorithm proposed in this paper, the problem was broken into a number of stages. At each stage, an optimal solution was sought (organisation of transport, delivery of materials to the destination, selection of materials, etc.). Thus, we applied a decomposition approach that allowed us to take into account the variety of parameters that affect the efficiency of the process. All these stages and their corresponding technological solutions were formalised by building network models. In these network models, vertices corresponded to solutions, and the distances between vertices (edges) corresponded to the value of the optimisation parameter. Thus, the shortest route from the initial to the final vertex corresponded to the optimal technological solution to combat negative water leakage in underground spaces. Based on the systematisation of data on technologies to combat water inflow into underground spaces, basic and refined models were developed. These models allowed us to take into account the risks associated with water breakthroughs into underground spaces. To minimise the risks, additional measures to combat water inflows are envisaged. In the practical part of this study, the results of the selection of a method with which to control water inflows are presented. This method involves the use of anchoring to reduce water filtration. According to the results of field observations, no water breakthroughs into the underground space were recorded. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Cycle route uptake and scenario estimation (CRUSE): an approach for developing strategic cycle network planning tools,"This paper describes an approach for developing strategic cycle network planning tools. Based on our experience developing and deploying the Cycle Route Uptake and Scenario Estimation (CRUSE) Tool for Ireland, we outline the underlying methods, including disaggregation of origin–destination data with the open source ‘odjitter’ software, incorporation of additional trip purposes, routing, scenario generation, and development of an intuitive user interface that is tested and used by practitioners. Commissioned by the national infrastructure agency Transport Infrastructure Ireland, CRUSE provides estimates of current and potential future cycling levels under ‘snapshot’ scenarios to inform investment decisions. The publicly available results at https://cruse.bike/ enable planners, engineers, and other stakeholders to make more evidence-based decisions. CRUSE goes beyond previous work by: modeling networks at high spatial resolution; simulating multiple trip purposes (social, shopping, personal utility, recreational, and cycle touring), supplementing official origin–destination datasets on travel for work and education; and providing estimates of ‘quietness’ (a proxy for cyclist comfort and route preference) at the route segment level. Three network types—‘Fastest’, ‘Balanced’, and ‘Quietest’—help plan both arterial and residential cycle networks. Workshops with stakeholders were used to inform the development of the tool. Feedback shows that the tool has a wide range of uses and is already being used in practice to inform urban, inter-urban, and rural cycle network designs. The approach is flexible and open source, allowing the underlying ideas and code to be adapted, supporting more evidence-based and effective cycling policies and interventions internationally. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Rickettsia asembonensis Isolated from Four Human Cases with Acute Undifferentiated Febrile Illness in Peru,"Rickettsioses, often underreported, pose public health challenges. Rickettsia asembonensis is a potential emerging pathogen that was previously detected in humans, animals, and a variety of arthropods. While its pathogenicity in humans remains unclear, it poses a potential public health threat. Here, we present an extended epidemiological, diagnostic, and genetic analysis of the information provided in a preliminary report on the investigation of rickettsiae in Peru. In particular, we report the detection of R. asembonensis in blood specimens collected from four human patients with an acute undifferentiated fever of a seven- to nine-day duration, all of whom tested negative for other vector-borne pathogens. Additionally, we describe the replicative capacity of the R. asembonensis isolates in cell cultures. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Living with Fire: Agricultural Burning by Quechua Farmers in the Peruvian Andes,"Fire is an essential tool enabling tropical subsistence agriculture, but can result in escaped fires when not adequately controlled. We employed agricultural calendars, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews with over 60 farmers over four months of fieldwork to evaluate how agricultural burning is currently conducted in the Peruvian Andes. We found that Quechua farmers use fire for clearing agricultural residue, controlling weeds and shrubs, and preparing new or fallow parcels, with most burns set during the dry season. Quechua farmers employ control burning techniques that reflect an understanding of how fire behavior is influenced by fuel, topography, and weather conditions, a knowledge that aligns closely with Western use of prescribed and controlled burns. We also observed a high incidence of escaped fires, although most were controlled within an hour, and very few required community-wide intervention to extinguish. Our findings have significant policy implications for the safe and effective use of fire in rural agricultural landscapes. Rather than solely impose fire suppression, governments could facilitate access to modern wildfire risk indices and provide technical assistance for controlled burns, compatible with farmers’ existing knowledge of factors influencing fire behavior. These recommendations are part of a worldwide call for collaborative fire management solutions that are reasonable and applicable in diverse settings in the Global South. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

Measurements reveal that air change rates in the squad rooms of the institutions is so low in relation to the present number of occupiers that carbon dioxide values of 0.3-0.4 volumes percent may occur. These values, which were measured with numbers of occupiers which were much less than the anticipated group size, are unacceptably high from a public health point of view.

An evaluation of influencing factors and public attitudes for the adoption of biogas system in rural communities to overcome energy crisis: A case study of Pakistan,"Energy is the backbone of a country's economy and development. The potential contribution of renewable energy technology to energy stability, climate change mitigation and economic growth is immense. Biogas, is a renewable energy resource and enriched with methane, produced through the breakdown of organic matters (anaerobically). The large quantity of livestock has significant contributions in Pakistan's economy, and also having a high potential for production of biogas. Therefore, this study was conducted in 6 southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, to identify the expected willingness of households for adopting any biogas system. A sum of 360 households (livestock-farmers) was selected for data collection by the procedure of equal allocation. The identification of the influencing factors on the household's willingness to adopt any biogas system was determined through probit analysis. It has been validated from the research outcomes of probit analysis that the selected household's qualification, electricity shortfall on daily basis and its impact on children's education and female work, awareness of the selected household's about the biogas utilization and its benefits as well as the availability of space have demonstrated their significance and relationship with the household's willingness to adopt biogas system. The overall model is statistically significant at 1% significance level and confirmed the impact of socioeconomic features as the prominent factors for the household's decision to adopt a biogas system. This study suggests the public awareness, which has more significant impact on identifying the household's adoption behavior. Similarly, adequate investments both at the private and public level, should be encouraged for promoting biogas technology. At the same time, the government's fiscal policy should be subsidized which will encourage the lower-income populations' participation in adopting and installing biogas plants. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Historical and comparative overview of sponge campus construction and future challenges,"Frequent urban flooding has caused great economic losses and casualties worldwide. Sponge cities have attracted attention as an important means of flood control and disaster reduction. This paper systematically and comprehensively analyzes the development of sponge campuses in China and other countries and compares classic examples of sponge campus construction. We identify the following issues in sponge campus construction: lack of appropriate numerical simulation model, low public engagement and support of sponge campuses, and a lack of standardized guidance for sponge campus construction. Based on the in-depth analysis of successful examples of sponge campus construction in developed countries, and combined with consideration of China's economic development, geographical location, and urbanization level, we suggest the future development direction of sponge campus: the development of local sponge campus models; popularization of sponge theory; improvement to public participation and experience; improve the financial system of sponge campus; and standardization of guidance for sponge campus construction and maintenance. This paper expounds on the necessity of sponge campus construction and further improves the theoretical system of sponge campuses. These results can provide theoretical support and reference for the construction or transformation of sponge campuses in colleges and universities and then promote further development of sponge campuses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Will Limiting Agricultural Carbon Emissions Affect China’s Agricultural Economy? Panel Data from 31 Provinces in China,"The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of agricultural carbon emissions on China’s agricultural economic development, which is of great significance to the modernization of China’s agricultural sector. Based on the panel data of 31 provinces in China from 2019 to 2022, this paper selected 10 carbon emission-related indicators and comprehensively adopted a pooled regression model, a fixed effect model, and a random effect model to evaluate the impact. It also passes the Hausman test and Tobit model stability test. The results show that limiting agricultural carbon emissions in China has a significant impact on agricultural economic development; the total power of agricultural machinery (TPAM), rural electricity consumption (REC), amount of agricultural chemical fertilizer applied (AACF), and amount of plastic film used in agriculture (APF) have a significant positive impact on the output of agricultural economy (OAE), while cultivated land (CA) has no significant impact. Chinese agriculture is currently on the left side of the inverted “U” shape of the environmental Kuznets curve. Therefore, there is a need for more research and development of agricultural biotechnology and agricultural policy support to strengthen farmers’ knowledge of how to reduce carbon emissions using the above indicators, which can promote agricultural economic growth and achieve high-quality agricultural development in China. © 2025, HARD Publishing Company.

One Health in Practice: Using Integrated Bite Case Management to Increase Detection of Rabid Animals in Tanzania,"Rabies is a neglected zoonotic disease that causes an estimated 59,000 human deaths worldwide annually, mostly in Africa and Asia. A target of zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies has been set for 2030, and large-scale control programs are now advocated. However, in most low-income endemic countries surveillance to guide rabies control is weak and few cases of rabies are recorded. There is an urgent need to enhance surveillance to improve timely case detection and inform rabies control and prevention, by operationalizing a “One Health” approach. Here we present data from a study piloting Integrated Bite Case Management (IBCM) to support intersectoral collaboration between health and veterinary workers in Tanzania. We trained government staff to implement IBCM, comprising risk assessments of bite patients by health workers, investigations by livestock field officers to diagnose rabid animals, and use of a mobile phone application to support integration. IBCM was introduced across 20 districts in four regions of Tanzania and results reported after 1 year of implementation. Numbers of bite patient presentations to health facilities varied across regions, but following the introduction of IBCM reporting of bite patients at high-risk for rabies more than doubled in all regions. Over 800 high-risk investigations were carried out, with 49% assessed as probable dog rabies cases on the basis of clinical signs, animal outcome, and rapid diagnostic testing. The status of a further 20% of biting animals could not be determined but rabies could not be ruled out. Livestock field officers reported that use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were useful for confirming rabies occurrence. Overall, our study provides further evidence that IBCM is a practical approach that can improve rabies detection in endemic countries, and be used to monitor the impact of mass dog vaccinations, including potential to verify rabies freedom. However, the main challenges to implementation are limited training of health workers in rabies, perceived burden of real-time recording and limited resources for livestock field officers to undertake investigations. Nonetheless, IBCM dramatically improved case detection and communication between sectors and we recommend further implementation research to establish best practice and applicability to other settings. © Copyright © 2020 Lushasi, Steenson, Bernard, Changalucha, Govella, Haydon, Hoffu, Lankester, Magoti, Mpolya, Mtema, Nonga and Hampson.",Not About Sufficiency
"An introduction to key ecological concepts, financial opportunities, and risks underpinning aspirations for nature positive","Global biodiversity is in decline, and businesses and society are being required to urgently create new operating models to ameliorate the crisis. Among the strategies proposed to do this, implementing the concept of nature positive has captured worldwide attention. Critical to its success will be effective collaboration between ecologists and businesspeople, driven by a shared understanding of key nature positive terminology, concepts, and risks. To this end, we introduce three core aspects: the ecological concepts in the definition of nature positive (health, abundance, diversity, and resilience), a typology of financial instruments that may be applied to achieving nature positive, and an overview of risks to biodiversity and society. The pivotal findings include that ecological complexity and uncertainty belie the simplicity of the definition of nature positive and that managing risk requires embedding aspirations into existing and emerging biodiversity conservation and restoration science and policy. Although it is challenging, nature positive deserves pursuit. © The Author(s) 2024.

Working at the boundary: Facilitating interdisciplinarity in climate change adaptation research,"Efforts are being made to develop new paradigms for climate change adaptation policy at both the national and the international levels. However, progress in vulnerability and adaptation research has not been matched by advancement on practical policy initiatives. The complexity of the challenge to develop methods and means to support adaptation to climate change necessitates a diversity of approaches. This diversity is healthy, and yet it is possible to define some key characteristics and tools that can promote practical outcomes. In this paper, some methodologies that have proved successful are reviewed. These include a mapping of contextual circumstances, an appreciation for multiple perspectives, and the importance of a ""boundary object"" in forging strong interactions among project participants. Further, a toolkit of approaches for natural scientists is presented. This toolkit can be used to organize work in collaboration with stakeholders and other participants and can help overcome barriers to a meaningful contribution to the policy process. Fundamentally, this challenge will require approaches that are more grounded in meaning, narration, and reflection. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Climate Change-Temperature-Crime Hypothesis: Evidence from a Sample of 15 Large US Cities, 2002 to 2015","Drawing on prior studies, green criminologists have hypothesized that climate change will both raise the mean temperature and the level of crime. We call this the “climate change-temperature-crime hypothesis” (“CC-T-C”). This hypothesis is an extension of research performed on temperature and crime at the individual level. Other research explores this relationship by testing for the relationship between seasonality and crime within a given period of time (i.e., within years). Climate change, however, produces small changes in temperature over long periods of time, and in this view, the effect of climate change on crime should be assessed across and not within years. In addition, prior CC-T-C studies sometimes employ large geographic aggregations (e.g., the entire whole United States), which masks the CC-T-C association that appears at lower levels of aggregation. Moreover, globally, crime has declined across nations since the early 1990s, during a period of rising mean global temperatures, suggesting that the CC-T-C hypothesis does not fit the general trends in temperature and crime over time. Addressing these issues, the present study assesses the CC-T-C relationship for a sample of 15 large (N = 15) US cities over a 14-year period. Given the CC-T-C hypothesis parameters, we assessed this relationship using correlations between individual crime and temperature trends for each city. Crime trends were measured by both the number and rate of eight Uniform Crime Report (UCR) Part I crimes, so that for each city, there are 16 crime-temperature correlations. Using a liberal p value (p =.10), the temperature-crime correlations were rejected as insignificant in 220 of the 234 tests (94%).

Competing claims on the use of nature, increasing regulation of land use and recreational activities, and the conflicting goals between conservation and development have led to a rise in conflicts in the designation and management of protected areas. How to effectively manage and resolve these conflicts has become a challenge for both legislators and managers. By adopting an institutional dimension in legal interpretation, this book critically examines how such conflicts are dealt with in the legal regimes of the US and China while exploring interactions between legislatures, agencies and courts. The book searches for a plausible solution to improve the legal framework of protected areas in China by emulating pertinent mechanisms developed in the US, whilst also presenting legal and policy recommendations to the US. This informative book will be useful for legal scholars in Chinese law, nature conservation law, administrative law and comparative law. © 2016 Yun Ma.",Not About Sufficiency
Forests and Forestry in Support of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): A Bibliometric Analysis,"To address the world's ongoing environmental challenges, 193 countries have committed to 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) concerning the economy, society, and the environment. However, there are gaps in our understanding of forests and forestry support SDGs. Through a systematized review, we identified which SDGs are relevant to forests and forestry at the target level, along with their interactions (synergies or tradeoffs). In addition, a bibliometric analysis of 377 papers was conducted worldwide between 2015 and 2020, to elucidate the status and development trends of SDG research related to forests and forestry in this study. The research results show that: (1) 11 SDGs and 19 targets are related to forests and forestry, and 47 are interactions between SDG15 and other targets, including 35 synergy effects and 12 tradeoff effects. (2) The USA is the highest publication output country, while the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the highest publication output institution, and Jianguo Liu of the University of Michigan is the highest publication output author. (3) The keyword co-occurrence analysis results show that the research hotspots mainly focused on the impacts of and responses to climate change, biodiversity conservation, land resource protection and management, remote sensing, the impacts of deforestation, and the promotion of sustainable development through governance. (4) The co-citation results reveal the existence of nine research themes: human well-being, food security, land use, land productivity, land tenure, tree loss, simulation models, criteria, and resilience.",Not About Sufficiency

Discussion on the Relationship between Environmental Regulation and Green Technology Innovation from the Perspective of Innovation External Cooperation: Evidence from Chinese Private Enterprises,"A number of studies have confirmed the Porter hypothesis that moderate environmental regulation can facilitate the adoption of green technology innovation strategies by cooperatives. However, the existing research has not clearly analyzed the paths of environmental regulation affecting green technology innovation and how internal factors act on the transmission path. To this end, this paper empirically examines the relationship between environmental regulation and enterprises’ green technology innovation from a collaborative innovation perspective, using data from the 13th Private Enterprise Survey in China as the sample. The findings show that: (1) the intensity of environmental regulation set by the Chinese government does promote enterprises’ green technological innovation, and this result will not change due to the difference between green process innovation and green product innovation; (2) under the constraints of environmental regulation, the allocation of resources through the mode of cooperative innovation to promote green technology innovation is an important transmission path, that is, cooperative innovation is an important mediating variable between environmental regulation and enterprises’ green technology innovation; (3) the management structure of enterprises can positively moderate the relationship between environmental regulation and collaborative innovation, i.e., the more managers, the more significant the influence of environmental regulation on collaborative innovation; (4) the stronger the social responsibility of enterprises, the more likely it is that the innovation resources obtained through collaborative forms will be allocated towards green technology innovation. However, such a moderating effect only exists in two types of cooperation: collaborative R&D and commissioned research. This research tells us that while environmental regulations continue to be strengthened, it is necessary to create an environment conducive to collaborative innovation but also to pay attention to the need for joint decision making and increase corporate social responsibility. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The Power of Responsibility: Unlocking the Potential of CSR in Hospitality’s Fight against Food Waste,"This research focuses on the significant role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in shaping employees’ behavior towards the reduction of food waste in the hospitality industry that has been under scrutiny for its environmental impact. The study aimed at understanding how CSR, coupled with employees’ moral attitudes, admiration for their organization, and climate change awareness influences sustainable practices by realizing the complex interplay between company initiatives and personal psychology. The participants were staff members who worked in several hotels in China where there were active CSR programs. Using established scales, we collected 422 valid responses over three waves to strengthen our data collection process. Empirically, it was found that CSR directly influenced food-waste-reduction behavior. Additionally, it was discovered that this relationship was mediated by moral attitudes and employee admiration as well as moderated by awareness of climate change. The findings have substantial theoretical implications regarding the interaction between emotional and cognitive factors within the CSR framework to influence behavior among employees. This paves the way for creating well-rounded strategies that appeal to staff and encourage sustainability in the hotel business. While focused on China’s hospitality industry, this research creates room for future studies in other places around the world using various methods. The conclusions drawn underline the critical role of CSR in promoting environmental sustainability in the hospitality industry, providing a pathway for organizations to engage employees in meaningful and impactful sustainability initiatives. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Determinants for the Implementation of Action-, Result- and Multi-Actor-Oriented Agri-Environment Schemes in Switzerland","Result- and multi-actor-oriented agri-environmental payment schemes are considered more cost-effective than action-oriented schemes in providing environmental public goods. This study analysed socio-economic determinants influencing the implementation of three types of agri-environmental scheme: action-, result- and multi-actor-oriented payment schemes. We relied on farm-level data from 2015 to 2017 retrieved from the Swiss Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and individually linked with Swiss agricultural census data. The census data provided detailed information on the proportions of action-, result- and multi-actor-oriented ecological focus areas (EFAs) implemented on each FADN farm. We found evidence that farmers' knowledge and competences are more important for result- and multi-actor-oriented EFAs than for action-oriented schemes: farms managed by young full-time farmers with higher levels of education have significantly higher proportions of result-oriented EFAs. In addition, farmers with higher levels of education who manage larger farms have significantly higher proportions of multi-actor-oriented EFAs. Furthermore, institutional factors such as cantonal authorities strongly influenced the proportions of result- and multi-actor-oriented EFAs. In contrast, the implementation of action-oriented EFAs was strongly driven by farm type. We observed higher proportions of action-oriented EFAs for farm types where implementation led to little change in farming practices (for instance, extensive ruminant farms). This adverse selection behaviour resulting from low compliance costs was not observed for result- or multi-actor-oriented EFAs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring acute weather resilience: Meeting resilience and renewable goals,"The United States is affected by an average of almost seven severe weather events a year, often resulting in billions of dollars in physical and economic damages, a subset of which are related to grid outages. There is a need for power and energy system stakeholders to better understand and implement the strategies that help reduce net-economic and societal consequences associated with grid outages by improving the resilience of their systems. In addition, there are incentives to reduce emissions and meet climate goals, several pathways of which include resilient technologies. Including resilience constraints and metrics in energy system planning models may help inform the design of more resilient systems that are also more renewable and sustainable. This paper reviews qualitative definitions of resilience, quantitative approaches to resilience, recent examples of the inclusion of resilience in energy system models with respect to acute climatological threats, and the gaps in fully articulating resilience in current modeling tools. We then outline steps to effectively improve resilience considerations against such threats into energy sector modeling tools. Based on the findings, the authors propose a novel framework for energy system resilience assessment and future areas of research to bridge the current modeling gaps. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
An introduction to predictive distribution modelling for conservation to encourage novel perspectives,"The rapid pace and potentially irreversible consequences of global change create an urgent need to predict the spatial responses of biota for conservation to better inform the prioritization and management of terrestrial habitats and prevent future extinctions. Here, we provide an accessible entry point to the field to guide near-future work building predictive species distribution models (SDMs) by synthesizing a technical framework for the proactive conservation of avian biodiversity. Our framework offers a useful approach to navigate the challenges surrounding the large spatio-temporal resolution of datasets and datasets that favor hypothesis testing at broad spatio-temporal scales and coarse resolutions, which can affect our ability to assess the validity of current predicted distributions. We explain how to improve the accuracy of predictive models by determining the extent to which: 1) dispersal limitation impacts the rate of range shifts, 2) taxa are rare at their range limits, and 3) land use and climate change interact. Finally, we offer approaches to filling knowledge gaps by creatively leveraging existing methods and data sources. © 2025, Museu de Ciencies Naturals. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency

Nanomedicine as a magic bullet for combating lymphoma,"Hematological malignancy like lymphoma originates in lymph tissues and has a propensity to spread across other organs. Managing such tumors is challenging as conventional strategies like surgery and local treatment are not plausible options and there are high chances of relapse. The advent of novel targeted therapies and antibody-mediated treatments has proven revolutionary in the management of these tumors. Although these therapies have an added advantage of specificity in comparison to the traditional chemotherapy approach, such treatment alternatives suffer from the occurrence of drug resistance and dose-related toxicities. In past decades, nanomedicine has emerged as an excellent surrogate to increase the bioavailability of therapeutic moieties along with a reduction in toxicities of highly cytotoxic drugs. Nanotherapeutics achieve targeted delivery of the therapeutic agents into the malignant cells and also have the ability to carry genes and therapeutic proteins to the desired sites. Furthermore, nanomedicine has an edge in rendering personalized medicine as one type of lymphoma is pathologically different from others. In this review, we have highlighted various applications of nanotechnology-based delivery systems based on lipidic, polymeric and inorganic nanomaterials that address different targets for effectively tackling lymphomas. Moreover, we have discussed recent advances and therapies available exclusively for managing this malignancy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability Transformation Through Green Supply Chain Management Practices and Green Innovations in Pakistan’s Manufacturing and Service Industries,"The increasing global emphasis on sustainability necessitates the integration of environmentally responsible practices within supply chains. This study explores the impact of green supply chain management practices (GSCMPs) on firm sustainable performance in Pakistan’s manufacturing and service industries. Unlike prior research, which primarily focuses on the direct impact of GSCMPs, this study advances knowledge by incorporating green technological innovation (GTI) and green managerial innovation (GMI) as mediators and green organizational culture (GOC) as a moderator. The study looks at survey data from 480 industry professionals and uses partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and multi-group analysis (MGA). It discovers that GSCMPs greatly enhance sustainability outcomes, especially when green innovations are used. Furthermore, the impact of GSCMPs is more pronounced in the manufacturing sector, emphasizing the role of regulatory pressures and technological advancements. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature by integrating post-pandemic sustainability challenges, highlighting industry-specific dynamics, and providing actionable strategies to enhance green supply chain adoption in emerging markets. The study provides applicable strategies for managers and policymakers to embed sustainability deeper into corporate strategies, ensuring resilience and competitive advantages in evolving global markets. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis With Considering Ecological Footprint and Governance Quality: Evidence From Emerging Countries,"Improving the environmental quality and economic growth simultaneously, and examining the variables affecting this nexus, has been one of the most important issues for researchers and policymakers in recent years, especially following the United Nations 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals. The aim of this study is to investigate the nexus among the ecological footprint as a multi-aspect indicator of environmental degradation, economic growth, renewable and non-renewable energies, and governance quality within the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis framework for two panels of European and Asian emerging countries during 1996-2017. For this purpose, we employ second-generation panel techniques that consider cross-sectional dependency in panel data. Augmented Mean Group estimation results indicate an inverted U-shape nexus among the economic growth and ecological footprint, which implies validation of the EKC hypothesis in all two panels of countries. The findings indicate the positive impact of non-renewable energy and the negative influence of governance quality on the ecological footprint in all two panels. At the same time, there is evidence of the negative impact of renewable energy on ecological footprint only in European emerging countries. In summary, the findings recommend that governments and policymakers pay closer attention to implementing non-renewable energy restrictive policies and renewable energy incentive policies. Furthermore, this is important to plan for improving various dimensions of governance quality to achieve better adoption and implementation of environmental policies, especially in the Asian emerging countries where it can lead to a more positive impact on environmental quality according to the results of estimated coefficients.JEL Codes: C33, Q01, Q20, Q50",Not About Sufficiency
National food security in Bangladesh to 2050,"Food security in Bangladesh, with particular reference to rice and wheat was investigated by examining trends in yields, area of cropping and overall production in recent decades. Prospects for continued increases in yield and area of the different rice crops and of wheat, considering the impact of climate change, suggest that continued large increases in production were likely. Demand for rice and other food will increase for many decades with the growing population. The range of projections was compared with recent population growth as well as the impacts of possible shifts in food preferences on the demand for rice and wheat. Demand for rice production in 2050 for a medium variant population projection is expected to be 14 % less than the most conservative projection. Wheat production appears likely to remain less than demand by up to 76 % in 2050, though it has the potential to increase sufficiently to meet demand. This analysis should help policy makers to take appropriate actions for maintaining Bangladesh’s food security in the future. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.",Not About Sufficiency
"How Do Institutional Quality, Natural Resources, Renewable Energy, and Financial Development Reduce Ecological Footprint without Hindering Economic Growth Trajectory? Evidence from China","Institutional quality, financial development, and natural resources primarily determine how economic representatives support their operational and production behaviors towards escalating the renewable energy share in the whole energy mix and protecting ecological quality. In this way, this paper is the first to investigate the influence of institutional quality, natural resources, financial development, and renewable energy on economic growth and the environment simultaneously in China from 1996 to 2020. The cointegration approaches verify the presence of a long-run association between the selected variables. The autoregressive distributed lag model outcomes reveal that institutional quality and renewable energy utilization greatly diminish ecological footprint. At the same time, other prospective indicators such as financial expansion and natural resources significantly enhance ecological footprint levels in the short- and long-run. Furthermore, institutional quality, financial expansion, renewable energy, and natural resources significantly trigger economic growth. Besides this, this study has revealed the unidirectional causal association from institutional quality and financial expansion to ecological footprint. In contrast, bidirectional causality occurs between renewable energy, natural resources, ecological footprint, and economic growth. The current research results offer some policy implications that will help to reduce the detrimental influence of environmental deprivation, without hindering the economic growth trajectory in the case of China. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Precooling and Cold Storage Methods for Fruits and Vegetables in Sub-Saharan Africa—A Review,"Fruits and vegetables, known for their large nutrient potential, are more susceptible to high postharvest loss than other crops. Factors such as perishability, poor post-production handling and storage and processing infrastructures, increase the magnitude of food losses. The postharvest loss of fruits and vegetables in Sub-Saharan Africa ranges from 30% to 50%. One key strategy to overcome such losses is through cold chain integration in value chains. However, most developing countries currently lack the basic infrastructure and management skills needed to support the development of integrated cold chains, particularly in rural areas, where up to 60% of overall food losses occur on the farm and in ‘first-mile’ distribution. Storage of highly perishable produce in a controlled environment with respect to temperature and relative humidity leads to quality and quantity preservation. This contributes to increases in food and nutrition security, household incomes and environmental protection. This review addresses the need for adopting and strengthening measures for the precooling and cold storage of fruits and vegetables to improve their value chains. A range of precooling and cold storage methods, their suitability, energy demands and the constraints on storage and distribution are discussed and recommendations are made on how to improve their accessibility for small-scale farmers in rural communities. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Indigenous agricultural practices employed by the Vhavenda community in the Musina local municipality to promote sustainable environmental management,"Indigenous knowledge offers insights into preserving natural resources and further contributes towards improving rural livelihoods. Incorporating this knowledge into agriculture can therefore increase acceptance and innovation of sustainable technologies. In support of this argument, rural small-scale farmers have globally proven the significance of indigenous knowledge in the agricultural sector by incorporating their local strategies and practices for both commercial and subsistence agriculture. This article demonstrates the various indigenous farming practices employed by the Vhavenda Community and how these practices promote sustainable environmental management. It reflects the essential aspects crucial to indicating the value of indigenous agriculture. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered face-to-face structured questionnaires to elderly villagers aged 50 years and above from the study area. Our results revealed various agricultural practices such as crop rotations, polyculture, intercropping, livestock farming, ploughing rituals, water harvesting, and seasonal agriculture. The Vhavenda community incorporates local knowledge, which is unique to these agricultural practices, and uses various strategies which contribute to a sustainable environment within their area. This has, in turn, allowed them to improve their livelihoods, reduce poverty, and provide life sustenance. The study's findings demonstrate the significance of indigenous knowledge in the agricultural sector and rural peoples' efforts towards supportable environmental management. The article therefore suggests that local indigenous knowledge should be understood as a collaborative concept within the agricultural industry. Furthermore, it proposes that stakeholders who influence decision-making and progress in rural communities should consider this knowledge and work together with local inhabitants. Additionally, it advocates for acknowledging the understanding of local indigenous peoples in pursuing sustainable environmental management. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Technology cooperation for sustainable energy: A review of pathways,"Policy makers, practitioners and academics agree that addressing climate change requires global efforts and that one pillar of any effective approach must include actions undertaken by developing countries. A key mechanism in which developing countries can be engaged is through collaboration to elicit more use of sustainable energy technologies in a region, organization, or community's energy portfolio. Approaches have tended to emphasize the role of the public and/or private sector. An alternative view has also emerged, termed as community approach, noting the absence of civil society actors in the predominant pathways that often characterize technology cooperation in developing countries. Local engagement is important, as it is often these players [whether local governments, community groups, and/or organizations (e.g. hospitals, schools)] who ultimately reap the benefits and/or bear the costs of these technologies. Recent emphasis centres on an enabling environment, recognizing the importance of creating markets for technology diffusion. Tackling the uptake of sustainable energy in a systematic way, emphasis is placed on policies, actors, and institutions. Building on these foundational frameworks, this paper scrutinizes actors and their relationships with a finer grain to better understand sustainable energy technology uptake. The notion is that sustainable energy technology use will increase with the active engagement of local players (earlier on, in a more meaningful way) in the technology cooperation process. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying pressures from Swedish industries impacting Sweden’s Environmental Quality Objectives,"This study finds that industries and other permit requiring activities (PRA) exert a significant cumulative pressure on 20 out of 34 examined specifications to the Swedish Environmental Quality Objectives (EQO), affecting the fulfilment of 12 out of 16 of these EQOs. PRA undergo thorough examination before receiving permits, and the permits come with detailed conditions. The permitting process is hence an important opportunity to contribute to the achievement of the EQOs. However, this opportunity has so far not been employed to any great extent since the quantitative significance of environmental impact from PRA on the national EQOs has not been well-known or expressed. We suggest that quantification of activities that can be regulated by environmental permitting may be of importance for the achievement of other instances of management by objectives in general, such as the global sustainable development goals and the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the ecological status regulated by the European Water Framework Directive. © 2021 IAIA.",Not About Sufficiency
Bridging disciplines-key to success when implementing planetary health in medical training curricula,"Planetary health is being or should be added to medical training curricula in accordance with association consensus. Several articles published in recent years have addressed concern on the implementation, and the challenges that can occur if not addressed properly. This scoping narrative literature review focuses on planetary health as a concept, as well as challenges and suggested solutions to address these challenges. Planetary health is an important concept and needs to be addressed in all medical training. We found that one main challenge is implementation without ensuring the right competences and resources. Medically trained teachers set out to understand and teach complex natural and social systems. At some institutions the time allocated to teach planetary health is limited or non-existent. Case studies and student led teaching are solutions suggested, while other argue that true interdisciplinarity by inviting experts are more in line with what we expect from other subjects. In conclusion, the roots of planetary health, the enormous health risks at stake and nature of the subject requires medical training to adopt a true inter/trans-disciplinary approach to succeed. It might not be expected for all students to become planetary health experts, but all need a general understanding of the most important aspects and values.

Inland wetlands in Africa: A review of their typologies and ecosystem services,"Wetlands, as one of the most productive natural ecosystems globally, have important roles in Earth system functioning through supporting biodiversity, storing carbon, recharging groundwater and removing pollutants. They are also critical locations for providing ecosystem and environmental services and thus supporting human livelihoods, especially in Africa where inland wetlands are extensively used for agriculture and as water sources. Despite this, the Ramsar Convention classifications do not wholly describe the physical nature and properties of African inland wetlands, or the varied and interconnected ways in which different ecosystem and environmental services are manifested in them. This review critically discusses the different types and definitions of inland wetlands in Africa with particular reference to dambos, based on wetland geomorphological, hydrological and ecological properties, and then considers the entangled nature of their ecosystem services and the benefits provided to local communities. Considering these services in a more integrated way – and not as a tick-box exercise as per the Ramsar Convention – allows for a better understanding of human–environment relations in wetlands, with implications for wetland sustainability and more effective management practices. © The Author(s) 2022.",Not About Sufficiency

"Quantifying the energy, water and food nexus: A review of the latest developments based on life-cycle assessment","Energy, water and food resource scarcity caused by rapid population growth, climate change, imbalanced ecosystems, and economic diversification, is the biggest challenge for today's world. In recent decades, the importance of the interdependent relationship between these resources has been recognized as the energy-water-food nexus. Sustainable resource consumption and the capability to ascertain true resource consumption is crucial for modern day development. As such, wide-spread adoption of the energy-water-food nexus methodology for integrated resource modeling can significantly contribute toward resource productivity and continuity. This methodology has expanded over the years, from concept development to application in multiple case studies. The methodology has also enabled the identification of synergies and trade-offs within the sub-systems that constitute the overall energy-water-food nexus system, hence providing a mechanism for optimization in resource consumption and minimization in the total environmental burden in the system under evaluation. This paper has reviewed the interlinkages inherent in the energy-water-food nexus, and the progress in developing suitable quantification methods. Although there is no standardized methodology for analysis involving the energy-water-food nexus, the life-cycle assessment methodology has been used as an enabler for the quantification of environmental burdens of systems evaluated using the ‘Nexus’ approach. As such, this paper will provide an overview of the different applications in which the life cycle assessment methodology has been applied to energy-water-food nexus analysis. The paper concludes that an integrated life cycle assessment and energy-water-food nexus methodology is necessary to determine environmental burdens for different scenarios presented within systems operating within an energy-water-food nexus environment, essentially influencing energy-water-food resource sectors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The Evolution and Cultural Framing of Food Safety Management Systems—Where From and Where Next?,"The aim of this paper is to review the development of food safety management systems (FSMS) from their origins in the 1950s to the present.

Effectiveness of local air pollution and GHG taxes: The case of Chilean industrial sources,"In 2017, environmental taxes began to be applied to CO2, PM, NOx and SO2 emissions in Chile to reduce the negative environmental effects of fossil fuels burned in industrial and thermoelectric sources with a thermal power greater than or equal to 50 MW. In this context, the present study generates an economic optimization model to simulate how different tax scenarios would modify the behavior of regulated industrial sources considering the alternatives they have to minimize their costs (tax payment, fuel change and/or installation of abatement technologies). The main results show that, under the current tax scenario, CO2, PM and SO2 emissions would decrease by 11%, 48% and 49% respectively, while NOX emissions would increase by 5%. By extending the tax to all industrial sources regardless of their thermal power, CO2, PM and SO2 emissions would decrease respectively by 14%, 98% and 66%, while NOX emissions would increase by 7.1%. Finally, it is determined that modifying the tax rate of a single pollutant while maintaining the rest of the constant rates generates a low impact on the other pollutants emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
A Case Study for Environmental Impact Assessment in the Process Industry: Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI),"Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been introduced in the evaluation of chemical processes and or products in order to take into account the Supply Chain and its environmental constraints and burdens. Regarding to the environmental assessment of chemical processes and/or products two main variables need to be taken into account: Natural Resources Sustainability (NRS) and Environmental Burdens Sustainability (EBS). NRS includes the use of energy, water and materials whereas EBS is given by the environmental sustainability metrics developed by the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE). The main components of EBS have been classified in 5 environmental impacts to the atmosphere (acidification, global warming, human health effects, stratospheric ozone depletion and photochemical ozone formation), 5 aquatic media impacts (aquatic acidification, aquatic oxygen demand, ecotoxicity (metals), ecotoxicity (others) and eutrophication) and 2 land impacts (hazardous and non-hazardous waste disposal). To reduce the number of variables and thus, the complexity, the development of a normalisation and weighting procedure is required. This work proposes the normalization of EB based on the threshold values of the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) and a similar procedure based on the values given by the BREF document on waste incineration for the NRS normalisation. This procedure will help in the decision making process in the waste management field and in the particular, in Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI).",Not About Sufficiency
"Knowledge, attitudes and practices about air pollution and its health effects in 6th to 11th-grade students in Colombia: a cross-sectional study","Introduction: Globally, air pollution is the leading environmental cause of disease and premature death. Raising awareness through environmental education and adequate communication on air quality could reduce the adverse effects. We aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding air pollution and health and determine the factors associated with these KAP in children and adolescents. Methods: In 2019–2020, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 6th–11th grade high school students in five municipalities in Colombia. Variables collected included: age, sex, private or public school, any medical history, emergency room visits due to respiratory symptoms in the last year, and whether students played sports. The main exposure was the School Environmental Project. The outcomes were the KAP scale [0% (the lowest score) to 100% (the highest score)]. The factors associated with KAP levels were evaluated with independent mixed regressions due to the multilevel structure of the study (level 1: student; level 2: school), and the exponential coefficients (95% confidence interval-CI) were reported. Results: Among 1,676 students included, 53.8% were females. The median knowledge score about air pollution and its health effects was 33.8% (IQR: 24.0–44.9), 38.6% knew the air quality index, 30.9% knew the air quality alerts that occurred twice a year in these municipalities and 5.3% had high self-perceived knowledge. Positive attitudes, pro-environmental practices, being female, grade level, attending a private school, having respiratory diseases, and the school environmental project importance were associated with higher knowledge scores. The median attitudes score was 78.6% (IQR: 71.4–92.9). Pro-environmental attitudes were associated with knowledge-increasing, being female, attending a private school, and the school environmental project. The median pro-environmental practices score was 28.6% (IQR: 28.6–42.9). During air quality alerts, 11.6% had worn masks, 19% had reduced the opening time of windows and 15.9% avoided leaving home. Pro-environmental practices were associated with knowledge-increasing and attitudes-increasing, and lower practices with higher grade levels, visiting a doctor in the last year, and practicing sports. Discussion: Children and adolescents have low knowledge scores and inadequate pro-environmental practices scores regarding air pollution. However, they demonstrate positive attitudes towards alternative solutions and express important concerns about the planet’s future.

For instance, local groups of farmers can negotiate land-use allocation patterns and exchange materials such as manure, grain, and straw. Development of such a collective agricultural system raises questions, rarely documented in the literature, about how to integrate crops and livestock among farms, and the consequences, impacts, and conditions of integrating them. Here, we review the different forms of crop–livestock integration beyond the farm level, their potential benefits, and the features of decision support systems (DSS) needed for the integration process. We identify three forms of crop–livestock integration beyond the farm level: local coexistence, complementarity, and synergy, each with increasingly stronger temporal, spatial, and organizational coordination among farms. We claim that the forms of integration implemented define the nature, area, and spatial configuration of crops, grasslands, and animals in farms and landscapes. In turn, these configurations influence the provision of ecosystem services. For instance, we show that the synergy form of integration promotes soil fertility, erosion control, and field-level biological regulation services through organizational coordination among farmers and spatiotemporal integration between crops, grasslands, and animals. We found that social benefits of the synergy form of integration include collective empowerment of farmers. We claim that design of the complementarity and synergy forms of crop–livestock integration can best be supported by collective participatory workshops involving farmers, agricultural consultants, and researchers. In these workshops, spatialized simulation modeling of crop–livestock integration among farms is the basis for achieving the upscaling process involved in integrating beyond the farm level. Facilitators of these workshops have to pay attention to the consequences on governance and equity issues within farmers groups. © 2016, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.",Not About Sufficiency
Recent applications of chromatography for determining microplastics and related compounds (bisphenols and phthalate esters) in food,"The presence of microplastics in food poses a significant concern due to its potential impact on human health. Numerous studies have focused on spectroscopic techniques to identify and confirm those contaminants in food, but less attention has been paid to chromatographic techniques. Thus, this article provides a comprehensive review of the recent applications of chromatographic techniques in the analysis of microplastics and related compounds such as bisphenols and phthalate esters in food from 2018 to 2022. The study covers and discusses a range of different chromatographic applications (gas and liquid chromatography). Furthermore, this review also explores different sample treatments employed for extracting these compounds from food matrices, while offering a detailed analysis of their principles, advantages, and disadvantages. This review provides readers with an overview and valuable insights into the analytical performance and potential applications of these chromatographic techniques in the analysis of microplastics and related compounds in food. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Physicochemical and pharmacotechnical characterization of Prussian blue for future Prussian blue oral dosage forms formulation,"Ferric hexacyanoferrate, Fe4 [Fe(CN)6]3 · xH2O, known as Prussian blue (PB), has proven its effectiveness as an antidote in cases of accidental poisoning or poisoning caused by radioactive materials such as cesium (Cs) and thallium (Tl); which due to their solubility in water, when absorbed by the human body, cause serious damage to vital organs. The local development of a drug with PB as an active ingredient arises as a response to the civil and military needs established within the Ministry's pharmacy request for national defense. This fact contemplates the circumstances related to public health protection in the nuclear, radiological, biological and chemical (NRBQ) of the emergency institutions in health and national security. In this paper and by using various analytical techniques, the characterization of the locally synthesized PB with pharmaceutical quality has been described, as a first step to predict its behavior in the preparation of a drug that contains it as an active ingredient. The research findings demonstrate that locally synthesized PB is suitable for use in oral dosage forms, enabling the local development of drug formulations incorporating PB, thus being able to potentially become a main resource in the treatment of Cs and Tl poisoning in any accidental or intended of the population. This development opens up the possibility of creating drug formulations that incorporate PB at a local level, making it a potentially significant resource in the treatment of Cs and Tl poisoning. The ability to locally produce and utilize PB in oral dosage forms could be crucial in addressing cases of accidental or intentional exposure within the population. This advancement not only contributes to the scientific understanding of PB but also holds promising implications for practical applications in public health and emergency situations. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing a potential conflict associated with the production of Moringa oleifera in the Limpopo Province of South Africa: A systems thinking approach,"The increased movement of humans throughout the world allowed the transportation of several species, such as Moringa oleifera Lam. (moringa), into biomes far away from their native habitation. Native to India, moringa is a versatile, drought-tolerant, and fast-growing tree that is easily adaptable to wide-ranging tropical and sub-tropical conditions around the world. It is used in cosmetics, as food and medicine for humans, livestock feed, crop biostimulant, and green manure. Even though moringa is an alien species to South Africa, its production is increasing, and its numerous uses are recognised by communities. Moringa forms part of a highly complex (social, ecological, and economic) system. This is because it is on the Species Under Surveillance for Possible Eradication or Containment Targets (SUSPECT) list under the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act (NEM:BA) of South Africa. Listing species that are regarded as beneficial to communities on national regulations can cause conflicts and uncertainties among various stakeholders (i.e., environmental policymakers, farmers, rural communities, and government bodies). In this paper, a systems thinking approach was applied to address complex and conflicting issues linked to the production and overall status (economic, ecological, legal, and social) of moringa in South Africa. The Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) was developed to present a broad insight into the complexity of moringa in South Africa and assist in underscoring the feedback mechanisms within the system. Moreover, the CLD indicated that the position of moringa within the country comprised a variety of interdependent variables of government policies, environment, and society, which are interconnected into a multifaceted system. The potential conflict dimensions and types associated with allocating moringa an impact category within the South African context were identified, and this may serve as a useful tool for facilitating engagements and decision-making processes among stakeholders in resolving the status of moringa in South Africa. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Administrative fairness and forest land decision-making: Restructuring land use governance in British Columbia, Canada","Attention to administrative process is of key importance in reconciling competing interests in environmental policy-making and implementation. Acute wilderness preservation/logging conflict in recent years in British Columbia, Canada, has led the government to attach a political priority to the development of legitimate procedural forms for forest land use allocation and management. In devising a provincial land use strategy governed by principles of sustainability, the Commission on Resources and Environment (1992-96) highlighted the need for neutrally administered decision-making processes open to the participation of all interests. Drawing on legal norms of administrative fairness, the Commission presented far-reaching proposals for restructuring land use planning in the province. Its suggestions for legal and institutional reform reflect the commitment of the Commission to public inquiry and discourse in environmental decision-making, but have raised objections relating to regulatory costs and bureaucratic accountability. These recommendations nevertheless claim to offer a means for resolving environmental disputes in an effective and non-discriminatory manner; as such, they are of critical relevance to other regional and national contexts where public agency decision-making must mediate between diverse, often opposing, interests.",Not About Sufficiency
Co-management of national protected areas: Lessons learned from Bolivia,"This article evaluates local management committees and co-administration-two mechanisms to promote local participation in the management of Bolivia's protected areas. The experience with the broadly participatory management committees varied tremendously. While their potential utility was large, they often struggled to overcome conflicts between local stakeholders, inconsistent representation, and a lack of basic funding for their operations. Co-administered protected areas were significantly better managed than those that were not, particularly for basic protection activities. Differences in long-term management, financing, and participation were not significant. Key challenges to co-administered protected areas included unclear rights and responsibilities of the parties, poor communication, distrust, and other institutional weaknesses. We conclude that co-administration works best when both parties have clearly defined rights and responsibilities, engage as full partners, are committed to protected area objectives, develop adequate institutional capacity, and build mutual trust and local support through effective communication and complimentary mechanisms to foster broad participation. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Agriculture planted the seeds of alienation from nature,"Our worldview is rooted in an agrarian culture that holds a dominionist view of the living world. In preagricultural times, forager peoples saw other animals as kindred tribes who gave a sense of continuity with nature. When foragers started to become farmers 10, 000 years ago, increasing their control over other animals and nature, they developed new myths of human supremacy to justify this exploitation. Agrarian life and population pressure required the production of surpluses and expansion of land holdings. The drive for surpluses, especially of other animals, led to concepts of property and wealth and the emergence of class. Warfare, conquest, and ruthlessness as means of social control and wealth building were built into the new social order. The oppression of other animals played a key role in facilitating the development of war, colonialism, capitalism, and other forms of domination. This aggressive, herder, “agriculture” has directly shaped our current worldview with terrible consequences. We need to reset our nature-dominating worldview. Only when we stop denying that kinship is the biological reality here on Earth can we hope to stop destroying nature and each other. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
The evolving landscape of agroecological research,"It has been widely argued that agroecological science, which originally developed as the application of ecological principles to agricultural systems, should engage with the social and political issues that affect production agriculture, and incorporate knowledge from a variety of sources. In this paper, we use techniques from network science and bibliometrics to evaluate the degree to which this transformation has taken place. By creating networks based on over 3,000 agroecology papers and the roughly 160,000 references they cite, we distinguish the sub-fields (“research fronts”) that made up agroecology in three time intervals: 1982–2004, 2005–2013, and 2014–2018. We also identify the main disciplines from which the research fronts in 2014–2018 drew their supporting knowledge. We suggest that, very broadly, themes in agroecological research include: Ecosystem services; (agro)biodiversity; approaches to agricultural intensification; tropical agroecosystems (particularly coffee); pest and weed management; organic agriculture; cropping systems; system transitions, modeling, and design; climate change adaptation; food sovereignty; education; and the nature and purpose of agroecology itself. Some research fronts mainly cite papers in natural science fields such as ecology, environmental science, agriculture, and entomology. However, others draw upon work in social science areas including development studies, environmental studies, and anthropology. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that agroecology has indeed evolved to possess many of the characteristics of an “ecology of [the entire] food system.” We anticipate that this work will also be of use to those wishing to gain an overview of the field or identify key papers, knowledge gaps, and potential collaborations. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency

The Shape of Things to Come: International Migration in the Twenty-First Century,"There have been three eras of mass international migration: the forced migration of Africans to the Americas during the mercantilist era, the mass movement of free Europeans to the Americas and Oceania during the laissez-faire industrial era, and the global movement of people from varied origins to diverse destinations during the neoliberal post-industrial era. This chapter forecasts the likely course of migration in the 2020s through a review of the demographic, economic, climatic, and governmental circumstances prevailing across world regions. It foresees an acceleration of migration between developing and developed regions composed increasingly of people moving to evade threats at places of origin rather than to access opportunities at places of destination. The coming decade will require a better theoretical integration of refugee and migration studies, close attention to the tradeoffs between internal and international migration, and a greater effort to theorize how states will behave in adapting to the realities of migration in an era of climate change. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Green information technology and green information systems: science mapping of present and future trends,"Purpose: This study provide an in-depth review on the knowledge structure of green information technology (GIT) adoption and behavior. Environmental degradation has escalated even further with information and digital technology development. Researchers have come up with a new concept of GIT to dampen the carbon emission due to the excessive use of IT in today’s everyday usage. A similar terminology, green information system (GIS), is a rather broad understanding of GIT, which relates to the environmental management system to improve operations in the organization and will be included in the scope of the study. Design/methodology/approach: This study presents a science mapping analysis through a bibliometric review to explore emerging trends and predict future trends based on 293 publications in the Web of Science. Findings: The bibliographic coupling analysis discovered five themes related to the theoretical foundation of GIT and the determinants of their adoption. The five themes are (1) theoretical foundation in GIT, (2) determinants of green IT and IS adoption, (3) fundamental of GIT and information science, (4) green technologies and green computing and (5) determinants of managers green IT adoption behavior. While co-word analysis presents the impact of GIT, driving performance and energy efficiency through the adoption of GIT producing four themes, (1) GIT acceptance through the theory of planned behavior, (2) impact of GIT’s: strategies for sustainable implementation, (3) driving sustainable performance through green innovation in information systems and technology and (4) energy efficiency and sustainability in green computing and cloud computing. Research limitations/implications: The finding is relevant to managers, researchers and stakeholders bounded by environmental responsibilities to mitigate its impact on the socioeconomic and environment through GIT adoption. Originality/value: The contribution of this study is presenting an in-depth analysis of the knowledge structure through bibliometric analysis by providing network visualization on one of the crucial pro-environmental behavior. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
DEMAND-PULL INSTRUMENTS TO SUPPORT THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,"In recent years, transitioning to a more circular economy has been introduced as a policy objective in many jurisdictions across the globe with a view to achieving a sustainable society. However, the increasing attention paid to this issue has so far not led to a large-scale transformation of production processes and consumption. Instead, many circular economy innovations have remained niche and have not become the mainstream solutions. A plethora of regulatory, market, cultural and technological barriers limit the demand for, and consequently wide-scale adoption of, circular solutions. This article examines the potential offered by regulatory demand-pull instruments to overcome such barriers and to mainstream circular economy solutions. In particular, the article investigates innovative demand-pull instruments that have been used in various jurisdictions globally. This article analyses the instruments according to their types – i.e., command-and-control measures, economic incentives, information tools and public procurement – to gain a better understanding of the rationales, strengths, and limitations of these categories of instruments in creating a stable demand for the circular economy. The lessons learned from the regulatory innovations enable a more critical approach in determining the best combination of instruments and tools to implement sustainable circular solutions on a larger scale. © 2022 by author(s).

Vulnerability to motor fuel price increases: Socio-spatial patterns in England,"In high-motorisation, car-dependent countries, transport affordability is intimately linked to the price of oil derived motor fuels, which may become increasingly volatile in the future due to global oil price movements and environmental taxation. The negative impacts of fuel price spikes in terms of increased household expenditure and economic stress are unevenly spatially and socially distributed. Previous research has found that vulnerability to fuel price increases is higher in peripheral, peri-urban and rural areas, and that low income tends to be co-located with high car dependence and low vehicle fuel efficiency, with a compounding effect on vulnerability. The goal of this article is to test these hypotheses for England, providing new evidence on spatial patterns of vulnerability to fuel price increases at the small-area level. We propose a composite vulnerability indicator combining data on income, accessibility, vehicle inspection and vehicle registration for 2011. Within English city-regions, we find little evidence of the socially regressive patterns previously identified in the literature. This is explained by the persistent concentration of poverty in urban cores, as well as by the poor fuel economy of the vehicle fleet in wealthier areas, due to the prevalence of powerful vehicles there. On the other hand, our analysis suggests that the impacts of fuel price increases would be very unequal between city-regions, as the least sensitive metropolitan area (Greater London)is also characterised by high levels of adaptive capacity. We conclude by setting out an agenda for future research on spatial vulnerability to fuel price increases. © 2019 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Ready, Steady, Go? Obstacles to the Spread of Eco-Social Work Approaches: An Italian Case Study","While eco-social work as a strategy that combines responses to environmental and social risks is gaining ground in Europe, it has not evenly spread across countries. This paper looks at Italy, a country in which eco-social work has arrived only recently and has found difficulty establishing itself, in order to understand the factors that have hindered and fostered its development. To do so, it explores two cases of eco-social innovation and, using a neo-institutionalist framework, the mechanisms at work in encouraging or impeding the establishment of eco-social work. The research suggests three mutually reinforcing obstacles to the spread of eco-social work in an Italian context: the limited space for eco-social work in the Italian policy agenda; the inability to reframe practices used by existing work integration initiatives; and the reproduction of established relationships between public and non-profit organisations in a competition for scarce resources. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
New boundaries for sustainability accounting? A case study of multi-entity accounting and reporting in the agrifood sector,"Purpose: This study examines how accounting tools and techniques are used to create and support membership and reporting boundaries for a multi-entity sustainability scheme. It also considers whether boundary setting for this initiative helps to connect corporate activity with planetary boundaries and the SDGs. Design/methodology/approach: A case study of a national agrifood sustainability scheme, analysing extensive documentary data and multi-entity sustainability reports. The concept of partial organising is used to frame the analysis. Findings: Accounting, in the form of planning, verification, target setting, annual review and reporting, can be used to create a membership and a reporting boundary. Accounting tools and techniques support the scheme's standard-setting and monitoring elements. The study demonstrates that the scheme offers innovation in how sustainability reporting is managed. However, it does not currently provide a cumulative assessment of the effect of the sector's activity on ecological carrying capacity or connect this activity to global sustainability indicators. Research limitations/implications: Future research can build on this study's insights to further develop our understanding of multi-entity sustainability reporting and accounting's role in organising for sustainability. The authors identify several research avenues including: boundary setting in ecologically significant sectors, integrating global sustainability indicators at sectoral and organisational levels, sustainability controls in multi-entity settings and the potential of multi-entity reporting to provide substantive disclosure. Originality/value: This paper provides insight into accounting's role in boundary setting for a multi-entity sustainability initiative. It adds to our understanding of the potential of a multi-entity reporting boundary to support connected measurement between corporate activity and global sustainability indicators. It builds on work on partial organising and provides insight into how accounting can support this form of organising for sustainability. © 2023, Rebecca Maughan and Aideen O'Dochartaigh.",Not About Sufficiency
A statistical model to forecast and simulate energy demand in the long-run,"This research aims to design a model to forecast and simulate aggregated world energy demand at distant horizons in time. This is done by estimating statistically a simplified interrelated model for the three variables considered, total primary Energy, world population and GDP. The approach intends to offer a complementary perspective to current practice, based on simulating energy demand conditional on GDP and population. The model is based on long historical series spanning the years (1900;2017) available from renowned researchers and institutions in their respective fields. The estimated models allow a forecast of future energy demand and a risk/sensitivity analysis. Alternative solutions and simulation methods are carried out to assess the robustness of the results derived. These forecasts are compared to the results of key relevant roadmaps put forward in the literature - in the range (330;408) EJ/yr for final energy consumption -, the general conclusion being that the afore-mentioned roadmaps assume sizeable efficiency savings, relying mainly on electrification and renewable energies deployment, that depart significantly from historical trends embodied in the model estimated - 900 EJ/yr on average, and 600 EJ/yr under favourable assumptions. These results jeopardise the unbounded GDP-growth paradigm, suggesting a replacement by alternative welfare measures as suggested by the UN human development index, the prosperity approach, and related standards.",Not About Sufficiency
Impactful Methodological Considerations for Knowledge Co-Creation in Sustainable Development Research,"The extant literature is rich with references to co-creation in research and knowledge initiatives. However, there is a pressing need for clarity regarding the definition of knowledge co-creation and its application in sustainable development research. To fill these gaps, we conducted a systematic review of 42 articles that met the selection criteria. The findings revealed the disciplinarity in the studies, geographical collaboration patterns, and varying interpretations of knowledge co-creation. This study also identified key engagement methods and stages essential for the knowledge co-creation process in the context of sustainable development. The implications for practice highlight the importance for researchers, and possibly policy-makers, to consider not only the various definitions of knowledge co-creation attempted—often lacking consensus—but also guiding principles. Strengthening knowledge co-creation in transdisciplinary studies, fostering robust global partnerships, ensuring equitable regional representation, facilitating the active participation of diverse stakeholders, and maintaining balanced power dynamics rooted in trust and relationality are crucial for achieving positive sustainable development outcomes. The intersection of research, knowledge co-creation, sustainable development, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), along with the elements proposed for future consideration, which has not been extensively explored in previous studies, underscores the originality of this study, which carries significant theoretical, methodological, and global policy implications. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"The effects of tourism development on the sustainable utilisation of natural resources in the Okavango delta, Botswana","Developing countries are faced with a decline in natural resources and high poverty rates. Ironically, these countries are also the key nature-based international tourism destinations. Research should, therefore, establish the contribution of tourism to Millennium Development Goals, particularly poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability. This paper uses the concept of social capital to analyse the effects of tourism as carried out through community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) to achieve the sustainable utilisation of natural resources in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Focus is on the utilisation of giraffes, sable antelopes and thatching grass. Using ethnographic field research methods supplemented by secondary data sources, results indicate that CBNRM has achieved the following: increased social capital between the CBNRM stakeholders; the formation of local conservation institutions and co-management of resources; and development of conservation practices such as suspension of hunting of declining species, selective hunting and harvesting of thatching grass in the dry season, resource monitoring and policing by communities. These practices contribute to low cases of illegal hunting in the CBNRM areas and increasing populations of giraffes and sable antelopes. Based on these findings, CBNRM can be used as a tool to achieve sustainability in natural resource use in rich biodiversity tourism destinations. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
"Climate change exposure, risk management and corporate social responsibility: Cross-country evidence","We examine how climate change risk impacts corporate social responsibility using an international firm-level sample. Exploiting a new firm-level measure of climate change risk, we find that firms significantly adjust their CSR standards upwards in response to climate change risk shocks. Using the difference in difference (DiD) approach and natural disaster shocks as plausibly exogenous shocks to climate change risk, we document an increase in CSR performance for affected firms relative to their unaffected peers after severe natural disasters. Additionally, we observe that the sensitivity of CSR performance to climate change risk jumps after the release of the Stern Review and the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, we find that this impact is more pronounced for firms in climate-sensitive sectors, firms with more growth options, firms with higher governance standards, and firms in highly competitive industries. Overall, our findings reveal that climate change uncertainty can trigger firms to invest more in CSR activities to hedge against regulatory and physical risks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Niche Construction and the Ideal Free Distribution: Partners in Characterizing Past Human-Environmental Dynamics,"Niche Construction Theory (NCT) and the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) have been called upon by various researchers to assess, analyze, and understand human-environmental dynamics in the past. In this chapter we highlight the complementarity of these two approaches. Where niche construction theory provides a framework to explore population-level ecological interactions, the IFD and its variants provide models to test hypotheses of human behavior and its ecological effects. Rather than being antithetical to one another, we suggest that the characteristics of niche construction are mechanisms by which humans modified habitat suitability as measured by the Allee effect of the IFD in particular and that short- and long-term activities and their legacy effects can be modeled and tested with archaeological and environmental data. We discuss the role of pastoralism in landscape modifications generally and illustrate the main issues with an example of the ecological impacts and changes of transhumant pastoralism in historic periods of the Iberian Peninsula. The deep time and large spatial scale of this example illustrates ongoing processes of niche construction with human and animal adaptations to fluctuating ecological, political, and economic dynamics. Ecological legacies effected human populations in the past, and continue to impact the habitats we live in today. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Model parameters for simulating fate and transport of on-site wastewater nutrients,"This paper presents a critical review of model-input parameters for transport of on-site wastewater treatment system (OWS) pollutants. Approximately 25% of the U.S. population relies on soil-based OWS for effective treatment and protection of public health and environmental quality. Mathematical models are useful tools for understanding and predicting the transport and fate of wastewater pollutants and for addressing water-budget issues related to wastewater reclamation from site to watershed scales. However, input parameters for models that simulate fate and transport of OWS pollutants are not readily obtained. The purpose of this analysis is to illustrate an objective, statistically supported method for choosing model-input parameters related to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Data were gathered from existing studies reported in the literature. Cumulative frequency distributions (CFDs) are provided for OWS effluent concentrations of N and P, nitrification and denitrification rates, and linear sorption isotherm constants for P. When CFDs are not presented, ranges and median values are provided. Median values for model-input parameters are as follows: total N concentration (44 mg/L), nitrate-N (0.2 mg/L), ammonium (60 mg/L), phosphate-P (9 mg/L), organic N (14 mg/L), zero-order nitrification rate (264 mg/L/d), first-order nitrification (2.9/d), first-order dentrification (0.025/d), maximum soil capacity for P uptake (237 mg/kg), linear sorption isotherm constant for P (15.1 L/kg), and OWS effluent flow rates (260 L/person/d).

Cheap and nasty? the potential perils of using management costs to identify global conservation priorities,"The financial cost of biodiversity conservation varies widely around the world and such costs should be considered when identifying countries to best focus conservation investments. Previous global prioritizations have been based on global models for protected area management costs, but this metric may be related to other factors that negatively influence the effectiveness and social impacts of conservation. Here we investigate such relationships and first show that countries with low predicted costs are less politically stable. Local support and capacity can mitigate the impacts of such instability, but we also found that these countries have less civil society involvement in conservation. Therefore, externally funded projects in these countries must rely on government agencies for implementation. This can be problematic, as our analyses show that governments in countries with low predicted costs score poorly on indices of corruption, bureaucratic quality and human rights. Taken together, our results demonstrate that using national-level estimates for protected area management costs to set global conservation priorities is simplistic, as projects in apparently low-cost countries are less likely to succeed and more likely to have negative impacts on people. We identify the need for an improved approach to develop global conservation cost metrics that better capture the true costs of avoiding or overcoming such problems. Critically, conservation scientists must engage with practitioners to better understand and implement context-specific solutions. This approach assumes that measures of conservation costs, like measures of conservation value, are organization specific, and would bring a much-needed focus on reducing the negative impacts of conservation to develop projects that benefit people and biodiversity. © 2013 McCreless et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Circumpolar stakeholder perspectives on Geographic Information Systems for communicating the health impacts of development,"Natural resource development is accelerating in the circumpolar region, raising questions about the balance between potential economic benefits for northern indigenous peoples with the risks of increasing long-standing health inequities. New communication tools are needed to document and synthesize complex and diverse evidence of health impacts in a context relevant for natural resource management. Our research examines the perspectives of circumpolar experts on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a platform to synthesize and communicate scientific and indigenous knowledge. Thirty policy makers, academic researchers, and community-level practitioners participated in semi-structured interviews examining indigenous community health, natural resource management, and the use of GIS within Arctic and subarctic communities. Qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts for key themes indicated that the majority of circumpolar experts supported employing GIS to facilitate more extensive collaboration with indigenous communities and to produce higher quality data outputs for decision-making forums. To ensure GIS enables natural resource development decision-making to improve the social and economic welfare of indigenous people, experts recommended increasing communities' access to technology and training, community stewardship of data, utilizing data for ongoing monitoring of development impacts, and coordinating cumulative impact monitoring within regions. Findings focus on circumpolar natural resource management in jurisdictions with a mandate for public participation, with relevance to improving accountability to indigenous populations in other regions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

"Gender, democracy, development, and overshoot: a cross-national analysis","The crux of sustainability concerns hinges on humanity’s overshoot of our global carrying capacity, which we currently exceed by about 50 %. Overshoot of the earth’s natural resource bases militates against our current and future prospects for sustainability. Despite the theoretical and practical impetus to examine these dynamics, there is a dearth of empirical sociological research that analyzes overshoot. The paper fills this gap by offering a structural equation model of each nation’s relative contributions to overshoot. The model tests key theorizations in the environmental sociology, development, and global political-economy literatures, and adds to them by theorizing and empirically testing ecofeminist positions that the status of women affects and is affected by environmental conditions. Findings support ecofeminist interpretations that resource degradation yields adverse impacts on women and that their representation in government bodes well for the environment.

"Marine litter and social inequities entangle Ecuadorian mangrove communities: Perceptions of plastic pollution and well-being concerns in Puerto Hondo and Isla Santay, Ecuador","Mangrove forests of Ecuador's Gulf of Guayaquil are ecologically, culturally, and economically important to local communities relying on them for artisanal fishing, ecotourism, and related businesses. However, these ecosystems have experienced significant degradation by anthropogenic impacts such as anthropogenic marine debris. On one hand, plastics have improved the ease of life and safety for local people of the region; however, plastic pollution threatens the health of the mangrove ecosystem and these communities. This interdisciplinary study explores perceptions of marine litter and its impacts on community well-being based on surveys conducted in Puerto Hondo and Santay Island, two mangrove communities in the Gulf of Guayaquil, in 2019 and 2021. Santay Island respondents expressed that marine litter is an extreme issue affecting their well-being, while Puerto Hondo respondents reported less concern. Authors suggest Puerto Hondo's geographic link to Guayaquil city has transitioned the community into a “peri-urban” landscape, where community members increasingly look inland for basic needs. Conversely, Santay Island, isolated by estuarine water, is physically linked to the mangroves. It is suggested that as communities spend less time in the mangroves, whether geographically or socially separated, marine litter becomes “out of sight, out of mind” despite its ongoing impacts on local food security and historical heritage. This work illustrates the complexities of plastic use and marine debris. To foster equitable plastic waste governance for exposed coastal Ecuadorian communities, policies must not only account for these intricacies but also actively engage with and listen to local perspectives. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The silent majority: Pico- and nanoplankton as ecosystem health indicators for marine policy,"A healthy marine ecosystem is a fully functioning system, able to supply ecosystem services whilst still maintaining resilience to human-induced environmental change. Monitoring and managing the health of resilient marine ecosystems requires indicators that can assess their biodiversity state and food web functioning. Plankton are crucial components of pelagic habitats, occupying the base of the pelagic food web. Larger plankton have long been used to monitor ecosystem productivity and biodiversity due to their identification via traditional light microscopy. In contrast, the regular monitoring of pico- and nanoplankton (<20 µm; hereafter called “tiny plankton”) only started with the development of flow cytometry techniques, which has limited their inclusion as ecosystem health indicators. Four UK plankton surveys have sampled and identified these tiny plankton for up to 14 years, providing an opportunity to test their suitability as indicators of ecosystem state. We investigated six groups of tiny plankton, including heterotrophic nanoeukaryotes, photosynthetic nanoeukaryotes, photosynthetic picoeukaryotes, and Synechococcus cyanobacteria, and two groups of heterotrophic bacteria. Flow cytometry and light microscopy data from an inshore Western English Channel station revealed that 99.98 % of plankton abundance and 71 % of plankton biomass was derived from tiny plankton cells too small to be quantified accurately under a light microscope and thus not adequately considered in assessments of pelagic habitats. Different UK marine and coastal regions showed consistency in peak abundances of these tiny plankton. We used a novel wavelet coherence method to identify time-based relationships between tiny plankton and environmental variables linked to human pressures. Relationships were found between nitrogenous nutrients and all tiny plankton groups, most commonly at sub-annual to annual time scales. Photosynthetic picoeukaryotes, heterotrophic nanoeukaryotes, and HNA-bacteria were associated with high sea surface temperatures. Given the here established relationship between tiny plankton and environmental variables, and their importance in the full plankton assemblage, we recommend that, alongside existing microplankton lifeforms, tiny plankton groups can be used as plankton lifeforms, either individually or in combination, to inform biodiversity indicators that meet policy obligations under the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), (Oslo-Paris Convention) OSPAR strategies, and the UK Marine Strategy. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Impacts of artisanal gold mining systems on soil and woody vegetation in the semi-arid environment of northern Ethiopia,"Gold mining is a tremendously important economic activity in rural districts of Ethiopia. We assessed the impacts of artisanal gold mining on soil and woody vegetation in northern Ethiopia. Estimation of soil loss, plant inventory, group discussions and transect studies were used to address the research questions. We employed t-test to compare woody species and soil loss between mined and unmined sites. Moreover, we ran one-way ANOVA to compare the average volume of soil loss among the mining sites. The study shows that gold mining removed colossal volumes of soil from the mining landscape with a significant difference among gold mining sites (P ≤ 0.05). Soil loss between the mined and unmined sites was also significant (P ≤ 0.05). Moreover, gold mining destroyed massive tracts of vegetation. Woody species encountered at plot level decreased from artisanal gold mined to unmined sites (P ≤ 0.05). Moreover, dead trees and exposed tree roots were higher in mined than the unmined areas (P ≤ 0.05). This discouraged regeneration and recruitment of woody vegetation. To conclude, gold mining system converted vegetated sites and farmlands into dysfunctional landscape. Therefore, we suggest that combined rehabilitation efforts are required to overcome the challenges of artisanal gold mining on sustainable land management in northern Ethiopia. © 2017 Department of Geography, National University of Singapore and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Biodigesters for Sustainable Food Waste Management,"The global challenge of food waste management poses severe environmental and public health risks. Traditional disposal methods, such as landfilling and incineration, exacerbate these issues. Decomposing food waste in landfills emits methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than CO2, while landfill leachate contaminates soil and groundwater with hazardous pathogens and toxins. Additionally, improper waste disposal fosters microbial proliferation, posing severe health risks. Incineration, though commonly used, is inefficient due to the high moisture content of food waste, leading to incomplete combustion and further air pollution. Therefore, this review examines biodigesters as a sustainable alternative to traditional food waste disposal, assessing their effectiveness in mitigating environmental and health risks while promoting circular economy practices. It evaluates different biodigester designs, their operational scalability, and their economic feasibility across diverse global contexts. Through an analysis of case studies, this review highlights biodigesters’ potential to address localized waste management challenges by converting organic waste into biogas—a renewable energy source—and nutrient-rich digestate, a valuable natural fertilizer. The process reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves soil health, and minimizes public health risks associated with microbial contamination. Various biodigester designs, including fixed-dome, floating-drum, and tubular systems, are compared for their efficiency and adaptability. Additionally, this review identifies key barriers to biodigester adoption, including feedstock variability, maintenance costs, and policy constraints, while also discussing strategies to enhance their efficiency and accessibility. This review is novel in its comprehensive approach, bridging the technological, environmental, and public health perspectives on biodigesters in food waste management. Unlike prior studies that focused on isolated aspects—such as specific case studies, policy analyses, or laboratory-scale evaluations—this review synthesizes the findings across diverse real-world implementations, offering a holistic understanding of biodigesters’ impact. By addressing knowledge gaps in terms of health risks, environmental benefits, and economic challenges, this study provides valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders seeking sustainable waste management solutions. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Unearthing research trends in emissions and sustainable development: Potential implications for future directions,"Emissions play a crucial role in sustainable development since they are the primary cause of climate change, which has a significant impact on the environment. Emissions are connected with many sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations. Reducing emissions may contribute to climate change mitigation, clean energy delivery, and the socio-economic development of countries. Hence, a deep and thorough understanding of the research trends in emissions vis-a-vis sustainable development can provide the basis for mitigating their negative impacts on society. However, there have been no systematic analyses on emissions and sustainable development perspectives to the best of our knowledge, making it challenging to achieve deeper insight. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive bibliometric, visual, social network, and statistical analysis of 2,392 documents appearing in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) to understand hot topics, how knowledge is structured, and trends that are emerging in this field. This analysis reveals that there has been a significant and continuous increase in concerns about emissions and sustainable development in the past few years. China was the most prolific contributor since it produced the highest number of publications and maintained active research institutions. The co-occurrence and trend topics analysis indicated that ""sustainable development,"" ""greenhouse gas emission,"" ""climate change,"" and ""circular economy"" were recognized as emerging research fields. Furthermore, the keyword burst citation analysis indicated that sustainable development and clean development were the most commonly found terms in the list of emerging trends. The present study is first of its type to depict the specific research field related to emission trends from a sustainable development perspective. The study reveals that there is a dire need to develop cost-effective technologies to reduce emissions and more accurate methods for measuring and predicting emissions and climate change. This article calls on policymakers and research scholars to engage more explicitly in developing and practicing emissions technologies within the sustainable framework to resolve today's policy challenges.

Towards a Sustainable Future: Examining the Symmetric and Asymmetric Effect of Unstable Macroeconomic Factors on Initial Public Offerings Variability,"The research seeks to explore the symmetric and asymmetric effects of renewable energy, technological innovation, and ecological footprint on the variability of initial public offerings in the unique institutional setting of the Pakistani IPO market. The study used yearly data on the Pakistani IPO market and the macroeconomic variables from January 1992 to December 2020. Further, the study employed the linear and Non-Linear ARDL to investigate the symmetric and asymmetric nexus among variables. For that purpose, the stationarity of the variables was predetermined using Augmented Dicker Fuller (ADF) and Phillips Perron (PP) unit root tests. Additionally, the F-bound test verifies that IPO issuance and macroeconomic drivers are co-integrated. The findings show a symmetric and asymmetric relationship between IPO variability and macroeconomic variables under study. Renewable energy and technological innovation have statistically positive effects on IPO variability. On the contrary, the ecological footprint has a significantly negative impact on IPO variability. The weak condition of the Pakistani IPO market could be attributed to the slow adoption of technological innovation, the transition to renewable energy, and a high ecological footprint that attracts stringent regulatory and environmental compliance costs of going public. © 2024, Econjournals.

Is the electricity cross-subsidization policy in India caught between a rock and a hard place? An empirical investigation,"Functioning of the Indian electricity sector is often found to be characterized by policy-level inconsistencies and meddled with political interference at all levels of governance. The objective of this study is to analyse the effect of reform-based policies and regulations and political environment on the cross-subsidization process in India. A panel data econometric technique is used as an empirical strategy to establish such a linkage, covering 18 Indian states over 10 years. Findings reveal that a favourable open access environment has become a game-changer for industrial and commercial consumers to migrate from the state grid to other sources - preferably to renewables - leading to greater renewable energy penetration. This has implications for cross-subsidies. In addition, it emerges from the analysis that it is crucial for distribution utilities and state regulatory commissions to be independent in their functioning. Greater reliance on the state exchequer by the distribution utilities could endanger their autonomy; whereas the lack of financial independence of SERCs could negatively impact their abilities to operate independently. Finally, it is found that the process of cross-subsidization is not always based on the hard logic of expanding welfare, rather it is motivated by the entrenched political goals and ambitions. This is in tune with findings from earlier studies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
An integrative approach to successional dynamics: Tempo and mode of vegetation change,"Much of what is considered conventional wisdom about succession is not as clear cut as it is generally believed.

"Democracy and Health in Developing Countries: New Cross-National Evidence, 1990–2016","Scholars have long investigated the factors that affect health outcomes in less-developed countries. One debate that has increasingly intensified in recent years is the democracy and health relationship in comparative international context. Scholars argue that democracy does affect country-level health outcomes in less-developed countries, while others argue democracy does not affect country-level health outcomes. I estimate the effect of numerous democracy indexes on child mortality and infant mortality in developing countries using fixed effects regression models with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered by country. I find that multiple aspects of democracy exert significant beneficial effects on child mortality and infant mortality in less-developed countries. © The Author(s) 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Context-related mechanisms of policy sustainability: Governance reform of the protected areas in Lombardy,"The management of protected areas has been recognised as a particularly complex policy field, with many interacting actors and frequent conflicts. How policies survive potential or actual conflict is a matter of policy sustainability; policy manipulation can modify the roles and perceptions of policy actors to achieve outcomes closer to the desired ones—at least, desired by the enacting coalitions. The article investigates the governance reform of protected areas in Lombardy, Italy, focusing on the dynamics of policy sustainability amidst conflict and opposition. It examines how the Lombardy Region's 2016 reform aimed to consolidate the management of protected areas under the umbrella of regional park authorities. Despite the reform's ultimate goals appeared unquestioned, it encountered significant resistance from local administrations. The analysis focused on the context features (pre-existence of local cooperation agreements, and salience of the protected area), and mechanisms (reputation, and loss aversion) in place at local level. Their combination appears able to explain the varied outcomes of the reform, ranging from failure to partial success. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of benthic habitat mapping for science and managers: A multi-design approach in the Southeast Brazilian Shelf after a major man-induced disaster,"Seabed mapping is currently the baseline information for ocean management and conservation, and is an indispensable item within research and Marine Spatial Planning. Here, we use a case study and published data along the southeast Brazilian continental shelf to illustrate the concepts and ideas of potential benthic habitat mapping and the importance of having maps on different scales and the potential for using a multi-design approach. The case analysis presented here uses a regional map and distinct criteria (seabed geodiversity and biodiversity, and potential influence of a tailings plume) to define three areas along the continental shelf to be mapped in a high-resolution, as part of a marine monitoring program. The background of the case study is a tailing dam failure disaster that led to the input of iron ore tailings in the ocean, leading to a major environmental disaster. Three areas were chosen, including: a Marine Protected Area (MPA Costa das Algas), a major fishing ground (the Doce River prodelta/depocenter), and an understudied reef area (Forgotten Reefs). Potential benthic habitat mapping was carried out using acoustic surveys (multibeam echosounder acquiring bathymetry and backscatter) and ground-truthing (sediment samples and seafloor image). Results detailed the potential habitats throughout the three areas, providing primary information for the study of benthic habitats and their distribution. The multi-design approach indicated that although a regional analysis can indicate potential vulnerability as a first assessment approach, high-resolution potential habitat mapping (herein, 20 m or finer) is beneficial to evaluate and produce a higher-confidence level for decision-makers. Having an overall view of what and where to collect new and finer data would be best to identify vulnerable areas that, in this case study, could be threatened by plume dispersion and tailings accumulation. Our results support the delineation of priority areas aiming for monitoring, protection and guiding for other studies, besides the consolidation of habitat importance and the integration of various datasets through a hierarchical classification scheme. Although Brazil has never produced a regional or national habitat map for the entire continental margin, there are already conditions to plan, execute and maintain a habitat mapping program, partnering with Universities, Government Institutions (e.g., the Brazilian Navy), and the private sector. In the context of the UN Decade of Ocean Science targets, it is urgent to plan and implement a national database capable of supporting a habitat classification effort on a broader national scale, with the flexibility to support a multi-design or a multi-scale approach.

International container intermodal competitiveness: An empirical study from Chinese hub ports,"The global energy crisis and environmental degradation have prompted ports to strive for green transformation. Intermodal transport, as a green and efficient form of organization in the transport sector, currently has a lot of room for development. How can the competitiveness of intermodal transport be enhanced while realizing the green sustainability of ports? This study objectively evaluates the competitiveness of international container intermodal competitiveness of hub ports and analyzes the characteristics of 16 Chinese ports from 2011 to 2020. The obstacle degree model (ODM) and the panel Tobit model considering random effects are utilized to explore the complex multidimensional elements affecting the competitiveness of intermodal transport in ports. In addressing the imbalanced characteristics of intermodal transport in ports, a variety of augmentation pathways are devised using the dynamic multi-time period fuzzy-sets qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method. The results found that: (1) The competitiveness of intermodal transport in ports shows a “three echelons” structure, requiring the implementation of appropriate augmentation strategies. (2) Elements affecting the competitiveness of intermodal transport in ports are multidimensional, underscoring the significance of holistically considering internal and external elements. (3) The key to enhancing the competitiveness of intermodal transport in ports lies in striking a balance between economic development and prudent attention to multiple dimensions to ensure sustainability. This study enriches the empirical research on intermodal transport in ports. It provides valuable references for ports seeking new avenues of growth and for governments with effective management practices. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Activating the green revolution: farmland transfer and agricultural green technology innovation—evidence from China,"Green technology innovation is a key approach to advancing pollution control at its source. However, the endogenous motivation for agricultural green technology innovation in China is currently insufficient, with innovation growth declining yearly, impacting sustainable agricultural development. It is imperative to accelerate the endogenous motivation for agricultural green technology innovation and advance the control of agricultural pollution at its source. This paper adopts a market-driven perspective, utilizing panel data from 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2022, and empirically analyzes the impact of farmland transfer on agricultural green technology innovation through fixed effects models, mediation effects, threshold effects models, and case studies. The study finds that farmland transfer significantly promotes agricultural green technology innovation, and this conclusion remains robust after a series of robustness checks. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that this impact is more pronounced in regions primarily focused on the primary industry and grain production. Mechanism analysis indicates that farmland transfer promotes the growth of agricultural green technology innovation by increasing agricultural research investment, alleviating the predicament of insufficient research and development input in green technology innovation. Finally, threshold effects analysis shows that under the institutional framework of intellectual property protection, the impact of farmland transfer on agricultural green technology innovation presents a nonlinear “inverted U-shaped” trend. In the initial stages, farmland transfer promotes agricultural green technology innovation, but after reaching a certain scale, the innovation effect weakens, exhibiting a pattern of first rising and then declining. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatial data intelligence and city metaverse: A review,"Spatial Data Intelligence (SDI) encompasses acquiring, storing, analyzing, mining, and visualizing spatial data to gain insights into the physical world and uncover valuable knowledge.

"Temporal continuity of extreme precipitation events using sub-daily precipitation: application to floods in the Ebro basin, northeastern Spain","Extreme precipitation events have been studied widely in various regions because of their implications for hazard assessment and risk management, particularly those of a hydrologic nature. Extreme precipitation events have been commonly defined using daily precipitation series owing to a lack of long-term data at higher temporal resolution. However, because of their potentially dramatic consequences, intense sub-daily precipitation is of great importance for risk assessment. Here, we define a new concept of extreme precipitation event based on temporal continuity of that event through run analysis using hourly precipitation. The aim of this definition is to record intense precipitation events over a very short period as well as very persistent rainfall events that produce heavy accumulated precipitation over several days. Both types of event can present considerable hydrologic hazards and are not considered in the definition of extreme precipitation event that is based on a daily time scale. We applied this method to the 29 greatest flood events in the Ebro River basin during 2000–2014 to determine whether our definition can be used to identify events producing hydrologic risks. In addition, we compared the synoptic patterns and trends of events defined using this method and those based on a daily time scale. The results show that the new definition allowed for identification of the 29 analysed flood events (as opposed to extreme events based on a daily time scale), among which eight events were not identified. Moreover, using the new definition facilitates establishment of synoptic patterns and more detailed study of trends by discriminating events according to their duration. The results reveal how the use of daily precipitation can hide trends of shorter events, because positive trends are more dominant in extreme precipitation events at sub-daily scale. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society",Not About Sufficiency
Quantitative risk assessment of E. coli in street-vended cassava-based delicacies in the Philippines,"In the Philippines, rootcrop-based food products are gaining popularity in street food trade. However, a number of street-vended food products in the country are reported to be contaminated with E. coli posing possible risk among consumers. In this study, information on quantitative risk assessment of E. coli in street-vended cassava-based delicacies was generated. The assessment started with the prevalence and concentration of E. coli at post production in packages of the cassava-based delicacies. Combase growth predictor was used to trace the microbial population of E. coli in each step of the food chain. The @Risk software package, version 6 (Palisade USA) was used to run the simulations. Scenarios in the post-production to consumption pathway were simulated. The effect was then assessed in relation to exposure to the defined infective dose. In the worst case scenario, a minimum and most likely concentration of 6.3 and 7.8 log CFU of E. coli per serving respectively were observed. The simulation revealed that lowering the temperature in the chain considerably decreased the E. coli concentration prior to consumption and subsequently decreased the percentage of exposure to the infective dose. Exposure to infective dose however was increased with longer lag time from postproduction to consumption. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Investigating how relational values influence landowner participation in an endangered species conservation program,"Research investigating landowner engagement in endangered species conservation (ESC) frequently cites value conflicts between landowners and ESC institutions, such as Voluntary Incentive Programs (VIPs), as driving landowner disinterest in VIPs. Existing ESC policy design mechanisms are incapable of resolving deficient engagement as they incorporate landowner values into decision-making without consideration of the meanings landowners attach to relationships with their land (i.e. Relational Values [RVs]). To identify RVs motivating ESC and points of alignment between landowner values and VIPs, we conducted 24 interviews with landowners about a VIP in East-central Texas. Results revealed that the program aligned with stewardship and management values but interfered with RVs of autonomy and social responsibility. Moreover, VIPs failed to provide incentives to compensate such losses. Bridging the rift between hegemonically designed VIPs and the values motivating ESC requires grassroots efforts to identify and incorporate landowner values into incentive structures that enhance and enable RVs motivating ESC. © 2023 Newcastle University.",Not About Sufficiency
Smallholder farmers’ perceived evaluation of agricultural drought adaptation technologies used in Uganda: Constraints and opportunities,"Many smallholder farmers in semi-arid areas continue to face increasing threats of agricultural drought exacerbated by a rapidly changing climate. This calls for increased understanding of farmers' drought response experiences and perceptions for better agricultural production. This study assessed the smallholder farmers’ perceived evaluation of drought adaptation technologies, constraints and opportunities in drought prone districts of Uganda. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using semi-structured questionnaires. The evaluation indicators of the technologies included efficiency, effectiveness, equity, acceptability, urgency and institutional compatibility performance measures. The findings show that among the irrigation technologies, drip irrigation systems were the most efficient, effective, acceptable and urgent performance measures (p < 0.05). The rainwater harvesting technologies used were perceived to be significant for all the considered performance measures (p < 0.05). In the agroforestry category, agrisilviculture and agrosilvopastoral were significant (p < 0.05) for the assessed indicators. The significant constraints were unreliable rainfall, high technology operational costs, limited labour and technical support (p < 0.05). This study reveals that market prices, efficient use of water, improved labour and time saving are important for adoption and use of drought adaptation technologies.

Carbon tax ethics,"Ideal carbon tax policy is internationally coordinated, fully internalizes externalities, redistributes revenues to those harmed, and is politically acceptable, generating predictable market signals. Since nonideal circumstances rarely allow all these conditions to be met, moral issues arise. This paper surveys some of the work in moral philosophy responding to several of these issues. First, it discusses the moral drivers for estimates of the social cost of carbon. Second, it explains how national self-interest can block climate action and suggests international policies—carbon border tax adjustments and carbon clubs—that can help address these concerns. Third, it introduces some of the social science literature about the political acceptability of carbon taxes before addressing a couple common public concerns about carbon taxes. Finally, it introduces four carbon revenue usage options, arguing that redistributive and climate compensation measures are most morally justified.

"Utilization of Pepeta, a locally processed immature rice-based food product, to promote food security in Tanzania","Consumption of pepeta, a traditionally processed immature rice product, is common in Tanzania, where it contributes to food security as an early rice food i.e. when there is no other food available at the household while the crops in the field not yet fully ripe. Many production steps are needed to guarantee a consistent, good quality pepeta product, and this hinders its utilization in other rice-growing sub-Saharan regions. This study aims to gain insight into the pepeta processing knowledge and final product, and assess variations in the processing conditions and parameters across the study area. A survey among 257 Tanzanian processors and consumers revealed that the pepeta product is widely known, rated second (73.5% respondents) as rice-based food after wali (cooked white rice, (100%)) and linked to traditions of the communities in the study area. Harvest of immature rice grain, roasting, pounding, cleaning, and packing are the main process steps of pepeta production. Method of rice harvest, rice suitability for pepeta production after optimum harvest, dryness of grains and number of pounding as indicator to terminate roasting and pounding process respectively, and packaging materials used varied significantly across respondents in the study area. Reported criteria considered by respondents for product acceptability did not vary significantly across study area. The criteria include colour (76.5%), general appearance (60.8%), texture (64.7%) and taste (52.9%). Immature rice paddy and pepeta were sold at a higher price than mature rice paddy and white rice, respectively, which implies that options to facilitate pepeta processing through, for instance, standardization of processing conditions and parameters could lead to increased income. © 2021 Miraji et al.

"Use of Biomaterials in the Field of Biomedical Engineering: Current Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities in Implementations","The development and improvement of biomaterials are particularly motivated by the necessity to attain the physical and biological needs of injured tissues. A new category of materials that react to various external stimuli is multi-functional biomaterials. Such biomaterials are enhanced to fully or partially replace a tissue, organ, or bodily function in an effort to maintain or improve the individual’s standard of living. As a result, there is a greater demand for biopolymers for their biocompatibility, non-antigenicity, biodegradability, and economic viability. Biomaterials that degrade in the body while helping the body’s tissues regain their functionality are referred to as resorbable biomaterials. In almost all of the load bearing applications, metals are preferred due to their superior structural rigidity and high ductility. Proportionately, the necessity for leading insertable biomaterials that can handle distinguishing issues related to the cardiovascular system, orthotics, shock, backbone, dentistry, and wound care has developed as a typical matter. The majority of natural biomaterials are biodegradable and can be altered by proteases and enzymes. Ingenious medical devices and treatments that only require temporary alteration of the implant site or resorbability can be developed using this property. A few metal-containing biomaterials that are frequently utilized are Ni, Fe, Ti, Au, Ag, Cu, Ce, Zn, Mg, Mn, Se, and Mb alloys. In particular, biomaterials can be fabricated to serve as an implantable biomedical device for lung sealants, intelligent wound dressing, laser welding with repair, dissolvable dressings, and zinc stents. Future research can be accomplished in integrating supramolecular, injectable, and immunomodulatory biomaterials and self-powered bioelectronics.

2 - Intergovernmental Institutions,"What have scholars learned over the past decade about the forces that shape the creation, design, and adaptation of intergovernmental institutions in earth system governance and their influence on state behaviour? Context characteristics - shared, science-based knowledge; the behaviours involved; and the availability of alternative behaviours - can shape institutional creation, design and adaptation. The strategies states, existing institutions and non-state actors deploy, in turn, can promote institutional formation despite challenges or inhibit it despite propitious conditions. Context characteristics also can pose larger or smaller obstacles to institutional effectiveness. Institutions prove more effective when their designs reflect political, economic and social constraints as well as major actors’ power and incentives. They shape material, ideational and normative incentives and opportunities that channel states toward positive behaviours and away from negative ones. New research can build on recent findings by investigating complex interactions at and across the international, transnational, domestic and subnational levels of earth system governance. © Cambridge University Press 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
Estuarine Acidification: Exploring the Situation of Mangrove Dominated Indian Sundarban Estuaries,"This book provides a cross-sectoral, multi-disciplinary assessment of different problems associated with estuarine acidification with special thrust on mangrove dominated Indian Sundarban estuaries. The arms of ocean acidification have extended to coastal and estuarine waters, where a wide spectrum of biodiversity thrives with unique adaptation extending several ecosystem services. Impact of acidification in these areas is a matter of concern as acidification potentially has more immediate effects on the health of estuaries and inshore regions as well as regional economies. Ground zero data collected for more than three decades have made the book stand on a strong base. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
"Review Study of Energy Efficiency Measures in Favor of Reducing Carbon Footprint of Electricity and Power, Buildings, and Transportation","Circular economy aspires to achieve environmental quality by minimizing resource input and waste, emissions, and energy leakage by which the environmental impact of any of these activities is equivalent to its carbon footprint production. To combat climate change, an immediate task that depends on the promise of a single alternative would be extremely dangerous. Instead, a variety of options are needed, including changing the composition of demand (using less energy), structural changes in the composition of the economy (dirty vs cleaner sectors and products, and different input mixes in production), low-carbon transportation, more energy-efficient technologies, and low-carbon (particularly renewable) energy sources. This study aims to address means of promoting energy efficiency implemented within socio-economic sectors: electricity and power, buildings, and logistics and transportation along with their carbon footprint impact. Starting from illustrating the notion of carbon footprint and ways of estimation, strategies for lowering carbon footprint are discussed. Moreover, this paper demonstrates three case studies of energy efficiency and reduction of carbon footprint. The first highlighted the effectiveness of employing geothermal renewable resources via analyzing the system to determine which of the cooling tower or shallow aquifer cooling is more efficient, to be implemented in the system. The second case examined and optimized a cogeneration system to achieve the optimum configuration as well as maximum energy efficiency. The third study investigated an option to decarbonize heavy-duty transport via fuel cell electric vehicles in Switzerland. Last but not least, to enhance economic development by enhancing energy efficiency and low-carbon approaches, carbon pricing should be on the top of climate policy makers’ objectives to promote and implement. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
"Optimization of carbon membrane performance in reverse osmosis systems for reducing salinity, nitrates, phosphates, and ammonia in aquaculture wastewater","This study investigates the performance of various types of carbon membranes in reverse osmosis systems aimed at reducing salinity, nitrates, phosphates, and ammonia in aquaculture wastewater. As sustainable aquaculture practices become increasingly essential, effective treatment solutions are needed to mitigate pollution from nutrient-rich effluents. The research highlights several carbon membranes types, including carbon molecular sieves, activated carbon membranes, carbon nanotube membranes, and graphene oxide membranes, all of which demonstrate exceptional filtration capabilities due to their unique structural properties. Findings reveal that these carbon membranes can achieve removal efficiencies exceeding 90 % for critical pollutants, thereby significantly improving water quality and supporting environmental sustainability. The study also explores the development of hybrid membranes and nanocomposites, which enhance performance by combining the strengths of different materials, allowing for customized solutions tailored to the specific requirements of aquaculture wastewater treatment. Additionally, operational parameters such as pH, temperature, and feed water characteristics are crucial for maximizing membrane efficiency. The integration of real-time monitoring technologies is proposed to enable prompt adjustments to treatment processes, thereby improving system performance and reliability. Overall, this research emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers and industry stakeholders to drive innovation in advanced filtration technologies. The findings underscore the substantial potential of carbon membranes in tackling the pressing water quality challenges faced by the aquaculture sector, ultimately contributing to the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems and ensuring compliance with environmental standards for future generations. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Linking entrepreneurial competencies, innovation and sustainable performance of manufacturing SMEs","Purpose: The purpose of this study is twofold: to examine the impact of entrepreneurial competencies and innovation on manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) sustainable performance and to explore the role of innovation as a mediator on the relationship between entrepreneurial competencies and manufacturing SMEs' sustainable performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data collected from manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia were analysed via the partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. Findings: The results reveal that entrepreneurial competencies play a robust and noteworthy role in promoting innovation and the sustainable performance of manufacturing SMEs, respectively. Further, innovation has a partially mediated effect on the link between entrepreneurial competencies and manufacturing SMEs' sustainable performance. Manufacturing SMEs' aspirations to be the first to market with new products are reflected in these SMEs' implementation of positive entrepreneurial competencies or capabilities which enable them to scan the environment to identify high-quality business opportunities and respond through these SMEs' Research and Development (R&D) activities to create products that provide real benefit to customers' needs. Hence, these SME's seize the market opportunities. Practical implications: Manufacturing SMEs' sustainable performance should be strengthened by linking entrepreneurial competencies with innovation to nurture greater agility to respond quickly to change and market demands. These SMEs should conduct tactical meetings on a regular basis to discuss current projects and assess critical indicators, as well as to identify and test fresh ideas for innovation and new business ventures in order to achieve sustainable performance in challenging business environments. Originality/value: By applying the resource-based view (RBV) theory and the triple bottom line (TBL) framework into a single framework, this study highlights the role of innovation as a meaningful mediator between entrepreneurial competencies and manufacturing SMEs' sustainable performance. As exploration of this relationship has been very limited, the study makes a novel contribution to the extant literature. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Awareness of information and communication technology induced climate change and the developing countries,"Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is central to every aspect of our lives and it has influenced peoples’ lives positively and negatively. The objective of this study is three fold: To explore how ICT contributes to carbon footprint generation. To determine how carbon footprint influence climate change. Thirdly suggest ways that can be used to reduce carbon footprint caused by ICT disposal. In this narrative review paper the online databases were searched for literature including grey literature. Papers included in this narrative reviews were written in English only. Hand searches of the references of retrieved literature was also conducted. ICT contributes to the production of carbon footprint. The amount of produced carbon footprint traps the heat in the atmosphere thereby raising the global temperature. Most people in the developing countries are not aware of how ICT contributes to global warming and climate change. Good side of ICT is that it can also act as “reducing agent” of carbon footprint generated itself and by other industries. Global warming and cause of climate change, is due to human made activities. For example, hazardous emissions of e-waste to the environment are man-made. People in developing countries are unaware about climate change, global warming and harmful effects of e-waste to the environment. To minimise carbon footprint generated by e-waste during disposal, this paper suggests proper management strategies. Formal recycling is identified as safer management strategy and friendly to the environment relative to informal recycling. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Not About Sufficiency
SARS-COV-2 and the (Dark) future of society: A machiavellian approach to the end of body sovereignty and the beginning of bio-feudalism,"As much as the event following 9/11 triggered massive changes in our understanding of privacy rights and increased our level of acceptance of government infringement on individuals' freedom, the pandemic of the SARS-COV-2 is threatening to change our understanding of societal hierarchy and democratic process. In this essay, we imagine a society where two classes, defined by their susceptibility to infection, emerge, and a neo-feudal system is established. We suggest that it is possible to evaluate how likely a dystopian outcome is by using Machiavelli's understanding of the impact of the Plague on medieval Florence. We also recommend following his advice to avoid such a drift by reaffirming the primacy of politics over scientism. Copyright © 2021 Andrea Molle",Not About Sufficiency
Control of Human Parasitic Diseases: Context and Overview,"The control of parasitic diseases of humans has been undertaken since the aetiology and natural history of the infections was recognized and the deleterious effects on human health and well-being appreciated by policy makers, medical practitioners and public health specialists. However, while some parasitic infections such as malaria have proved difficult to control, as defined by a sustained reduction in incidence, others, particularly helminth infections can be effectively controlled. The different approaches to control from diagnosis, to treatment and cure of the clinically sick patient, to control the transmission within the community by preventative chemotherapy and vector control are outlined. The concepts of eradication, elimination and control are defined and examples of success summarized. Overviews of the health policy and financing environment in which programmes to control or eliminate parasitic diseases are positioned and the development of public-private partnerships as vehicles for product development or access to drugs for parasite disease control are discussed. Failure to sustain control of parasites may be due to development of drug resistance or the failure to implement proven strategies as a result of decreased resources within the health system, decentralization of health management through health-sector reform and the lack of financial and human resources in settings where per capita government expenditure on health may be less than $US 5 per year. However, success has been achieved in several large-scale programmes through sustained national government investment and/or committed donor support. It is also widely accepted that the level of investment in drug development for the parasitic diseases of poor populations is an unattractive option for pharmaceutical companies. The development of partnerships to specifically address this need provides some hope that the intractable problems of the treatment regimens for the trypanosomiases and leishmaniases can be solved in the not too distant future. However, it will be difficult to implement and sustain such interventions in fragile health services often in settings where resources are limited but also in unstable, conflict-affected or post-conflict countries. Emphasis is placed on the importance of co-endemicity and polyparasitism and the opportunity to control parasites susceptible to cost-effective and proven chemotherapeutic interventions for a package of diseases which can be implemented at low cost and which would benefit the poorest and most marginalized groups. The ecology of parasitic diseases is discussed in the context of changing ecology, environment, sociopolitical developments and climate change. These drivers of global change will affect the epidemiology of parasites over the coming decades, while in many of the most endemic and impoverished countries parasitic infections will be accorded lower priority as resourced stressed health systems cope with the burden of the higher-profile killing diseases viz., HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. There is a need for more holistic thinking about the interactions between parasites and other infections. It is clear that as the prevalence and awareness of HIV has increased, there is a growing recognition of a host of complex interactions that determine disease outcome in individual patients. The competition for resources in the health as well as other social sectors will be a continuing challenge; effective parasite control will be dependent on how such resources are accessed and deployed to effectively address well-defined problems some of which are readily amenable to successful interventions with proven methods. In the health sector, the problems of the HIV/AIDS and TB pandemics and the problem of the emerging burden of chronic non-communicable diseases will be significant competitors for these limited resources as parasitic infections aside from malaria tend to be chronic disabling problems of the poorest who have limited access to scarce health services and are representative of the poorest quintile. Prioritization and advocacy for parasite control in the national and international political environments is the challenge. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
A review of graphical methods to map the natural hazard-to-wellbeing risk chain in a socio-ecological system,"The popular concept of wellbeing has added multiple dimensions to the current socio-economic measures of vulnerability from natural hazards. Due to the wellbeing concept's relevance in various policy agendas, there is a need for a stronger integration of what is predominantly a socio-economic concept into the natural hazards space. Graphical methods have been used as transdisciplinary engagement tools to translate verbal descriptions of socio-ecological systems into simulation models able to test hypotheses. The purpose of this article is to identify the graphical methods that have been used in the literature to graphically represent, structure and model different segments of the hazard risk chain. A thorough review of the literature on natural hazards was performed using a set of keywords and filters that resulted in a total of 94 articles, which were then categorised based on the graphical methods used, broad families, properties, hazard types, and segments along the risk chain considered. A case study on volcanic hazards in Mount Taranaki, New Zealand showcased ways forward by conceptually combining methods to link hazards to impacts on wellbeing. Out of the review it was identified that the most widely used methodologies in the natural hazards space are probabilistic graphs (e.g. Bayesian networks) representing the random nature of hazards while mapping methods based on System Dynamic principles (SD) (e.g. causal loop diagrams) are used to characterise the dynamically emergent behaviours of socio-economic agents. While studies linking hazards to wellbeing using graphs are scarce, there is a nascent literature on the characterisation of wellbeing's multi-dimensionality using networks and SD diagrams. Hence, the possibilities to use common methods, or combinations of these, are numerous potentially enabling the creation of graph-based, distilled simulation models that can be used by experts from different backgrounds to quantitatively model the wellbeing impacts exerted by natural hazards. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"From land productivity trends to land degradation assessment in Mozambique: Effects of climate, human activities and stakeholder definitions","Remote sensing observations such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) trends can provide important insights into past and present land condition. However, they do not directly provide comprehensive information about our representation of land degradation and the processes at work. This study aimed to analyze vegetation productivity underlying factors in order to assess land degradation and to highlight the impact of definitions on its quantitative assessment, using Mozambique as case-study. Land productivity change were first analyzed using NDVI time-series (2000–2016), and a two-step framework was then used to understand the main factors of these productivity changes. The impact of land degradation's definition was assessed based on four types of stakeholder, with different priorities in terms of ecosystem services. The results show that 25% of the country display a significant land productivity decrease, while only 3% display a land productivity increase. A large part of these land productivity changes (>61% of the decrease, and >98% of the increase) is directly assigned to human activities, such as native forest growth or tree plantations (for the increase), or forest degradation, deforestation and loss of grassland productivity (for the decrease). We showed that the fraction of degraded land varies according to stakeholders' definitions, ranging from 12% to 20% of the Country, much less than the 39% estimated by Tier 1 United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. This study provides a sound methodological framework for assessing land degradation status that could help stakeholders to design national and locally relevant land degradation mitigation policies or programmes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Handbook of Sustainability for the Food Sciences,"Many books on sustainability have been written in the last decade, most of them dealing with agricultural systems, communities, and general business practices. In contrast, Handbook of Sustainability for the Food Sciences presents the concept of sustainability as it applies to the food supply chain from farm to fork but with a special emphasis on processing. Structured in four sections, Handbook of Sustainability for the Food Sciences first covers the basic concepts of environmental sustainability and provides a detailed account of all the impacts of the food supply chain. Part two introduces the management principles of sustainability and the tools required to evaluate the environmental impacts of products and services as well as environmental claims and declarations. Part three looks at ways to alleviate food chain environmental impacts and includes chapters on air emissions, water and wastewater, solid waste, energy, packaging, and transportation. The final part summarizes the concepts presented in the book and looks at the measures that will be required in the near future to guarantee long term sustainability of the food supply chain. Handbook of Sustainability for the Food Sciences is aimed at food science professionals including food engineers, food scientists, product developers, managers, educators, and decision makers. It will also be of interest to students of food science. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
"Initial physiochemical characterization of Djulis (Chenopodium formosanum) spent mushroom substrate biochar and its application for methylene blue dye adsorption, isotherm, kinetics, and parameters","This study presents the initial physiochemical characterization of Djulis (Chenopodium formosanum) spent mushroom substrate (SMS) biochar and its application for methylene blue (MB) dye adsorption. Biochar was produced over a wide temperature range; 800 °C and 60-min retention time resulted in the best product having a specific surface area of 289.44 m2 g−1. Functional group analysis revealed the presence of hydroxyl (OH) and carboxyl (COOH) groups. MB adsorption was evaluated under different conditions: dosage, pH (3–11), and temperature. Increased biochar dosage and higher temperatures improved MB removal efficiency. Zeta potential (ζ) values (− 11.43 to − 45.6 mV) indicated stable suspension. The pseudo-first-order (PFO) and pseudo-second-order (PSO) models had close R2 values with the PSO’s being greater in general. Maximum adsorption capacity (qe) was 41.161 mg g−1. Although the intraparticle diffusion (IPD) model fit the data well, the C value suggested the involvement of additional mechanisms. Isotherm analysis demonstrated that the Freundlich model provided the better fit (R2 = 0.940), with adsorption constants KF = 10.755 and n = 1.788, indicating a heterogeneous surface and some form of physisorption. These results suggest that unmodified Djulis SMS biochar is a promising candidate for MB adsorption and can potentially be enhanced for more effective wastewater treatment applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Preparing for a low-energy future,"Nearly all official forecasts see ever-rising levels for global energy consumption, in line with forecast continued global economic growth. Global primary energy use is thus anticipated to increase from its present level of over 500EJ (EJ=exajoule=1018J), to as much as 1000EJ by 2050. We argue that it is unlikely that anywhere near this level of energy will be available in 2050, because of resource and environmental constraints on fossil fuels, which presently account for over 80% of global primary energy use, and time and other constraints on rapid uptake of alternatives. Instead we propose that the world will need to make do with far lower levels of energy than we use today. We give an outline of the way presently high energy use societies must change to accommodate lower levels of per capita consumption. This will involve replacing present growth-oriented economies by ones based on human needs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Future Directions in the Use of SAbR for the Treatment of Oligometastatic Cancers,"The role of local therapy as a sole therapy or part of a combined approach in treating metastatic cancer continues to evolve. The most obvious requirements for prudent implementation of local therapies like stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAbR) to become mainstream in treating oligometastases are (1) Clear guidance as to what particular patients might benefit, and (2) Confirmation of improvements in outcome after such treatments via clinical trials. These future directional requirements are non-negotiable. However, innovation and research offer many more opportunities to understand and improve therapy. Identifying candidates and personalizing their therapy can be afforded via proteomic, genomic and epigenomic characterization techniques. Such molecular profiling along with liquid biopsy opportunities will both help select best therapies and facilitate ongoing monitoring of response. Technologies both to find targets and help deliver less-toxic therapy continue to improve and will be available in the marketplace. These technologies include molecular-based imaging (eg, PET-PSMA), FLASH ultra-high dose rate platforms, Grid therapy, PULSAR adaptive dosing, and MRI/PET guided linear accelerators. Importantly, a treatment approach beyond oligometastastic could evolve including a rationale for using SAbR in the oligoprogressive, oligononresponsive, oligobulky and oligolethal settings as well as expansion beyond oligo- toward even plurimetastastic disease. In any case, lessons learned and experiences required by the implementation of using SAbR in oligometastatic cancer will be revisited. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
A CULTURAL HISTORY OF CHEMISTRY: IN THE MODERN AGE: VOLUME 6,"A Cultural History of Chemistry: Volumes 1-6 is a 2023 CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title A Cultural History of Chemistry in the Modern Age covers the period from 1914 to the present. The impact of chemistry and the chemical industry on science, war, society, and the economy has made this era the “Chemical Age”. Having prospered in the West, chemical science spread across the globe and slowly became more diversified in terms of its ethnic and gendered mix. After flourishing for sixty years, the chemical industry was impacted by the Oil Crisis of the 1970s and became almost invisible in the West. While the industry has clearly delivered many benefits to society-such as new materials and better drugs-it has been excoriated by critics for its impact on the environment. The six-volume set of the Cultural History of Chemistry presents the first comprehensive history from the Bronze Age to today, covering all forms and aspects of chemistry and its ever-changing social context. The themes covered in each volume are theory and concepts; practice and experiment; laboratories and technology; culture and science; society and environment; trade and industry; learning and institutions; art and representation. © Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
The big ecological questions inhibiting effective environmental management in Australia,"The need to improve environmental management in Australia is urgent because human health, well-being and social stability all depend ultimately on maintenance of life-supporting ecological processes. Ecological science can inform this effort, but when issues are socially and economically complex the inclination is to wait for science to provide answers before acting. Increasingly, managers and policy-makers will be called on to use the present state of scientific knowledge to supply reasonable inferences for action based on imperfect knowledge. Hence, one challenge is to use existing ecological knowledge more effectively; a second is to tackle the critical unanswered ecological questions. This paper identifies areas of environmental management that are profoundly hindered by an inability of science to answer basic questions, in contrast to those areas where knowledge is not the major barrier to policy development and management. Of the 22 big questions identified herein, more than half are directly related to climate change. Several of the questions concern our limited understanding of the dynamics of marine systems. There is enough information already available to develop effective policy and management to address several significant ecological issues. We urge ecologists to make better use of existing knowledge in dialogue with policy-makers and land managers. Because the challenges are enormous, ecologists will increasingly be engaging a wide range of other disciplines to help identify pathways towards a sustainable future. © 2009 CSIRO.",Not About Sufficiency
Design and Planning of Sustainable Supply Chains,"Supply chains play a significant role in global sustainability as they affect and are affected by several stakeholders, legislation, and cultures. When designing a supply chain it is critical to consider these elements so that a competitive advantage can be achieved in the long run.

There is then the need to develop decision support tools that can assist in such decisions. However, the complexity, uncertainty, and subjectivity involved in these decisions hamper the development of such tools and literature in the field, as overviewed in this chapter.

Corporate immunity during crises and pandemics: does ESG matter? Literature review and future prospects,"Purpose: This research aims at synthesizing the existing body of literature on the role of environmental, social and governance (ESG) during the Covid-19 global pandemic, identifying the research agenda and perspectives on the role of ESG during times of economic turbulences and pointing to gaps and future research directions in this area. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review of academic articles that focus on the role of ESG investments during the Covid-19 pandemic is conducted. These studies are identified based on searching/containing the keywords “ESG”, “Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)”, “Sustainability” and “Sustainable Finance” in combination with one or more of the following terms: “Covid-19”, “Pandemic” “and Crisis”. Then, the authors explore the key directions/themes in these papers, and highlight the main gaps and areas that are evolving as future research opportunities. Findings: The empirical findings provide overall compelling evidence in support of the role of ESG during times of crisis, especially when it comes to stock risk and volatility. For example, several studies report that ESG stocks are associated with superior stock performance (higher stock returns and firm value) during the pandemic, while other studies report that ESG act as a risk protection tool during times of crisis, as they document that ESG stocks are associated with lower volatility and lower downside risk during the Covid-19 crisis. Originality/value: To the best of the authors knowledge, no review of the literature on the role that ESG plays during crises and pandemics has been conducted before. Thus, it fulfills this research gap in the literature. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency

Possibility of Implementing Large-Scale Solar Desalination System in the Republic of South Africa,"This paper examines the viability of introducing solar thermal desalination technology as a means to supplement existing water production methods in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). The study provides an overview of the current state of desalination technology in the country. A key aspect of this study involves comparing the RSA with the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, using publicly available studies and reports. The focus of this comparison is to highlight the potential implementation of large-scale solar desalination in the RSA by evaluating the respective resources and environmental data that directly impact the input and output of a thermal desalination system. The study comparatively analyzes the environmental conditions and seawater salinity of the RSA and the MENA region. The RSA receives a higher solar irradiation range of 4.5–6.5 kWh/m2, whereas the MENA region experiences a range of 3.5–5.5 kWh/m2. Additionally, the salinity of the RSA’s seawater ranges between 35 and 35.5 parts per thousand, which is lower than the MENA region’s range of 36–40 parts per thousand. The study also reviews and proposes the adoption of an emerging thermal desalination method that has been successfully tested in the MENA region and other countries, based on its performance. © 2024 by the author.",Not About Sufficiency
A Monitoring Method for Corporate Environmental Performance Based on Data Fusion in China under the Double Carbon Target,"The production and operation of corporates have a significant impact on the environment, and it is crucial for corporates to operate in an environmentally friendly manner, especially in the context of the China double carbon target. Corporate environmental performance refers to the degree of impact on the environment and the degree of contribution to environmental protection by corporates in their business activities. Our study conducted an assessment and early warning system for corporate environmental performance by monitoring seven typical corporate environmental performance variables, including the green asset ratio (Gra), the proportion of environmentally friendly products (Pefp), and cash flow for environmental protection to total assets ratio (ECF), of 2718 non-financial listed corporates in China’s A-share market. The dataset comprised empirical data from the CSMAR database and multi-scale measurements collected by us. Among data-driven monitoring methods, deep learning is widely applied due to its powerful automatic feature extraction abilities. However, multi-time scale data is often encountered in industrial ecology-related data, as the different underlying physical quantities of various data result in inconsistent sampling rates. Multi-time scale data are incomplete and asymmetrical, making it difficult for traditional models to use directly for corporate ecological monitoring. In this article, an improved CNN-LSTM monitoring model based on data fusion is proposed to address this issue. This method employs unified vectorization processing to transform incomplete multi-time scale data into uniform complete data. An end-to-end diagnostic model is constructed to simultaneously optimize feature extraction and monitoring. In a multi-time scale corporate monitoring model, CNN can mine hidden features of data, while LSTM can further capture the time dependence of underlying time series. Compared to manual feature extraction that relies on prior knowledge, the proposed model can learn more effective data features. The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through empirical data experiments, which is beneficial for corporates in the context of double carbon emissions, providing a method for regulating corporate ecological indicators. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Conservation farming and changing climate: More beneficial than conventional methods for degraded Ugandan soils,"The extent of land affected by degradation in Uganda ranges from 20% in relatively flat and vegetation-covered areas to 90% in the eastern and southwestern highlands. Land degradation has adversely affected smallholder agro-ecosystems including direct damage and loss of critical ecosystem services such as agricultural land/soil and biodiversity. This study evaluated the extent of bare grounds in Nakasongola, one of the districts in the Cattle Corridor of Uganda and the yield responses of maize (Zea mays) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to different tillage methods in the district. Bare ground was determined by a supervised multi-band satellite image classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). Field trials on maize and bean grain yield responses to tillage practices used a randomized complete block design with three replications, evaluating conventional farmer practice (CFP); permanent planting basins (PPB); and rip lines, with or without fertilizer in maize and bean rotations. Bare ground coverage in the Nakasongola District was 187 km2 (11%) of the 1741 km2 of arable land due to extreme cases of soil compaction. All practices, whether conventional or the newly introduced conservation farming practices in combination with fertilizer increased bean and maize grain yields, albeit with minimal statistical significance in some cases. The newly introduced conservation farming tillage practices increased the bean grain yield relative to conventional practices by 41% in PPBs and 43% in rip lines. In maize, the newly introduced conservation farming tillage practices increased the grain yield by 78% on average, relative to conventional practices. Apparently, conservation farming tillage methods proved beneficial relative to conventional methods on degraded soils, with the short-term benefit of increasing land productivity leading to better harvests and food security. © 2017 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Domestication, crop breeding, and genetic modification are fundamentally different processes: implications for seed sovereignty and agrobiodiversity","Genetic modification (GM) of crop plants is frequently described by its proponents as a continuation of the ancient process of domestication. While domestication, crop breeding, and GM all modify the genomes and phenotypes of plants, GM fundamentally differs from domestication in terms of the biological and sociopolitical processes by which change occurs, and the subsequent impacts on agrobiodiversity and seed sovereignty. We review the history of domestication, crop breeding, and GM, and show that crop breeding and GM are continuous with each other in many important ways, but represent a momentous break from domestication because they move plant evolution off of farms and into centralized institutions. The social contexts in which these processes unfold dictate who holds rights to germplasm and agricultural knowledge, shape incentives to effect particular kinds of changes in our crops, and create or constrict biodiversity. Presenting GM as a continuation of domestication puts forward a false equivalency that fundamentally misrepresents how domestication, crop breeding, and GM occur. In doing so, this narrative diminishes public understanding of these important processes and obscures the effects of industrial agriculture on in situ biodiversity and the practice of farming. This misrepresentation is used in public-facing science communication by representatives of the biotechnology industry to silence meaningful debate on GM by convincing the public that it is the continuation of an age-old process that underlies all agricultural societies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Co-evolution and Fisheries Policy Implementation in Sub Saharan Africa,"The policy implementation process is often overlooked when policy is introduced, potentially leading to policy failure.

Application of blockchain technology for sustainability development in agricultural supply chain: justification framework,"Blockchain technology, is conceptualised as a type of disruptive technology and is regarded as one of the prime tools of Industry 4.0 today. The varied features of Blockchain like smart contract, decentralisation, transparency, traceability, data immutability and data privacy along with a consensus mechanism make it suitable to be utilized in the complex and multi—echelon supply chains of today. These factors improve the production processes and make the existing supply chains agile, resilient and responsive in the long term. Blockchain also add an aspect of sustainability which correlates with the phenomenon of circular economy in today’s world. Hence firms should compare and evaluate the significance of the traditional supply chain and blockchain-enabled supply chain in bringing the concept of sustainability in the supply chain today. This paper aims to highlight the benefits of blockchain in supply chain management with the help of a literature review along with opinions of experts from the agricultural sector. The key benefits identified are data privacy, decentralisation, immutability of data, smart contract, improved sustainability, building of resilient supply chains, transparency and shared database. These potential benefits of blockchain are assessed using the analytical hierarchical process technique. Global desirability index for traditional supply chain and blockchain—enabled supply chain is calculated. The high value of global desirability index of the blockchain-enabled supply chain over the traditional supply chain suggests that the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain is justified for bringing sustainability in the supply chain. This study aims to offer meaningful implications for practitioners so that they can take suitable measures for adoption of this technology. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Conceptual Model of Technical Sustainability for Integration into Electrical/Electronic Engineering Programmes in Nigerian Polytechnics,"Global warming is probably the greatest threat of this century. Several developed and developing countries have taken important measures to reduce its adverse effects, including greening their Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) curricula. However, Sub Saharan African countries are left behind to that effect, despite the fact that people in these countries are the greatest recipients of the global warming harmful consequences. The goal of this research therefore, is to investigate the suitable competencies in technical sustainability for incorporation into Higher National Diploma electrical/electronic engineering curriculum in Nigeria. The authors used mixed-method approach employing sequential exploratory design in the study. In the qualitative phase, we analyzed documents consisting of 10 journal articles and 3 skills standards, as well as conducted a total of 10 interviews with experts. Also, we carried out 3 rounds of modified Delphi survey using 28 participants to ascertain the appropriateness of the competencies suitable for infusion into the said curriculum. The study discovered competencies suitable for incorporation into the curriculum which include cognitive-related competencies in clean energy, eco-design, and RD; psychomotor-related competencies in sustainable production, waste-to-energy-technology, communication/ICT, and use of modern engineering software tools; and affective values related to engineering ethical responsibility, occupational health and safety, cooperation/teamwork, and equity. We analyzed only 13 documents, conducted 10 interviews, and administered questionnaires in 3 rounds of Delphi survey technique to 28 experts in only one geo-political zone of the country. Thus, conclusions derived from these sources rely on the genuineness of the information provided by the participants. The findings provided the researchers, accreditation bodies as well as curriculum developers with competencies in technical sustainability in the events of curriculum upgrade or renewal to integrate technical sustainability. The findings are the results of triangulated data elicited theoretically and empirically. © 2013 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
Rural Entrepreneurship and Innovation in BRICS Economies: Secondary Evidence from Rural Areas in South Africa,"It has been propagated by scholars and practitioners that entrepreneurship and innovation are potent tools that can be harnessed to transform rural areas, grow rural economies, create jobs, and enhance the prospects of attaining sustainable development goals (SDGs). Subsequently, these disciplines have garnered attention from researchers for virtually a century. Nonetheless, these researchers often focused on entrepreneurship and innovation activities in urban areas, thereby neglecting entrepreneurship and innovation activities in rural areas. Thus, there is a paucity of literature on rural entrepreneurship and innovation in the BRICS economies. Within the context of the agency theory and the Triple Helix Model of industrial policy, this study systematically reviews the literature on rural entrepreneurship and innovation in the Republic of South Africa. The study revealed that rural firms are risk-averse, which challenges the doctrine of rural transformation through rural entrepreneurship and innovation. Moreover, the ability to engage in entrepreneurship and innovation by rural firms is highly dependent on the availability of support from the government and actor networks. Subsequently, rural firms fail when support has been phased out. Thus, the government and actor networks should do things differently, with an emphasis on teaching rural firms to be independent and sustainable entrepreneurs and innovators. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Origami Housing: An Innovative and Resilient Postdisaster Temporary Emergency Housing Solution,"Over the last two decades, natural disasters have led to economic losses exceeding $2.97 trillion, causing 1.23 million deaths and affecting over 4 billion people through injuries, housing loss, displacement, and requiring emergency aid. Data have shown that physical, social, and economic inequities significantly contribute to the vulnerability of communities, especially after disasters. Therefore, low-income communities not only endure more severe and long-lasting infrastructure damage but also face over four times as many deaths per disaster. Natural disasters cause prolonged and widespread homelessness, leading to an inevitable temporary housing crisis, further exacerbated by delayed disaster recovery. This study proposes an innovative short-term Origami temporary emergency housing (TEH) solution, providing an equitable and affordable option to swiftly shelter potential victims postdisasters by considering material, construction, and transportation costs. This research aimed to address postdisaster homelessness challenges by: (1) understanding the timeframe for disaster recovery and TEH implementation following a natural disaster; (2) identifying the main challenges, vulnerabilities, and crucial needs faced by low-income communities postdisaster; (3) recognizing the key characteristics for TEH to be an adequate solution postdisaster; and (4) proposing Origami shelter as a solution for the housing crisis that arises postdisaster and validating its feasibility and applicability through surveying engineering, architecture, and construction (EAC) experts from Peru and Puerto Rico, given the frequent exposure and high vulnerability of these regions to natural disasters. The results underscore the need to implement TEH that can be quickly assembled, enabling victims to reside safely and resume normal activities while infrastructure systems and homes are being repaired or rebuilt. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Not About Sufficiency
"Localising Global Standards in Toba, Indonesia Through a Tourist-Centric Perspective of UNESCO Guidelines","This study examines the response to and support of the UNESCO recommendations on behalf of geo-tourism using the actual perspectives of tourists visiting the Toba region. The study employed a detailed map of Toba Geo-tourism in the Sumatra Utara Province, Indonesia, to provide a comprehensive understanding. The research was underpinned by a random sampling approach, gathering responses from a broad spectrum of tourists. The results captured an optimistic landscape, demonstrating a clear synergy between the UNESCO recommendations and the sentiments of the tourists. Not only did the guidelines resonate, but there was also a palpable feeling among tourists to either extend their stay or make a subsequent visit, provided the recommendations were implemented holistically. This study stresses the value of adopting and localising global sustainable tourism standards to suit a region such as Toba’s unique attributes and tourist expectations. By means of this research, we aim to amplify that dialogue, charting a path for Toba and similar regions to embrace a future that is both ecologically sensitive and visitor centric. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Determinants of adoption of small-scale irrigation practices as adaptation strategies to climate change stresses in Kersa District, Eastern Oromia, Ethiopia","This study was conducted to assess the factors influencing farmers’ decisions to adopt small-scale irrigation practices as an adaptation strategy to climate change in Kersa district, East Hararghe Zone, Oromia. The data were collected from a sample of 288 farm households (130 adopter and 158 non-adopters). Both qualitative and quantitative data were obtained from primary and secondary sources. A binary logistics regression model was used to identify the determinants of irrigation scheme adoption. The results indicate that the adoption of small-scale irrigation scheme was influenced by the age of the household head, dependency ratio, distance from water source, household size, frequency of extension contact, access to credit, livestock holding, off/nonfarm activities, membership in an agricultural cooperative, access to climate information, and perception of climate change, which had significant positive effects. Small-scale irrigation practices are a practical solution to lessen the effects of climate change stresses. Therefore, to improve rural farm productivity and lessen the effects of climate change stresses, the agricultural and natural resources office should focus scientific attention on the key factors that influence the adoption of small-scale irrigation. © 2023, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Who’s responsible for climate change? Untangling threads of media discussions in India, Nigeria, Australia, and the USA","Media representations of climate change play a critical role in shaping public perceptions and knowledge of climate change. Public understanding of climate change and the responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions are especially important, as these shape social problem definition, in turn influencing policy responses. In this study, we aimed to understand print media discourses on the existence and responsibility for climate change. We contrasted two Global North countries—the USA and Australia—and two Global South countries—India and Nigeria. We examined 600 newspaper articles, randomly selecting 50 articles each from three newspapers in each country. We conducted discourse analysis to examine narratives on climate change existence and who bears responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. We found media from all four countries agreed that climate change was real. Narratives of responsibility, however, varied between countries. In Australia, the primary narrative stated that India and China were responsible for the majority of emissions, while abdicating Australia from responsibility. In contrast in the USA, the primary narrative focused on the country’s own responsibility. In India, the primary responsibility was assigned to the Global North, while in Nigeria, all countries were considered equally responsible for global emissions. We demonstrated that media narratives for climate change responsibility were primarily driven by political discourse. As the majority of the public depends on media for information on climate change, it is essential that narratives of responsibility incorporate scientific evidence and not follow purely political expedient discourses to assign responsibility for action. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Can renewable energy transition drive green growth? The role of good governance in promoting carbon emission-adjusted economic growth in Next Eleven countries,"This study emphasizes green growth establishment in the Next Eleven countries, especially by boosting their economic output production rates while simultaneously containing their carbon emission growth figures. Notably, considering the novel concept of ‘emission growth-adjusted economic growth rate’ for selecting the proxy for green growth, the impacts exerted by renewable energy transition, good governance, globalization, urbanization, industrialization, and financial development on the process of greening the economies of the Next Eleven countries are evaluated in this study. Overall, the results derived from the econometric analyses endorse that undergoing renewable energy transition does not promote green growth unless the quality of governance in the Next Eleven countries is improved in tandem. Thus, good governance is observed to act as a mediator between renewable energy transition and green growth establishment in these emerging countries. Besides, the results confirm the green growth-hampering effects of international trade, urbanization, industrialization, and financial development. Conversely, financial globalization is found to be ineffective in influencing the objective of establishing green growth in the Next Eleven countries. Furthermore, conducting the analyses separately for the lower-middle and upper-middle income categories, the green growth-influencing determinants appear to be mostly heterogeneous across the alternative sub-samples of Next Eleven countries. Therefore, considering these critically important findings, several green growth-stimulating policies are suggested to the concerned governments. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Cleaner and sustainable synthesis of high-quality monoglycerides by use of enzyme technologies: techno-economic and environmental study for monolaurin,"Abstract: Currently, monoglycerides (MG) are produced using a complicated energy-intensive technology that contributes negatively toward greenhouse gas mitigation. This work suggests a cleaner and simpler one-step enzymatic production of α-monolaurin in an inert membrane reactor, where the reaction and enzyme separation are conducted simultaneously in one unit. Candida antarctica lipase (Lipozyme 435) was used to catalyze the esterification reaction between lauric acid and glycerin in a solvent-free system under mild temperatures. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the reaction conditions. The optimal conditions were a molecular sieve of 14.85% w/w, a temperature of 56.95 °C, an enzyme amount of 5.38% w/w, and a molar ratio of 4.75% w/w. The gas chromatography (GC) analysis showed that the α-monolaurin percentage was 49.5% when the enzymatic process (ENZ) was used. The conventional chemical (CHEM) and autocatalytic (AUT) esterification methods were also performed to study their proportional MG yields. The GC results showed the MG percentages of 43.9 and 41.7% for CHEM and AUT, respectively. Economic analysis was also conducted for the suggested enzymatic technique, and the findings were compared with those of the CHEM and AUT technologies. Using a plant capacity of 4950 t/year and 11% interest for the proposed ENZ process, the total capital investment of α-monolaurin production was preferably four times less than that of the CHEM process and three times less than that of the AUT method, presenting investment possibilities. However, the ENZ process showed the least profitability (net profit per day) among the three processes. Nevertheless, the return on investment and net present value for the ENZ process were preferably higher than those of CHEM and AUT because of its interestingly lower inside battery limit plant cost and less energy consumption. The AUT/CHEM processes generated a total carbon dioxide (CO2) exhaust of 678.7 t CO2 eq./year. In contrast, the ENZ process exhausted a total CO2 of only 50 t CO2 eq./year. The present integrated techno-economic and environmental study of α-monolaurin production emphasizes the green and cost benefits of the proposed ENZ technology.

Distance education initiatives and their early 21st century role in the lives of people with disabilities,"Technological advancement has broadened educational, employment and training opportunities for students and adults with disabilities via distance education. Distance education is a prized tool of K-12 and higher education, and for vocational training and research. Advancing knowledge of accessible technology and universal design concepts have coincided with the distance education movement, and with a federal mandate for accessible technology under Section 508 of the amended Rehabilitation Act. However, studies of website accessibility and universal applications designed to deliver online learning question whether these tools permit equal and effective participation by people with varying disabilities. Other studies of accessible virtual knowledge communities suggest needed improvements to advance the inclusion of people with disabilities in online collaborative research and training initiatives. This chapter explores the implications of the growing distance education movement for people with disabilities. First, we review the breadth of distance learning initiatives and their benefits and challenges for learners with disabilities. Second, we discuss applicable learning theory and practice, and the relevant mandates of U.S. disability laws. Third, we evaluate likely compliance on distance learning activities with disability law and propose best practices to support distance education programs for equal access and opportunity in employment, education, and other areas by the widest number and variety of people. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Sustainability assessment tools–their comprehensiveness and utilisation in company-level sustainability assessments in Finland,"Companies have a central role in the transition towards more sustainable economic systems, as they are one of the major sources of environmental impacts, economic activity and social development. Various tools are available to support sustainability assessments, but there is little information on how suitable they are for company-level assessments and how companies use them in real-life applications. The article examines some of the commonly used tools and the utilisation of these tools in Finnish companies. A sample of seven tools was compiled: multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), material flow analysis, life cycle assessment (LCA), input–output models, sustainability indicators and indices, cost–benefit analysis (CBA) and optimisation methods. MCDA, LCA, CBA and optimisation methods were found to be successful with respect to many of the criteria used in the evaluation, but none of them was comprehensive. The assessment indicates that MCDA has the greatest potential to be successfully applied to support sustainability assessment, but solely applying MCDA is not suggested, since MCDA needs input from other tools and methods, in order to have reliable impact assessments. Finnish companies regularly employ sustainability criteria and indices, and a few construction companies had applied LCA, but utilisation of other tools was rare. The findings indicate that the tools frequently discussed in research are not actually used by companies. Expert-driven sustainability trials and user-friendly, simplified tools could be a solution to issues of accessibility in real-world applications. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency

Avocado seed biomass-assisted synthesis of heterostructure bismuth vanadate nanomaterial by combustion method for the application of electrochemical lithium battery storage and supercapacitor,"With the global demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), research is focused on developing advanced energy storage materials with high energy and power densities. Hetero-structured nanomaterials have garnered significant interest in energy storage applications based on their unique architecture providing sites for improved electrochemical activity. This work reports a facile single-step combustion synthesis of bismuth vanadate nanoparticles (BVNPs) using avocado seed powder, an economical and eco-friendly fuel source. By optimizing the precursor-to-fuel ratio to 1:1, highly pure phase BVNPs were obtained as characterized via XRD, FT-IR, SEM-EDAX, TEM, UV-DRS, PL, BET, and DLS analyses. When assessed as an electrode material for LIBs, the BVNP1:1 delivered an exceptional initial discharge capacity of 2166 mAhg−1 and a retention of ∼53 mAhg−1 over 90 cycles with 99% Coulombic efficiency. The BVNP1:1 electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 545.65 mF/cm2 at 2 mA/cm2 current density as a supercapacitor. The combination of scalable green synthesis, excellent phase purity, and superior electrochemical performance makes these BVNPs a promising and sustainable electrode material for forthcoming energy storage technologies to meet the surging energy needs. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Complementary benefits of tourism and hunting to communal conservancies in Namibia,"Tourism and hunting both generate substantial revenues for communities and private operators in Africa, but few studies have quantitatively examined the trade-offs and synergies that may result from these two activities. We evaluated financial and in-kind benefit streams from tourism and hunting on 77 communal conservancies in Namibia from 1998 to 2013, where community-based wildlife conservation has been promoted as a land-use that complements traditional subsistence agriculture. We used data collected annually for all communal conservancies to characterize whether benefits were derived from hunting or tourism. We classified these benefits into 3 broad classes and examined how benefits flowed to stakeholders within communities under the status quo and under a simulated ban on hunting. Across all conservancies, total benefits from hunting and tourism increased at roughly the same rate, although conservancies typically started generating benefits from hunting within 3 years of formation as opposed to after 6 years for tourism. Disaggregation of data revealed that the main benefits from hunting were income for conservancy management and food in the form of meat for the community at large. The majority of tourism benefits were salaried jobs at lodges. A simulated ban on trophy hunting significantly reduced the number of conservancies that could cover their operating costs, whereas eliminating income from tourism did not have as severe an effect. Given that the benefits generated from hunting and tourism typically begin at different times in a conservancy's life-span (earlier vs. later, respectively) and flow to different segments of local communities, these 2 activities together may provide the greatest incentives for conservation on communal lands in Namibia. A singular focus on either hunting or tourism would reduce the value of wildlife as a competitive land-use option and have grave repercussions for the viability of community-based conservation efforts in Namibia, and possibly other parts of Africa. © 2016, Society for Conservation Biology.",Not About Sufficiency
Mapping Real Estate-induced Urban Expansion in Delhi NCR: A Synergy of Artificial Intelligence and Geospatial Models,"Urban expansion induced by real estate development is a significant phenomenon in metropolitan cities, especially in developing countries. Real estate development plays an important role in shaping urban landscapes, influencing spatial pattern, and socio-economic dynamics. Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), one of the fastest-growing metropolitan regions of India, provides a compelling case for understanding the drivers of real estate-induced urban expansion. This study aims to analyse the drivers of real estate induced urban expansion in Delhi NCR using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP NN) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. A comprehensive dataset comprising of physical, economic, demographic and spatial factors from 1990 to 2021 have been used for the analysis. The MLP NN model has been applied to assess the relative importance of drivers of real estate induced urban expansion in Delhi NCR. The results of MLP NN show that real estate expansion in Delhi NCR is primarily influenced by proximity factors, with the highest importance value of 0.21, observed for distance to regional centres (RC), followed by the distance to major centres (MC) at 0.16, and distance to utility services (US) at 0.14. Population density (0.12) and investment (0.08) also emerged as the main drivers. In contrast, physical factors like slope and elevation had the lowest significance values, 0.003 and 0.004, respectively are less important. The GWR model showed spatial heterogeneity in the influence of these drivers across the districts of Delhi NCR. The model exhibited high explanatory power, with an R2 value of 0.97 alongside an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of 416.49, which shows robustness of the model. This study highlights the significance of considering spatial heterogeneity in urban planning and policy formulation to address the dynamic nature of real estate-induced urban expansion for sustainable urban development. © King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring Nuclear Energy and Environment Interaction in Pakistan Using the Fourier ARDL,"This research examines the relationship between nuclear energy and environmental quality in Pakistan from 1971-2020 with the help of Fourier ARDL. In 2020, the use of fossil fuels, CO2 emissions, and the population had increased by 203.02%, 211.61%, and 101.18%, respectively, compared to 1990. This rise in contamination has caused a strain on the air quality in the country. To mitigate this, the use of nuclear energy increased from 0.18% in 1990 to 2.34% in 2020. The findings suggest that nuclear energy could be an effective policy for Pakistan if they want to improve its environmental quality. Additionally, it is projected that the detrimental externalities linked to pollution can be minimized in a year. Furthermore, with a 318% rise in energy imports in 2020 compared to 1990, it is vital for Pakistan to responsibly raise its utilization of nuclear energy to lessen its dependence on foreign energy sources and promote environmental quality. The economic repercussions of nuclear energy use in Pakistan are controversial; some studies suggest this increased usage might be impeding economic growth, while other studies suggest the opposite. This analysis seeks to examine the link between nuclear energy production and environmental damage using an appropriate method and scope. © 2023, Technical University of Kosice.

Biocuration of a Transcription Factors Network Involved in Submergence Tolerance during Seed Germination and Coleoptile Elongation in Rice (Oryza sativa),"Modeling biological processes and genetic-regulatory networks using in silico approaches provides a valuable framework for understanding how genes and associated allelic and genotypic differences result in specific traits. Submergence tolerance is a significant agronomic trait in rice; however, the gene–gene interactions linked with this polygenic trait remain largely unknown. In this study, we constructed a network of 57 transcription factors involved in seed germination and coleoptile elongation under submergence. The gene–gene interactions were based on the co-expression profiles of genes and the presence of transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region of target genes. We also incorporated published experimental evidence, wherever available, to support gene–gene, gene–protein, and protein–protein interactions. The co-expression data were obtained by re-analyzing publicly available transcriptome data from rice. Notably, this network includes OSH1, OSH15, OSH71, Sub1B, ERFs, WRKYs, NACs, ZFP36, TCPs, etc., which play key regulatory roles in seed germination, coleoptile elongation and submergence response, and mediate gravitropic signaling by regulating OsLAZY1 and/or IL2. The network of transcription factors was manually biocurated and submitted to the Plant Reactome Knowledgebase to make it publicly accessible. We expect this work will facilitate the re-analysis/re-use of OMICs data and aid genomics research to accelerate crop improvement. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

New perspective for eco-hydrology model to constrain missing role of inland waters on boundless biogeochemical cycle in terrestrial–aquatic continuum,"Recent research shows that inland water may play some role in carbon cycling though its contribution has remained uncertain due to a limited reliable data. From the viewpoint of scale similarity and discontinuity of eco-hydrological processes, it is important to identify spatial coupling of ecosystems including energy, materials, and organisms flows across their boundaries. One of the fundamentals of eco-hydrology model is to incorporate a complex relation between soil, water, temperature, plant, and carbon. In this paper, the author reviewed previous progress in eco-hydrology model focusing on surface–groundwater connectivity and hydrologic–geomorphic–ecological processes interaction. He also reviewed the recent progress in modeling, the role of inland water on biogeochemical cycle by compiling various datasets of hydrological and biogeochemical cycle. Then, he showed a new advanced model coupling eco-hydrology and biogeochemical cycle (NICE-BGC). The model results of both CO2 evasion and carbon transport to the ocean were reasonably in good agreement with previous data. In order to decrease uncertainty about carbon cycle, it became clear the previous empirical estimation should be extended to this process-oriented model and higher resolution data to further clarify mechanistic interplay between inorganic and organic carbon and its relationship to nitrogen and phosphorus in terrestrial–aquatic linkages. NICE-BGC would play important role in re-evaluation of greenhouse gas budget of the biosphere, quantification of hot spots, and bridging gap between top-down and bottom-up approaches in global carbon budget. This will also help to integrate knowledge and provide understanding needed for reaching sustainability by 2030 in UN Sustainable Development Goals. © 2016 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences",Not About Sufficiency

The asymmetric nexus of renewable energy consumption and economic growth: New evidence from Rwanda,"Existing studies on the impact of renewable energy consumption on economic growth, which was conducted in either middle/high-income countries or mixed sampled countries, produce the effect, but unfeasible in low-income countries. This study examines the asymmetric nexus of renewable energy consumption and economic growth, and the impact of agriculture and capital on economic growth by employing a non-linear autoregressive distributed lagged model (NARDL) and causality test from 1990 to 2015 in Rwanda. The results show evidence that renewable energy consumption affects economic growth. Asymmetric causality relationship, which is running from positive shocks renewable energy consumption to economic growth is noted. Furthermore, the unidirectional causality effect flowing from both agriculture and capital to economic growth for both positive and negative shocks is obtained. Therefore, the Government of Rwanda needs to realize positive economic growth from its investment in renewable energy consumption and agriculture as prior sectors of development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Discourse analysis of the perceptions of environmental justice and respiratory health disparities in Dallas, TX","This article examines the perceived relationships between environmental justice and health disparities among minority populations in the Dallas, TX metropolitan area. We study the varying discourses on EJ and respiratory health disparities, and how the local discourses are different from what is understood by planners and environmental advocates. We also ask how a participatory approach can provide an inclusive platform to strengthen the efforts to reduce health disparities. Utilizing a survey, a focus group of local residents, and in-depth interviews with local government officials, urban planners, environmental and health advocates, and urban ecologists, we identify and discuss key discourses of health disparities and environmental (in) justice to better understand different positionalities. Using Foucauldian discourse analysis, three discursive approaches were identified: “institutional racism”, “inclusion and recognition”, and “scientific evidence”. Drawing on these identified discourses we illustrate the importance of the political and social framings of environmental justice and health concerns and perceptions to better inform community health promotion efforts. The results highlight the importance of incorporating knowledges from various stakeholders in the analysis of environmental inequalities in parallel with the ecological understanding of environmental and human health disparities. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency

The political ecology of Yukon forestry: Managing the forest as if people mattered,"Over the past several decades a growing interest has emerged in the relationship between forest dependent communities and their use of non-timber forest resources (NTFR—i.e. berries, roots, barks). Motivated in large part by international concerns over the loss of biological and cultural diversity, efforts are now being made to conserve the world's remaining forests by repositioning NTFR to the forefront of the forest management process. Together with the Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation, we have undertaken an assessment that: 1) addresses the role of NTFR in fulfilling basic human necessities and well-being of community members, and 2) identifies the perceptual differences that exist among First Nation and non-First Nation community members regarding the security and future availability of forest resources. Based on our findings, we argue that if the true value of the forest is to be understood, and thus sustained, those involved in management must consider the full array of products and services the forest provides. Thus the conventional and over-simplified view that the forest is to provide primarily for commercial timber must be challenged in light of the multiplicity of values community members gain from forest use. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
"Overview of asean environment, transboundary haze pollution agreement and public health","The hazardous consequences of haze and fires compelled the ten fellow countries of ASEAN to conclude a historic regional agreement on transboundary haze pollution to confront this problem. This paper provides an overview of ASEAN environmental conditions, the failure of the Transboundary Haze Pollution Agreement, and the adverse effects of its failure on public health. The study argues that there is a potential in the region to overcome the haze problem; although the ASEAN haze agreement lacks enforceable obligatory provisions, it remains a beneficial vehicle for regional cooperation to eradicate transboundary pollution. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2017.",Not About Sufficiency
Estimating the Impact of Small-Scale Farmer Collective Action on Food Safety: The Case of Vegetables in Vietnam,"This paper is an original empirical attempt to explain the outcome of collective action in the domain of food safety. We examine conditions and institutions that influence pesticide residue levels in vegetables using econometric analysis on data gathered from 60 farmer organisations in Vietnam. Findings suggest that collective action affects safety in that it provides members with technical assistance and monitoring for pest management at the farming level. They confirm the U-shape hypothesis of the effect of group size on safety performance which derives from the trade-off that exists between economies of scale and free-riding. The contribution of public authorities and ecological conditions to food safety remains controversial, while market forces do not yet seem able to drive the production of safer vegetables. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
Maximising the benefits of rainwater harvesting technology towards sustainability in urban areas of South Africa: a case study,"Rainwater harvesting (RWH) technology has been in use for a long time, however its contribution towards urban water supply has been negligible in South Africa. Through a comprehensive literature review and analysis of interviews with key stakeholders, this case study presents implementation challenges and policy gaps in relation to the scale of adoption in the City of Johannesburg (CoJ). Findings show that only 0.1% of CoJ’s population utilises RWH due to various reasons, varying from financial viability, reliability, quality concerns, and system maintenance. This paper attributes these to the scale of adoption and suggests upscaling the system to larger commercial buildings to optimise benefits. However, there is an urgent need to bridge the policy gaps for successful implementation. Three categories of policy reforms are therefore proposed to facilitate innovation uptake, stakeholder engagement and compliance. This knowledge can guide future research towards urban water management, scientists and policymakers nexus. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
"Information technology, gender economic inclusion and environment sustainability in sub-Sahara Africa","Purpose: This study examines the relevance of information and communication technologies in the effect of gender economic inclusion on environmental sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The focus is on a panel of 42 sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2005–2020. The empirical evidence is based on generalized method of moments. The environmental sustainability indicator used is CO2 emissions per capita. Three indicators of women’s economic inclusion are considered: female labour force participation, female employment and female unemployment. The chosen ICT indicators are mobile phone penetration, Internet penetration and fixed broadband subscriptions. Findings: The results show that: (1) fixed broadband subscriptions represent the most relevant ICT moderator of gender economic inclusion for an effect on CO2 emissions; (2) negative net effects are apparent for the most part with fixed broadband subscriptions (3) both positive ICT thresholds (i.e., critical levels for complementary policies) and negative ICT thresholds (i.e., minimum ICT levels for negative net effects) are provided; (4) ICT synergy effects are apparent for female unemployment, but not for female employment. In general, the joint effect of ICTs or their synergies and economic inclusion should be a concern for policymakers in order to better ensure sustainable development. Moreover, the relevant ICT policy thresholds and mobile phone threshold for complementary policy are essential in promoting a green economy. Originality/value: The study complements the extant literature by assessing linkages between information technology, gender economic inclusion and environmental sustainability. © 2024, Cheikh Tidiane Ndour and Simplice Asongu.",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptive co-management of biodiversity in rural socio-ecological systems of Ecuador and Latin America,"Biodiversity management in Ecuador, and across Latin America, focuses on using protected areas for conservation purposes. However, this management strategy does not adequately consider biodiversity interactions with humans by neglecting socio-ecological systems that provide many benefits especially to indigenous and other rural peoples. This paper reviews successful examples of local applications of adaptive co-management that incorporate socio-ecological interactions and the benefits they provide to rural communities in Latin America. These examples show the potential of applying adaptive co-management to manage biodiversity and to revitalize the development of rural communities across the region. © 2022 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptive capacity to climate change: Does energy aid matter?,"The global call for augmented financial support to satisfy the growing requirements for adaptation funding, essential for enabling vulnerable groups to withstand the ramifications of climate change, has been resonant. Channeling energy assistance to developing countries may serve to ameliorate this shortfall. Through an empirical analysis using a balanced panel dataset comprising 64 countries from 2002 to 2020, the research investigates the role of energy assistance in enhancing the adaptive capacities of developing nations. Our analysis identifies critical areas with pronounced deficiencies in adaptive capacity, primarily situated in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Central Asia, and western South America. The study reveals that energy aid, notably in the forms of non-renewable, policy-related, and distribution assistance, significantly elevates adaptive capabilities. Although this assistance yields significant benefits for countries across various income levels, the impact is relatively greater for higher-income nations. Additionally, energy aid indirectly bolsters adaptive capacity by stimulating innovation, and an improvement in the quality of governance aids in enhancing the effectiveness of energy assistance implementation, especially for lower-income countries. The study concludes by offering nuanced policy insights aimed at donors and recipients alike, with the goal of augmenting the efficacy of aid to improve climate change adaptation. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
The mutual interdependences between safety and operations: A systematic literature review,"Safety and operations are pivotal areas of industrial sustainability, often considered in a trade-off. Although focusing both on the workplace, safety and operations are still mainly tackled individually, without exploiting or even recognizing the mutual interdependencies between them. The literature nonetheless started addressing the safety outcomes deriving from the adoption of operational interventions, and the operational outcomes deriving from the adoption of safety interventions, but the general discourse still lack a complete overview and a managerial perspective. The present study provides a systematic literature review, investigating the mutual interdependences between safety and operations, critically revising the extant knowledge from an industrial sustainability perspective. We identified several relationships considering different operations and safety-related aspects, while also recognizing factors moderating or mediating the relationships. The analysis of the literature underlines the need for a more sustainability-oriented integrated approach toward the identification and evaluation of outcomes, highlighting several still open issues and offering possible future streams of research. Particularly, the literature still needs to address the mutual relationships between safety and operations from a sustainability perspective and shortcomings are identified concerning the investigation of contexts, climates, specific interventions, and the decision-making process, above all from an empirical viewpoint. The study provides both academic and practical contributions, by analysing the current knowledge and offering insights to support the adoption and the evaluation of safety and operational interventions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Annoyance based vibro-acoustic comfort evaluation of as summation of stimuli annoyance in the context of human exposure to noise and vibration in buildings,"This paper presents the issues of assessing the comfort of people staying indoors who are exposed to vibrations and material noise caused by vibrations of partitions like floors and walls (ground-borne noise). Current criteria in the evaluation of vibrational and acoustic comfort cannot be assessed in the context of the simultaneous occurrence of stimuli such as noise and vibration. Railway transport, including passenger and cargo transport, is becoming increasingly prevalent, and new railway lines are being planned for environmental reasons. Sometimes, there are changes in stimuli produced by existing railway lines. For example, high-speed trains appear on an old railway track. Such a situation appeared on the Central Railway Line in Poland, which is still used by old trains, yet its operator plans to raise their speed limits. The analysis of the problem of the simultaneous occurrence of stimuli presented in this paper was based on measurements performed in a residential building located near the Central Railway Main Line in the city Zawiercie. Noise and vibration as the analyzed stimuli in both cases meet comfort requirements, yet when exposure to two stimuli was considered, comfort may be at risk. © 2020 by the authors.

Holocene glacial landscapes of the Scandinavian Peninsula,"The Scandinavian Peninsula is located between 55°N and 71°N, and 5°E and 32°E in Northern Europe. Numerous records of Holocene glacier variations from northern and southern Scandinavia have been derived mainly from stratigraphic investigations of proglacial lacustrine and terrestrial sedimentary sequences in combination with mapped marginal moraines. Mapping and dating demonstrate a rapid wastage of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet in the Early Holocene. By ~10.5-10.0ka, the ice sheet had largely melted. During wastage of the ice sheet, brief episodes of glacier readvance or stillstand occurred at ~11.5-11.3, ~11.1, ~10.5 and ~10.2-9.7ka. Remnants of the ice sheet that survived wastage during the Early Holocene, together with isolated mountain glaciers that existed beyond the limits of the ice sheet during Younger Dryas times, were briefly revived during the ~ 8.2ka (Finse) Event. During the Middle Holocene, Scandinavian glaciers were reduced in size and most, if not all, melted away completely, at least between ~7.5 and 5.5ka. During the Late Holocene, they reformed (neoglaciation), increasing in size in response to a cooler and more humid climate. Several century- to millennial-scale events were apparently superimposed on this trend, but none of these glacier expansion episodes exceeded that of the Little Ice Age. In Scandinavia, the timing and extent of the mid-18th century Little Ice Age glacial maximum have been well established based on historical evidence. Retreat from this maximum has been reconstructed from recessional moraines dated by monitored glacier-front variations, historical evidence and lichenometric dating. Since attaining their Little Ice Age maximum, Scandinavian glaciers have shrunk considerably. At present, Scandinavian glaciers cover an area of approximately 2620km2 and number about 5560 (>0.1km2), of which the vast majority are located in Norway and about 300 in northern Sweden. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis of the Environmental Management System based on ISO 14001 on the American continent,"The American continent is in broad economic and industrial development. Consequently, a more detailed discussion of the impacts generated by such development is needed. Moreover, there is an increase in the number of ISO 14001 certificates issued to this continent. Given the above, no studies were found that bridge the gap to identify the influence of different factors on ISO 14001 in the Americas. Thus, this article has as its main aim to check which economic, environmental and cultural factors have influence on ISO 14001 Certification in the American Continent. The data were collected in the ISO Survey, World Bank, United Nations Development Programme and International Energy Agency. Among the countries of that continent, thirteen were analyzed and only two did not show the economic factors as the influence factor in the multiple regression models fitted with Brazil and the United State. In these models, all presented environmental factors as influencing factors. Only in Brazil the index HDI presented as cultural factor in multiple regression model fitted. The economic factors: Gross Domestic Product and exports of goods and services and environmental: Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and fossil fuel consumption were the most influential in ISO 14001 certification. Venezuela, Uruguay, Colombia and the United States were countries that had factors dependent on each other, featuring the environmental marketing. Briefly, this study brings up several implications: to the academy, with the proposal of new concepts and guidance on the factors that assist in ISO 14001 certification in the American Continent. Additionally, taking into account the industry, the factors serve as efficiency parameters for the implementation of ISO 14001 standard, and for the Government to improve through factors that do not fit in multiple regression models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The international political economy of governing carbon,"How should 'we' govern carbon? More precisely, how should we govern carbon: in a global world where direct intergovernmental and public control over the actors and processes which extract and burn most carbon is either weak and indirect or often nonexistent; in a carbon-constrained world faced with dangerous levels of climate change, but in which political responses to the threat fall well short of what the science suggests is required; and in a world of extreme poverty and inequality in which large increases in carbon associated with energy use will be required to meet the basic needs of millions of the world's inhabitants? The first point refers to such issues as the weak and fragmented nature of global energy governance, where governments continue to resist the concession of power to regional and global institutions over a sector of such high strategic importance (Florini and Sovacool 2009; Newell 2011). The second refers to the scale of cooperation, political action and finance required to keep temperature increases below 2_C compared with preindustrial levels (the stated aim of the 2009 Copenhagen Accord), amid calls for US$100 billion to be made available annually by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation actions, and all in the context of a global financial crisis. The third refers to the 1.6 billion people who are still without access to electricity, who are the target of the UN's Year of Sustainable Energy for All. © Anthony Payne and Nicola Phillips 2014.

Soil carbon enhancing practices: a systematic review of barriers and enablers of adoption,"Sustained adoption of soil carbon enhancing practices (SCEPs) at scale remains an aspiration goal to maintain sufficient amount of soil carbon in household farms in order to impact on the sustained farm productivity caused by sustained soil fertility. The objective of this study is to systematically evaluate the current evidence base to identify: (a) which factors enable or constrain adoption of SCEPs and hence maintain soil carbon in Kenya and Ethiopia; (b) to be able to lessons learnt concerning what influences the adoption of the SCEPs for the purpose of maintaining soil fertility among smallholder farms; and (c) how this can be improved going into the future for the purpose of formulating appropriate policies in Kenya and Ethiopia in both the short and long run. A systematic review was conducted using established review methodology and extensive searches of published and unpublished literature sources. Data extraction and quality appraisal of quantitative, qualitative and case studies that met the inclusion criteria were conducted while checking for reliability. A broad range of interrelated enabling and constraining factors was identified for the SCEPs. All the factors matter, and some of most of these factors are important to be considered during planning and implementation of SCEPs aiming at promoting soil carbon sequestration. Despite the limitation in the quantity of evidence, this systematic review provides a useful starting point for the scaling up programmes to ensure more effective adoption of SCEPs. This review also underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach in understanding what determines the adoption of SCEPs to capture a holistic view. © 2019, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
What drives construction SMEs on CSR implementation during economic uncertainty?,"World uncertainty is currently at an exceptionally high level, leading to difficulties in business operations. This phenomenon raises questions about the necessity of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives for vulnerable organizations such as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they may deprioritize CSR to focus on surviving. The review of previous studies highlighted a limited theoretical understanding of CSR that existed during such challenging economic periods. This study aims to bridge this research gap by investigating the driving forces that motivate construction SMEs to implement CSR during economic uncertainty. Through a combination of literature review, semi-structured interviews, and hybrid fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory-Analytic Network Process methods, 13 drivers for CSR were identified and categorized into four clusters: human resources benefit, market pressure, organizational reputation, and financial benefit. Human resources benefit was recognized as the most influential cluster, and employee commitment and loyalty was the most critical CSR driver.

Energy mix diversification in emerging economies: An econometric analysis of determinants,"Energy mix diversification (EMD) is recognized as a plausible strategy for emerging economies to achieve energy security targets and meet net zero carbon emissions goals by 2050. Thus, this research explores the determinants of EMD utilizing a sample panel for seven major emerging (E7) economies, including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey, observed from 1995 to 2018. The Pedroni panel cointegration test investigates the long-run equilibrium, and the long- and short-run determinants are identified using a panel autoregressive distributed lag model. The findings reveal a long-run equilibrium linkage among EMD, carbon emissions, financial development, economic growth, technological progress, energy efficiency, and globalization. The long-run estimates show that energy efficiency and carbon emissions are driving forces for EMD, whereas technological progress, financial development, and globalization have insignificant effects. However, all variables - except economic growth are found to be the barriers to EMD in the short-run. The findings presented in this research are novel and add value to the energy literature by identifying the long- and short-run determinants of EMD, specifically for E7 economies. These economies are expected to take appropriate actions to stimulate the adoption of clean and green energy sources; thus, appropriate implications of the findings are discussed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Two decades of forest-related legislation changes in European countries analysed from a property rights perspective,"In the last two decades, attention on forests and ownership rights has increased in different domains of international policy, particularly in relation to achieving the global sustainable development goals. This paper looks at the changes in forest-specific legislation applicable to regular productive forests, across 28 European countries. We compare the legal framework applicable in the mid-1990s with that applicable in 2015, using the Property Rights Index in Forestry (PRIF) to measure changes across time and space. The paper shows that forest owners in most western European countries already had high decision-making power in the mid-1990s, following deregulation trends from the 1980s; and for the next two decades, distribution of rights remained largely stable. For these countries, the content and direction of changes indicate that the main pressure on forest-focused legislation comes from environmental discourses (e.g. biodiversity and climate change policies). In contrast, former socialist countries in the mid-1990s gave lower decision-making powers to forest owners than in any of the Western Europe countries; over the next 20 years these show remarkable changes in management, exclusion and withdrawal rights. As a result of these changes, there is no longer a clear line between western and former socialist countries with respect to the national governance systems used to address private forest ownership. Nevertheless, with the exception of Baltic countries which have moved towards the western forest governance system, most of the former socialist countries still maintain a state-centred approach in private forest management. Overall, most of the changes we identified in the last two decades across Europe were recorded in the categories of management rights and exclusion rights. These changes reflect the general trend in European forest policies to expand and reinforce the landowners' individual rights, while preserving minimal rights for other categories of forest users; and to promote the use of financial instruments when targeting policy goals related to the environmental discourse.",Not About Sufficiency
Resourcing Future Generations: A Contribution by the Earth Science Community,"The last 50 years saw a dramatic increase in living standards and improvement in the quality of life for many of the world’s poorest. Mortality rates fell, life expectancy rose and per capita incomes swelled. That improvement has been underpinned by technological development and the ubiquitous use of metal and mineral resources. To maintain such progress while addressing climate change and a rising world population, sustainable sources of raw materials will be required, in both developed and developing countries. Delivering the UN Agenda 2030 with its seventeen Sustainable Development Goals and implementing the Paris Agreement of December 2015 will require technologies that consume both traditional and new minerals. Metal recycling and technological change will contribute, but mining must continue and grow for the foreseeable future. Of the 200 or so countries in the world, 60 are open to large-scale mining but 140 are not. New resource governance linkages are needed between existing institutional frameworks so that continuity of global mineral supply is assured over coming decades. Such arrangements would oversee responsible sourcing of minerals, directions of mineral exploration and sustainability of mining and ore processing, raising of consumer awareness and sharing the wealth generated by mining more fairly. © 2017, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.",Not About Sufficiency
Discordant agendas on a just transition in Romanian coal mining areas: The case of the Jiu Valley,"Despite the promises that the just transition will bring more democracy and prosperity, there are legitimate fears that, in some regions, the pre-existing inequalities will be reinforced rather than rectified. Questioning how community resilience can be stimulated prior to and during coal mining closures, this paper focuses on Jiu Valley, a coal mining region in Romania. Using empirical and action research methodologies, this case study underlines the importance of considering the level of agency and different agendas of stakeholders regarding both the vision of their common future and the timeline for implementation. The article stresses shortcomings in implementing a just transition, including the issue of governance and mistrust towards local and national authorities, difficulties in orchestrating individual agendas to launch a collective action for the future of the region and, not least, poor information and delays of the mine closures. Concerning the hypotheses about awareness, preparedness and transition delays, this study pointed out some of the mechanisms that explain the scarce preparedness and why, both closure and transition, were repeatedly postponed. Furthermore, the research profiled the different actors and highlighted the challenges to address and roles of stakeholders to contribute to a just transition. © 2022 Sanda Nicola et al., published by Sciendo.",Not About Sufficiency
Conservation agreements as a tool to generate direct incentives for biodiversity conservation,"Many environmental issues can be attributed to misaligned distribution of the costs and benefits of conservation. For instance, biodiversity represents value for the global community, but biodiversity protection imposes various costs on local communities that depend on forests, marine areas, and other habitats of conservation importance in developing countries. Correcting this misalignment requires presenting these local communities with appropriate incentives. Conservation agreements—negotiated transactions in which conservation investors finance direct social benefits in return for conservation actions by communities—are one tool for doing so. This direct incentive approach departs from Integrated Conservation and Development (ICDP) approaches by explicitly linking benefits to verified conservation performance by resource owners/users, thus requiring effective performance monitoring protocols. In doing so, conservation agreements parallel the logic of easements and related mechanisms used in developed countries, but adapt that logic to property rights and governance challenges that characterize developing country contexts. This paper will present the conservation agreement model using examples of agreements supported by Conservation International's Conservation Stewards Program (CSP), and drawing on a recent portfolio-wide assessment of these experiences. Elements to be considered include conservation outcomes as well as socio-economic impacts and financial and institutional sustainability. Individual agreements in the CSP portfolio vary widely with respect to conservation objectives, including efforts to protect individual species, improve natural resource management, prevent carbon emissions from deforestation, and reinforce protected areas; the paper will argue that the conservation agreement model readily lends itself to tailoring for particular conservation aims as well as community development priorities. The paper will conclude by summarizing the strengths and limitations of the conservation agreement model and identifying key considerations for scaling up the approach to advance conservation and poverty alleviation at regional and national levels. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Airway inflammation after controlled exposure to diesel exhaust particulates,"Epidemiologic evidence suggests a link between morbidity and mortality and levels of particulate matter in the atmosphere. We studied the inflammatory response to inhalation of diesel exhaust particulates (DEP) in normal volunteers. DEP were collected from the exhaust of a stationary diesel engine and were resuspended in an exposure chamber. Ten nonsmoking healthy volunteers were exposed for 2 h at rest to a controlled concentration of DEP (monitored at 200 μg/m3 particulate matter of less than 10 μm aerodynamic diameter [PM10]) or air in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Exposures were followed by serial spirometry and measurement of pulse, blood pressure, exhaled carbon monoxide (CO), and methacholine reactivity, as well as sputum induction and venesection for up to 4 h after exposure, and a repeat of all these procedures at 24 h after exposure. There were no changes in cardiovascular parameters or lung function following exposure to DEP. Levels of exhaled CO were increased ater exposure to DEP, and were maximal at 1 h (air: 2.9 ± 0.2 ppm [mean ± SEM]; DEP: 4.4 ± 0.3 ppm; p < 0.001). There was an increase in sputum neutrophils and myeloperoxidase (MPO) at 4 h after DEP exposure as compared with 4 h after air exposure (neutrophils: 41 ± 4% versus 32 ± 4%; MPO: 151 ng/ml versus 115 ng/ml, p < 0.01), but no change in concentrations of inflammatory markers in peripheral blood.

Understanding Ethiopia’s maize innovation system: Application of integrated innovation system and sustainability transition perspectives,"Agricultural innovation is a top priority on the global sustainable development agenda to solve food insecurity, land degradation, climate-change issues, poverty, and unemployment. This paper aims to identify systemic problems and socio-technical transition factors that hinder the development, dissemination, and utilization of improved maize varieties in Ethiopia. Primary data were gathered through structured and semi-structured interview schedules, and then analyzed thematically. Results show that systemic failures such as the absence of key actors, institutional problems, lack of interaction between actors, and inadequate infrastructure are the major hindrances to the systems functioning. Three functions, including entrepreneurship, knowledge development, and creating legitimacy, were found to be weaker than others in the case of improved maize varieties released by Pioneer Hi-Bred Seeds Ethiopia Plc. However, these functions were stronger in the case of improved maize seed varieties released by public research centres. Knowledge dissemination and resource mobilization were the stronger functions of Pioneer Hi-Bred Seeds Ethiopia Plc., which were found to be weak in the public research centres. The result also shows that policies and governance affected the sustainable development of improved maize varieties released by Pioneer Hi-Bred Seeds Ethiopia Plc. Promoting knowledge development and resource mobilization within networks of policymakers, the public sector, and local and foreign private sectors, and a regulation on breeders’ rights to encourage the involvement of private companies in the sector are recommended to enable the innovation system to function sustainably. © 2024 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.",Not About Sufficiency
An eco-impact design metric for water lubricated bearings based on anticipatory Life Cycle Assessment,"Water lubricated bearings have been named in literature as a sustainable alternative to their oil-based counterparts. In order to clarify when water lubricated bearings are or are not a sustainable alternative, and inform design decisions, an analytical design tool is introduced based on anticipatory Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This model is based on data from the bearing geometries, materials, and material combinations that have been the subject of research attention in the past 20 years in water lubricated bearing design. The model provides simple equations, fed with data from literature on materials, production and their tribological combination to provide initial insight on the sustainability of these types of bearings and future designs. A case study illustrates that quantifying environmental impacts can help determine when lubricant loss is more important than material choice, or vice-versa.

The Impact of the BBNJ Agreement on Regional Fisheries Management Organisations or Arrangements,"This chapter focuses on the changes which may be brought to the operation of regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements (RFMOs) by the entry into force of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement). It first reviews the relevant provisions of the BBNJ Agreement on the relationship between the Agreement and relevant instruments, frameworks, and bodies (IFBs), including RFMOs. It then identifies and discusses the mechanisms through which the BBNJ Agreement seeks to provide a more coherent system of governance in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ): by creating a platform for interaction with and among IFBs; issuing recommendations on appropriate measures; and influencing parties’ behaviour within IFBs by obliging them to promote the adoption of measures in IFBs so as to support the implementation of the decisions and recommendations adopted by the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the BBNJ Agreement. The chapter concludes by observing that the BBNJ Agreement reflects a balanced approach which could fill gaps and create a strong pull towards a coherent system for the governance of ABNJ without undermining relevant IFBs. While RFMOs will continue to play their roles in managing high seas fisheries resources, they will be invited and expected to interact with the new legal framework of the BBNJ Agreement. RFMOs’ performance could come under increased scrutiny in relation to possible recommendations over ABMTs, including marine protected areas, or guidelines and/or standards on environmental impact assessments adopted by the BBNJ Agreement’s COP. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Bjørn Kunoy, Tomas Heidar and Constantinos Yiallourides; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of forests in the mitigation of global climate change: Emprical evidence from Tanzania,"The contribution of forests in regulating climate relies on the extent of forests. Therefore, mapping and monitoring changes of forests are fundamental and should be accurate. This study therefore assessed the potential role of forests in Tanzania in mitigation of climate change by (1) assessing extent of forests, deforestation, and accounted for their mapping errors, (2) estimating quantities of CO2 stored and sequestered by forests, (3) estimating quantities of CO2 emitted due to loss of forests. The study also hypothesized that, forests in Tanzania are net sink of CO2. Findings revealed that, the extent of forests for Mainland Tanzania in 2013 was 46,239,549 ± 1,400,514 ha while deforestation (2002–2013) was 469,016 ± 57,272 ha year−1. It was further observed that, the use of unbiased estimator to account for errors in classification of forests and deforestation improved the forest extent and deforestation estimates significantly. Total carbon stored by forests was estimated at 5.8 Gigatons CO2e while the total quantities of carbon sequestered by forest remaining forests for the period 2002–2013 was about -0.4 Gigatons CO2e year−1. Besides, carbon emissions due to deforestation (2002–2013) was estimated at 0.04 Gigatons CO2e year−1. The current level of emissions from deforestation is high and needs to be addressed urgently. Despite that emissions from deforestation are high, the study demonstrates in quantitative terms that forests in Tanzania were net sink of CO2 (-0.3 Gigatons CO2e year−1) hence regulate and stabilise global climate system by reducing the concentration of atmospheric CO2 through carbon sequestration. Improved land use planning, enhanced inter-sectoral coordination, upscaling of participatory forest management particularly in village forests, enhanced performance of institutions mandated to manage forest resources and taking advantages of climate finance opportunities are recommended as means of achieving emission reduction and sustaining the role of forests as carbon sinks. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency

Thus, REDD+ is the UNFCCC's primary mechanism for addressing global forest governance, emphasizing on improving biodiversity and safeguarding indigenous peoples' rights and promoting equitable benefit sharing. Through a systematic review, this chapter established that benefit sharing could promote inclusiveness and transparency within forest fringe communities, and eventual drive the achievement of the objective of REDD+. It underscores that difficulties this may create for external stakeholders, impede performance and stakeholder participation in the implementation of effective forest protection programs in Africa. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Navigating expert skepticism and consumer distrust: Rethinking the barriers to vehicle-to-grid (V2G) in the Nordic region,"Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) refers to a technology that could help make the electricity grid more effective, reduce the cost of ownership of electric vehicles (EVs), and help integrate intermittent renewable energy sources. However, despite these advantages, implementation and even knowledge of the technology is not widespread. In order to explore why, we ask the question: what are the barriers that V2G currently faces? To provide an answer, the authors conducted 227 semi-structured interviews with transportation and electricity experts from 201 institutions across seventeen cities within a market currently experimenting with electric mobility and V2G, the Nordic region. Results show that there is an extensive range of barriers facing V2G, with experts suggesting in total 35 categories of barriers. While the literature espouses substantial benefits of V2G, the experts interviewed generally displayed skepticism of the benefits and necessity of V2G in the Nordics. We categorized the top nine discussed barriers into four clusters. These clusters focused on the experts’ skepticism of the benefits of V2G, consumer acceptance, economic viability, and regulatory structure for V2G participation. We conclude the paper with policy implications and suggestions for future research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Infrastructuring the circular economy,"The circular economy (CE), and its focus on the cycling and regeneration of resources, necessitates both a reconfiguration of existing infrastructures and the creation of new infrastructures to facilitate these flows. In urban settings, CE is being realized at multiple levels, from within individual organizations to across peri-urban landscapes. While most attention in CE research and practice focuses on organizations, the scale and impact of many such efforts are limited because they fail to account for the diversity of resources, needs, and power structures across cities, consequently missing opportunities for adopting a more effective and inclusive CE. Reconfiguring hard infrastructures is necessary for material resource cycling, but intervening in soft infrastructures is also needed to enable more inclusive decision-making processes to activate these flows. Utilizing participatory action research methods at the intersection of industrial ecology and design, we developed a new framework and a model for considering and allocating the variety of resources that organizations utilize when creating value for themselves, society, and the planet. We use design prototyping methods to synthesize distributed knowledge and co-create hard and soft infrastructures in a multi-level case study focused on urban food producers and farmers markets from the City of Chicago. We discuss generalized lessons for “infrastructuring” the circular economy to bridge niche-level successes with larger system-level changes in cities. © 2020 by the authors.

Interventions for mainstreaming underutilized crop species in developing regions,"Food diversity is an essential and sustainable means to improve the diets and health of smallholder farmers in developing regions. Addressing livelihood options in these communities therefore requires that we broaden the focus of research and development to include a much wider range of crop species. Many underutilized crops occupy important niches, and are both nutritionally important and ecologically resilient. Yet, they generally rank low in national agricultural policies and research agendas. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in close cooperation with partners from national and international agencies, is focusing on: (1) documenting underutilized crops, their diversity, distribution and utilization, as an essential step in guiding use-enhancement interventions; (ii) strengthening sustainable conservation through effective linkages between ex situ conservation in gene banks and in situ/on-farm conservation realized by farmers and other users; (iii) enhancing whole-system optimization through holistic, interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder interventions along the value chains and focusing on cultivation, processing and marketing; (iv) creating linkages among user groups, bridge sectors (especially conservation, agriculture and nutrition and health) whose complementarities are essential to the valorization of target species. Scientific and technical innovations are key to securing the full potential of these promising species. European institutions, with a strong focus on plant research and innovation, can provide opportunities in overcoming some of the key challenges by establishing bilateral and multilateral north-south partnerships, increasing scientific collaboration, supporting access and transfer of technology, improving both individual and institutional capacities.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon reductions and building regulations: the case of Norwegian mountain cabins,"What are the limitations of regulatory measures to decrease environmental impacts of buildings? The case of Norway's wood-fired mountain cabins is used to explore whether strict energy-efficiency requirements in building regulations are appropriate and effective. A self-service (holiday) cabin is analysed in three different scenarios. The carbon emissions from the extra material required to meet the new regulations are calculated and compared with the emissions saved by the expected decrease in operational energy demand over a 50-year life cycle. The results show that in all three scenarios the carbon emissions from the extra material use and their transport outweighs the savings from reduced heating. As expected, the frequency of use (occupancy rate) is shown to be an important variable to determine the usefulness of technical upgrading. Alternative measures for decreased environmental impacts are considered. Suggested solutions for long-term reductions in carbon emissions for wood-fired mountain cabins are area efficiency (reduced floor area), low-carbon materials and the reuse of components instead of improved U-values. Regulatory measures that create universal standards for all buildings fail to account for particular circumstances and create revenge effects. Increased flexibility in regulatory mechanisms could reduce these problems. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem services: From eye-opening metaphor to complexity blinder,"What started as a humble metaphor to help us think about our relation to nature has become integral to how we are addressing the future of humanity and the course of biological evolution. The metaphor of nature as a stock that provides a flow of services is insufficient for the difficulties we are in or the task ahead. Indeed, combined with the mistaken presumption that we can analyze a global problem within a partial equilibrium economic framework and reach a new economy project-by-project without major institutional change, the simplicity of the stock-flow framework blinds us to the complexity of the human predicament. The ecosystem services approach can be a part of a larger solution, but its dominance in our characterization of our situation and the solution is blinding us to the ecological, economic, and political complexities of the challenges we actually face. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Between green growth and degrowth: Decoupling, rebound effects and the politics for long-term sustainability","Taking the simple equation: I(impact) = P(population) A(affluence) T(technology) as the point of departure, this chapter discusses the delusion of decoupling economic activities from environmental impacts by resorting to reduce eco-intensities through technological advancement alone. It is argued that the rebound effect is both a natural consequence of the growth dedicated society and a driver of further economic growth. Through rebound effects, labour productivity and eco-efficiency technologies in the growth society tend to contradict the goal of achieving environmental sustainability. To address the environmental problems, attention should therefore be redirected to the growth ideology and policy in current society. Drawing on the emerging degrowth debates in the affluent countries, the chapter proposes pathways towards a degrowth transformation by, respectively, discussing the role of population, affluence and technology in the attempts at reducing environmental impacts. Overall, it is suggested that from an analysis not confined to monetary terms, but with real cost and real benefits represented by environmental damage and human satisfaction, respectively, a degrowth in affluent countries can be achieved at no net cost. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Not About Sufficiency
Neoliberal (Mis)Management of Earth-Time and the Ethics of Climate Justice,"In this chapter I will argue that present day forms of economic accounting and management are changing the public and private representation of costs and benefits of consumption and production activities, including those which impact on climate change and energy use. I These foster a culture focused on near-term quantitative targets instead of attending to the intrinsic goods of production and service activities. The resultant short-termist mentality has notable impacts on the ecological sustainability of public and private investments. In this study of faith-based climate activism I show that individuals and communities who commit to ecologically sustainable activities do so primarily not from an accounting frame of near term risks and benefits. Instead they act because of their knowledge of the impacts of climate change on already existing persons, including farmers in developing countries, or climate risks for their own children and grandchildren. This relational frame for responding to environmental risks arguably has more cultural power in fostering sustainability than the narrowly quantitative cost benefit frame fostered by economic neoliberalism. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Tourism and development in sub-Saharan Africa: Current issues and local realities,"Over the past 20 years, the perception of tourism as an effective contributor to socio-economic development in the developing world has propagated, with many viewing tourism as a provider for poverty alleviation and towards other UN Millennium Development Goals. Over the same period, readers have become familiar with the paradoxes, complexities and inequalities of tourism in relation to development, wealth creation, growth, redistribution, governance and 'hosts-guests' relationships. This volume further extends this critical debate with a much-needed cohesive publication on Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). In an era of fluctuating tourist arrivals at global level, the growth of tourism in SSA requires deeper consideration in terms of its inconsistent and questionable implications at local level. Taking as a central theme the debate on whether tourism should be used in development efforts, this book examines the way in which tourism has controversially become the way forward to development in several SSA locations and assesses bottlenecks to sustainable development as well as dilemmas and challenges faced by those SSA destinations seeking to achieve development through tourism. It offers an explicit set of chapters adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, drawing upon tourism studies, human geography, sociology, anthropology, political economy, development and environmental studies, and integrates case studies authored by local African practitioners and academics to produce a book that gave voice to local experts on local realities. Combining an overview of key theories, concepts, contemporary issues and debates as well as practical insights from a wide range of regions in SSA, this book will be a valuable resource for those investigating the role of tourism in development. © 2016 Marina Novelli.

Stakeholders' views on the global guidelines for the sustainable use of non-native trees,"A large number of non-native trees (NNTs) have been introduced globally and widely planted, contributing significantly to the world's economy. Although some of these species present a limited risk of spreading beyond their planting sites, a growing number of NNTs are spreading and becoming invasive leading to diverse negative impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and human well-being. To help minimize the negative impacts and maximize the economic benefits of NNTs, Brundu et al. developed eight guidelines for the sustainable use of NNTs globally—the Global Guidelines for the Use of NNTs (GG-NNTs). Here, we used an online survey to assess perceptions of key stakeholders towards NNTs, and explore their knowledge of and compliance with the GG-NNTs. Our results show that stakeholders are generally aware that NNTs can provide benefits and cause negative impacts, often simultaneously and they consider that their organization complies with existing regulations and voluntary agreements concerning NNTs. However, they are not aware of or do not apply most of the eight recommendations included in the GG-NNTs. We conclude that effectively managing invasions linked to NNTs requires both more communication efforts using an array of channels for improving stakeholder awareness and implementation of simple measures to reduce NNT impacts (e.g. via GG-NNTs), and a deeper understanding of the barriers and reluctance of stakeholders to manage NNT invasions.

"Conserving Africa’s Eden? Green Colonialism, Neoliberal Capitalism, and Sustainable Development in Congo Basin Literature","Starting with European colonization, African natural resources in particular and nature in general have been coveted and exploited mainly in the interest of Euro-American industrialized countries, with China as a recent major player from Asia. Interestingly, the incessant quest by some Western NGOs, institutions, and governments to protect and conserve African nature not only are inspired by ecological and climatic concerns but also often tend to propagate a false image of Africa as the last Eden of the earth in order to control Africa’s resources. Using literary texts, this article argues that some Euro-American transnational NGOs and some of their governments sometimes conspire with some African governments to spread global capitalism and green colonialism under the pretext of oxymoronic sustainable development as they attempt to conserve a mythical African Eden. Utilizing three novels and one play from the Congo Basin, namely In Koli Jean Bofane’s Congo Inc.: Le Testament de Bismarck (2014), Assitou Ndinga’s Les Marchands du développement durable (2006), Étienne Goyémidé’s Le Silence de la forêt ([1984] 2015), and Ekpe Inyang’s The Last Hope (2011), I contend that such Euro-American environmental NGOs and their governments sometimes impose and sustain fortress conservation (creation of protected areas) in the Congo Basin as a hidden means of coopting Africa’s nature and Africans into neoliberal capitalism. For the most part, instead of protecting the Congo Basin, green colonialists and developmentalists sell sustainable development, undermine alternative ways of achieving human happiness, and perpetuate epistemicide, thus leading to poverty and generating resentment among local and indigenous populations. As these literary texts suggest, nature conservation and sustainable development in the Congo Basin should not be imposed upon from the outside; they should emanate from Africans, tapping into local expertise, and indigenous and other knowledge systems. © 2023 by the author.",Not About Sufficiency
Hidden by the name: A new fluorescent pumpkin toadlet from the Brachycephalus ephippium group (Anura: Brachycephalidae),"Species of Brachycephalus has been having taxonomical issues due its morphological similarity and genetic conservatism. Herein, we describe a new species of Brachycephalus from the south Mantiqueira mountain range and semidecidual forests in the municipalities of Mogi das Cruzes, Campinas and Jundiaí, state of São Paulo, Brazil, based on an integrative approach. It can be distinguished from all species of the B. ephippium species group based on morphological characters (especially osteology and head shape), advertisement call and divergence in partial mitochondrial DNA gene sequences (16S). The new species is genetically similar to B. margaritatus and morphologically similar to B. ephippium. It can be differentiated from B. ephippium by the presence of dark faded spots on skull and post-cranial plates, presence of black connective tissue connective tissue scattered over dorsal musculature, parotic plate morphology, smaller snout-vent length (adult SVL: males 13.46–15.92 mm; females 16.04–17.69 mm) and 3% genetic distance. We also present natural history data and discuss the robustness of the integrative approach, geographic distribution, genetic data, behaviour, fluorescence in ontogeny, and conservation status. © 2021 Nunes et al.

Modern Animal Traction to Enhance the Supply Chain of Residual Biomass,"Throughout history, the use of animals for agricultural and forestry work has been closely associated with human societies, with multiple references to animal power being utilized for various tasks since the Neolithic period. However, the advent of industrialization has fundamentally transformed the reality of society, leading to a significant shift towards the mechanization of processes. Despite this, animal traction continues to play an important role as a workforce in many developing countries and developed nations, where there is a renewed interest in the use of animal traction, particularly for tasks intended to have a reduced environmental impact and a smaller carbon footprint. The present study conducted a SWOT analysis to examine the potential of animal traction as an alternative for the recovery processes of forest residual woody biomass, particularly when the use of mechanical equipment is not feasible. This can contribute to the creation of value chains for residual products, which can be harnessed for energy recovery. The utilization of modern animal traction can promote the sustainable development of projects at the local and regional level, with efficient utilization of endogenous resources and the creation of value for residual forest woody biomass. This approach can thus facilitate the optimization of supply chains, from biomass to energy. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Ethnopharmacological survey of native remedies commonly used against infectious diseases in the tropical island of Mauritius,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Infectious diseases (IDs) still remain a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. This study has been geared to gather primary ethnopharmacological information on common native remedies (NRs) used to treat and/or manage common infectious diseases from different regions of Mauritius, a tropical multicultural island in the Indian Ocean. Given the dearth of updated information on traditional medicine of Mauritius, this work can provide an opportunity to establish valuable primary information on the different NRs used by the local people and hence open new perspectives for further pharmacological research. Aim of the study: To collect, preserve and document primary ethnopharmacological data from the local population concerning NRs commonly used against IDs in the tropical island of Mauritius. Materials and methods: Face to face interviews were conducted with Mauritians and herbalists (n=307) using a semi-structured questionnaire. Quantitative ethnobotany parameters such as informant consensus factor (FIC), fidelity level (FL), use value (UV) and variety of use (VU) were used for herbal and animal products. Statistical analysis such as Pearson correlation and Chi-squared test were performed to delineate any association. Results: It was found that 94.8% of the local people claimed that managing IDs with NRs was part of their culture and have been using it since childhood. A total of 39 plant species belonging to 24 families and 9 animal species were reported to be traditionally used in the formulation of herbal remedies and animal products, respectively. Sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, place of residence and income) had a significant (p<0.01) impact on the use of these NRs. The most relevant family contributing much to the medicinal flora was Zingiberaceae (No of citation=301). The average FIC for all ailments for medicinal plants and animal products were 0.963 and 0.972, respectively. Acalypha indica L. had the highest FL (0.83) for skin and subcutaneous tissue problems. Panoply of animal products (Anguilla japonica, Periplaneta americana and Helix aspersa) were culturally used, whereby products from Bos taurus, (42.0%) were the most utilized zootherapy. Other remedies used in concurrence with herbal and animal products involved cultural rituals and prayers that were never reported in previous studies. Therapeutic properties of some herbal remedies reported correlated to some extent with those of previous studies while others have open potential perspectives for further research as their chemistry and pharmacology have not been published. Conclusions: Given the plethora of novel information obtained from the present survey, it is obvious that the indigenous population still relies to a great extent on NRs which need to be preserved and used sustainably. Nonetheless, further research is needed to probe the possible active constituents that could be the basis of an evidence based investigation to discover new drugs. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Towards Sustainable Development of Mineral Resources in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach,"This study focuses on economic, governmental, social, and environmental factors and their impact on the sustainable development of mineral resources in sub-Saharan Africa. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) and data from 40 countries from 2010 to 2022, the research examines the hypothesized links between these factors and sustainable development. The results reveal a positive and statistically significant relationship between economic factors and sustainable development, underlining the crucial role of economic growth in achieving sustainable development goals. Furthermore, effective governance and policy implementation are strongly associated with better sustainable development, underscoring the importance of robust government action. This study also highlights the importance of social factors, demonstrating that increased community involvement and participation contribute positively to sustainable development. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, the research reveals a positive relationship between environmental factors and sustainable development, challenging existing ideas and suggesting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the interaction between environmental practices and sustainability. This study concludes with concrete recommendations, including prioritizing economic growth, improving governance and policy effectiveness, promoting social inclusion, and reassessing environmental conservation strategies. These findings provide valuable information for policymakers, corporations, and communities in sub-Saharan Africa, thus contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of sustainable development in the region. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The rural economy in Zambia,"This chapter provides an exposition of Zambia's rural economy during the colonial and post-independence period. It occasionally delves into the decade before the colonial period to explain developments during the colonial period. A two-phased post-independence era comprising a state-led rural economy landscape from 1964 to 1990 and a market-driven neoliberal phase from 1991 to 2000 is described in detail. The chapter explores trends in the socio-economic aspects of Zambia's rural environment. Actors and drivers in the Zambian rural economy are identified and discussed in terms of their respective roles and associated effects. Additionally, the chapter narrates the overarching policy frameworks and rural development approaches used from 1924 to 2021 with the respective outcomes such as food security. Special reference is made to the main pillars of the rural economy: the contribution of forestry, agriculture, fisheries, and wildlife resources. Furthermore, the chapter elucidates on rural developments in terms of challenges and opportunities before raising a conclusion. © Oxford University Press 2024.

Using the Concepts and Tools of Social Ecological Systems and Ecosystem Services to Advance the Practice of Ecosystem-Based Management,"Environmental problems are very often wicked problems: they are persistent, they have no clear end, and involve moral choices resulting in winners and losers. Just as the ecological and biological elements of these problems are dynamic and complex, so the social and political elements are also constantly changing and do not follow linear patterns. Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) is an approach developed to work on wicked problems that recognizes social-ecological systems and the need to incorporate systems thinking into natural resource management. In this chapter we describe the scope and scale of this book and briefly discuss its four sections: • foundational concepts • tools for the practice • national and international governance contexts • case studies. We then go on to identify some of the main lessons learned, challenges and the main needs required to further advance the applications of EBM. We conclude with an exhortation for readers to learn from our experience, to use and adapt the tools and techniques we present here and a call for continued international collaboration. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
Collective responsibility amplifies mitigation behaviors,"How can individuals be convinced to act on climate change? It is widely assumed that emphasizing personal responsibility for climate change is effective at increasing pro-climate behavior whereas collectively framing the causes of climate change diffuses responsibility and dampens the incentive for individual action. We observe the opposite result. Here we find, across three experiments, that emphasizing collective responsibility for the causes of climate change increases pro-climate monetary donations by approximately 7 % in environmental group members and by 50 % in the general public. Further, highlighting collective responsibility amplifies intent to reduce future carbon emissions. In contrast, focusing on personal responsibility for climate change does not significantly alter donations to climate change advocacy or the intent for future pro-climate behavior. These effects replicate and persist multiple days after treatment. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Not About Sufficiency
Revitalising African agriculture through innovative business models and organisational arrangements: Promising developments in the traditional crops sector,"Within the last four years, a number of high profile reports outlining new strategies for pulling African agriculture out of its current impasse have emerged. These include the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme of NEPAD, and the InterAcademy Council Report commissioned by UN Secretary General Koffi Annan. Whilst these strategies are a welcome improvement on those that have characterised African agriculture in the past, it is argued here that like their predecessors, they fail to focus on business-competitive approaches as an integral part of the reform package needed to stimulate African agricultural productivity and development.

It focuses on three concepts: value innovation, lead user focus and organisational value logic. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.",Not About Sufficiency
"Characterization and perception of ecosystem services of an ecotourism park in an ejido in the State of Mexico, Mexico","Ecosystem services are a concept that reflects the different ways in which society interacts with nature, which are often classified with a utilitarian approach. However, there are alternative classifications based on ecological function and structure to highlight certain natural elements or interactions’ relevance that differ from natural resources or tangible benefits. One way to understand ecosystem services is to assess them in urban areas as ecosystems. The urban sprawl of Mexico City is growing quickly, putting at risk the diversity of protected natural areas established on its periphery. Although most of these areas are managed by government institutions, certain social property zones are voluntarily established for conservation. The ejido Emiliano Zapata has put more than 90% of its territory into forestry programs as an ecotourist park Bosque Esmeralda, in an area influenced by one of the most traditional national parks in Central Mexico, in which intensive agriculture and husbandry have had a significant environmental impact. In this study, forest cover changes were analyzed as a reflection of the reconversion process in the territory, as well as social perception from both ejido inhabitants and ecotourist park workers and visitors, to assess ecosystem services in addition to natural resource management. It was found that there are ways of valuing additional ecosystem services in addition to the usefulness of natural resources. This approach is important in the context of climate change, and considering accelerated urbanization, understanding the functioning of ecosystems and their relationship to the benefits they provide is crucial for territorial planning. © 2025 Universidad de Ciencias Aplicadas y Ambientales U.D.C.A.

Understanding the current state of collaboration in the production and dissemination of adaptation knowledge in Namibia,"Adaptation to climate change is challenging in terms of managing knowledge flow among diverse actors. This paper examines the roles of key actors in Namibia in the production and dissemination of climate adaptation knowledge. The intention was to identify opportunities for enhancing collaboration among actors to facilitate knowledge flow and uptake in adaptation action. The Omusati Region was used as a case study in understanding the chain of interactions among actors from local/district to the national level vis-à-vis the production and dissemination of adaptation knowledge in Namibia. The researchers conducted key informant interviews with representatives of key organizations in the Namibian adaptation network operating in the Omusati Region. The selection of the organizations of interviewed respondents was based on a previous climate change adaptation stakeholder and influence network mapping exercise in the region. Results indicate that adaptation knowledge generation by organizations happens mainly in the context of other developmental services. Furthermore, most organizations generate their adaptation knowledge internally through their directorates of research and also through cooperation with other organizations. However, there is little or no collaboration between organizations with respect to dissemination of adaptation knowledge to intended targets. The study, therefore, recommends a more concerted effort towards improving collaboration between organizations, and with local communities in the dissemination of adaptation knowledge as a way of enhancing knowledge uptake. This will have practical implications for the improvement in the rate of knowledge uptake in adaptation actions, particularly at the local level. In this regard, the use of workshop and field day meetings show the best prospect for improving collaboration between organizations in knowledge dissemination. © 2018, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Green transformation and finance literature: A mini-review approach,"Green transformation is a process of urban transformation that focuses on using renewable energy sources and green areas (e.g. environmental degradation) for cities' sustainable future. In recent decades, this dilemma has become a universal concern for humankind because of increasing daily needs, urbanisation, population, and economic growth to produce CO2 emissions. Thus, this paper seeks to provide an overview of the literature on green transformation and finance from various sources, summarises the results and makes conclusions based on the findings. This study's design is a qualitative method with mini-review through reading and analysing 30 journal articles. Green transformation and finance reviews were carried out by reading and analysing 30 peer-reviewed journal articles and summarised on the basis of the subject in two tables, namely article journal and publisher distribution, and article category. Using the mini-review analysis, we found that most companies in different countries implement different regulations and policies related to the environment to overcome this green transformation. It is undeniable that lenders are willing to invest their money to support companies that practise environmental sustainability awareness to implement the green transformation to loans. As a result, it is quite significant for companies and countries' performance that have policies and controls on the environment to implement and deploy green finance. In conclusion, this study found a role and government policies related to green finance in realising green transformation and firm performance. © IEOM Society International.",Not About Sufficiency
Conceptualization of groundwater-surface water interaction with evidence from environmental isotopes and hydrogeochemistry in lake Babati Basin in Northern Tanzania,"The holistic management of water resources is attainable with evidence-based planning constructed on reliable hydrological information. However, data paucity, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, leads to a significant knowledge gap regarding surface water and groundwater interactions, leaving considerable uncertainty to support relevant decisions. This study combined hydrogeochemistry and environmental isotopes to explore the connections between the surface water and groundwater in the data scarce catchment of Lake Babati Basin in northern Tanzania. The results showed that: i) Lake Babati receives groundwater influx from recently recharged aquifers endowed in the pyroclastic formation in the lake basin; ii) the lake is not well mixed as presented by the heterogenous hydrogeochemistry and confirmed by the differences in the isotopic composition of deuterium and oxygen – 18 at different locations within it; iii) the deep wells located near the lake abstract a mixture of recently recharged water, deep aquifer waters and lake water with enriched isotopic compositions; and iv) the hydrogeochemistry and isotopic data reveal the presence of a hydraulic connection between the lake and deep wells. The findings of this study demonstrate that the catchment, the groundwater system, and Lake Babati are interlinked and, therefore, require the implementation of integrated water resources management to enhance sustainable development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
A global assessment of the social and conservation outcomes of protected areas,"Protected areas (PAs) are a key strategy for protecting biological resources, but they vary considerably in their effectiveness and are frequently reported as having negative impacts on local people. This has contributed to a divisive and unresolved debate concerning the compatibility of environmental and socioeconomic development goals. Elucidating the relationship between positive and negative social impacts and conservation outcomes of PAs is key for the development of more effective and socially just conservation. We conducted a global meta-analysis on 165 PAs using data from 171 published studies. We assessed how PAs affect the well-being of local people, the factors associated with these impacts, and crucially the relationship between PAs' conservation and socioeconomic outcomes. Protected areas associated with positive socioeconomic outcomes were more likely to report positive conservation outcomes. Positive conservation and socioeconomic outcomes were more likely to occur when PAs adopted comanagement regimes, empowered local people, reduced economic inequalities, and maintained cultural and livelihood benefits. Whereas the strictest regimes of PA management attempted to exclude anthropogenic influences to achieve biological conservation objectives, PAs that explicitly integrated local people as stakeholders tended to be more effective at achieving joint biological conservation and socioeconomic development outcomes. Strict protection may be needed in some circumstances, yet our results demonstrate that conservation and development objectives can be synergistic and highlight management strategies that increase the probability of maximizing both conservation performance and development outcomes of PAs. © 2016, Society for Conservation Biology.",Not About Sufficiency
Artisanal fisheries research: A need for globalization?,"Given limited funds for research and widespread degradation of ecosystems, environmental scientists should geographically target their studies where they will be most effective. However, in academic areas such as conservation and natural resource management there is often a mismatch between the geographic foci of research effort/funding and research needs. The former frequently being focused in the developed world while the latter is greater in the biodiverse countries of the Global South. Here, we adopt a bibliometric approach to test this hypothesis using research on artisanal fisheries. Such fisheries occur throughout the world, but are especially prominent in developing countries where they are important for supporting local livelihoods, food security and poverty alleviation. Moreover, most artisanal fisheries in the Global South are unregulated and unmonitored and are in urgent need of science- based management to ensure future sustainability. Our results indicate that, as predicted, global research networks and centres of knowledge production are predominantly located in developed countries, indicating a global mismatch between research needs and capacity. © 2016 Oliveira Junior et al.

For this, we developed a speciated NMVOC emission inventory for Spain from 2010 to 2019 combining national reported emissions with state-of-the-art speciation profiles, which resulted in a database of emissions for over 900 individual NMVOC species and 153 individual sectors. Additionally, we analysed 2030 emission projections to quantify the expected impact of planned measures on future OFP levels. Overall, the main activities contributing to OFP in Spain are paint manufacturing and applications (20 %), manure management (16 %), and domestic solvent use (6 %). These activities contribute unevenly across regions. The more urbanised areas report a larger contribution from the solvent sector (64 % in Madrid), while in rural areas, manure management and agricultural waste burning gain importance (24 % in Extremadura), indicating that local control measures should be implemented. The top 10 NMVOC species contributing to OFP are ethanol, ethene, xylenes, propene, toluene, formaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, styrene, n-butane, and cyclopentane, which together are responsible for 54 % of the total OFP. Our trend analysis indicates a reduction of NMVOC emissions and OFP of −5 % and −10 % between 2010 and 2019, respectively. The larger decrease in OFP is driven by a bigger reduction in xylenes (−29 %) and toluene (−28 %) from paint application industries and the road transport sector. By 2030 a significant increase (+37 %) in the OFP from the public electricity sector is expected due to the planned increase in biomass use for power generation. Our results indicate that policies should focus on paint reformulation, limiting aerosol products, and implementing NMVOC control devices in future biomass power plants. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
Postmortem concentrations for total blood carbon monoxide (TBCO) as a novel biomarker for carbon monoxide (CO) poisonings,"Total blood carbon monoxide (TBCO) showed promising results in improving accuracy of CO determinations in blood and presenting better stability to different storage conditions. Therefore, it was proposed as an alternative biomarker to carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) for CO poisoning diagnosis. However, given that current interpretation reference values exist for COHb only, it is difficult to implement TBCO analysis in routine. Therefore, we aimed at determining TBCO reference values for postmortem CO poisoning cases. A previously validated method for TBCO analysis via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was applied to cardiac, peripheral, cranial and spleen blood samples collected from 92 autopsies. Autopsy cases included 21 non-CO-related and 71 CO-related cases with varying postmortem intervals (PMIs). Statistical analyses were performed using statistical software R Studio. When comparing lower to higher PMIs for non-CO-related cases, no significant differences were found, which suggests that CO formation or degradation at low PMIs does not occur. Spleen blood showed potential as an alternative matrix to CO determinations in cases with sample availability issues but needs to be evaluated for CO-positive cases. Results for cardiac blood in CO-related autopsies showed a positive correlation between COHb and TBCO values (R = 0.78). This value is lower than what is found in the literature, suggesting that even though COHb and TBCO are correlated, a potential underestimation of the true CO exposure might occur if only COHb values are taken into consideration. Samples were divided into CO exposure groups based on COHb concentrations, and with the data obtained, classification into the following TBCO concentration groups is proposed: no significant CO exposure case <6 μmol/mL, medium CO exposure case 6–20 μmol/mL and high CO exposure case >20 μmol/mL. Even if a higher number of samples in each group would enable to increase the confidence, these results are very promising and highlight the importance of TBCO measurement. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Awareness and Utilisation of Natural and Mineral Resources in Selected Communities of Southwest Rural Communities of Nigeria,"Nigeria is often described as a land flowing with milk and honey in reflection of the rich endowment of natural and mineral resources embedded in the country. Sadly, few of its people have benefited from these abundant resources as a large percentage of its population remains poor, particularly in rural areas. Hence, this present study assessed the awareness and utilisation of the natural and mineral resources in 24 selected southwest rural communities. The study adopts the mixed method to elicit responses from rural and urban respondents in four of Nigeria’s southwest states. Findings from the study revealed a high level of awareness of available resources in rural communities but gross underutilisation of the resources. The study concludes that the available resources in the southwest rural communities if tapped into, could transform the rural economy and ameliorate the level of underdevelopment in those areas. The study recommends that the government at all levels needs to recognise the rural areas as the fulcrum of national economic development and should be given utmost priority regarding infrastructural provisions and adequate funding. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability labelling as a tool for reporting the sustainable development impacts of climate actions relevant to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement,"The architecture of global carbon markets has changed significantly since the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals were both agreed in 2015. Voluntary, international cooperative approaches established in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement allow Parties to work together to achieve the targets set out in their respective Nationally Determined Contributions to limit global warming to an increase below 1.5–2 °C. In Article 6.4, a sustainable mitigation mechanism is established for which rules, modalities and procedures will be developed internationally considering the experience and lessons learned from existing mechanisms, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and its Sustainable Development (SD) Tool. Historically the issue of making integrated assessments of sustainable development and mitigation actions has been politically and methodologically controversial for many reasons: developing countries fear that an international definition of SD will interfere with their sovereignty and therefore their ability to define their own development pathways; players in the carbon market fear that markets can only handle one objective, namely mitigation outcomes; and sustainable development is regarded as too complex and costly to be measured and quantified. In an effort to address these concerns, the article proposes a new methodology for the sustainability labelling of climate mitigation actions relevant to Article 6 approaches. The article draws on an application of the CDM SD tool to analyse 2098 Component Programme Activities that had entered the CDM Pipeline by January 2017. The article demonstrates that assessment of the sustainable development benefits of climate actions can be graded and labelled based on the analysis of qualitative data, which is less costly than applying a quantitative approach. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Implications of managerial framing of stakeholders in environmental reports,"Corporate environmental reports are increasingly viewed as products of the managerial framing of responsibility and stakeholders. This notion encouraged us to conduct a multiple case study on how stakeholders are framed in environmental reports. We show how interaction between companies and stakeholders is described in the environmental reports of three firms operating in different business sectors – financial, aviation and energy – over a period of five years. We use an inductively oriented content analysis to identify five categories of relationships being constructed in the data: demanding, promoting, committing, donating and preventing. We then show how commitment and promotion dominate. We conclude by discussing the implications of this type of managerial framing to maintaining business-as-usual approaches to corporate environmentalism and show how the critique of environmental reports derives from stakeholder accountability and critical approaches. We argue that managerial framing of stakeholders in environmental reports partly explains the increased criticism among stakeholder representatives and academics. © 2014 Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research.",Not About Sufficiency
“We grow earth”: performing eco-agrarian citizenship at the semi-periphery of Europe,"Peasant studies have long demonstrated the historical contribution of peasants to the stewardship of earth’s commons. We enter the debate on ecological citizenship through a concern for environmental and food justice/sovereignty, two scholarly fields that have rarely been connected despite their theoretical complementarity. We argue that peasants have historically acted as eco-citizens, even if they still have to reclaim their political status as citizens with rights. We focus on the labor practices and advocacy efforts of peasants in Romania and Portugal and analyze their testimonies to identify rural civic engagements as acts of planetary eco-citizenship based on interdependence and care. Building on Wittman´s concept of agrarian citizenship, we look at three dimensions of collective action–peasant agroecology, seed sovereignty and re-localization of food–as political acts which expand prevailing visions of eco-citizenship by de-centering urban and national spaces as the locus of civic engagement and the promotion of transnational political action. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the vulnerability of urban forests to climate change,"Climate adaptation is being embraced by many municipalities worldwide. An element of this is the planting and protection of urban trees. However, the fact that climate change will also have an impact on urban trees has been largely overlooked. We argue that climate vulnerability assessments are necessary for addressing climate adaptation in urban forests and contribute to successful climate adaptation in cities. We review and integrate the literature on climate vulnerability and urban forests to explore how the general notion of urban forest vulnerability to climate change can be developed into an operational framework for undertaking a vulnerability assessment. The framework characterizes climate exposure, impact, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, as well as nonclimatic drivers and factors, in urban forests. The most important themes in this discussion include urban tree species selection and diversity, naturalization, resource access, social awareness and engagement, budget and economic valuation, liability issues, and governance structures. Climate change vulnerability assessments help us understand how and why urban forests are vulnerable to climate change, identify future areas for research, and determine what adaptation measures could be included in urban forest management. These assessments help bring climate change to the forefront of the decision-making process and contribute to successful urban adaptation to climate change. © 2014 Published by NRC Research Press.",Not About Sufficiency
"Examining the Relationships between Religious Affiliation, External and Internal Behavioural Factors, and Personal Carbon Footprint","Different studies have shown that daily consumption is responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions. Since consumption is closely linked to individuals’ preferences, moti-vations, and beliefs, the personal carbon footprint should be a good indicator of actual consumers’ commitments towards climate change mitigation. Previous research has shown the importance of considering individual-level religion as an antecedent of mitigation outcomes, although the evidence is inconclusive in this regard. This study examines the relationship between religious affiliation and personal carbon footprint, following socio-psychological models that consider behaviour to depend on external or situational factors, and internal or intrinsic ones. A questionnaire was carried out on a random sample of the Spanish population (N = 845) to determine the main drivers of carbon footprint for different religious groups. External factors (i.e., socioeconomic) and internal ones related to climate change knowledge, commitment, and intractability, on the one hand, and value orientation, nature-relatedness, and the main motivation to conserve nature on the other hand, were analysed. In-tergroup differences in the personal carbon footprint were found, especially based on sex, age group, and type of work among external factors and value orientation, the main motivation for conserving nature and climate change perceived commitment within the internals. Intragroup differences for food carbon footprint were also observed, as follows: the main motivation to conserve nature and the level of commitment implied differences among Catholic believers, whereas value orientation and the level of commitment implied differences among non-believers. Our conclusions suggest, on the one hand, the importance of examining the religion-mitigation link in a socio-psychological framework and, on the other, the need for further study within groups to promote better behavioural responses to climate change. © 2022 by the authors.

Implications of mineral price volatility on the outcome of social life cycle assessment interpretation—a battery material case study,"Purpose: New research methods are needed to better understand the progress toward social sustainability goals. Social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) is one way to measure this progress, but price volatility may cause challenges in using monetary value-based S-LCA modelling with typical S-LCA databases. To address these methodological concerns, the study focuses on assessing the impacts of price volatility on S-LCA results through a comparative case study on the social risks of battery materials. Methods: The Social Hotspot Database (SHDB) was used to compare cathode active material (CAM) production in Finland and globally to see how price volatility of minerals impacts the results of comparative S-LCA. Also, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the prices of multiple minerals and energy types used in NMC 811 CAM production. Results and discussion: This study shows that price volatility might have an unanticipated effect on the results of S-LCA, e.g., by increasing the social risks when the mineral price is decreased due to price volatility. This may cause challenges with interpretation of the results or when results of two different studies using price data from different years are compared with each other, e.g., the results of social product declarations (SPD). However, one of the main purposes of using the SHDB is to find the countries and sectors with the highest social risks in the supply chain, and these results were less sensitive to price volatility except for lithium which also had the highest price fluctuation. Conclusions: Price volatility can have significant impacts on the results of the monetary value-based S-LCA. It is recommended that the mineral price volatility is considered if developing product category rules for battery-related sectors. The importance of sensitivity analyses should be emphasized, and physical unit-based reference flow should be preferred if site-specific data collection about worker hours is possible. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Fungal spores and pollen are correlated with meteorological variables: effects in human health at Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico","We conducted the first study of air pollen and fungal spores for Hermosillo, Sonora, where the human population is exposed to high temperatures and high levels of dust and suffers from diseases related to air quality. We sampled pollen and fungal spores daily in the air during 2016 using a volumetric spore trap Hirst-type sampler. We used simple linear correlation to investigate the association between pollen and spore counts and daily weather conditions. We found an Annual Pollen Integral of 16,243 pollen day/m3 and an Annual Spore Integral higher 222,365 spore day/m3. We identified 32 pollen taxa and 15 different spores. We found two periods of higher pollen and spore concentrations: March to May and August to October, the latter was the most severe. Spore and pollen concentrations in the air increased at higher temperature and higher relative humidity but decreased at higher precipitation. We detected negative impacts during summer and fall on population health, with 13,454 cases of people who presented diseases related to allergies. A peak in allergies is centered during October and correlates well with our peaks in pollen and spore concentrations; it seems that pollen of Poaceae is the one that generates most effects in allergic people. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency

"Electricity generation from renewables in the United States: Resource potential, current usage, technical status, challenges, strategies, policies, and future directions","In order to secure the energy future and protect the environment, the U.S. is looking for renewable resources to meet the increasing energy demands for its electricity sector (which accounts for ≈ 40% of total U.S. energy consumption in 2011). The overall aim of this article is to summarize the possible approaches that can be used to improve and optimize the utilization of renewables for electricity generation in the United States. First, an overview is presented about the resource potential, current usage, and technical status of electricity generation from renewables (in the United States). Second, a number of economic, operational, regulatory, sustainability, and technical challenges that are likely to be encountered are identified. Third, strategies are outlined that can be used to minimize costs, deal with the spatial nature of renewables, smooth temporal variations associated with intermittency, and achieve successful integration of electricity generated from renewable resources into the U.S. power grid. Fourth, a sustainability assessment framework for renewable resource deployment (for electricity generation in the U.S.) is discussed. The framework considers multiple criteria (including cost, environmental and social impacts), thus giving a comprehensive assessment of each renewable energy resource (for electricity generation in the United States). Fifth, the current U.S. renewable energy policy is analyzed, and rigorous recommendations are made for optimizing future U.S. renewable energy policy that can permanently induce a long-term sustainable shift towards electricity generation from renewables. Finally, directions for future research are highlighted. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Insights for informing energy transition policies – Are decision makers listening to science? The case of Chile,"The current climate targets of most countries are insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. This work emphasises how the gap between recent governmental policies for the energy transition and scientific findings may be jeopardising the fulfilment of the Paris Agreement. Concretely, Chile is used to identify the most significant global issues behind this gap and underline the importance of weighing in more insights from science. The analysis showed that the gap is mainly based on three critical problems in modelling tools for simulating long-term energy scenarios: (1) low temporal resolution in the modelling; (2) overly pessimistic and even outdated cost projection assumptions for key technologies, especially for solar photovoltaics; and, (3) key enabling technologies and infrastructures are not fully represented, such as decentralised solutions, Power-to-X for e-fuel production, and sector coupling. The study finalises by providing recommendations for energy decision-makers, such as policymakers, planners, and investors, to help speed up the needed energy transition that simultaneously tackles environmental, public health, and socioeconomic challenges. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Tillage system and cover crop effects on organic carbon and available nutrient contents in light chestnut soil,"Optimal use of management systems including tillage and cover crops are recommended to improve available nutrient contents in soils and sustain agricultural production. The effects on organic carbon and available nutrient contents of three tillage methods (conventional tillage, minimum tillage and no-tillage) and different cover crops such as flaxseed oil, buckwheat, soybean, pea, corn, sorghum, spring oilseed rape and sugar beet were evaluated in a short-term experiment on a light chestnut soil in Kazakhstan. Organic carbon and available nutrient contents were measured in the autumn of 2021. The field measurements included the yield of cover crops and input of organic matter into soils with root and other residues of cover crops. In the laboratory, total organic carbon, labile organic carbon, easily hydrolyzable nitrogen (NH4-N), NO3-N, available P and exchangeable K were measured. The results showed that one season of cover crop growth was not enough to find detectable changes in soil organic matter and available nutrient status in light chestnut soils. On the other hand, even in a short-term field experiment period of 3 months, the most labile organic carbon in soil organic carbon was obtained in conventional tillage. Overall, the results show that at least in the short term and under lower drip irrigation rate in summer for the study area, reduced tillage methods (no-tillage and minimum tillage) is suitable in the study area for soybean, corn and sugar beet production after intensive tillage in the previous year. © 2023 Federation of Eurasian Soil Science Societies.

The eu’s green deal: A third alternative to green growth and degrowth?,"In December 2019, the European Union introduced its Green Deal in which the ecological crisis is prioritized. In doing so, the EU seems to be breaking with its traditional green growth discourse. Does it? In this article, we seek to find out whether and to what extent the EC indeed has such a revolutionary cultural, economic and political agenda in mind with its Green Deal. While the green growth discourse presumes a growth-based economy that must become greener, the degrowth discourse questions the growth model and perceives it as ecologically irresponsible. If the European Green Deal represents a third alternative, then it will somehow succeed in prioritizing ecology without welfare loss. To ascertain to what extent the European Green Deal is that third alternative, three preliminary steps need to be undertaken. The first step consists in a brief exposition of the key features of the traditional green growth discourse, as propounded by the EC and its various allies. Thereafter, the overlaps between the green growth discourse and the European Green Deal are noted. In the third section, the latter’s divergences from that previous model are highlighted. In the final section, the main question of the article is answered. It is also suggested that specific interpretations and implementations of the European Green Deal could possibly turn the original communication into an alternative to both green growth and degrowth. © 2020 by the authors.

What does the 7th cooperative principle (concern for community) really mean?,"Cooperatives are an important organizational form that operate under seven principles (Voluntary and Open Membership; Democratic Member Control; Member Economic Participation; Autonomy and Independence; Education, Training, and Information; Cooperation among Cooperatives; Concern for Community). Concern for Community was the last formally stated cooperative principle in 1995, after decades of discussion within the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA). The statement of this “new” principle has provoked questions for cooperatives and the cooperative movement more generally, regarding their definition, scope, and implementation. This article employs a systematic literature review to examine the academic understanding of Concern for Community that has emerged over the past 30 years. The review analyzes 32 academic journal articles from an initial dataset of 438 articles generated by a two-string search (“concern for community” and “cooperative principles”). Five themes are identified: cooperative principles, defining Concern for Community, adoption of Concern for Community, antecedents of Concern for Community, and outcomes. Comparing these themes with the normative instructions proposed by the ICA, the article develops a framework for future research. The review also finds that there is not an established clear difference between Concern for Community and corporate social responsibility in the extant literature, which carries the implication that constructs from the latter can be integrated into the analysis and development of the 7th principle. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
“Good” Forests and Ambiguous Fields: Cultural Dimensions of Agroforestry Landscapes,"Over the past decades environmental programmes have promoted agroforestry initiatives in Madagascar. These projects often struggle to meet their objectives, in part because what constitutes a “good” agroforest in the eyes of an environmental organisation does not align with what constitutes a “good” agroforest for smallholder farmers. In the Mananara Nord region of Madagascar, where smallholders cultivate subsistence and market crops in diversified agroforests, a ‘good’ agroforest brings together economic, cultural, historical, and spiritual dimensions, integrating what anthropologist Maurice Bloch identifies as transcendent and transactional social realms (2008). In contrast to such expansive views, environmental initiatives take more reductionist approaches to agroforests that emphasise technical interventions and quantifiable metrics. These differences in perceptions may hamper the success of partnerships between farmers and environmental groups. To foster more successful agroforestry initiatives, projects can centre the localised perceptions of agroforestry landscapes and shift from a problem-based to a strength-based development approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Presence and effectiveness of material benefit provisions under Joint Forest Management in India: The cases of World Bank-aided Village Forest Committees in Madhya Pradesh,"Provision of material benefits by external agencies has been widely adopted in developing countries' forest management, although their effectiveness in improving local livelihoods and conservation has been controversial. We provide empirical evidence of the presence and effectiveness of material benefit provisions under Joint Forest Management in a forest division of Madhya Pradesh State, India. We conducted an extensive survey of 18 World Bank-aided Village Forest Committees and case studies of two committees, one tribal and one non-tribal. Material benefit provisions by the forest department were the most predominant type of economic activity. Provisions were dispensed in a top-down manner lacking communication and facilitation, and consequently were not sufficiently effective in improving local livelihoods and conservation, especially in tribal communities. The policy implications we derived are the following: the provision of material benefits should be properly explained to beneficiaries for them to be effective as conservation incentives, technical assistance for the maintenance of the dispensed materials should be provided by village development specialists, and collective forest-based activities should be gradually promoted so that beneficiaries gain a sense of ownership for forest resources and programs. These improvements should be implemented with particular attention to disadvantaged or marginalized populations. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
Flow of mangrove ecosystem services to coastal communities in the Brazilian Amazon,"Mangrove forests are broadly recognized to support a variety of ecosystem services on coastal margins worldwide. These services may significantly contribute to the wellbeing of millions of people, but there is limited information about their importance in the Global South. This study mapped for the first time the flow of ecosystem services in Brazilian Amazon mangroves, which represent over 700,000 ha of mangroves in the country. We also identified the spatial changes in the flow of services across coastal landscapes, including urban, agricultural upland areas and coastal natural protected areas. Our matrix model indicated that mangroves, waterbodies, sandflats and mudflats are critical to the flow of multiple ecosystem services, including provisioning (fish, mariculture), cultural (historical and intrinsic value, research, and education), and regulation (climate, flood control, nursery, and breeding grounds). Social economic context, occupation, education, and residence time are important factors influencing villagers to identify the flow of ecosystem services, which could be compared across other coastal marine reserves in South America that have similar management of natural resources. Adjacent coastal upland habitats such as forests and croplands are important to support many provisioning ecosystem services to coastal villagers that would otherwise be obtained from mangroves, suggesting that protecting these connected habitats and supporting small-scale agriculture may help to avoid deforestation of mangrove forests. As over 80% of the mangroves in the country are managed as extractive reserves and may support communities with comparable socio-economic characteristics, we provide a foundation for the development and replication of ecosystem services assessments in Brazilian mangroves, which cover an area of over 1 million hectares. Our work highlights the importance of mangrove forests in providing food, and cultural services and to increase local climate resilience of coastal villages in the Amazon coast.

Environmental Sustainability in India: The Effects of Financial Development and Green Energy on Ecological Footprint,"In this study, environmental sustainability is investigated through the ecological footprint variable in India from 1965 to 2018. In this context, the impact of renewable energy use, financial development, urbanization and economic growth on India's ecological footprint is analyzed. Since all variables were stationary at the first difference, the cointegration relationship between variables was tested with Gregory-Hansen and Hatemi-J cointegration tests. Empirical findings have shown that there is a long-term relationship between the variables in the relevant period. FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR estimators were used to determine the direction and magnitude of the effect of the explanatory variables on the dependent variable. The estimation results found that while economic growth increased the ecological footprint the most, financial development decreased the most. In addition, the increase in urbanization increases environmental degradation. However, although the use of green energy is not at the desired level, it increases the environmental quality. On the other hand, the study tests the EKC hypothesis for India. Research results support that there is an inverted-u-shaped relationship between economic growth and ecological footprint. Therefore, for India, whose GDP is integrated with fossil fuels, higher growth at the beginning causes more fossil fuel use and negatively affects environmental quality. On the other hand, increasing urbanization in India, which has an underdeveloped energy infrastructure, increases environmental degradation. However, increasing renewable energy and financial development offer significant opportunities to reduce the ecological footprint. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Step-feeding in aerobic/anoxic cycles enhanced the performance of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) systems treating effluents with low C:N ratios,"Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) systems treating effluents with a C:N:P ratio similar to real old landfill leachate were evaluated on simultaneous C, N and P removals, and to reduce the main problems encountered, such as nitrite accumulation, biomass loss, and granule disintegration. Therefore, six sequential batch reactors (SBR) were operated with different anaerobic (A), anoxic (An), and aerobic (O) configurations: A/O (R1 and R2), O/An with conventional feeding and well-defined anoxic phase (R3), O/An with step-feeding and well-defined anoxic phase (R4), and O/An (R5 and R6). The O/An with step-feeding reactor (R4) had the highest biomass retention/settleability (SVI30 < 50 mL/g), the best nitrification rates (99%), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (97%), total nitrogen (91%) and total phosphorous (55%) removals. Furthermore, there was no nitrite accumulation, and granules’ disintegration was insignificant. The most abundant phylum in the reactors O/An was Planctomycetota, composed mainly of organisms from the Pirellulaceae and Legionellaceae families. In these reactors, the abundance of phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs) and denitrifying bacteria were similar, while the abundance of glycogen-accumulating organisms was much higher than PAOs. Therefore, the type of cycle directly influences performance, granule characteristics, and system stability, being important for future investigations applying the AGS technology to leachate treatment. © 2022 The Institution of Chemical Engineers",Not About Sufficiency
Risks to Coastal Critical Infrastructure from Climate Change,"Coastal systems are sensitive to direct and indirect impacts of climate change. Approximately 90% of all coastal areas will be affected by climate change to varying degrees. Nearly half of the world’s major cities are located within 50 km of a coast, and coastal population densities are 2.6 times greater than those of inland areas, with a steep rise over the years. While coastal critical infrastructure is expanding, more social and physical systems are increasingly exposed to climate-induced hazards. The interconnectedness and interdependencies of critical infrastructure systems increase their systemic instability and fragility, resulting in greater dynamic risk and cascading impacts. Coastal critical infrastructure systems on several continents are at risk from the effects of climate change, including sea level rise, storm surges, and extreme weather events. Therefore, it is necessary to build and run climate-resilient infrastructure that is planned, designed, implemented, and operated to predict, be prepared for, and adapt to changing climatic circumstances. This review provides an up-to-date, objective, and critical assessment based on the literature to help determine what is known and what needs the future attention of researchers.

Regulation of CO2 fluxes along gradients of water saturation in irrigation canal sediments,"Hydrological intermittency affects sediment biogeochemistry, organic carbon (OC) metabolism and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission but the study of the effects of drying is generally confined to natural ecosystems. Agricultural canals are artificial, widespread elements in irrigated floodplains, and regularly subjected to water level fluctuations. The aim of this study was to quantify the CO2 emissions along water saturation gradients in artificial canals to understand the environmental factors regulating these fluxes. CO2 measurements were performed in five replicated canals within the Po River basin (Northern Italy). In each canal we analysed three sites: (i) a spot with exposed, dry sediments; (ii) a spot with inundated, saturated sediments and (iii) a spot with an intermediate level of saturation. Besides dark CO2 flux measurements, net potential nitrification and denitrification rates were measured as proxies of sediment redox potential and due to their CO2 sink and source role, respectively. We hypothesized a site-specific regulation of CO2 emission, depending on the interplay among water saturation, sediment oxidation and organic matter content. Our results suggest that desiccation stimulates mineralization processes and CO2 fluxes, that were mainly dependant on water and organic matter content and correlated with microbial N transformations. CO2 emissions tended to increase along the considered water saturation gradients, almost tripling rates from inundated, saturated (158.2 ± 24.1 mmol CO2 m−2 days−1) to dry, exposed sediments (416.5 ± 78.9 mmol CO2 m−2 days−1). Results also suggest that net potential nitrification and denitrification allow tracing the effects of drying on N microbial communities involved in CO2 fluxes. Net potential nitrification rates produce little effects on CO2 fluxes, but is a good proxy of oxygen (O2) availability, whereas potential denitrification may be responsible for variable fractions (up to 100%) of CO2 production, in wetter sediments. © 2021, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Knowledge diffusion trajectories of agile software development research: A main path analysis,"Context: The dramatic growth of agile software development (ASD) research has resulted in a large number of diverse theoretical and empirical publications. The citation relationships among these publications indicate knowledge dissemination across and within academia or scientists. Objective: This study offers a comprehensive understanding of the ASD literature by exploring the knowledge diffusion path through the citation network of publications that have made significant contributions to its research development. Method: We employ a quantitative citation-based methodology, main path analysis (MPA), to examine the citation relationship of 1431 scientific articles published in the Web of Science (WoS) between 2001 and 2021 and visualize the MPA results using Pajek software. Results: Through citation analysis this study discovers knowledge diffusion trajectories of publications concerning ASD method. Our key results present 32 publications identified along the key-route main path as the most influential ones in the trajectories of ASD. There are three phases of ASD research development: introduction, evaluation, and deployment and expansion. Using the multiple-global main path, we further uncover the publication trends from a set of recent papers and reveal four sub-themes: tailoring of agile practices, large-scale agile context, challenges and success factors of large-scale organizations, and agile global software development. Conclusions: Although there was little academic interest in the initial phase, ASD-related publication and citation trends have consistently increased over time. The historical development of ASD methods was established in three distinct phases of publications in the domain. Each phase presents a narrative of agile methods’ development with different focuses. The most recent trends of ASD publications tend to focus on the agile tailoring and scaling process in the global and distributed environment. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Hydropower: A low-hanging sour-sweet energy option for India,"India is the world's second largest populous nation, fifth largest economy with seventh largest geographical area but experiences high energy poverty. With the lowest per capita energy consumption among world's top ten economies, India ranks at 137 out of 218 nations. Hydropower has the potential to alleviate India's energy asymmetry as well as realize its sustainable growth aspiration of a low-carbon regime. However, hydropower in India has been plagued by debates on human displacement, loss of biodiversity, increased risk of natural disasters, and socio-economic conflicts making it an unpopular energy alternative. Here, we review and address various concerns related to India's hydropower sector, examine scientific evidence, analyze energy policy imperatives, geopolitical considerations, and future directions for a sustainable hydropower policy in India in the context of ongoing climate change. Evidence indicates that besides electricity generation, hydropower infrastructure helps: (i) avert floods, (ii) mitigate the impacts of global warming, and (iii) ensure redistribution of water to arid regions and improve water security. As a part of sustainable hydropower policy, we propose that most of the ecological and social problems associated with hydropower development can be avoided to a great extent through careful planning, proper project design, responsible ownership, and public participation. As short-term measures, we propose: (i) entrepreneurs and planners follow credible and transparent pre-project investigations, (ii) mandatory implementation of environmental management plans, and (iii) better accountability and transparency of statutory bodies as well as hydropower developers. For long-term measures, we suggest: (i) create a 'National Institute of Energy & Environmental Sustainability' to oversee post-project hydropower developmental activities, (ii) streamline various bureaucratic and institutional procedures, and (ii) establish a trans-boundary water management system for seamless and coordinated implementation of hydropower development programs across upstream-downstream nations.",Not About Sufficiency
Reviewing the impacts of smart energy applications on energy behaviours in Norwegian households,"As climate problems escalate, it is crucial to reduce emissions. Understanding the ability of citizens to engage in decarbonization efforts is vital to address the sustainability challenge posed by climate problems. The potential for emissions reductions through changes in environmentally friendly behaviour is significant but often underestimated. Among many environmentally friendly behaviours, sustainable residential energy behaviours can have a direct impact, as a large share of total energy is consumed in the residential sector, and end-user practices can have a significant effect. As smart technology advances, various digital solutions have emerged for the end-users, significantly influencing their daily behaviour. Notably, smart energy applications have gained increased popularity among these solutions. This study aims to examine the potential and opportunities of smart energy apps to promote energy-related behaviour change and sustainable practices in the Norwegian context and to provide an overview of the relevant literature. Our findings suggest a significant lack of empirical research on the effectiveness of energy-related apps in promoting sustainable residential energy behaviour. Additionally, the limited empirical findings that do exist are mainly based on pilot-level projects, with little evidence from population-level adoption. Therefore, further research is needed to gain qualitative and quantitative insights into users' motivations and perceptions and investigate these apps' effectiveness in changing energy-related behaviours and sustaining behaviour change in the residential sector. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Institutions on Economic and Environmental Performance: Evidence from Europe,"Within the Environmental Kuznets Curve framework, we investigate whether the effect of institutions on environmental quality differs among the Western Balkans, the other European post-socialist states, and Western Europe. We estimate both direct and indirect effects of institutions on air pollution for each respective sub-sample and for the whole European region (45 countries during 1996-2014). The negative direct effect is greater for non-post-socialist states, compared to post-socialist ones. Regarding the indirect effect, improving the quality of economic institutions induces an increase in the scale of economic activity, leading to an increase in CO2 emissions per capita. Estimated elasticities of CO2 emissions with respect to institutions, for all sub-groups, uncover a total positive effect, which is larger for Central-eastern and South-eastern European states. Improving the quality of institutions should go hand in hand with stricter formation and implementation of policies designed to decouple economic growth from CO2 emissions. © 2022 Maria Panteli et al., published by Sciendo.",Not About Sufficiency
Cities and quality of life. Quantitative modeling of the emergence of the happiness field in urban studies,"Where we live affects all aspects of our life and thus our happiness. In recent years, and now for more than half of the population of the Earth, our place of residence or activity has been increasingly transformed into an urban one. However, while the impact of happiness studies has grown in importance during the last twenty years, we note that happiness-related concepts find it difficult to penetrate the planning and design of cities, and affect the field of urban studies. In this paper, we map the temporal evolution of the fields of happiness and urban studies into dynamic networks obtained by paper keywords co-occurrence analysis. We identify the main concepts of the “urban happiness” field and their capacity to agglomerate into coherent thematic clusters. We find that while quality of life and well-being are highly interconnected with some well-defined urban categories, other happiness-related concepts, as subjective well-being or happiness itself, are located in peripheral positions where their influence is minimised. We present a one-parameter spatial network model in order to reproduce the changes in the topology of these networks. Results explain the evolution and the level of interpenetration of these two fields as a function of “conceptual” distances, mapped into Euclidean ones. In addition to other approaches (i.e., co-frequency matrix of bibliometric analysis), complex networks science appears as a valid alternative and opens the way for the systematic study of other academic fields in terms of complex evolving networks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Threatening dystopias: Development and adaptation regimes in Bangladesh,"Development in Bangladesh is increasingly defined by and through an adaptation regime, a socially and historically specific configuration of power that governs the landscape of possible intervention in the face of climate change. It includes institutions of development, research, media, and science, as well as various state actors both nationally and internationally. The adaptation regime operates through three interrelated processes: imagination, experimentation, and dispossession. Each of these processes is produced and manifested both materially and epistemically. The adaptation regime is built on a vision of development in which urbanization and export-led growth are both desirable and inevitable. For the rural poor, this entails dispossession from agrarian livelihoods and outmigration. As this shift contributes to the expansion of production of export commodities such as garments and frozen shrimp, the threat of climate change and its associated migrations is reframed as an opportunity for development and growth. © 2018 by American Association of Geographers.",Not About Sufficiency
Reduction of physical activity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Background: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) decrease their physical activity. However, it is unknown at which stage of the disease the reduction occurs and whether dyspnea is a limiting factor. Aim: To compare physical activity between patients with COPD and controls of similar age and to assess its association with disease severity. Material and Methods: We studied 112 patients with mild to very severe COPD and 55 controls. Lung function, six-minutes walking test (SMWT), and physical activity through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) were measured. Results: Compared to controls, physical activity was significantly reduced in COPD patients (1823 ± 2598 vs. 2920 ± 3040 METs min/week; p = 0.001). Patients were more frequently sedentary (38 vs. 11%), while controls were more often very active (31 vs. 19%) or moderately active (58 vs. 43%). Physical activity was reduced from Global Initiative for Obstructive Chronic Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 2 and from Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnea grade 1. Weak relationships were observed between lung function, SMWT and physical activity. Conclusions: Physical activity decreases early in the course of the disease and when dyspnea is still mild, among patients with COPD.",Not About Sufficiency
Clean energy entrepreneurship in sub-Saharan Africa,"Many clean energy ventures, particularly those in the early stage and operating in the developing world, never get off the ground because traditional sources of capital like banks tend to shy away from sectors that seem unfamiliar or too risky. As highlighted most recently in the COP21 Paris Climate Change summit in December 2015, there is a critical gap in market understanding of and limited scholarly research on the role clean energy entrepreneurship can play in addressing energy poverty and sustainable business model development in the developing world. To address these gaps, this chapter seeks to connect the theory and practice of clean energy entrepreneurship in sub-Saharan Africa. Three issues and questions will be explored in this chapter. First, what are the critical differences in terms of sustainability and entrepreneurship between industrialized OECD countries and emerging markets and developing countries? Second, what key issues and questions need to be addressed in order to design, build, and scale a clean energy entrepreneurial ecosystem in sub-Saharan Africa? Third, what is the future outlook for clean energy entrepreneurship in sub-Saharan Africa? Copyright © 2016 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
E-government as an anti-corruption tool: panel data analysis across countries,"Over the past two decades, many governments around the world have adopted e-government as an anti-corruption tool. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the impacts of e-government on corruption. Thus, this article aims to empirically examine whether e-government reduces corruption across countries. For this purpose, longitudinal data from 2003 to 2016 were collected from 214 countries and then panel data analysis based on a fixed-effect model was conducted. Analysis results reveal that e-government as a whole significantly reduces corruption, while the effects of open government as one type of e-government are unclear. However, the rule of law moderates the relationship between open government and corruption. That is, in countries with more effective legal systems, open government is more likely to reduce corruption than in countries with less effective legal systems. E-government as a whole can effectively reduce corruption. Open government, such as open data portals and online discussion forums, does not have a direct impact on the reduction of corruption. Open government can have a conditional impact on corruption, relying on the effectiveness of legal systems. © The Author(s) 2019.",Not About Sufficiency
How the climate movement shaped the EU: protest cycles and democratic spaces in the European green deal,"The European Green Deal (EGD), a broad programme aiming at EU climate neutrality by 2050, includes attention to democratic participation. This article unpacks how social movement claims about participatory democracy are reflected in the EGD. It discusses the long-term impacts of social movements through the cumulative effects of protest cycles on complex political contexts and explains how movements’ claims about participatory democracy contributed to shape the EGD. After discussing how these claims have been carried through protest cycles since the turn of the millennium into current demands for citizens’ assemblies by climate justice movement groups, the EU’s actions to include this idea in the EGD and beyond is described. The EU has taken up the idea of citizens’ assemblies, but with important differences from their practice in protest cycles. Attention to the experiences of social movements and co-design approaches could allow for innovative EU policies and improved legitimacy. © 2025 The Author(s).

Temperatures that sterilize males better match global species distributions than lethal temperatures,"Attempts to link physiological thermal tolerance to global species distributions have relied on lethal temperature limits, yet many organisms lose fertility at sublethal temperatures. Here we show that, across 43 Drosophila species, global distributions better match male-sterilizing temperatures than lethal temperatures. This suggests that species distributions may be determined by thermal limits to reproduction, not survival, meaning we may be underestimating the impacts of climate change for many organisms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Not About Sufficiency

Towards a Global Biodiversity Action Agenda,"Non-state and sub-national actors (e.g. cities, regions and companies) are increasingly taking action to address biodiversity loss. They set up standards and commitments, provide funding, create and disseminate information, and execute projects on the ground. As part of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) decided to implement the ‘Sharm El-Sheikh to Beijing Action Agenda for Nature and People’. While there is general support for a voluntary commitment process, the question now is how the Action agenda should look like, what form voluntary commitments for biodiversity should take and if and how the action agenda could become a meaningful pillar in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. A recent study by the authors reveals the actual depth and breadth of biodiversity governance beyond the CBD. This contribution argues that lessons learned from the ongoing climate change action agenda should urgently be taken into account when further developing the biodiversity action agenda. © 2019 The Authors.

Conservation enforcement: Insights from people incarcerated for wildlife crimes in Nepal,"There are long-standing debates about the effectiveness and social impacts of enforcement-based conservation, particularly as investments into enforcement increase in response to growing alarm about Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT). However, there is little data on the people subject to this enforcement, including prison sentences, species targeted, what motivates and deters them, and the social impacts of enforcement. This study identified 384 individuals across Nepal who were in prison for IWT offences in late 2016, and involved interviews (n = 116) focused on respondents' trade practices, economic circumstances and motivations. IWT prisoners represented 10–20% of the total prison populations in two regions and often received stiff sanctions, with a range of downstream impacts on respondents' families. Most respondents were arrested for their involvement in the rhinoceros trade (61%). Most were poor (56%) and from indigenous communities (75%), highlighting potentially inequitable impacts of enforcement. Despite common assumptions about the links between IWT, poverty and organized crime, most respondents were motivated by the desire to earn extra income and by the ease of IWT compared to other employment. IWT was neither a primary livelihood strategy, nor had the attributes for formal organized crime. Respondents, particularly poor respondents, seemed to underestimate the risks of detection and incompletely understood the scale of sanctions. Improved public awareness about the scale and social impacts of sanctions could help increase deterrence effects while reducing unintended social harms of enforcement. © 2019 The Authors.

Designing a global assessment of climate change on inland fishes and fisheries: knowns and needs,"To date, there are few comprehensive assessments of how climate change affects inland finfish, fisheries, and aquaculture at a global scale, but one is necessary to identify research needs and commonalities across regions and to help guide decision making and funding priorities. Broadly, the consequences of climate change on inland fishes will impact global food security, the livelihoods of people who depend on inland capture and recreational fisheries. However, understanding how climate change will affect inland fishes and fisheries has lagged behind marine assessments. Building from a North American inland fisheries assessment, we convened an expert panel from seven countries to provide a first-step to a framework for determining how to approach an assessment of how climate change may affect inland fishes, capture fisheries, and aquaculture globally. Starting with the small group helped frame the key questions (e.g., who is the audience? What is the best approach and spatial scale?). Data gaps identified by the group include: the tolerances of inland fisheries to changes in temperature, stream flows, salinity, and other environmental factors linked to climate change, and the adaptive capacity of fishes and fisheries to adjust to these changes. These questions are difficult to address, but long-term and large-scale datasets are becoming more readily available as a means to test hypotheses related to climate change. We hope this perspective will help researchers and decision makers identify research priorities and provide a framework to help sustain inland fish populations and fisheries for the diversity of users around the globe. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).",Not About Sufficiency
Public acceptance of post-growth: Factors and implications for post-growth strategy,"Growing evidence supports the need to re-evaluate the nature and function of our economies in favour of post-growth principles if we are to have a socially and environmentally viable future. This study contributes to the discussion on how to achieve such a future by addressing a remaining gap in the literature about the public acceptance of post-growth, since a viable transition requires public support to validate political actions. Taking a mixed-methods approach, we ask which values and socio-economic characteristics are associated with support for post-growth and why. On average among 34 European countries, 60.5 % of people are in favour of post-growth. Values such as environmentalism, collectivism and post-materialism were found to support post-growth visions of the future, but support for post-growth and these values is lower among disadvantaged people. We conclude that greater emphasis on redistribution and improving opportunities and livelihoods for disadvantaged people in a post-growth economy is key to making such a future more acceptable to them. However, this conflicts with policy preferences and values such as hierarchy, meritocracy, and individualism that tend to be more prominent among people who are well-off. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
The interaction between market forces and management systems: A case study of non-wood forest products in the humid forest zone of cameroon,"In Cameroon, resources such as non-wood forest products are often managed as common pool resources in customary systems, which have been variously influenced by changes in policy, demographics and market opportunities. This research explored the effects of increasing commercialisation on the customary management systems for three commercially important species, Gnetum spp. (Gnetum), Irvingia spp. (bush mango) and Ricinodendron heudelotii (njansang) in two areas differentiated on the basis of level of commercialisation. Findings showed that increased commercialisation was leading to overharvesting of these products, particularly Gnetum. The customary rules of access were also changing as the perception of improved marketing opportunities was leading to restrictions on access to bush mango and Gnetum. The increasing privatisation of access for njansang has removed it from the common pool, which could negatively affect those women, with insecure access to land, who depend on its harvest and sale as a source of livelihood.",Not About Sufficiency
The emerging global tourism geography-an environmental sustainability perspective,"The current development of tourism is environmentally unsustainable. Specifically, tourism's contribution to climate change is increasing while other sectors are reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. This paper has two goals: reveal the main structural cause for tourism's emission growth and show the consequences thereof for (mitigation) policies. It is reasoned that the main cause for tourism's strong emission growth is the time-space expansion of global tourism behavior. Contemporary tourism theory and geography fail to clearly describe this geographical development, making it difficult to understand this expansion and develop effective policies to mitigate environmental impacts. Therefore, this paper explores some elements of a 'new tourism geography' and shows how this may help to better understand the causes of the environmentally unsustainable development of tourism with respect to climate change and devise mitigation policies. © 2012 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating the Impact of Building Materials on Indoor Air Quality: A Critical Analysis,"It is known that people generally spend 90% of their time indoors. Therefore, indoor air quality is a major concern for many people. Building materials play an important role in indoor air quality. Therefore, this study evaluates the role of building materials in IAQ by conducting a bibliometric analysis of articles from the Web of Science Core Collection and utilizing VOSviewer software to analyze publications from 2010 to 2023, focusing on the citation, year, country, and keywords co-occurrence. The analysis reveals key trends and gaps in the literature, highlighting the predominance of specific materials and pollutants. It also highlights that variability in building parameters makes attributing pollution sources difficult and underlines the need for context-specific assessments. These findings underscore the critical need to prioritize IAQ in building design and management to ensure safe and healthy indoor environments.

Climate change accounting and the Australian mining industry: Exploring the links between corporate disclosure and the generation of legitimacy,"This paper explores how disclosure is used by key bodies in the Australian mining industry as a means to respond to climate change and ensure their social licence to operate. The study utilises a legitimacy theory framework and a multi-case analysis to examine the environmental disclosure practices via a variety of media of two companies and two industry bodies within Australia's mining industry. It is revealed that a combination of legitimising strategies is undertaken by key bodies in the Australian mining industry, however to differing degrees depending on the organisation. There is also support for the notion that different media plays a critical role in facilitating the legitimacy seeking behaviours of the companies and industry bodies. This study extends existing literature on legitimacy theory by highlighting the value of utilising this perspective to explore contemporary phenomena such as corporate responses to climate change. The findings of this study have practical significance as they are expected to have important policy ramifications. One of the differentiating features of this paper, compared to prior studies utilising a legitimacy theory framework, is the examination of legitimising disclosure strategies at an industry level, which complements a company level analysis. Moreover, variations in legitimising disclosure strategies and communication media employed may be due to their focus on differing conferring publics and stakeholder groups. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Nature, limits and form-of-life","Sustainable development, ecological modernisation, eco-efficiency and the like have reframed material limits as conventional barriers to growth. Even in recent arguments for degrowth, limits recede to the background in favour of self-limitation. To reclaim limits as the grounds for an effective environmental politics. I reconstruct how the case for the limits to growth was reversed into a case for the growth of limits, and how foundational boundaries were increasingly blurred. Arguing that lifestyle politics is unlikely to be effective against the growth machine, I elaborate on the notion of form-of-life. If not understood as a solipsistic self-mastery but as the mutually formative encounter of living entities–provided with their own dispositions yet sharing a common destiny–this notion puts the focus on how freedom and equality are premised on, rather than hampered by, limits. I conclude with four reasons why a radical theory and politics for the environment should make use of the notion. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
"Mechanical, antibacterial, and non-cytotoxic performance of polypropylene nanocomposites reinforced with sTiO2 deposited with AgNPs mediated by quercetin biomolecule","In this work, the mechanical, antibacterial, and non-cytotoxic performance of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) nanocomposites was evaluated when silanized TiO2 (sTiO2) nanoparticles deposited with AgNPs were used as filler. The synthesis and deposition on sTiO2 were carried out using the quercetin biomolecule as reducing and stabilizing agents, as green approach. One-step and two-step methods were compared, and two qualities of quercetin were used: reactive grade (99% purity) and dietary supplement (20% purity). Both methods were characterized by UV, TEM, EDX, XRD, and Z potential. For nanocomposites, iPP was prepared with sTiO2-AgNPs at two ratios, 0.5 and 1% w/w, to evaluate whether the nanoparticles can confer antimicrobial activity and improve their mechanical properties. The antibacterial activity was studied against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and the mechanical properties were evaluated by dynamic mechanical analysis. The best nanomaterial was prepared by the one-step method using quercetin dietary supplement, with the highest silver content (7.0%) and the most significant antibacterial activity, with an improvement of 40%. As for the nanocomposites, those prepared at 0.05% w/w with the one-step method presented the best dynamic mechanical properties, because the fillers were well dispersed and significantly improved the integration and stress dissipation, thus enhancing the antimicrobial capacity. Finally, cytotoxic activity evaluation found that nanocomposites of iPP with sTiO2-AgNPs are non-toxic, unlike single AgNPs. These findings open the possibility of using these nanocomposites with high antimicrobial power and without cytotoxic effects at industrial and commercial level in medicine, food, environment, among others.

Portrayals of the tiny house in electronic media: challenging or reproducing the Australian dream home,"The Australian home is embedded within social norms that align the ideal dwelling with the large detached suburban house and mass-consumption. In this paper, we present a Foucauldian discourse analysis of Australian electronic media representations of the tiny house to better understand how this dwelling type might challenge the normalisation of the Australian dream home. Our analysis suggests that the tiny house is a crucial site both for contesting and normalising sets of ideas that constitute the Australian dream home. Those advocating for tiny house living tap into narratives of ‘less is more’ and ‘debt free living’ that trouble dominant Australian housing social norms by generating material spaces that suggest affinities with affordability, slower-paced off-grid living, and enhanced sustainability. Yet, the electronic media representation of the tiny house simultaneously reproduces dominant housing social norms around luxury (even ‘in nature’) and a still unfettered material consumption. To conclude we draw out the broad implications of these contradictory media representations of the tiny house for Australian planners. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
"Identifying the driving forces of global ecosystem services balance, 2000–2020","In 2019, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly announced the implementation of the “UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030)” initiative. However, overexploitation continues to severely impact the global ecosystem services (ESs) balance. Identifying the global ESs balance and its driving forces can effectively identify sensitive areas under such high ecological stress and corresponding governance responses. The world is currently facing increasing pressure on natural resources, while research on this issue remains controversial at global level. To address the gap, we portrayed the spatial characteristics of global ESs balance across county units worldwide in 2000, 2010, and 2020, and we further examined the driving forces of ESs balance covering six continents of the world (excluding Antarctica) by Geodetector model. Our results showed that the deficit areas of ESs balance were concentrated in urban and barren areas, while the surplus areas were distributed in areas with dense vegetation, especially primary forest communities. Furthermore, the global Moran's I value of ESs balance averaged 0.719 over three years, demonstrating a significant spatial dependence of its spatial distribution. According to the spatial statistical analysis, the factors that affected ESs balance varied among continents and had evolved over the last two decades. Nevertheless, nighttime light intensity and forest proportion consistently showed high contributions, with maximum values of 0.569 and 0.546, respectively. The contribution of socio-economic factors is higher in the developed regions and lower in the less developed regions. This work provides a framework for future global large-scale ESs balance assessments. It identifies similarities in impact mechanisms across continents and the dominance of individual drivers to encourage contextualized, collaborative governance in environmental policy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Evaluating the circular economy–based big data analytics capabilities of circular agri-food supply chains: the context of Turkey,"Agri-food supply chains (AFSCs) are one of the significant building blocks of agricultural production, and their sustainability aims are advanced by big data analytics (BDA) and the circular economy (CE). As access to safe, healthy, and high-quality food has become increasingly difficult, AFSCs need to leverage their capabilities for CE-based BDA to overcome sustainability challenges. However, a significant gap exists in the relevant literature on how to identify such capabilities to achieve sustainability goals. To build CE-based BDA capabilities, organisations need to orchestrate their resources and competencies and align them well with specific sustainability targets. In consideration of these issues, this study was conducted to identify the aforementioned capabilities and their effects on the performance of circular AFSCs from the perspective of a developing country. To this end, a three-stage multi-criteria decision-making model was developed and used in the examination of circular AFSCs in Turkey. The findings revealed that supply chain management (SCM) was the most important capability, followed by organizational, technical, environmental, economic, and social capabilities. Furthermore, big data infrastructure was the most important sub-capability ahead of financial benefits, top management support, sustainability and resilience, and food waste reduction. Finally, productivity improvement was determined as the most significant impact of CE-based BDA capabilities on circular AFSCs. This study can serve as a reference for managers and policy-makers on what BDA capabilities should be developed for circular AFSCs. It also contributes to addressing the agricultural production issues encountered by developing countries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Microeconomic Ensemble Modeling to Inform Robust Adaptation to Water Scarcity in Irrigated Agriculture,"This paper compares the economic performance of a dam construction strategy versus a no dam construction (i.e., the statu quo) strategy under multiple scenarios and using a multimodel ensemble of three microeconomic mathematical programming models. The result is a database of simulations representing multiple plausible futures which offers information on uncertainty regarding scenario assumptions and model structure (through the ensemble spread). Using an iterative robust decision-making framework, simulation results are coupled with experts' knowledge and opinion to detect vulnerabilities in the proposed strategies, quantify potential trade-offs between responses, and identify a robust adaptation strategy. Methods are illustrated as applied to the Órbigo Catchment in Northwestern Spain, where the Douro River Basin Authority (DRBA) will decide in the coming months whether to build two dams to enhance irrigation water supply and reliability. Simulation results show that, for most scenarios and models considered, dam construction costs lead to water prices beyond the willingness of local cereal-growing irrigators to pay. Following a robust decision-making process, parties to the decision unanimously declared the status quo (i.e., no dam construction) strategy to be preferred to the dam construction strategy. This outcome substantiates the need for economic assessments of dam construction projects that account for nonlinear responses by agents to complement technical assessments in decision making. © 2021 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.",Not About Sufficiency
Social Accounting into Action: Religion as ‘Moral Source’,"This paper analyses, and responds to, one aspect of perceived failures of social and environmental accounting to make societies more sustainable. First, we argue that Charles Taylor’s concept of moral sources can articulate part of the ‘motivational gap’ between social and environmental accounts and sustainability. A moral source is an ideal that inspires people to enact their beliefs. Without a compelling moral source, social and environmental accounts may increase people’s knowledge of sustainability issues without changing their behaviour. Second, we use religion to illustrate the type of moral source that social accounting might mobilise. Drawing on Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudato Si': On Care for Our Common Home (2015), we outline how moral sources can clarify what sustainable action requires and help commit people to these actions. Third, we apply this religious moral source to social and environmental accounting research into climate change-induced migration. Our paper does not argue that religion in general, or Catholic texts in particular, are the only moral sources accounting research could use. Rather, we use this religious discourse to illustrate the potential value of more directly linking social and environmental accounting to ‘moral sources’ that perform a comparable role in motivating sustainable social practice. © 2017 Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research.",Not About Sufficiency

Part of the dissatisfaction derives from the Agreement itself: some sections are vague and difficult to translate into practices; the advisory committee structures are not well suited to Native cultures; and the right to develop is woven throughout the sections on environmental protection. However, failures and delays in implementing the Agreement have also contributed to this dissatisfaction. These issues have implications for the negotiation strategies of other groups.",Not About Sufficiency
Narrow and Brittle or Broad and Nimble? Comparing Adaptive Capacity in Simplifying and Diversifying Farming Systems,"Humanity faces a triple threat of climate change, biodiversity loss, and global food insecurity. In response, increasing the general adaptive capacity of farming systems is essential. We identify two divergent strategies for building adaptive capacity. Simplifying processes seek to narrowly maximize production by shifting the basis of agricultural production toward centralized control of socially and ecologically homogenized systems. Diversifying processes cultivate social-ecological complexity in order to provide multiple ecosystem services, maintain management flexibility, and promote coordinated adaptation across levels. Through five primarily United States focused cases of distinct agricultural challenges—foodborne pathogens, drought, marginal lands, labor availability, and land access and tenure—we compare simplifying and diversifying responses to assess how these pathways differentially enhance or degrade the adaptive capacity of farming systems in the context of the triple threat. These cases show that diversifying processes can weave a form of broad and nimble adaptive capacity that is fundamentally distinct from the narrow and brittle adaptive capacity produced through simplification. We find that while there are structural limitations and tradeoffs to diversifying processes, adaptive capacity can be facilitated by empowering people and enhancing ecosystem functionality to proactively distribute resources and knowledge where needed and to nimbly respond to changing circumstances. Our cases suggest that, in order to garner the most adaptive benefits from diversification, farming systems should balance the pursuit of multiple goals, which in turn requires an inclusive process for active dialogue and negotiation among diverse perspectives. Instead of locking farming systems into pernicious cycles that reproduce social and ecological externalities, diversification processes can enable nimble responses to a broad spectrum of possible stressors and shocks, while also promoting social equity and ecological sustainability. © Copyright © 2021 Petersen-Rockney, Baur, Guzman, Bender, Calo, Castillo, De Master, Dumont, Esquivel, Kremen, LaChance, Mooshammer, Ory, Price, Socolar, Stanley, Iles and Bowles.",Not About Sufficiency
Broad patterns in domestic vector-borne Trypanosoma cruzi transmission dynamics: synanthropic animals and vector control Quantitative analysis of strategies to achieve the 2020 goals for neglected tropical diseases: where are we now?,"Background: Chagas disease (caused by Trypanosoma cruzi) is the most important neglected tropical disease (NTD) in Latin America, infecting an estimated 5.7 million people in the 21 countries where it is endemic. It is one of the NTDs targeted for control and elimination by the 2020 London Declaration goals, with the first goal being to interrupt intra-domiciliary vector-borne T. cruzi transmission. A key question in domestic T. cruzi transmission is the role that synanthropic animals play in T. cruzi transmission to humans. Here, we ask, (1) do synanthropic animals need to be targeted in Chagas disease prevention policies?, and (2) how does the presence of animals affect the efficacy of vector control? Methods: We developed a simple mathematical model to simulate domestic vector-borne T. cruzi transmission and to specifically examine the interaction between the presence of synanthropic animals and effects of vector control. We used the model to explore how the interactions between triatomine bugs, humans and animals impact the number and proportion of T. cruzi-infected bugs and humans. We then examined how T. cruzi dynamics change when control measures targeting vector abundance are introduced into the system. Results: We found that the presence of synanthropic animals slows the speed of T. cruzi transmission to humans, and increases the sensitivity of T. cruzi transmission dynamics to vector control measures at comparable triatomine carrying capacities. However, T. cruzi transmission is amplified when triatomine carrying capacity increases with the abundance of syntathoropic hosts. Conclusions: Our results suggest that in domestic T. cruzi transmission scenarios where no vector control measures are in place, a reduction in synanthropic animals may slow T. cruzi transmission to humans, but it would not completely eliminate transmission. To reach the 2020 goal of interrupting intra-domiciliary T. cruzi transmission, it is critical to target vector populations. Additionally, where vector control measures are in place, synanthropic animals may be beneficial. © 2015 Peterson et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Global research trends on the human exposome: a bibliometric analysis (2005–2024),"Exposome represents one of the most pressing issues in the environmental science research field. However, a comprehensive summary of worldwide human exposome research is lacking. We aimed to explore the bibliometric characteristics of scientific publications on the human exposome. A bibliometric analysis of human exposome publications from 2005 to December 2024 was conducted using the Web of Science in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Trends/hotspots were investigated with keyword frequency, co-occurrence, and thematic map. Sex disparities in terms of publications and citations were examined. From 2005 to 2024, 931 publications were published in 363 journals and written by 4529 authors from 72 countries. The number of publications tripled during the last 5 years. Publications written by females (51% as first authors and 34% as last authors) were cited fewer times (13,674) than publications written by males (22,361). Human exposome studies mainly focused on air pollution, metabolomics, chemicals (e.g., per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), endocrine-disrupting chemicals, pesticides), early-life exposure, biomarkers, microbiome, omics, cancer, and reproductive disorders. Social and built environment factors, occupational exposure, multi-exposure, digital exposure (e.g., screen use), climate change, and late-life exposure received less attention. Our results uncovered high-impact countries, institutions, journals, references, authors, and key human exposome research trends/hotspots. The use of digital exposome technologies (e.g., sensors, and wearables) and data science (e.g., artificial intelligence) has blossomed to overcome challenges and could provide valuable knowledge toward precision prevention. Exposome risk scores represent a promising research avenue. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Socioecological systems,"The socioecological system (SES) theory sprang from the recognition of close interaction between society, in terms of social-economic system, and natural system. Human society represents the driving forces of biosphere and ecological systems. So, it is relevant to understand the human sources of ecological change. To do this, we must understand the driving forces motivating human actions. There are several examples on how human and environment systems are coupled and how human choices and the consequent environmental effects influence each other. Here three examples regarding southern Yucatan, Arctic region, and Eastern Europe are reported. The assessment of the vulnerability of modern socioecological systems to future human activities and climate change can be greatly improved by (1) knowing the rates and directions of past trajectories in key processes, such as land cover, soil erosion, and flooding; (2) analyzing how thresholds have been transgressed in the past; and (3) deducing the natural or pre-impact patterns of environmental variability. Therefore, the past provides the means to test the models upon which we depend for future projections and scenarios. For this reason three generic responses are possible when a crisis occurs: (1) no effective responses; (2) response without experience; and (3) response with experience, in which the institution has previous experience with a crisis of that kind and management policy used on previous occasions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Epidemiology of selected diseases related to air pollution in Krakow,"Excessive concentrations of smog toxicants constitute a critical factor influencing the health quality of inhabitants of urban agglomerations. The exposure to elevated concentrations of suspended particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) is associated with an increase of adverse health effects. Prolonged exposure to air pollution, especially from low emission, may be linked not only to a greater risk of developing cancer of the respiratory system, or cardiovascular morbidity but also to the increased frequency of admissions to hospitals and emergency units as well as medical consultations in surgeries and outpatient clinics. The issue was investigated using the city of Cracow as an example. Attempts were made to find the connection between air pollution in the city of Cracow and the frequency of hospitalization and medical consultations of patients (registered in the city) due to lung and bronchial malignancy and cardiac dysrhythmia taking into account the data from the years 2010-2016 submitted by the Malopolska Regional Branch of the National Health Fund. © 2018 Polish Society of Ecological Engineering (PTIE).",Not About Sufficiency
Dehorning impacts white rhinoceros behaviour less than social events: evidence from Botswana,"Dehorning is a conservation measure used to protect rhinoceroses (‘rhinos’) from being poached by removing most of the visible horn and thus reducing the monetary reward for the risk that a poacher takes. Rhinos use their horns in comfort and aggressive social behaviours. The loss of the horn might result in a decrease in aggressive and affiliative behaviours and an increase in avoidance behaviours after dehorning due to a reduced effectiveness and potential discomfort when using the nasal body part. The dehorning procedure, which includes chasing and immobilization, can lead to the separation of groups and might therefore result in fewer social interactions. To estimate whether the stress of the dehorning procedure and the loss of the horn affect the activity budget of the rhino, we compared general activities and horn-related behaviours before and after dehorning. We observed nine (six females and three males) wild white rhinos (Ceratotherium simum simum) in Botswana for 1 month before and 1 month after dehorning. The proportions of feeding, resting, comfort, aggressive, avoidance and affiliative behaviours did not change significantly within 1 month after dehorning. We observed sex-specific changes in proportions of locomotion and in vocalization rates, which we linked to the chasing during the procedure and to the social events of two births in the study population. Effects of the dehorning itself seemed to be weak and short-lived. Our results suggest that dehorning has no major impact on rhino behaviour. However, there is a key need to investigate the effectiveness of dehorning in reducing poaching events. © 2023 The Authors.

Governing partnerships for development in post-conflict settings: Evidence from a longitudinal case study in Colombia,"Drawing on a longitudinal case study of a 10-year cross-sector partnership for development in Colombia, this paper makes three contributions to current discussions on new collaborative governance approaches in which business, non-governmental organizations and development agencies jointly address development challenges. First, our study explores how partnerships can be successful in achieving longer term development while being designed as short-term governance arrangements. Second, we shed light on how power asymmetries can shape partnership governance. Many studies have highlighted the negative aspects of donor involvement in cross-sector partnerships. We identify, however, that an interplay of formal and informal governance in partnerships can provide a positive enabling framework for partner relationships to grow and mature. Third, the case highlights that the studied partnership employed governance mechanisms that facilitate local ownership and empower small-scale farmers, which effected (longer term) value chain relationships. In this regard, our case study helps to understand governance processes and conditions under which transformative local partnerships can emerge and sustain in post-conflict settings. The paper adds observations on the collaborative governance content that is required for a more integrative research approach to corporate contributions to development. © 2020 The Authors.

Guidelines for co-creating climate adaptation plans for fisheries and aquaculture,"Climate change is having a significant impact on the biology and ecology of fish stocks and aquaculture species and will affect the productivity within seafood supply chains in the future. The challenges are further amplified when actors within the fisheries and aquaculture sectors have very different ideas and assumptions about climate change and what risks and opportunities they entail. In order to address the challenges of climate change, several countries have developed national adaptation plans. However, fisheries and aquaculture are rarely included in these plans, resulting in a general lack of documented adaptation strategies within these sectors in most countries. This paper introduces guidelines for the development of climate adaptation plans (CAPs) within fisheries and aquaculture, applying a co-creation approach that requires the participation of scientists, industry representatives, policymakers, and other relevant stakeholders. The objective is to provide a stepwise approach to facilitate and enable stakeholders to plan strategies toward climate adaptation. The guidelines are based on practical experience and include a three-step process: (1) assessment of risks and opportunities; (2) identification of adaptation measures, and (3) operationalization of CAPs. The three-step process is also part of a larger cycle, including implementation, monitoring, and evaluation, again generating iterative feedback loops over time. Lessons learned are discussed, and we highlight the advantages and challenges of developing CAPs. While the guidelines are designed for and tested within fisheries and aquaculture systems, the CAP approach is also employable for other natural resource-based systems. © 2021, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Management, public opinion and research on Costa Rica’s surface and groundwater resources","Costa Rica has a reputation as an ecotourism destination and a haven of biodiversity. However, in terms of the management of its water resources, its reputation for progressive environmental management is seriously challenged. The country’s water resources are managed by an array of government institutions and these are guided by legislation dating from 1942 long considered inadequate. Attempts to update the law have not yet met with success. A review of newsprint media during 2007-2008 revealed serious public concerns regarding government ability in managing water resources; the safety of potable water, ecosystem viability and especially surface and groundwater contamination. The major issues were: Central Valley urban area water quality concerns due to nearly inexistent wastewater treatment; northwest and central Pacific coast nearshore concerns due to poor wastewater management and an unreliable potable water supply; and Caribbean coastal plain concerns due to alleged groundwater contamination from pineapple cultivation. In an analysis of surface water quality at 56 sites in the Central Valley, home to nearly 60% of the nation’s population, highly degraded river courses were observed and high levels of nutrients corroborated the absence of wastewater treatment. With chaotic tourist development along the NW Pacific coast, similar observations were made at 15 sites. The Costa Rican government and public recognize the danger to human and aquatic ecosystem health. However, balancing population and economic growth against the availability of economic resources will continue to challenge their ability to manage their surface and groundwater resources. © 2010 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Factors affecting the participation in community forest conservation in Northern Upland of Laos P.D.R,"Results showed that the variable of household income had a strong degree of association with participation in activities of community forest conservation, and old age households had more opportunities to participate in knowledge dissemination activity than young age households. Men were more participated than women, especially, in forest restoration activities. The educated households were participated more in the activity of forest fire prevention than the uneducated households such as households who lived far from the place of community and were not to be members of social committees and who did not access training activities. In contrast, the getting information was promoted the people to participate more in activities of community forest conservation. The accessibility households of large landholding had less participated a lot of activities. Households are hold the executive position in social committees who participated more activity of forest conservation, and public relations activity. Moreover, households with long periods of residence are participated in the activity of forest conservation and public relations activity. The results showed that the community forests conservation activities of households were not homogeneous, due to a policy of users who were equal; participated in all activities of community forest conservation. © 2023 Association of Agricultural Technology in Southeast Asia.

Does green productivity promote agricultural productivity in Vietnamese market?,"Purpose: The research aims to assess the relationship between ecological innovation, green productivity, sustainable development and agricultural productivity in Vietnam. The agricultural sector of Vietnam has been observed with new opportunities which have fostered its productivity and growth. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a range of methods where initially, the researcher used descriptive analysis, cointegration and unit root tests. Secondly, Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) is used to assess the short and long run effects. The QARDL methodology is employed to capture the relationship between variables. Through this approach, the researcher is able to examine the scale of the interaction between dependent and independent variables. Findings: The unique findings drawn through statistical techniques are also a great addition to the context of literature related to Vietnam’s agricultural productivity. Practical insights can also not be denied as the study provides beneficial guidelines for Vietnam’s agricultural sector to refine agricultural productivity. Research limitations/implications: Scholars are advised to use strong literary techniques to overcome these limitations and give a more thorough investigation into the same ideas. The availability and dependability of data was one of the primary challenges in carrying out this study. Vietnam has made significant advances in the collection and documentation of agricultural data, but there might still be gaps in the availability of thorough and current data on ecological innovation, green production and sustainable development. Originality/value: Vietnam’s unique socioeconomic, cultural and environmental features influence how ecological innovation, green productivity, sustainable development and agricultural production are interconnected. Consequently, consideration should be taken when applying the results to various scenarios. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Participation in residential organic waste diversion programs: Motivators and optimizing educational messaging,"Participation in residential organic-waste-diversion-programs (OWDP) represents an individual-level behaviour with significant environmental benefits, including lowering greenhouse gas emissions. This study of 2621 Niagara, Canada, residents sought to understand the attitudinal and sociodemographic drivers of participation and non-participation in OWDP. Additionally, we examined the impact of messaging about the benefits of OWDP on likelihood of future participation while varying the frame and perceived source of information. Participants reported environmental factors as the main motivators for OWDP involvement, while non-participants cited smell, inconvenience and cost as the most salient barriers. Several sociodemographic and knowledge factors predicted participation, as did strong recognition of the anthropogenic origins of climate change. Forty two percent of non-participants were more likely to participate after receiving the educational message, but this did not vary with information source nor a social-norm frame. These findings inform theory around pro-environmental behaviour and provide actionable information for education campaigns aimed at promoting OWDP. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Impacts of Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystems on Sustainable Development: Insights from Latin America,"Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystems (DEEs) are transforming the economic landscape through their integration of digital technologies, offering new opportunities for innovation and growth. This study explores the impact of DEEs on sustainable development, focusing specifically on Latin America. As DEEs continue to evolve, understanding their influence on economic, environmental, and social sustainability becomes crucial, particularly in a region characterized by significant developmental challenges. Utilizing a data panel from two different periods of analysis, from 2013 to 2017 and from 2018 to 2022, within the adapted DEE framework provided by the Global Entrepreneurship Development Institute (GEDI), we employ Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA 3.0) to analyze DEE components across 14 Latin American countries. These countries may not have the full spectrum of digital capabilities, yet they are still able to harness the digital elements they do possess effectively. This suggests that even partial digitalization, when strategically utilized, can lead to substantial gains in sustainable development. Additionally, Networking, Digital Protection, and Digital Tech Transfer are DEE components that present a higher magnitude in social, environmental, and economic development in Latin American countries. This study not only contributes to a deeper understanding of a DEE’s role in fostering sustainable development, but it also offers actionable insights for policymakers and entrepreneurs to leverage DEEs for broader societal benefits. The implications of the findings present perspectives under the existing literature, and the conclusion shows recommendations for future research and strategy development. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Reducing industrial hydrogen demand through preheating with very high temperature heat pumps,"Decarbonising industry while maintaining economic competitiveness and improving living standards is one of the main challenges of reaching net zero targets, and low-carbon process heating will play a key role in this. In this work we investigate the potential to reduce the energy demands of hydrogen-based industrial heating systems using very high temperature reverse Joule-Brayton cycle heat pumps as preheaters, considering their economics and technical challenges. A thermodynamic process model is used to assess performance at temperatures of 300–500 °C, and cost optimisation is used to conduct cost-benefit analysis of preheating green hydrogen using heat pumps. It is found that over this temperature range, heat pump coefficient of performance lies in the range 1.4–1.7, with the turbine meeting 30–40% of the compressor load. At the electricity prices currently paid by heavy industry in Western Europe, levelised cost of heat from these heat pumps would be less than 4.5p/kWh. Using 500 °C heat pumps as preheaters in hydrogen heating systems could reduce hydrogen demands by over 20% and provide savings on the cost of green hydrogen of at least 8% out to 2050. With process heat accounting for three-quarters of industrial energy use and half of this being at temperatures above 400 °C, these savings are significant and suggest that very high temperature heat pumps could make an important contribution to industrial decarbonisation. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"Green finance, renewable energy, financial development, FDI, and CO2 nexus under the impact of higher education","This research investigates the relationships between CO2 emissions, the economy, renewable energy consumption, green financing, and foreign direct investment in BRICS nations from 2000 to 2019 under the effect of higher education. The stationarity of the data was evaluated using three unit root tests: ADF-Fisher, Levin, Lin, and Chin and Im, Pesaran, and Shin. The panel autoregressive distributed lag approach identified the long-run and short-run elasticities. The empirical findings demonstrate that variables cointegrate. In the long run, renewable energy, economic growth, green finance, foreign direct investment, and higher education all influence CO2 emissions; however, in the short run, only economic growth, renewable energy, and higher education influence CO2 emissions. The findings also indicate that higher education increases dramatically at the individual and societal levels, reducing CO2 emissions in the short and long term. The overall empirical study of group and economy is supported by the results of robust statistics. In light of the results, the BRICS economies are advised to collaborate for sustainable growth while preserving environmental quality. Moreover, the BRICS countries should prioritize investing in the growth of higher education and enhancing the use of renewable energy for sustainable development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Indoor air quality in portuguese archives: A snapshot on exposure levels,"Indoor air quality recently entered legislation in Portugal. Several parameters must be evaluated and kept within limits in order to obtain a certification for air quality and energy consumption. Certification parameters were analyzed in two Portuguese archives in order to assess indoor air quality both for people attending or working on these premises and for maintenance of a written heritage that must be retained for future generations. Carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), formaldehyde, and fungal counts were kept within stipulated limits. Relative humidity (RH), volatile organic compounds (VOC), particulate matter (PM10), and ozone (O3) showed values above legislated levels and justified the implementation of corrective measures. In terms of conservation, studies on the limit values are still needed, but according to the available international guidelines, some of the analyzed parameters such as PM10, O3, and RH were also above desirable values. Corrective measures were proposed to these institutions. Although this study was only of a short duration, it proved valuable in assessing potential eventual problems and constitutes the first Portuguese indoor air quality assessment taking into consideration both aspects of an archive such as human health and heritage safekeeping. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
The circular bioeconomy and innovation,"The evolution of the economy has always been dependent on technological progress. Successive inventions have made it possible to keep socio-economic progress moving forward, achieved, as can now be seen, at the expense of damage to the environment and growing external costs. The concept of the circular (bio)economy has the potential to become the next turning point in technology and processes, helping to solve the dilemma of choosing between economic growth or stopping negative environmental changes. The era of the circular (bio)economy has already begun. However, it will not be possible to eliminate externalities from the economic process and meet the population’s needs without changes to approaches to production and consumption, and innovations are an indispensable tool for doing this. The circular (bio)economy is an area which is in itself an innovative approach, and, understood as the next stage in economic history, it not only serves as source of inspiration, but also forces innovation through policy frameworks. This chapter employs the model proposed by J. Fourastié to show the links between evolution of the bioeconomy and innovations by analogy to the fossil fuel-based economy. Some examples of innovation in selected sectors of the bioeconomy will also be cited. The interdependence of the bioeconomy and innovation is linked to threats for countries which, by not implementing an innovation strategy, may fall victim to the resource curse. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Małgorzata Pink and Agnieszka Józefowska; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
A case study on life cycle energy use of residential building in Southern India,"The life cycle energy of a building consists of construction energy, operational energy and demolition energy. Construction refers to initial construction as well as recurring maintenance and repair work. Initial construction represents manufacturing of construction materials, transportation and site related on-site construction processes. Only a few studies focused on life cycle energy use of Indian residential buildings. However, the energy use due to on-site construction processes is either ignored or not modelled with adequate level of detail at present. This paper presents a case study on life cycle energy analysis of a residential development consisting of 96 identical apartment-type homes located in Southern India. Energy use due to transportation of materials and construction equipment use at site are quantified. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to study the influence of building service life and monthly electricity use per home on the relative significance of construction energy and operational energy. The construction energy is found to be a significant component of life cycle energy of residential buildings with partial or no air-conditioning. Further, reduced building service life period and increased energy efficiency achieved in the operational phase makes the construction energy as important as the operational energy with respect to life cycle. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Climate change adaptation in the Murray-Darling Basin: Reducing resilience of wetlands with engineering,"Conflict over water allocations and the need to adapt to climate change in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin has resulted in decision makers choosing engineering interventions to use water more efficiently for wetlands conservation. We review a range of policy and infrastructure adaptation measures implemented in the Basin by governments. The water supply and demand ""environmental works and measures"" adopted in the Coorong and Lower Lakes region, as well as along the River Murray, are assessed and compared with the opportunity costs for ecosystem-based adaptation. The results suggest that risks of disruption to ecological processes, desiccation of wetland areas and institutional failure with infrastructure-led adaptation measures are little appreciated. Further, ecosystem-based measures to maintain a more diverse range of ecological processes that would spread risk and conserve a more diverse range of biota have not been identified or adopted by governments. We conclude that as a primary adaptation to climate change environmental works and measures may represent overly-narrow or mal-adaptation that can reduce the resilience of wetland ecosystems. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.",Not About Sufficiency
Responsible artificial intelligence in Africa: towards policy learning,"Several African countries are developing artificial intelligence (AI) strategies and ethics frameworks with the goal of accelerating responsible AI development and adoption. However, many of these governance actions are emerging without consideration for their suitability to local contexts, including whether the proposed policies are feasible to implement and what their impact may be on regulatory outcomes. In response, we suggest that there is a need for more explicit policy learning, by looking at existing governance capabilities and experiences related to algorithms, automation, data, and digital technology in other countries and in adjacent sectors. From such learning, it will be possible to identify where existing capabilities may be adapted or strengthened to address current AI-related opportunities and risks. This paper explores the potential for learning by analysing existing policy and legislation in twelve African countries across three main areas: strategy and multi-stakeholder engagement, human dignity and autonomy, and sector-specific governance. The findings point to a variety of existing capabilities that could be relevant to responsible AI; from existing model management procedures used in banking and air quality assessment to efforts aimed at enhancing public sector skills and transparency around public–private partnerships, and the way in which existing electronic transactions legislation addresses accountability and human oversight. All of these point to the benefit of wider engagement on how existing governance mechanisms are working, and on where AI-specific adjustments or new instruments may be needed. © The Author(s), 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Restoring and conserving Khasi forests: A community-based REDD strategy from Northeast India,"An initiative to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) was launched in December 2007 at the Bali Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), yet little progress has been made in Asia in developing certified REDD projects, especially those that engage forest-dependent people. According to UNFCCC, REDD is a multilevel activity that involves both national policy and structures, as well as subnational projects involving local communities [1]. While many Asian nations are trying to create frameworks that link the national strategy to sub-national projects, in India this formal integration has yet to take place. As a consequence projects like the Khasi Hills Community REDD+ project fall outside the UNFCCC strategy and operate under voluntary standards (Plan Vivo) and markets. The project involves both avoided deforestation and reforestation components. The project is being implemented by a federation of ten Khasi tribal kingdoms, a major ethnolinguistic group in the Indian state of Meghalaya. Project experience may provide guidance regarding actions required to create a more enabling environment for community forest carbon projects in Asia. These findings may better inform the December 2015 21st UNFCCC Conference of Parties in Paris as they again address REDD strategy. The experience of this Khasi Federation [2] in designing and implementing a REDD project has led to the emergence of a modernizing forest management system that is helping to conserve and restore the Khasi's ancestral forests. Learning from this REDD project also illustrates the barriers that the Khasi communities have faced, including those imposed by national governments, certifiers, and carbon markets, that will likely constrain the expansion and replication of community-based climate initiatives. The author suggests some alternative policies and systems that may enable greater community participation in REDD projects. © 2015 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Enjoying climate change: Jouissance as a political factor,"In this paper, we explore this dissonance between knowing and acting that produces the current climate deadlock by focusing on ‘enjoyment’ as a political factor. The enjoyment that infuses the climate change consensus and climate activism stands as an avatar for the wider impasse that characterizes most attempts to inflect the trajectory of the future away from ‘accumulation for accumulation sake’ and its associated socio-ecological catastrophe. Considering enjoyment as a political factor might open avenues for re-framing the impasse of the present socio-ecological condition. We engage the Lacanian notion of enjoyment (jouissance). Our overall argument is that climate, and its change, is not only a threat to the world, but also something that is enjoyed in one way or the other. To illustrate the Lacanian take on enjoyment, we will differentiate between two dominant strands of enjoying climate change: First, a passionate engagement in destroying Nature based on an imperative to enjoy fossil fuels and what they metonymically stand for, and second, an equally passionate commitment to saving Nature based on an imaginary enjoyment that stems from renunciation and sacrifice. The paper proceeds by arguing for the need to traverse the fantasies that sustain the very deadlock of the current situation, a process that requires re-scripting the process of political subjectivation and our libidinal attachments to the enjoyment of climate change. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
The potential of agroforestry concessions to stabilize Amazonian forest frontiers: a case study on the economic and environmental robustness of informally settled small-scale cocoa farmers in Peru,"Agroforestry Concessions, foreseen by the new Peruvian Forest Law, anticipate integrating thousands of small-scale farmers encroached on public forest land into the formal economy, to strengthen local livelihoods, stimulate land restoration, and halt deforestation. But, there are contrasting opinions regarding the potential of agroforestry and land tenure security to create economically and environmentally robust livelihoods. To better understand the relevance of this potential, this study analyses the economic and environmental robustness of 118 informally settled small-scale cocoa farmers in three districts in the Peruvian Amazon. The study shows that the vast majority of these farmers faced serious obstacles to overcome. Less than 20 % of the households have managed to establish economically robust livelihoods on a robust natural production basis. Farm size, specialization in cocoa, and participation in associations positively influenced the economic performance of the households but had little effect on the quality of natural resource management and on the capacity to conserve forests. To harness the potential of cocoa farming requires long-term support well adapted to local specificities. The legal recognition of sustainable land-use practices on public forest land is a meaningful step. To effectively address deforestation, however, requires broader integrated approaches that go far beyond the promotion of sustainable land-uses. © 2020",Not About Sufficiency

Effective Action Strategy to Cope with Climate Change and Its Impact on Russia’s Economy,"Abstract: In continuation of the topic of choosing an effective strategy on coping with climate change and its impact (see [1]), this paper considers the strategy above within the framework of the conditions, imperatives, and prospects of the socio-economic development of modern Russia. It is substantiated that this strategy should imply the implementation of interrelated sets of institutional, economic, and technological measures that prioritize (1) boost of economic growth through improving production efficiency using the best available resource management technologies; (2) reduction of the hazardous impact of economic activity on the environment and the communities (primarily, cutting emissions of toxic and hazardous pollutants, including those containing carbon, into the air); (3) communities’ and ecosystems’ adaptation and protection against such an impact and its consequences, including climate change; (4) alleviation of accumulated effects and reduction of current and future technological impact on climate forcing environmental factors. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Mathematical model of determining a risk to the human health along with the detection of hazardous states of urban atmosphere pollution based on measuring the current concentrations of pollutants,"A mathematical model of joint determining the risk to human health and the identification of hazardous states of the polluted urban atmosphere based on the measurement of current concentrations of pollutants was developed. The structure of the model includes two structural units. The input data for structural units are the results of measuring current concentrations of atmospheric pollutants at a checkpoint. The current risk to human health is calculated in the first unit, and recurrent states of atmosphere for early detection of dangerous pollution levels are determined in the second unit. A distinctive feature of the model is the use of only measurements of current concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere at a control point. Meteorological or other information is not used. That is why the developed model is universal and can be used in any weather conditions and peculiarities of the urban infrastructure. The operation efficiency of the proposed model was tested experimentally using the example of measuring current concentrations of formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide, and ammonia in the atmosphere of the typical urban infrastructure. It was established that the developed model makes it possible to determine the risk of immediate toxic effects and chronic intoxication for humans, caused by atmospheric pollution. It was proved experimentally that the proposed model makes it possible, together with the identification of relevant risks to human health, to detect hazardous states of the polluted atmosphere, in which pollutants are usually accumulated. It was established that determining the current probability of recurrent conditions of the polluted atmosphere makes it possible with various reliability degrees to detect the possible occurrence of negative effects of atmospheric pollution on human health 6–12 hours beforehand Copyright (c) 2020 Boris Pospelov, Vladimir Andronov, Evgeniy Rybka, Olekcii Krainiukov, Nadiya Maksymenko, Ruslan Meleshchenko, Yuliia Bezuhla, Inna Hrachova, Roman Nesterenko, Alla Shumilova",Not About Sufficiency
How can anyone be more than one thing? Dialogues on more-than-humanity in the smart city,"In this chapter, we ruminate the consequences of trying to reposition our ways of encountering our multispecies neighbours. We see such encounters as generative, forming the potential for new kinds of solidarity, both human and non-human. In particular, we argue that some of the ways to see, sense, or understand our neighbours produce significant tensions, which are important for three reasons: 1) They foreground the political qualities of 'partial perspectives'; 2) They reveal asymmetries in the capacity to use technology to recognise others; and 3) They suggest parallels between the challenges of sensing non-human 'others' and the challenges of recognising difference within human relations. In an era of climate change, ecological instability, and fragmented human relationships, we reflect here on the kinds of connections that we might model through our encounters with animal 'others' in the smart city and consider how to shift relationships of knowledge and practice towards liberation. © Oxford University Press 2024.

"Soil Microbiome: Characteristics, Impact of Climate Change and Resilience","Soil contains a variety of biotic and abiotic substances and serves as a medium for plant growth as well as a habitat for microorganisms, all of which help maintain and contribute to ecosystem services, because they are involved in organic matter breakdown, nutrient cycles and soil health. Microorganisms in the soil are clearly an important part of both natural and managed ecosystems. Despite the difficulties of surviving in soil, a gram of soil may include hundreds of different microbial taxa, including viruses and organisms from all three domains of life. As soil environmental factors are so different, soil microbial populations are extremely diverse. There are many different microbial habitats in a single soil, each with its own microbial composition. The spatial variability of soil microbial community structure is generally greater than the temporal variability. Soil and site characteristics, such as soil pH, temperature and organic carbon availability, may frequently predict the composition of soil bacterial communities and the abundances of individual species. Recent advancements in marker gene, genomic and metagenomic studies have substantially increased our capacity to characterize the soil microbiome and uncover the factors that change soil microbial populations with time. © The Editor(s) (ifapplicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.2022.",Not About Sufficiency
POSTGROWTH HUMANITIES. THE LIMITS OF CULTURAL CRITIQUE IN ITS ENCOUNTER WITH PLANETARY LIMITS,"What are the limits of cultural critique in its encounter with planetary limits? The recognition of planetary limits entails a vibrant transformation of the humanities with the rapid emergence of the environmental humanities and the energy humanities. This transformation is forcing cultural studies to adjust their theoretical radars signifi-cantly. Yet, some humanities scholars resist or ignore this transformation and still teach and research as if we were not living on a dying planet. If petromodernity and cultural theory emerged together, cultural theory may be nothing but petrocultural theory, in which case peak oil would coincide with peak theory. This essay comments on these transformations and suggests the importance for the humanities to come to terms with planetary limits by becoming what could be named postgrowth humanities. This entails not only to take planetary limits seriously, but for the humanities to intentionally become a key player in the task of envisioning, designing, and transitioning to a regenerative, fair, and post-growth cultural paradigm. © 2025, Universidad de Granada.

Improved soil environment under conservation agriculture,"The natural resources are continuously depleting because of the intensive agricultural operation, the insufficient return of organic matter (OM) to the soil, and continuous monocropping system. Along with OM depletion, erosion and soil salinization are aggravating the problems of resource depletion several times. For achieving food security and alleviation of hunger and poverty, there is a need of a sustainable agricultural production technology, which will be able to conserve the natural resources and will be capable of reducing the harmful effect on the environment. Under these circumstances, conservation agriculture (CA) has come to be a promising production technology which consists of minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover maintenance by means of cover crops and/or crop residues, and crop diversification for attaining higher crop productivity and subsequently decreasing the adverse environmental effects. It is also referred to as resource efficient or resource effective agriculture. The ultimate aim of CA is to achieve satisfactory returns and greater plus persistent crop production and, at the same time, to conserve the environment. The prime goal of CA is to reduce the adverse impact of traditional agriculture and burning or removal of crop residue. Right now, CA is followed on approximately 157 million ha arable land worldwide. CA can effectively conserve and use the natural resources as it involves integrated management of soil, available water, and biological resources along with the judicial use of external inputs. In CA, good agronomic practices like timely farm operations, quality seeds use, and integrated weed, nutrient, pest, as well as water management are followed. The yield under CA system is at par with the conventional system. Residue retained on the surface of soil helps in improving soil quality, plant health, and overall resource use efficiencies. CA practices can improve the water and nutrient use efficiencies by enhancing nutrient balances and availability, infiltration, and water retention in soils; by reducing evaporation losses; and by enhancing the surface and subsurface water quality and availability. As the pragmatism of CA in various parts of the globe is governed by the biophysical and socioeconomic challenges, an adaptation of CA should be as per the site and farmer's condition. As CA requires better understanding and knowledge, convincing the farmers through proof is the most important task in motivating the farmers for adopting CA. In this chapter, an attempt has been made to describe how CA can modify and improve the soil physical environment. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",Not About Sufficiency
A review of the wetland’s restoration mechanisms and its economic and social benefits,"Our Earth has given many ecosystems that will heal themselves from the degradations. One of those ecosystems is the wetland, which is a precious natural sponge, naturally purifying and replenishing the water, heading off floods, and mainly giving tremendous biodiversity to the flora and fauna. However, human activities are degrading the wetlands and polluting them indiscriminately with solid wastes and domestic and industrial wastewater discharge. With the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, nations around the world have acknowledged the critical benefits of wetland restoration and development. In this review article, we contributed to address the general wetland policies in the world, both nationally (India) and regionally (Tamil Nadu). In this paper, we will be discussing the reviews on the characteristics of wetland ecosystems, indices of biodiversity, risks to the wetland’s restoration tactics, its main obstacle, and the financial advantages of wetlands. After clearly analyzing 226 previous research and review articles, a clear coherence between the explored hypothesis of wetland restoration mechanisms and the resulting economic and social benefits was arrived. Our findings indicate that effective restoration not only enhances ecosystem services but also leads to significant economic gains and improved community well-being. This alignment underscores the importance of investing in wetland restoration for sustainable development. © 2024, IWA Publishing. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Spatial, temporal and taxonomic variation in coral growth-implications for the structure and function of coral reef ecosystems","Growth is a fundamental biological trait, generally considered to have an important role in structuring populations and communities. Accordingly, many studies have quantied growth rates of scleractinian corals, but using a variety of different methods and measures that may or may not be comparable. The purpose of this review is to compile extensive data on the growth of corals, to relate disparate methods of measuring coral growth, and to explore spatial, temporal, and taxonomic variation in growth rates. The most common metric of coral growth is linear extension, measured as unidirectional change in branch length or colony radius. Rates of linear extension vary greatly among corals, being highest among arborescent Acropora species. This is not unexpected given the limited carbonate investment in producing long, slender branches compared to solid hemispherical colonies. However, differences in the way that extension rates are actually measured (e.g., linear extension of individual branches vs. changes in the mean solid radius of massive corals) could potentially bias interspecic comparisons of coral growth. The most comparable measure of growth, which gives unbiased estimates of growth across different growth forms, is average annual calcication or change in weight normalized to a measure of size. Surprisingly, even calcication rates appear to be much higher for branching Acropora compared to other coral genera, which contributes to the high extension rates recorded for this genus. Despite inconsistencies and incompatibilities among studies of coral growth, there is clear evidence that coral growth rates vary spatially and temporally, largely in response to light and water quality (e.g., turbidity), temperature, and aragonite saturation state. Ongoing changes in environmental conditions (e.g., due to climate change) are expected to have generally negative consequences for the growth of scleractinian corals, which may be further exacerbated by shifts in assemblage structure towards relatively slowgrowing species. © 2015 by R.N.

"Real-time, single-particle volatility, size, and chemical composition measurements of aged urban aerosols","Aerosol particles undergo significant amounts of atmospheric processing within the Los Angeles basin. To assess the major sources and degree of aging, ambient particle volatility, size, and chemical composition were measured concurrently in real-time during the Study of Organic Aerosols conducted in Riverside, CA in November 2005. A thermodenuder (TD) was coupled toanaerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer(ATOFMS) to characterize the chemistry of the individual submicrometer particles remaining after heating. Aged organic carbon (OC) particles contained>50%by volume secondary species, primarily ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, and amines. At 230 °C, the chemistry of the 100-150 nm residues were elemental carbon (29% by number), OC (27%), and biomass burning (15%). Sea salt (47%) and dust (15%) were the major contributors at the larger sizes (750-800 nm). Many particles at 230 °C possessed signatures similar to those of fresh vehicle emissions, biomass burning, sea salt, and dust particles, showing that the TD-ATOFMS method can be used to apportion particles in highly aged environments to their original sources, while providing insight into the relative contributions of primary and secondary species. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
A comprehensive review on the recycling technology of silicon based photovoltaic solar panels: Challenges and future outlook,"With the aim of realizing the goals of the Paris Agreement, annual solar power generation on a global scale using silicon PV panels had exceeded 1000 TWh by the end of 2021. Mass installation of silicon-based photovoltaic (PV) panels exhibited a socioenvironmental threat to the biosphere, i.e., the electronic waste (e-waste) from PV panels that is projected to reach 78 million tonnes by the year 2050. Recycling PV panels through e-waste management is crucial step in minimizing the environmental impact of end-of-life PV systems such as the release of heavy metals into the environment. An increasing amount of academic research on recycling approaches to PV panels that suggests different technology and policy challenges remain. The present review critically evaluates a range of recycling solutions, encompassing both lab-scale and pilot-scale research, and conducts analyses of their cost and environmental implications. A detailed discussion of the recycling policies adopted by governments worldwide to handle e-waste has also been provided. In this review article, the complete recycling process is systematically summarized into two main sections: disassembly and delamination treatment for silicon-based PV panels, involving physical, thermal, and chemical treatment, and the retrieval of valuable metals (silicon, silver, copper, tin, etc.). Furthermore, technical, and non-technical challenges and prospects are identified to guide future exploration and innovation. In the pursuit of sustainable recycling of solar PV panels, technology convenience, cost-effectiveness, and social desirability should come together to develop innovative recycling technologies with a high recovery rate of valuable metals. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Planetary health: A new approach to healing the Anthropocene,"The Anthropocene is a proposed geological epoch reflecting the large-scale impact of human activity on the Earth's natural systems. This era is also characterized by other significant threats to ecologic well-being that are less evident in the sedimentary records. Extensive environmental changes with industrialization and urbanization have also contributed to declining biodiversity and microbial dysbiosis in essential ecosystems—the original and foundational lifeforms that continue to sustain virtually all ecosystems today, including our own. These changes, along with numerous other social and ecologic disruptions at all scales are implicated in the rising rates of physical and mental ill-health, particularly the immune dysregulation and noncommunicable diseases that characterize the Anthropocene. This narrative review considers how urgent structural changes in how we live are essential to the future of human health and the flourishing of all life on Earth. It explores planetary health as a solutions-oriented, transdisciplinary field and social movement aimed at addressing these interconnected global challenges through integrated ecologic approaches. Planetary health considers not only the vital biophysical “planetary boundaries” required to support human flourishing, but also the upstream social, political, and economic ecosystems that support (or undermine) well-being at all scales. The value systems and the worldviews that have contributed to our global challenges are a central consideration in the planetary health agenda—emphasizing the imperative to address structural inequalities, injustices, and the social, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of unrealized human potential. Promoting these inner assets is essential to human flourishing and fostering the cultural capacities necessary to ensure sustainable planetary health. © 2024 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",Not About Sufficiency

Integrated pest management for sustainable intensification of agriculture in Asia and Africa,"Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a leading complement and alternative to synthetic pesticides and a form of sustainable intensification with particular importance for tropical smallholders. Global pesticide use has grown over the past 20 years to 3.5 billion kg/year, amounting to a global market worth $45 billion. The external costs of pesticides are $4-$19 (€3-15) per kg of active ingredient applied, suggesting that IPM approaches that result in lower pesticide use will benefit, not only farmers, but also wider environments and human health. Evidence for IPM’s impacts on pesticide use and yields remains patchy. We contribute an evaluation using data from 85 IPM projects from 24 countries of Asia and Africa implemented over the past twenty years. Analysing outcomes on productivity and reliance on pesticides, we find a mean yield increase across projects and crops of 40.9% (SD 72.3), combined with a decline in pesticide use to 30.7% (SD 34.9) compared with baseline. A total of 35 of 115 (30%) crop combinations resulted in a transition to zero pesticide use. We assess successes in four types of IPM projects, and find that at least 50% of pesticide use is not needed in most agroecosystems. Nonetheless, policy support for IPM is relatively rare, counter-interventions from pesticide industry common, and the IPM challenge never done as pests, diseases and weeds evolve and move. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
The World Bank's environmental strategies: Assessing the influence of a biased use of New Institutional Economics on legal issues,"The World Bank considers itself as “a leader in piloting payments for ecosystem services”. This article explores how the World Bank gradually integrated environmental and legal issues within its strategic framework with a particular focus on its economic theoretical influences. In the early 1990s, the New Institutional Economics became the main influence concerning the analysis of institutional arrangements and legal issues. We distinguish between different branches within the NIE. One remained very close to the mainstream or orthodox economics and tended to focus on private property rights as the central legal issue. We demonstrate that this branch fitted with both the market-friendly policies supported by the WB, and with the theoretical and statistical tools used by the WB's economists. It induced a very specific analysis of legal and institutional issues. It also involved a kind of theoretical path dependency, which influenced a market-oriented analysis of ecosystem services and impoverished the institutional and legal debates concerning the WB's environmental strategy. We suggest that the other branch of the NIE, as developed by the Bloomington School, offered another framework to tackle environmental issues regarding the diversity of institutional and legal arrangements. We conclude on the ambiguous use of economic theory for addressing environmental and legal issues. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
The Case of an Agricultural Crop Business Association in Navarra as Circular Economy Intermediary,"The circular economy (CE) is an alternative economic system based on closing energy and material cycles to achieve sustainable development and create value based on innovation. In this sense, business associations (BAs) can work as intermediaries to promote CE in industrial sectors. They bring together many companies, generate trust-based relationships, support companies’ strategy and collaborative innovation to construct closed-loop material flows, and increase competitiveness in sectors and regions. This study aims to show the BA’s role as intermediaries of CE and promoters of industrial symbiosis (IS) as a value creation strategy among its affiliated companies (AC). Thus, this work takes the form of an exploratory case study of five different companies of the Union of Agricultural Cooperatives of Navarra (UCAN) in Spain. Researchers collected this study’s data through a focus group and surveys. As a result, an original serious game was developed in 2016 and a survey in 2016 and 2020, which considers the CE’s six fields of action (take, make, manufacture, distribution, use, recovery, and IS). Finally, this study proposes a methodology to promote the CE through the BAs, based on the performance of the UCAN as an intermediary of the CE and IS. Likewise, BAs’ potential to promote the closure of energy and materials cycles in regions and commercial sectors such as agribusiness is demonstrated. The study also demonstrated the organizations’ evolution and the improved perception of economic benefits and reduced barriers to implementing CE. This long-term analysis is valuable in novel topics such as CE. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency

Threats without enemies: Facing environmental insecurity,"In this book, eminent experts describe the new threats and the scale of the dangers which they present and set out the political, military and institutional changes needed. Gwyn Prins is Director of the Global Security Programme at the University of Cambridge. He is author of Top guns and Toxic Whales, also published by Earthscan. Progress For A Small Planet Three topics dominate discussions of the global environment: pollution; the consequences of the affluent running ever faster through finite resources; and the growing tensions between rich and poor as a third of humanity continues to live and die in desperate poverty. In this exceptional book Barbara Ward (co-author with Rene Dubos of the bestselling Only One Earth) refused to see these processes as inevitable. It describes new technologies for recycling waste, for energy, for 'getting more for less', linking them to ordinary people's working lives. It also suggests a strategy for meeting the basic needs of the disadvantaged, and shows how the vast inequalities between countries can be reduced. This perceptive survey of policies outlines a planetary bargain between the world's nations that would guarantee individual freedom from poverty and keep our shared biosphere in good working order. Originally published in 1993.; The world is moving into a new era which will be dominated by a new range of threats and a new range of priorities. Already headlines tell of storms and droughts, mass emigrations, the danger of old Soviet nuclear reactors and the thinning ozone layer, and with the menaces of global warming, deforestation, pollution and loss of biodiversity, the picture is likely to get bleaker. Unlike traditional threats, these are not made deliberately and standard military responses are usually inappropriate They are threats without enemies and they present quite new and fundamental challenges to the international community which has to find new methods and institutions, as well as the resolve, to tackle them. © in this collection, Gwyn Prins, 1993.

Leading from the Niche: Insights from a strategic dialogue of renewable energy cooperatives in the Netherlands,"Renewable energy cooperatives envision and manifest an alternative way of organising within the energy system (and beyond). Yet, despite their growth, it is uncertain whether such initiatives are able to increase and deepen their impact, leading the transition to an environmentally sustainable and socially just energy system. This paper presents insights from a strategic dialogue co-organised with the Dutch national interest group of renewable energy cooperatives ""ODE Decentraal"". We used transition management as action research methodology to organise the dialogue to understand and support the transformative potential of the cooperative energy movement. The dialogue helped to clarify the challenges and possibilities for scaling energy cooperatives beyond the niche, supporting at the same time the participants to reflect, strategize and develop a shared transition agenda. This contribution presents and analyses our intervention and its impact, also specifically evaluating the potential of transition management to facilitate social learning processes, reflexivity and the development of strategic actions. Our intervention confirmed the hypothesis that actors in the niche often focus too much on the competition with the regime for individual goals, thereby failing to collectively strategize and engage with incumbent regimes in a systematic way. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Beyond food: A stochastic model to estimate the contributions of urban agriculture to sustainability,"In the first decades of the 21st century, urban agriculture has gained attention for its role in enhancing food security, particularly in developing nations. Additionally, it is commonly assumed that urban agriculture also has positive implications for other aspects of urban sustainability, such as mitigating runoff and creating job opportunities. However, the extent of these contributions has not been extensively quantified. This study aims to address this gap by presenting a stochastic model that quantifies the contributions of urban agriculture to urban sustainability, using Sant Feliu de Llobregat, a Mediterranean city, as a case study. We assessed eight indicators, including accessibility to green areas, food self-reliance, green surface area per capita, job creation, NO2 sequestration, runoff mitigation, urban heat island effect, and volunteer participation. These indicators were estimated across twelve different simulated scenarios using 1000 Monte Carlo simulations for each scenario, to account for uncertainties. The findings revealed that the contributions of urban agriculture are not straightforward, as they are influenced by factors such as garden typology and location. Although urban agriculture typically originates as a grassroots movement, it often receives administrative support. Therefore, strategic planning can be employed to maximize the contributions of urban agriculture to urban sustainability and minimize trade-offs between social and environmental benefits. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Do natural resources bestow or curse the environmental sustainability in Cambodia? Nexus between clean energy, urbanization, and financial deepening, natural resources, and environmental sustainability","The management and utilization of natural resources can either promote or hinder environmental sustainability. While they can provide the basis for renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and conservation efforts, their extraction and use can also lead to environmental degradation, pollution, and depletion. This study examines the intricate relationship between natural resource rent (NRR) and environmental sustainability in Cambodia. Specifically, the study investigates the impacts of financial openness, institutional quality, financial deepening, and urbanization on this relationship. Employing both symmetric and asymmetric frameworks, the research assesses the explanatory power of these variables on environmental sustainability. Study implemented novel cointegration test offered by Bayer-Hancked and Makki, the long-run and short-run coefficients has derived through the implementation of augmented autoregressive Distributed Lagged (AARDE) and Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (NARDL). The study reveals the long-term association between NRR and environmental indicators, additionally the findings uncover both positive and negative correlations between NRR and environmental sustainability, emphasizing the challenge of managing natural resources effectively. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential adverse environmental effects of financial expansion, suggesting that increased investment in certain industries and higher consumption patterns may exacerbate environmental degradation. It also underscores the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) in promoting renewable energy technologies and sustainable practices, ultimately reducing CO2 emissions. Additionally, the study stresses the importance of institutional quality and transparent financial systems in encouraging sustainable practices and mitigating carbon emissions. It advocates for Cambodia to prioritize institutional strength and financial openness to achieve long-term environmental sustainability, while addressing the challenges posed by financial deepening and urbanization. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Regional variations in energy efficiency: Modifying China's industrial approaches to meet sustainability goals,"China has devoted much attention to the “carbon peaking” and “carbon neutrality” objectives, the related research focuses on renewable energy, carbon removal, electrification, and hydrogen technologies. Yet, energy efficiency, especially in resource-based and older industrial cities continue to be a research gap in this regard. This study fills this research gap by assessing the role of China's national Industrial Transformation and Upgrade Demonstration Zones (ITUDZ) in energy conservation from 2010 to 2021. In this paper, applying the time-varying Difference-in-Differences (DID) method, we confirm that ITUDZ effectively decreases the energy utilization of these cities. These tests are reliable based on the results obtained above. Mechanism assessments show that the ITUDZ does so through enhancing green innovation and adjusting industrial patterns and that marketization enhances the energy-saving impacts. Geographical heteroscedasticity tests also show that the effects are significant for multi-urban areas and eastern China but weaker for central-western and single-urban city areas. Therefore, this study serves to add to the existing knowledge regarding place-based industrial policies and their contribution towards the realization of China's sustainable development agenda. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Contradiction or harmony? Spatial and temporal relationships between new urbanization and rural revitalization in the Yellow River Basin from a coupling perspective,"Integrating urban and rural areas is the only way to achieve sustainable regional development. To comprehensively build an evaluation index system for new urbanization and rural revitalization (NU-RR), taking the Yellow River Basin (YRB) as research object, and the coupled coordination degree (CCD) model, relative development degree (RDD) model and gravity model are used to quantitatively measure the spatial and temporal patterns, synchronous development status and spatial linkages of the coupled coordination of NU-RR from 2005 to 2020. The factors influencing the CCD are identified with the help of the geographic detector model. The findings indicate that: (1) From 2005 to 2020, the combined indexes of NU-RR in the YRB show an increasing trend, while rural revitalization is growing slower than new urbanization. (2) The CCD of NU-RR in the YRB shows spatial structure characterized by “high in the east and low in the west” and undergoes an evolutionary process of “low coupling-medium coupling-high coupling”. (3) The spatial disparities in the state of coupled and coordinated development of different cities are significant, mainly showing the spatial distribution characteristics dominated by the lagging new urbanization. (4) The spatial connection of CCD is networked and polarized, and the interprovincial barrier effect is weakened. (5) Total retail sales of consumer goods per capita and local general public budget expenditure as a share of GDP are the primary influencing elements affecting the CCD of NU-RR in the YRB. The interaction is manifested as bivariate enhance and nonlinear enhancement. The study’s findings can guide decisions to promote high-quality urban-rural integration development in the YRB. © 2023 Qiao et al.

Collaborative management of environmental pollution and carbon emissions drives local green growth: An analysis based on spatial effects,"Collaborative management of environmental pollution and carbon emissions (CMPC) has been a major policy instrument to promote Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in recent years. However, the relationship between the benefits and drawbacks of this environmental management practice for green growth in and around a local area remains to be clarified. Using 30 provinces in China during 2001–2019 as the object of analysis, we assessed the efficiency of local CMPC practices using the nonradial directional distance function (NDDF) model, predicted local green growth using the frontier green complexity index (GCI), and empirically examined the spatial effects, locational heterogeneity, and threshold characteristics of the relationship using the spatial Durbin model and the panel threshold model. Our study finds that although efficient CMPC does drive local green growth, the promotion effect is nonlinear with decreasing marginal effect. This effect is particularly obvious in economically developed regions with higher CMPCs, which will absorb resources from neighboring regions and create a “siphoning” effect. It was found that local financial support and foreign direct investment (FDI) can radiate green growth to neighboring regions; therefore, CMPC practice needs to pay more attention to the effect of joint governance, supplemented by financial and foreign investment policy tools, to better promote the green transformation of local economy. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Reassessing the non-linear causal link between long-duration commuting and self-rated health: do behavioral preferences and built environment matter?,"Introduction: Long-duration commuting is widely recognized for its significant influence on health. However, while research has traditionally focused on direct impacts, there remains a critical need to explore the nonlinear dynamics of this relationship. This study aims to deepen our understanding of how behavioral preferences and built environments contribute to these complex interactions. Methods: This study was conducted in Jinan, China’s most congested city, using data from the “Jinan Residents Commuting Survey” of 1,755 participants aged 19 to 59. We applied Generalized Propensity Score Matching (GPSM) to explore the nonlinear effects of commuting time on self-rated health, adjusting for participants’ sociodemographic characteristics. Variables related to active commuting, physical activity, and perceived built environment were also examined for their potential moderating effects. Results: Commuting for less than 21 minutes enhances health, but negative effects intensify and peak at 60 minutes. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that women and older adults, especially those with higher incomes, are more susceptible to long commutes, experiencing a delayed onset of adverse effects. While active commuting offers health benefits, it may exacerbate health issues if prolonged. Conversely, regular physical activity consistently improves health outcomes related to commuting. Additionally, factors like residential greenery and walkability help alleviate commuting-related stress, improving the overall commuting-health dynamic. Discussion: This study clarifies the commuting-health relationship by identifying key time thresholds and the positive effects of active commuting and physical activity on mitigating longer commute impacts. The findings inform healthier commuting behaviors and offer practical guidelines for urban planning and policy-making to enhance commuter well-being.

Management of various socio-economic factors under the United Nations sustainable development agenda,"The objective of the study is to assess the United Nation's healthcare sustainable development agenda by controlling the number of socio-economic and environmental factors, including carbon emissions, particulate emission damages, natural resource depletion, communicable diseases, and per capita income in a panel of 40 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The study covered a time period of 2000–2016 for robust inferences. The pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator is used to controlled possible heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. The results confirmed the inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita income and natural resource depletion, while the U-shaped relationship is found between communicable disease and per capita income. The long-run results confirmed that communicable diseases and particulate emission damages both negatively linked with the country's per capita income, while there is a direct association between per capita income and carbon emissions across countries. The results further reveal that particulate emission damages and high mass carbon emissions largely associated with the communicable diseases that need sustainable healthcare policies to delimit carbon-particulate emissions growth in a panel of SSA countries. The undeniable health losses and low adaptability of environmental sustainability reforms lag behind the SSA countries from the assigned target of United Nation's sustainable development goals, which need national and international collaborations to designed better healthcare policies to prevent from infectious diseases that lead towards sustained global healthcare infrastructure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Energy efficiency and environmental regulations for mitigating carbon emissions in Chinese Provinces,"Taking into account the contributions of economic performance (GDP), urbanization (URB), industrial structure (IND), and renewable energy consumption (REC), this paper examines the impact of green technology innovation (GTE), energy efficiency (EF), and environmental regulation (ER) on CO2 emissions in Chinese provinces from 2010 to 2020. Using the GMM method for the initial estimation, the MMQR as 2nd generation test for robustness and innovative panel causality presented by the JKS test, we have found: 1) a one percent boom in GDP is linked with a 0.08% upward push in CO2 emissions throughout 30 provinces in China. 2) the renewable energy and energy efficiency data seems to effectively decrease CO2 emissions, with a more pronounced impact observed at the upper quantile. 3) The environmental policy is limited across all quantiles.

"Overview of aquaculture Artificial Intelligence (AAI) applications: enhance sustainability and productivity, reduce labor costs, and increase the quality of aquatic products","The current work investigates the prospective applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the aquaculture industry. AI depends on collecting, validating, and analyzing data from several aspects using sensor readings, and feeding data sheets. AI is an essential tool that can monitor fish behavior and increase the resilience and quality of seafood products. Furthermore, AI algorithms can early detect potential pathogen infections and disease outbreaks, allowing aquaculture stakeholders to take timely preventive measures and subsequently make the proper decision in an appropriate time. AI algorithms can predict ecological conditions that should help aquaculture farmers adopt strategies and plans to avoid negative impacts on the fish farms and create an easy and safe environment for fish production. In addition, using AI aids to analyze and collect data regarding nutritional requirements, nutrient availability, and price could help the farmers to adjust and modify their diets to optimize feed formulations. Thus, using AI could help farmers to reduce labor costs, monitor aquatic animal’s growth, health, optimize feed formulation and reduce waste output and early detection of disease outbreaks. Overall, this review highlights the importance of using AI to achieve aquaculture sustainability and boost the net profits of farmers. © 2024 Sciendo. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Influence of Tillage and Organic Amendments on Terrace Soil Bio-physico-Chemical Properties and Carbon Sequestration Index,"Two sets of experiments were conducted in Bangladesh for 10 successive growing seasons of transplanted aman and boro rice during 2010–2015 to assess the effects of tillage and organic amendments on properties and carbon sequestration index (CSI) of terrace soil. The experiment 1 comprised of two tillage practices (minimum and traditional) and three rice straw management (zero, incorporation, and mulch). The experiment 2 consisted of five treatments viz. control, poultry manure (PM), cowdung (CD), rice straw (RS), and soil test-based fertilizers. A fixed carbon (C) rate of 2 t ha−1 was ensured from organic amendments in each crop season. Data were collected after harvesting of the 10th crop in 2015. Traditional tillage and RS mulch were found immensely positive for microbial population and biomass C and nitrogen (N) in soils. Minimum tillage tied with RS incorporation was appeared positive in holding C and nutrients and increasing CSI. Poultry manure contributed to higher quantities of bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes and attributed to maximum biomass C and N compared to other organic treatments. Organic amendments increased soil aggregate stability, nutrients, and moisture contents. The CSI of RS (0.21–0.29), PM (0.25), and CD (0.22) can be used to predict soil C sequestration. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency

Energy-economy-environment nexus in China: The role of renewable energies toward carbon neutrality,"Global climate change triggered by the escalating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from heightened economic expansion and consumption of energy represents the foremost environmental concern in the contemporary global context. China is accountable for nearly 27% of total global CO2 emissions, making it the largest emitter worldwide. This study explores the consequences of economic outgrowth, fossil fuel, and renewable energy utilization on China's emissions of CO2. The study utilized an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to analyze China's annual data from 1965 to 2022. The ARDL bounds test results indicate the presence of long-term cointegration among the variables. The empirical results specify that a 1% growth in the utilization of fossil fuels and the economy leads to long-term growth of 4.97% and 0.58% in CO2 emissions. In the short term, these increases amount to 2.42% and 1.21%, respectively. Conversely, a long-term enhancement of 1% in renewable energy utilization could result in a reduction of CO2 emissions by 1.39%, whereas in the short term, the reduction would be 0.50%. This study proposes policy suggestions for the attainment of sustainable development and carbon neutrality. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Investigating the impact of oxygen concentration on fire dynamics using numerical simulation with FDS,"The world is experiencing an increase in demand for medical facilities due to the worsening of environmental and political conditions leading to emergencies that could suddenly increase the patients count in hospitals. The extensive use and storage of oxygen in hospitals and violation of the fire safety management practices lead to the occurrence and worsening of fire accidents. Though many researchers documented the influence of O2 enrichment on fire dynamics, there are only limited studies present. This article attempts to investigate the effects of varying oxygen concentrations - 21% (v/v), 22% (v/v), and 23% (v/v) - on fire dynamics in a hospital environment using Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS). The changes in Mass Loss Rate (MLR), Heat Release Rate (HRR), temperature profile, flash over occurrence and thermal intensity were reported and compared with varying oxygen concentration. The results show a significant increase in MLR and HRR with the increase in O2 concentration, which directly contributed to the earlier occurrence of flashover. For oxygen concentrations of 21% (v/v), 22% (v/v), and 23% (v/v), the highest temperatures achieved were 1395 °C, 1421 °C, and 1494 °C and the thermal intensity values were found to be 966 kW.m-2, 1027 kW.m-2, and 1074 kW.m-2, respectively. The variation in peak temperature and thermal intensity at 21% (v/v) and 23% (v/v) O2 concentration, is found to be 7.1% and 11%, respectively. The findings provide a valuable insight that the oxygen concentration in a fire can impact the fire dynamics. This study can aid in the development of effective fire safety management systems for hospital environments. In addition, the process industries have a key role to play in supporting hospitals to adopt proper approaches, drawing on lessons learned from managing flammable and explosive atmospheres in chemical processes. These simulation results will give better understanding to adopt relevant safety codes for the hospitals. © 2023 The Institution of Chemical Engineers",Not About Sufficiency
Policy forum: Improving the acceptability of REDD+ projects among local households in Indonesia,"Improving acceptability of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) projects among local households requires adaptive policy approach based on the implementation experience of such projects. This paper analyses the current state of REDD+ implementation in Indonesia based on a synthesis of policy documents, published studies and our field research. A key finding of this analysis is that enhancing the acceptability of REDD+ is contingent on the appropriation of its benefits and costs to affected households, which further depends on forest management regime – private, community, and government. In implementing REDD+ projects, efficiency can be achieved by targeting selected groups as REDD+ participants, adapting transparent implementation mechanism, and sharing factual information among local communities to mitigate REDD+ scepticism. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
How Policy Entrepreneurs Encourage or Hinder Urban Growth Within a Political Market,"This paper updates and extends the Political Market Framework (PMF) by integrating elements of interest groups and political market theory with policy entrepreneurs’ (PEs) roles in explaining the patterns of urban infrastructure construction. The prominent role of PEs is observed through a grounded analysis of two large infrastructure projects in Mexico City. A comparative study of the cases suggests that: (1) The agency of PEs in political markets is central to explaining the construction of urban infrastructure; (2) PEs contribute to the definition of pro-growth or anti-growth coalitions and the definition of public problems; (3) the legitimacy of PEs is grounded in their political or technical reputation, or both; (4) the appropriate use of political institutions requires that PEs know how to use electoral timing strategically; and (5) the role of PEs seems to be better understood within a bounded analysis framework, such as the political markets approach. © The Author(s) 2022.",Not About Sufficiency

The Contribution of Industry 4.0 Technologies to the Circular Economy,"Faced with the changes that happen all the time in the industry and the growing need for consumption, it is necessary to think of approaches that meet these demands without harming the environment. Within this context, the main objective of this study is to explore how digital technologies can be used in the waste reduction, reuse, and recycling of end-of-life products and what contributions they bring to the context of the development of theCircularEconomy. For the development of the article, we chose to use the systematic literature review method, as it is a method of easy replication and high reliability. Thus, 27 articles were analyzed to meet the research objective. With the analysis of the articles, it was possible to identify the main technologies adopted within the practices of the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle) of the CE and how these technologies are used to leverage the CE. Integrating digital technologies with CE makes it possible to develop more sustainable production, ensuring greater efficiency in the consumption of resources and reducing the entry of new raw materials due to greater reliability and intelligence in the reuse and recycling processes. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Global Goals and African Development,"The United NationsUnited Nations (UN) Sustainable DevelopmentDevelopment Goals (SDGs), occupying a centre stage in the post-2015 developmentDevelopment paradigms, raise important questions about how African developmentDevelopment priorities and needs are situated within broader global agendas, and the impacts these agendas have on the well-being of people living on the continent. The aim of this chapter is to contribute to discussions and debates on the intersection between the SDGs and African developmentDevelopment in the twenty-first century. African developmentDevelopment has been a subject of scholarly debates and policy interventions by state and non-state actors for many years. Our intention in this chapter is to discuss African developmentDevelopment in the context of the SDGs and through five themes relevant to this volume. The first theme tackles the question whether the SDGs compete with or compliment other developmentDevelopment agendas on the continent. The second theme places the SDGs within the political economyEconomy of AfricaAfrica’s natural resourcesNatural resources to argue that AfricaAfrica’s resources remain crucial for the global capitalist economyEconomy, and that this limits the promise of transforming the continent through the SDGs.

Spatial spillover effects of capital factor agglomeration on the urban industrial structure upgrading in China: Based on panel data of 284 prefecture-level cities,"The spatial agglomeration of capital factors has become an important force affecting regional economic development and industrial structure. Investigating the spatial relationship of capital factor agglomeration is a key way to accelerate the upgrading of urban industrial structure and realize sustainable development. Based on the panel data of 284 cities in China from 2008 to 2017, we use the theoretical framework of spatial econometrics and estimate the spatial effects of capital factor agglomeration on the upgrading of urban industrial structure. Both the global Moran index and the local Moran scatter chart present that the agglomeration of capital factors and the upgrading index of urban industrial structure shows the characteristics of spatial agglomeration. The results reveal that the agglomeration of capital factors can significantly promote the upgrading of the industrial structure of local and surrounding cities. Still, the spatial spillover effect is not significant. We then explore the possible factors that limit the spatial spillover effects of capital agglomeration. Using the results of the paper, we provide policy suggestions for strengthening urban industrial construction and optimizing the urban governance model. Copyright: © 2021 Ran, Zhao.

Transforming farm agro waste into valuable resources: A guide to sustainable agriculture and economic growth,"Farm agro-waste to wealth refers to converting agricultural waste into valuable products. This approach has become increasingly popular due to its potential economic, environmental, and social benefits. Here are some examples of how farm agro-waste can be converted to wealth. Biogas production: Agricultural waste such as animal manure, crop residues, and food waste can be used to produce biogas through anaerobic digestion. Biogas can be used as a renewable source of energy for cooking, heating, and electricity generation. Composting: Organic waste such as crop residues, animal manure, and food waste can be converted into compost through a natural decomposition process. Compost can be used as a soil amendment to improve soil health and fertility and also as a substitute for chemical fertilizers. Biochar production: Agricultural waste such as crop residues, wood chips, and sawdust can be converted into biochar through a process of pyrolysis. Biochar can be used as a soil amendment to improve soil health, increase crop yields, and sequester carbon. Biomass energy: Agricultural waste such as crop residues, wood chips, and sawdust can be used as feedstock for biomass energy production. Biomass energy can be used to generate electricity, heat, and transportation fuels. The utilization of agricultural waste to generate economic value can generate job prospects, diminish greenhouse gas emissions, and positively impact sustainable farming practices. Moreover, it can help address the issue of waste management and reduce the environmental impact of agricultural activities. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

Towards environmental sustainability: further evidences from decarbonization projects in Kenya’s Blue Economy,"Kenya is committed to the global efforts on climate change mitigation and adaptation as seen through investments in various sustainable green and blue economy projects. In this review paper, we present the current status of what has been done, particularly on the blue carbon offset initiatives undertaken in the mangrove and seaweed ecosystems as well as the decarbonization activities at the port of Mombasa and which should form reference information for local, regional, bilateral/multilateral partners, scientists and other climate change stakeholders. The blue carbon offset projects involve mangrove conservation, reforestation and carbon credit sale as well as seaweed farming. The initiatives have several unique features amongst which are the community-led income generation systems that simultaneously act as an inducement for ecosystem preservation, co-management and benefits sharing which are recipes for economic, socio-cultural, and environmental sustainability. A notable project impact is the conferment of economic power to the locals, particularly the women and the youth The model used embraces a collaborative approach involving multisectoral engagements of both the government, multilateral organizations, NGOs, and local communities. This integrated top-down (government) and bottom-up (local community) method deliberately targets the strengthening of economic development while ensuring sustainability.

Decarbonisation strategies in industry: going beyond clusters,"An effective and just industrial transition is necessary both to mitigate climate change and protect jobs, and as a precursor to enable other sectors to decarbonise. Activity is at an early stage and examples of successful sector-wide interventions to decarbonise industry do not yet exist. Governments of industrialised countries are beginning to develop policy and provide funding to support deployment of carbon capture and low-carbon hydrogen infrastructures into high-emitting industrial clusters, but options for sites outside of clusters, denoted here as ‘dispersed sites’, are also required. This paper takes a mixed methods approach to provide the first analysis of the issues facing dispersed industrial sites on their route to decarbonisation and to suggest solutions to the challenges they face. Using the UK as a case study, it first characterises dispersed sites in terms of location, emissions released, sectors involved, and size of companies affected. It then shows how these features mean that simply expanding the geographical scope of the present UK decarbonisation strategy, which focuses on the provision of carbon capture and low-carbon hydrogen, would face a number of challenges and so will need to be broadened to include a wider range of abatement options and other considerations to meet the needs of dispersed sites. While the solutions for each place will be different, these are likely to include some combination of the expansion of shared infrastructure, the development of local zero-carbon hubs, research into a wider range of novel abatement technologies and facilitating local participation in energy planning. The paper concludes with a discussion of remaining knowledge gaps before outlining how its findings might apply to industrial decarbonisation strategies in other countries. © 2023, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Prospects for sustainability of pig production in relation to climate change and novel feed resources,"Pig production systems provide multiple benefits to humans. However, the global increase in meat consumption has profound consequences for our earth. This perspective describes two alternative scenarios for improving the sustainability of future pig production systems. The first scenario is a high input–high output system based on sustainable intensification, maximizing animal protein production efficiency on a limited land surface at the same time as minimizing environmental impacts. The second scenario is a reduced input–reduced output system based on selecting animals that are more robust to climate change and are better adapted to transform low quality feed (local feeds, feedstuff co-products, food waste) into meat. However, in contrast to the first scenario, the latter scenario results in reduced predicted yields, reduced production efficiency and possibly increased costs to the consumer. National evaluation of the availability of local feed and feedstuff co-product alternatives, determination of limits to feed sourced from international markets, available land for crop and livestock production, desired production levels, and a willingness to politically enforce policies through subsidies and/or penalties are some of the considerations to combine these two scenarios. Given future novel sustainable alternatives to livestock animal protein, it may become reasonable to move towards an added general premium price on ‘protein from livestock animals’ to the benefit of promoting higher incomes to farmers at the same time as covering the extra costs of, politically enforced, welfare of livestock animals in sustainable production systems. © 2020 The Authors.

FinTech solutions for sustainable agricultural value chains: A perspective from smallholder farmers,"Smallholder farmers in developing nations face multifaceted challenges as they strive to secure fair prices for their agricultural products. With a primary focus on bolstering sustainable agricultural value chains (SAVC), this conceptual paper investigates the transformative potential of Financial Technology (FinTech) solutions. The study synthesizes insights from prior research on SAVC, hurdles faced by smallholder farmers, conventional strategies, and the untapped prospects offered by FinTech solutions in the agricultural sector. Utilizing the PRISMA strategy for comprehensive documentation retrieval, the study underscores the significance of creating a robust SAVC to empower smallholder farmers within the broader value chain landscape. It is found that Agri-FinTech solutions represent a pivotal avenue for advancing living standards and cultivating agricultural sustainability in developing nations. The integration of FinTech solutions for agri-credit mechanisms and product market facilitation catalyzes enabling pre-production financing and ensures fair prices for smallholder farmers in the post-production phase while neutralizing the value chain's exploitation potential. The study advocates for the expeditious adoption of information technology in developing countries, spotlighting the transformative role of Mobile Financial Services (MFS), which fortifies the agriculture sector, ensuring its resilience and responsiveness to the evolving demands of a globalized market. Drawing upon an evaluation of existing literature on FinTech-enhanced agricultural initiatives in developing nations, the study outlines directions for future research and creates a path for a more nuanced understanding of the strategic enhancements necessary to fortify the SAVC, fostering a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for smallholder farmers. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Cooperation without trust: Overcoming collective action barriers to endangered species protection,"Mutual trust among individuals is frequently cited as an important factor in encouraging collective action, particularly in environmental policy settings. Yet the precise role of trust in the collective action process remains uncertain. This article explores the hypothesis that trust is overrated as a cause of cooperation. It initially tests this hypothesis through two case studies of voluntary collective action in a new context: the creation of multiactor Habitat Conservation Plans to protect endangered species. The two cases suggest that institutional mechanisms and political leadership can play an important role in encouraging collective action without relying on trust among cooperators. Besides their theoretical implications, the results suggest policymakers might spend more energy on creating incentives and assurance mechanisms to encourage collaboration, rather than the potentially fruitless task of building of social capital among rival stakeholders. © 2006 The Policy Studies Journal.",Not About Sufficiency
Comparison of limestone calcined clay cement and ordinary Portland cement for stabilization/solidification of Pb-Zn smelter residue,"Decreasing carbon emissions by replacing Portland cement (PC) with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), such as low-grade limestone (LS) and calcined clays (CC), has tremendous potential for stabilization/solidification (S/S) of industrial hazardous waste primarily with heavy metals. Recently, a low-carbon-based cementitious binder, namely, limestone calcined clay cement (LC), has emerged as an alternative for S/S treatment of wastes. However, comprehensive comparison between LC and PC application in solidifying/stabilizing wastes has not been conducted. This study aims to investigate the S/S efficiency of Pb-Zn smelter residue (LZSR) comprising heavy metals lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd) at higher concentrations. LZSR is treated with LC and PC for capturing strength and leaching toxicity. The test results indicate that low-grade CC and LS in the LC binder can promote the alkaline environment, and act as fillers in solidifying heavy metals. The toxicity characteristic leaching procedure leaching concentrations of untreated (UT) LZSR were 503 mg/kg, 1266 mg/kg, and 251 mg/kg for Pb, Zn, and Cd, respectively. After a 28-day curing, the leaching concentrations in LC-treated LZSR reduced to 4.33 mg/kg, 189.68 mg/kg, and 0.46 mg/kg, while the leaching concentrations of PC-treated LZSR reduced to 29 mg/kg, 338 mg/kg, and 6 mg/kg for Pb, Zn, and Cd, respectively. The maximum immobilization efficiencies for Pb, Zn, and Cd reached 85%, 99%, and 99%, respectively. Moreover, the insoluble phases for Pb, Zn, and Cd obtained from the sequential extraction test results were 63.5%, 72.1%, and 42.4% for LC-treated LZSR and 35.7%, 38%, and 43% for PC-treated LZSR with binder content of 8% binder and curing time of 28 days. Increasing curing time and binder content reduced leaching concentrations, and the underneath mechanisms were interpreted by XRD, SEM-EDS, and FTIR analyses. Overall, the results indicate that Pb, Zn, and Cd can be successfully immobilized using 8% LC binder by transforming soluble heavy metals to insoluble hydroxides and their complexes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency

Loss and fragmentation of habitat for pastoral people and wildlife in east Africa: Concepts and issues,"Little of the current focus on landscape fragmentation has focused on rangelands or pastoral lands. This paper investigates the existing evidence for causes and processes of fragmentation in pastoral lands and its effects of landscapes and peoples. More conceptual work is needed on the definition of loss and fragmentation, particularly efforts to clarify fragmentation from whose (or what's) perspective. Fragmentation and loss are caused by a suite of underlying demographic, economic, institutional, technological and policy, biological and climatic factors in east Africa, with property rights as a particularly important cause. These underlying causes often originate far from rangelands and drive more local causes like expansion of cropland and settlements and construction of fences and water points. Pastoral systems first fragment in wetter rangelands or in the key resource areas (wetlands, riverine areas) in drier rangelands. Ecological effects of fragmentation range widely across animal and plant populations, nutrient cycling and soils, with strong effects on animals with large body sizes. We have little understanding of the economic consequences of fragmentation and have a strong need to focus future research on valuing ecological services that affect human well-being, to gain a better picture of the complementarities and trade-offs land managers face during the process of fragmentation.",Not About Sufficiency
No small hope: Towards the universal provision of basic goods,"This book argues in favor of an approach to global policy priorities that emphasizes the attempt to put a minimal set of basic goods and services into the hands of everyone. This universal provision of basic goods and services includes nutritious food, clean water, sanitation, health services, education services, housing, electricity, and human security services. The book argues that this policy focus is appropriate both for practical and ethical reasons, but that success in this provision will not be easy and therefore is no small hope. Basic goods and services meet central and objective human needs. The basic goods approach tries to form a bridge between the standard growth perspective on development and the capabilities/human development perspective. What really matters about growth is the possibility that growth will lead to an increase in the broad-based provision of basic goods and services, an outcome that is not always guaranteed. The hoped-for expansion of human capabilities and development is predicated on this expanded provision of basic goods, and the expanded provision of basic goods and services also can promote growth. In these ways, basic goods and services are critical link between growth and human development. The book explores each of the identified basic goods and services, the basic rights to them, and the many challenges to be overcome in their expanded provision. © Oxford University Press 2018.

How Do Consumers Living in European Capital Cities Perceive Foods with Sustainability Certificates?,"Certification aims at ensuring food quality and safety, as well as confirming other beneficial credence attributes, such as local origin and sustainability. In order to explore the visibility and credibility of such certification labels functioning in the European Union, a study was conducted among residents of two EU Member States, Poland and Belgium. Face-to-face questionnaire-based interviews and focus group interviews were conducted among 701 adults living in Warsaw and Brussels—the capital cities of these countries. Almost 44% of Belgian respondents and 33% of Polish respondents considered certified foods as being of better quality compared to unlabeled products. Focus group interviews demonstrated that Belgian consumers had more extensive knowledge and a higher level of trust in certified foods compared to Warsaw inhabitants. Our findings suggest that certificates are moderately important factors of food choice due to the wide variety of certificates, leading to consumer confusion, a lack of label uniformity, greenwashing, limited visibility and availability at points of sale, consumer price sensitivity and the prioritization of other factors. These constraints can be alleviated by introducing food labeling standards and regulations. Increasing consumer awareness and the availability and affordability of certified foods can also boost the demand for sustainable products in the region. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

"Supply chain performance, information and communication technology capital formation, and green growth in top carbon emitter economies","The emergence of green growth has proved vital for achieving sustainable development goals, and a supply chain can expedite the nation's journey toward green growth. This analysis aims to investigate the impact of supply chain performance and information and communication technology on green growth in top polluted economies by controlling the impact of education, financial development, renewable energy consumption, and foreign direct investment. For empirical analysis, we have employed the ordinary least squares, two-stage least squares, and generalized methods of moments. The main findings of the study confirm that logistics performance, infrastructure, and services are vital in promoting green growth. The diffusion of information and communication technology, education, the use of renewable energy, and financial development all help to achieve green growth. We suggest that firms should invest in green manufacturing practices, intelligent distribution networks, and better and energy-efficient logistics infrastructure, which can help the economies keep the environmental impact of economic growth at bay. Thus, our results emphasize the priorities of supply chain performance and information and communication technology diffusion in top carbon emitter economies. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring multifunctional agriculture. A review of conceptual approaches and prospects for an integrative transitional framework,"In the last decade the multifunctional agriculture (MFA) concept has emerged as a key notion in scientific and policy debates on the future of agriculture and rural development. Broadly speaking, MFA refers to the fact that agricultural activity beyond its role of producing food and fibre may also have several other functions such as renewable natural resources management, landscape and biodiversity conservation and contribution to the socio-economic viability of rural areas. The use of the concept can be traced to a number of wider societal and political transformation processes, which have influenced scientific and policy approaches in different ways amongst countries and disciplines. This paper critically discusses various existing research approaches to MFA, both from natural and social sciences. To this aim different strands of literature are classified according to their focus on specific governance mechanisms and levels of analysis into four main categories of research approaches (market regulation, land-use approaches, actor-oriented and public regulation approaches). For each category an overview of the state-of-the-art of research is given and an assessment is made of its strengths and weaknesses. The review demonstrates that the multifunctionality concept has attracted a wealth of scientific contributions, which have considerably improved our understanding of key aspects of MFA. At the same time approaches in the four categories have remained fragmented and each has limitations to understand MFA in all its complexity due to inherent constraints of applied conceptualizations and associated disciplinary backgrounds. To go beyond these limitations, we contend, new meta-level frameworks of analysis are to be developed that enable a more integrated approach. The paper concludes by presenting the main lines of an integrative, transitional framework for the study of MFA, which analyses multifunctional agriculture against the background of wider societal change processes towards sustainability and identifies a number of key elements and research challenges for this. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Knowledge management-related training strategies in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia construction industry: an empirical study,"The growing popularity of knowledge management (KM) in the construction industry has, unfortunately, not been matched by parallel empirical research in training and benefits of KM for construction industry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). This article discusses the KM-related training strategies implemented in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia construction industry. Given the relatively new and unexplored nature of the research problem, qualitative research method was adopted to collect and analyse data. Results are based on the analysis of data from 46 professionals from KSA construction organizations. This article concludes that training interventions are a complex and context-embedded activity. The current study results suggests that for effective implementation of KM strategies, there is an urgent need for KSA construction industry to develop and deploy appropriate KM-related management training programmes. Leadership plays an important role in breaking down barriers in achieving KM strategies. The practical implication of this research is that the KM should not only focus on the specific knowledge to be captured, shared, mapped and transferred between individuals but should also address strategic concerns at group and organizational levels. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
An Economic Analysis of Liability and Compensation for Harm from Large-Scale Field Research in Solar Climate Engineering,"Solar climate engineering is under increasing consideration as a potential means to reduce climate change risks. Its field research may generate knowledge to reduce climate risks to humans and the environment and will, at a large-enough scale, pose its own risks, some of which will be of the transboundary kind. Liability or compensation for harm is frequently referenced as a possible component of international regulation of solar climate engineering but has been insufficiently developed. This article offers an economic analysis of the possible interrelated roles of rules, liability, and compensation in the future international regulation of large-scale field research in solar climate engineering. Notably, the benefits, risks, and incentives of climate-engineering research are unlike typical high-risk activities. The analysis proposes a hypothetical international agreement that links general and procedural rules for research, an international compensation fund, and limited, indirect state liability with a duty-of-care defence. © 2015 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",Not About Sufficiency
An earth system governance perspective on solar geoengineering,"Solar geoengineering appears capable of reducing climate change and the associated risks. In part because it would be global in effect, the governance of solar geoengineering is a central concern. The Earth System Governance (ESG) Project includes many researchers who, to varying degrees, utilize a common vocabulary and research framework. Despite the clear mutual relevance of solar geoengineering and ESG, few ESG researchers have considered the topic in substantial depth. To stimulate its sustained uptake as a subject within the ESG research program, we identify significant contributions thus far by ESG scholars on the subject of solar geoengineering governance and survey the wider solar geoengineering governance literature from the perspective of the new ESG research framework. Based on this analysis, we also suggest specific potential lines of inquiry that we believe are ripe for research by ESG scholars: nonstate actors’ roles, polycentricity, public engagement and participation, and the Anthropocene. © 2020 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: BETWEEN MEANING AND MEANINGLESS,"As a rich expression of meanings and uses, the work reveals the meanings of Corporate Social Responsibility. The text presents, under the ballast of bibliographic review and the logical-inductive method, the historical sequence of meaning of the term and culminates in the exposition of conceptual model of management that combines economic and social aspects, with respect for human rights, and that has the environment as an imperative of responsibility. It exposes the eventual emergence in the step of a binding international document, in order to avoid a gravitating reputational label that can be coined as blue, green or other washings. The first result of the research is that companies today do not fulfill their social function merely by generating profits, and that, as a second result, it is necessary that corporate management derives its social license to create wealth and pursue economic policies and practices that promote the sustainable development of society. In conclusion, it should be noted that the concepts attributed to Corporate Social Responsibility are incomplete duo to variation in the meaning of the expression over time and that its parameters are still only ethical, since they lack other, legal, parameters that companies must comply with. © 2023 Editora Dom Helder.

Unveiling the Soil beyond Definitions: A Holistic Framework for Sub-Regional Soil Quality Assessment and Spatial Planning,"The issue of land/soil consumption and degradation has been extensively explored in international literature, yet a universally accepted definition of soil quality remains elusive. Over the decades, the scientific community has witnessed the evolution of the concept of land/soil quality, with varying nuances across different disciplines. The absence of a shared definition poses challenges in addressing local concerns and preserving the distinctiveness and well-being of the soil. The present paper seeks to fill this gap from the spatial planning perspective by proposing a soil quality detection framework tailored for the sub-regional spatial context, offering support in particular for local planning decisions. The concept of soil quality is approached comprehensively, and the indicators put forth are selected based on specific soil functions, services, or threats. To support this all-encompassing approach through a case study in the Italian context, this paper suggests integrating 11 datasets and 55 indicators. This extensive dataset aims to quantify and generate meaningful cartographic representations, offering a multifaceted and detailed understanding of soil quality within the sub-regional context. The goal is to establish a framework that facilitates a more holistic understanding of soil quality, aiding in effective spatial planning and policy-making processes. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Substitutability of natural and human capitals: lessons from a simple exploratory model,"Most ecosystem services (ES) are co-produced, to varying degrees, by interactions between people and ecosystems. Although ES research has tended to emphasize the role of ecosystems, or natural capital, in ES provision, the need for a deeper understanding of the role of human-derived capitals, like technology, labour, and management, is increasingly being recognized. Understanding the capacity for, and limitations of, human-derived capitals to enhance or substitute for natural capital is important for environmental decision-making, especially for decisions about when to promote conservation of natural capital to provide ecosystem services and when to employ technological alternatives. From the perspective of long-term sustainable ecosystem management, such decisions are further complicated by dynamics and interactions between different types of capital. We created a simple simulation model to compare how different assumptions around the temporal dynamics and interactions between natural and human-derived capitals affect long-term outcomes of different management choices on ES provision. We found that the extent to which different capitals are substitutable in the long-term depends on how individual capitals change over time and how different capitals interact with each other, and that replicating the near-term function of natural capital does not necessarily mean human-derived capitals are a viable long-term substitute. With an understanding of the dynamics and interactions of natural and human-derived capitals, it is possible to determine general long-term ES management strategies that are more likely to produce the desired benefits. © 2023 The Author(s).

Particle toxicology and health - Where are we?,"Background: Particles and fibres affect human health as a function of their properties such as chemical composition, size and shape but also depending on complex interactions in an organism that occur at various levels between particle uptake and target organ responses. While particulate pollution is one of the leading contributors to the global burden of disease, particles are also increasingly used for medical purposes. Over the past decades we have gained considerable experience in how particle properties and particle-bio interactions are linked to human health. This insight is useful for improved risk management in the case of unwanted health effects but also for developing novel medical therapies. The concepts that help us better understand particles' and fibres' risks include the fate of particles in the body; exposure, dosimetry and dose-metrics and the 5 Bs: bioavailability, biopersistence, bioprocessing, biomodification and bioclearance of (nano)particles. This includes the role of the biomolecule corona, immunity and systemic responses, non-specific effects in the lungs and other body parts, particle effects and the developing body, and the link from the natural environment to human health. The importance of these different concepts for the human health risk depends not only on the properties of the particles and fibres, but is also strongly influenced by production, use and disposal scenarios. Conclusions: Lessons learned from the past can prove helpful for the future of the field, notably for understanding novel particles and fibres and for defining appropriate risk management and governance approaches. © 2019 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

A conceptual methodology to screen and adopt circular business models in small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs): A case study on child safety seats as a product service system,"While small and medium enterprises are already aware of the increasing benefits of resource efficiency, reducing waste, and closing material loops, the adoption of circular economy principles in small and medium enterprises is still nascent. Despite a large body of academic literature providing numerous definitions and business models to elucidate circular economy, these approaches lack systemic research from a small and medium enterprise's perspective and are often vague and overwhelming. Furthermore, small and medium enterprises lack financial and organizational resources to implement a (systemic) change to their already optimized business models. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by presenting a conceptual approach that not only serves as a decision-making tool and a possible starting point towards circular value creation, but also provides an initial estimation on how well forms of circularity can be achieved within the adapted business models. The developed methodology was applied to a complex product within the plastics sector. Starting with the product-disassembly-workshop, an in-depth analysis to identify various circular concepts was then conducted, using design thinking tools. The results are presented and summarized in the form of a decision tree analysis. Using a contradiction matrix and environment mapping tool, it was then attempted to narrow down the circular solution spectrum to a manageable level. To conclude, a cross impact balance analysis was applied to validate the identified business model scenarios. The presented methodology aims to show small and medium enterprises how to generate business model innovations systematically, narrow down the solution space in a structured manner, and how to evaluate the resultant solution options against each other and weigh their trade-offs. The tools and techniques used were chosen in such a way that they can be applied with as few resources and complexity as possible, and therefore can serve as a guidance for small and medium enterprises in their transition towards circular value creation. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
Efficient Operation of Metropolitan Corridors: Pivotal Role of Lane Management Strategies,"Lane management strategies are vital for solving traffic congestion and improving transportation efficiency in metropolitan corridors. These corridors, which facilitate economic and social interactions by connecting major urban areas, face significant challenges such as congestion, environmental concerns, and the need for sustainable growth. Effective lane management involves techniques such as HOV lanes, HOT lanes, reversible lanes, and dynamic toll pricing, which have been implemented worldwide. This study addresses the questions ‘What are the benefits and limitations of lane management strategies in metropolitan corridors?’ and ‘When should decision-makers consider implementing lane management strategies in a metropolitan corridor?’ This paper aims to evaluate lane management strategies to increase the multimodal efficiency of metropolitan corridors. A systematic literature review of case studies reveals that while these strategies significantly reduce congestion and emissions, they also face road safety, compliance, and public resistance issues. In addition, gaps in existing research on metropolitan corridors and lane management will be identified, and areas for future research are proposed. The impacts of new societal trends and evolving urban planning concepts are examined. The study highlights the need for adaptive planning and innovative solutions. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Potential high-quality growing tea regions in Ecuador: an alternative cash crop for Ecuadorian small landholders,"BACKGROUND: Agriculture is the main means of subsistence for most of the population in developing countries. Crops that can increase their value with in situ processing have a big impact on the small landholder's economics. Moreover, crops such as coffee and cocoa beans have been very important for Ecuadorian farmers. In this study, we wanted to analyze if the climatic conditions exist for growing high-quality tea in Ecuador and determine the areas that will be less affected by global climate change in the future. RESULTS: We used a GIS (geographic information systems) based analysis, together with ecological niche modeling to determine areas in Ecuador where Ceylon and Nilgiris tea varieties could be grown, which will maintain similar ecological conditions in the future, and have a high agricultural aptitude. In total, there are more than 150 000 ha in Ecuador that could be converted to high-quality tea plantations, most of them in the coastal provinces, with some specific areas in the Andean foothills. CONCLUSION: Ecuador has a significant amount of land with the potential to grow high-quality tea, with no significant ecological niche modifications due to climate change in the long-term future. Tea is a viable and potentially highly profitable crop for small landholders and should be considered by local stakeholders. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",Not About Sufficiency
Freshwater governance on limboto lake in Gorontalo province of Indonesia,"This study investigates the nature of governance system around Limboto Lake and its impact on the conservation of the freshwater resources. It also seeks to understand the structural process and contribution of local knowledge in freshwater conservation, which is a gap identified in freshwater governance. Data was based on residents’ impact and institutions involved in collation, formulation and implementation of freshwater policy. Based on the findings there is a unanimous indication that, locals are not part of freshwater governance at Limboto Lake and this finding has nothing to do with their educational background. This renders the system of governance as a top-bottom approach. Indications are that this system does not support the conservation of the Lake considering the apathy in adhering to rules and regulation by the locals. The locals believe that their contributions and participation would help strengthen capacities of knowledge and practices in freshwater governance to reduce degradation. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Applying the STIRPAT model in a post-Fordist landscape: Can a traditional econometric model work at the local level?,"Recent empirical investigations have illustrated the stochastic validity of the IPAT model. The preponderance of these studies shows that theoretical relationships of IPAT hold at large units of analysis. This research applies the stochastic transformation of the IPAT-STIRPAT-model in the southeastern US. Using county-level data, this research illustrates that population is a unit-elastic determinant of total carbon emissions. At the same time, various metrics of affluence present statistically mixed results for wealth as a determinant of environmental degradation. Other "" sunbelt"" technology variables designed to capture the effects of economic restructuring are significant, suggesting that post-Fordist geographies complicate the nature of the relationships in the identity model. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Absence of Gigasporales and rarity of spores in a hot desert revealed by a multimethod approach,"Hot deserts impose extreme conditions on plants growing in arid soils. Deserts are expanding due to climate change, thereby increasing the vulnerability of ecosystems and the need to preserve them. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) improve plant fitness by enhancing plant water/nutrient uptake and stress tolerance. However, few studies have focused on AMF diversity and community composition in deserts, and the soil and land use parameters affecting them. This study aimed to comprehensively describe AMF ecological features in a 5,000 km2 arid hyperalkaline region in AlUla, Saudi Arabia. We used a multimethod approach to analyse over 1,000 soil and 300 plant root samples of various species encompassing agricultural, old agricultural, urban and natural ecosystems. Our method involved metabarcoding using 18S and ITS2 markers, histological techniques for direct AMF colonization observation and soil spore extraction and observation. Our findings revealed a predominance of AMF taxa assigned to Glomeraceae, regardless of the local conditions, and an almost complete absence of Gigasporales taxa. Land use had little effect on the AMF richness, diversity and community composition, while soil texture, pH and substantial unexplained stochastic variance drove these compositions in AlUla soils. Mycorrhization was frequently observed in the studied plant species, even in usually non-mycorrhizal plant taxa (e.g. Amaranthaceae, Urticaceae). Date palms and Citrus trees, representing two major crops in the region, however, displayed a very low mycorrhizal frequency and intensity. AlUla soils had a very low concentration of spores, which were mostly small. This study generated new insight on AMF and specific behavioral features of these fungi in arid environments. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Transforming students’ environmental attitudes in schools through external communities,"Given the current environmental crisis, an innovative training project has recently been implemented in schools to teach sustainable development among young students. The aim is to transform students’ attitudes by learning from communities committed to achieving sustainable development. Small organic producers, consumers, farmers, organic companies, environmental NGOs and several environmental policymakers were appointed to interact with students both in schools and in visits to farms and companies over three years (from 2016 to 2018). Seven criteria were developed among 389 young students, namely, waste management, transport, energy, climate change, biodiversity, water and citizenship. Students were asked about their willingness to transform their environmental attitudes to protect nature through experiential learning. The hypotheses were validated through SmartPLS path modelling, and the results have shown the efficiency of this method when raising environmental awareness in young students. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Double energy vulnerability: Spatial intersections of domestic and transport energy poverty in England,"Double energy vulnerability (DEV) is the increased likelihood of negative impacts upon well-being, owing to the intersection of domestic energy poverty (DEP) and transport energy poverty (TEP). Whilst considerable research has focused on the geography of DEP, similar issues of transport-related energy costs have received less attention, reflecting entrenched disciplinary and sectoral boundaries. This is despite transport accounting for a high proportion of household energy consumption and expenditure amongst specific vulnerable populations and locales. Meanwhile, owing to the prevalence of fossil fuels in domestic and transport energy, both are affected by changes in fuel prices. Subsequently, selected households face high expenditure on both domestic and transport energy. Focusing on a case study of England, this paper analyses the geographical distribution of DEP and TEP, and the extent to which the two intersect. Two neighbourhood-scale analyses shed light on the geographies of DEV, using three existing DEP and TEP indicators. Firstly, we identify significant clusters of neighbourhoods with a high or low propensity to DEV using a Local Moran's I statistic. Secondly, we identify neighbourhoods in the highest and lowest quantiles for multiple DEP and TEP indicators. Our results illustrate that as many as 6% of neighbourhoods (accounting for 3 million residents) have a high propensity towards DEV depending on the indicators selected, typically concentrating in isolated, rural neighbourhoods. We discuss our findings in light of the role that lack of access to networked energy and transport infrastructures plays in aggravating energy poverty in both domains. The findings support a cross-sectoral policy approach to tackle the issue of DEV. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Sustainable development through service learning and community engagement in higher education: a systematic literature review,"Purpose: This study aims to delve into the evolution, trends and implications of scientific production related to service learning (SL) and community engagement for sustainability in higher education institutions (HEIs). Because HEIs play a crucial role in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs), experiential learning approaches are needed to actively involve students in sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 869 publications from Web of Science and Scopus databases were analysed using a bibliometric approach that included performance analysis and science mapping. Subsequently, a systematic literature review was conducted on 118 publications, focusing on their contribution to SDGs and alignment with United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation’s fields of expertise. Findings: The findings reveal two significant trends: a substantial shift from curriculum development (2000–2010) to education for sustainable development (2011–2022), and the effectiveness of experiential learning teaching approaches, such as the integration of SL with community engagement and the use of innovative research methods in promoting the acquisition of sustainable development competencies. Additionally, community-based research, participatory action research and capacity development emerged as the primary topics. Research limitations/implications: While this research is based on publications from two prominent databases, it may not include significant studies published in other databases. Practical implications: These findings suggest that stakeholders should incorporate experiential learning activities and innovative research approaches to enhance education in, for and from sustainability. Originality/value: This study offers a fresh perspective on the intellectual framework of experiential learning teaching approaches concerning sustainability in HEIs. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Nature Driven Planning for the FEW-Nexus in Western Sydney,"Current urbanisation is leading to an extraordinary depletion of resources, degraded landscapes, severe health implications for urban residents and pollution of air, water and soil. This way of urban development is driven by landownership and maximisation of profits for only a small group in society. The majority of the people have to bear the consequences. In this chapter an alternative approach is presented and applied to the case of Western Sydney. The alternative way of planning for urban development uses the FEW-Nexus as the entrance point for urbanism in five subsequent steps, form analysis to local design. It starts with understanding the size and working of urban flows of food, energy and water, and their waste implications in Sydney and Australia. This knowledge is then used to redesign the FEW-systems in an interconnected way for the local context of Western Sydney. Once the coherent systemic relationships are conceptualised the major challenges for design are translated into five holistic design principles for the Purifying City, the Hyperlocalised City, The Indigenous City, The ReciproCity and the Inclusive City. These coherent future city models are then used to build hypothetical scenarios for the Western Sydney Parklands. These explorations are finally designed at a detailed level for specific locations within the site at multiple scales. The approach illustrates benefits of the alternative way of developing the city by creating attractive and healthy urban environments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of rank-ordered feature perceptions of energy sources on the choice of the most acceptable power plant for a neighborhood: An investigation using a South Korean nationwide sample,"The present study incorporates a competitive context into an individual's response to the construction of a power plant in his/her neighborhood and the determinants of this response. The study adopts an individual's rank-ordered feature perceptions of competing energy sources to reflect the individual's comparative perceptions of the sources regarding the features, and it investigates the effects of these perceptions on his/her choice of the most acceptable power plant in the area where he/she lives. Our mixed conditional logit analysis of nationwide survey data from South Korea demonstrated the following: among the rank-ordered feature perceptions, the perceptions regarding safety and eco-friendliness significantly predict an individual's choice of the most acceptable power plant for his/her neighborhood, while those regarding affordability, contribution to economic development, and job creation do not. In addition, among those significant features, safety was found to be a stricter criterion than eco-friendliness. The selective significance of the feature perceptions and the differentiated criteria between the significant features provide practical implications for professionals in energy industries, as well as theoretical implications for researchers. © 2019 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Carbon performance, carbon disclosure, and economic performance: the mediating role of carbon (media) legitimacy in the UK","There has been a continuous and controversial debate about the relationship between carbon performance, carbon disclosure, and economic performance. This study investigates whether corporate economic performance is influenced by carbon performance and disclosure and whether carbon (media) legitimacy mediates such relationships. This study provides a broader understanding of the relationship between carbon performance, disclosure, and economic performance by investigating the mediating role of carbon (media) legitimacy, and offers further evidence from the UK context. Based on a balanced panel data of 95 UK firms between 2009 and 2014 (amounting to 475 obser-vations in total) and using path analysis, we find that improving the company’s carbon performance is not financed by shareholders, and carbon (media) legitimacy as an intangible asset enhances the economic performance of the firm. We also find that while carbon disclosure does not directly improve economic performance, it indirectly does so via carbon (media) legitimacy. Finally, the results show while carbon performance is not reflected in carbon (media) legitimacy, carbon disclosure as a legitimizing tool strongly enhances carbon (media) legit-imacy. Overall, our results suggest that voluntary carbon disclosure, regardless of the firm’s underlying carbon performance, is an effective tool to manage corporate (media) legitimacy, and subsequently improve economic performance. Thus, voluntary carbon disclosure in the UK may hinder future improvements in a firm’s carbon performance. © Alireza Rohani et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the impact of mutations and horizontal gene transfer on the antimicrobial resistance and its control: a mathematical model,"This study presents a simple mathematical model with deterministic equations addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR), in which sensitive and resistant bacteria interact in the environment, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are functions that depend on resistant bacteria. We studied analytical conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium states and propose an optimal control problem in which avoiding mutations and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are the primary control strategies. Our results showed that bacterial population dynamics are influenced by factors such as geographical area, immune system strength, and antibiotic usage, with oscillations occurring because of antibiotic frequency and immune response. Control strategies targeting mutations and MGEs reduced bacterial populations, but did not eliminate them, indicating the need for stronger interventions to fully manage bacterial adaptability. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Matemática Aplicada e Computacional 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Make or brake — Rich states in voluntary federal emission pricing,"Voluntary participation can improve multilateral environmental governance. We model voluntary participation of states in unanimously approved federal environmental policy. A Pareto-improving federal emission price coexists with state-level emission pricing. Federal revenues are distributed equally per capita (egalitarian), in proportion to states' historical emission levels (sovereignty), or states’ actual payments (juste retour). We find that the existence of Pareto-improving uniform federal prices depends on wealth differences, transfer rules, and on whether or not states anticipate transfers. Sovereignty transfers work in all cases. Differences in wealth can undermine egalitarian transfers. Juste retour transfers render federal policy ineffective if states anticipate them. The richest state prefers the lowest Pareto-optimal federal price (“minimum price”) as it becomes the largest net-donor. Adding different population sizes, the richest and largest (smallest) state prefers the minimum price with sovereignty and juste retour transfers (egalitarian transfers). Therefore, rich states brake and simultaneously make possible passing unanimous federal policy. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Human insecurities in gold mining: A systematic review of evidence from Ghana,"Adverse mining effects, notably the uncontrolled spread and consequences of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), are growing concerns in sub-Saharan Africa. A securitization discourse is often used to justify a military-style approach toward illegal mining but fails to acknowledge the multiple dimensions of insecurities arising from mining. A human security approach allows taking a more holistic perspective but has hardly been applied to the mining sector. We address this gap by unraveling the insecurities arising from gold mining in Ghana based on a systematic literature review of empirical studies on mining impacts across multiple disciplines. Results reveal that the reviewed literature predominantly focuses on environmental and health insecurities, less on economic, food, and community insecurities, and hardly on personal and political insecurities. Recommended governance responses increasingly call for multidimensional and integrated approaches, considering that gold mining – particularly ASM – is situated in multifunctional landscapes and part of multidimensional livelihoods. We conclude that a human security approach enables a comprehensive analysis of a country's mining sector but still bears the risk of a ‘securitization trap’. We therefore advocate multistakeholder dialogue and integrated landscape approaches as the way forward to deal with the insecurities arising from a mining sector largely characterized by informality. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
Oil pollution in soils and sediments from the Northern Peruvian Amazon,"Oil has been extracted from the Northern Peruvian Amazon for over four decades. However, few scientific studies have assessed the impacts of such activities in the environment and health of indigenous communities in the region. We have investigated the occurrence of petrogenic hydrocarbon pollution in soils and sediments from areas favoured as hunting or fishing grounds by local indigenous inhabitants. The study was conducted in one of the most productive oil blocks in Peru, located in the headwaters of the Amazon river. Soils and river sediments, in the vicinity of oil extraction and processing infrastructure, contained an oil pollution signature as attested by the occurrence of hopanes and steranes. Given the lack of any other significant source of oil pollution in the region, the sources of hydrocarbons are likely to be the activities of the oil industry in the oil block, from voluntary discharges or accidental spills. Spillage of produced water was commonplace until 2009. Moreover, petrogenic compounds were absent in control samples in sites far removed from any oil infrastructure in the oil block. Our findings suggest that wildlife and indigenous populations in this region of the Amazon are exposed to the ingestion of oil polluted soils and sediments. The data obtained supports previous claims that the local spillage of oil and produced waters in the water courses in the Corrientes and Pastaza basins could have eventually reached the main water course of the Amazon. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Results showed that perceived personal experience of climate change was related to the use of traditional media (β = 0.20), social media (β = 0.16), and interpersonal sources (β = 0.13), but not institutional sources. Perceived personal experience of climate change was positively related to agreement with the new ecological paradigm (β = 0.36), awareness of consequences (β = 0.26), ascription of responsibility (β = 0.25), and personal norm (β = 0.20). Generally, perceived personal experience of climate change mediated the relationship between traditional media, social media, and interpersonal sources and each type of climate change belief. This suggests some types of information, but not all, offer vicarious experiences of an environmental phenomenon that largely escapes direct perception. In addition to those theoretical implications, this work has practical implications for audience segmentation and climate change communication. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Reduced biodiversity in modernized villages: A conflict between sustainable development goals,"Despite large conservation efforts to halt the loss of farmland biodiversity in Europe, negative population trends are still observed, especially for common species. Old villages and human settlements are biodiversity hotspots and important breeding habitats for farmland birds, but recent requirements for energy saving measures and improved living comfort have changed their architecture and habitats. Consequently, modernization of villages may negatively affect bird diversity due to the loss of nesting and foraging sites. We investigated how the abundance and diversity of birds breeding in 104 Polish villages varied in relation to the degree of modernization as estimated by the proportion of new and renovated homesteads. Abundance of building-nesting species, but not tree-nesting species, declined by 50% across a gradient of old to highly modernized villages. The contribution of new versus renovated houses to the observed decline was similar. Synthesis and applications. Rural modernization may have a dramatic effect on abundance of birds nesting on buildings, thus may be an important and overlooked contributor to farmland bird population declines in Europe. Villages and rural properties fall outside of current conservation policy as they are neither protected areas nor agricultural lands (where agri-environmental schemes can be applied). The observed conflict between sustainability goals such as increased building energy efficiency and biodiversity conservation suggests that sustainable rural development should better link modernization with conservation measures, for example, by constructing nesting sites when renovating and building new houses. The challenge is to design modern buildings that are both energy-efficient and biodiversity-friendly to generally improve quality of life for rural communities and to halt or reduce farmland bird declines in rural landscapes. Designers and architects can find inspiration from traditional architecture and add a variety of nest-box types. © 2019 British Ecological Society",Not About Sufficiency
Suitability of small-scale biogas systems based on livestock manure for the rural areas of Sumatra,"The increasing demand for farm animal products leads to higher pressure on the effective treatment of animal waste. Based on practice from other countries, biogas systems offer several significant advantages in terms of energy, environmental and economic development. Therefore, this paper investigates the potential development of small-scale biogas systems and their suitability in rural parts of northern Sumatra. A baseline field survey using semi-structured personal interviews based on questionnaires was carried out among randomly selected rural households (n = 196) in northern Sumatra in July-August 2014. The follow-up field visits to verify the results from the first stage were organised in August–September 2016. The findings show that only small individual farmers, who own 2–5 cattle heads spread on pastures, face difficulties to collect the dung. Other farmers report enough cattle manure to cover feedstock for biogas production. The calculations show sufficient animal waste feedstock supply and consequently estimated potential of energy from biogas (845 TJy−1) in the region. Nevertheless, the respondents manage animal manure only with composting (65% of respondents) and with sun-drying for fuel purposes (6%); often they leave manure fallow. The surveyed households use mostly a combination of subsidized LPG and electricity as a primary energy source for food and feed preparation, supplemented by fuelwood as the secondary source. Only half of the respondents have some knowledge about biogas technology and its benefits. The potential for small biogas systems development in the region is supported with a sufficient amount of animal manure as feedstock and suitable designs of biogas digesters on one hand; and on the other hand, impeded by challenges related to low information accessibility and investment power of rural households. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Unlocking the surge in demand for personal and protective equipment (PPE) and improvised face coverings arising from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic – Implications for efficacy, re-use and sustainable waste management","Currently, there is no effective vaccine for tackling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 with the occurrence of repeat waves of infection frequently stretching hospital resources beyond capacity. Disease countermeasures rely upon preventing person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV2 so as to protect front-line healthcare workers (HCWs). COVID-19 brings enormous challenges in terms of sustaining the supply chain for single-use-plastic personal and protective equipment (PPE). Post-COVID-19, the changes in medical practice will drive high demand for PPE. Important countermeasures for preventing COVID-19 transmission include mitigating potential high risk aerosol transmission in healthcare setting using medical PPE (such as filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs)) and the appropriate use of face coverings by the general public that carries a lower transmission risk. PPE reuse is a potential short term solution during COVID-19 pandemic where there is increased evidence for effective deployment of reprocessing methods such as vaporized hydrogen peroxide (30 to 35% VH2O2) used alone or combined with ozone, ultraviolet light at 254 nm (2000 mJ/cm2) and moist heat (60 °C at high humidity for 60 min). Barriers to PPE reuse include potentially trust and acceptance by HCWs. Efficacy of face coverings are influenced by the appropriate wearing to cover the nose and mouth, type of material used, number of layers, duration of wearing, and potentially superior use of ties over ear loops. Insertion of a nose clip into cloth coverings may help with maintaining fit. Use of 60 °C for 60 min (such as, use of domestic washing machine and spin dryer) has been advocated for face covering decontamination. Risk of virus infiltration in improvised face coverings is potentially increased by duration of wearing due to humidity, liquid diffusion and virus retention. Future sustained use of PPE will be influenced by the availability of recyclable PPE and by innovative biomedical waste management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Triple oxygen isotopic fractionation in CO2-CaCO3-H2O system during CO2-H2O exchange, carbonate precipitation, and acid digestion","The triple oxygen isotope composition of carbonate deposits provides a proxy for understanding changes in the past hydrological cycle. The reconstruction relies on knowing the temperature dependence of 17O and 18O fractionation factors, 17α and 18α, and θ = ln17α/ln18α, associated with the carbonate precipitation which can take place at various temperatures in nature. To determine these parameters, we synthesized carbonates at temperatures ranging from 10 °C to ∼50 °C from various substrate waters. The oxygen isotope composition of the waters was obtained using the CO2-H2O exchange method at 25 °C and the composition of the carbonate was derived from that of CO2 generated by reacting the carbonate with phosphoric acid at 25 °C. In both cases, the δ17O and δ18O values of the CO2 were measured. To convert the δ17O and δ18O values of the water equilibrated CO2 to the corresponding values of the water phase, a prior knowledge of the 17O and 18O fractionations during the CO2-H2O exchange is necessary. Liang et al. (2023) previously determined these fractionations by equilibrating CO2 with VSMOW2 (δ17O and δ18O = 0 ‰) at 25 °C and measuring the resulting isotope values. Building on this work, we present rescaled and refined fractionation values: 17α = 1.02135 ± 0.00001, 18α = 1.04122 ± 0.00002, and θ = 0.5230 ± 0.0001. With this knowledge, we calculated the values of θ relating the CO2 derived from acid–reacted carbonates (precipitated at different temperatures) and the parent water (θCO2(carb)-w). The θCO2(carb)-w (mean ± SE) at 10 °C, 25 °C, and 35 °C are 0.5232 ± 0.0001, 0.5233 ± 0.0003, and 0.5229 ± 0.0002, respectively. We also did these experiments at 50 °C. However, the θCO2(carb)-w (0.5129 ± 0.0004) at 50 °C was likely affected by kinetic isotope fractionation. We also determined the acid digestion fractionations at various temperatures ranging from 0 °C to 110 °C. We did not observe significant temperature dependence in Δ′17O values of the acid digested CO2 across the above temperature range, the triple oxygen isotope slope (relating δ’17O and δ’18O) is 0.5220 ± 0.0002. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Concealing protocols: conservation, Indigenous survivance, and the dilemmas of visibility","In an effort to recast themselves as proponents of human rights, transnational conservation organizations increasingly look to Indigenous communities as sources of labour, knowledge, and legitimacy. In many cases, the resulting relationships are fraught with stark power imbalances and premised on flawed understandings of Indigenous practices. As a result, even the most ‘people-centered’ conservation interventions too often serve to accelerate the enclosure, commodification, and dispossession of Indigenous lands. In this article, we reflect on our respective collaborations with Indigenous communities in Sarawak, Malaysia, and Palawan, Philippines, who have contended with biodiversity conservation projects led by transnational NGOs. We have noticed that our collaborators navigate the projects’ expectations by selectively performing, concealing, and obscuring important aspects of their lives. They do so, in part, in an effort to manage the NGOs, government agencies, and other actors vying for their cooperation. But more importantly, we argue, this is a way to defend their lands, livelihoods, and ecosystems from dispossessory pressures, including those exerted by conservation. As such, we theorize, these acts constitute a form of what Vizenor calls ‘survivance’ and raise important questions about the role of scholars and activists in rendering Indigenous lifeworlds (in)visible to conservation organizations and other institutions of neocolonial power. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Economic evaluation of recreational fishery policies,"Recreational fisheries around the world provide humans with important economic benefits because people derive well-being from participating in the act of fishing. Many of these benefits are difficult to value, however, because they are nonmarket in nature and depend on 'free' ecological services. Other sectors of society may also depend on these public goods. It is difficult to exclude people from using public goods and there is, therefore, a tendency for them to be under-produced by the private sector. Thus, there is often a need for government policy intervention to ensure the adequate production of public ecological services and resolve conflicts over their use. Policies that affect recreational fisheries have costs and benefits, both for anglers and people in other sectors of society, that must be accounted for if social well-being is to be maximised. Economics can be used to quantify the costs and benefits of various policy options available to society and make recommendations that improve overall economic efficiency. Overall well-being (welfare) consists of the sum of 'surpluses' accruing to producers and consumers. In this chapter, we outline the principles of economic cost-benefit analysis of market and nonmarket values for recreational fisheries using examples from various jurisdictions. We also consider how economic analysis can be used to account for the transaction costs of fisheries management - costs often borne by society as a whole - for different forms of governance. © 2002 by Blackwell Science Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Benchmarking on railway safety performance using Bayesian inference, decision tree and petri-net techniques based on long-term accidental data sets","Not only has the railway accidental prevention been a prime focus, but it has also become a key challenge for the industry in recent years. For many decades, rail authorities have attempted to significantly improve rail safety, whilst facing various passengers’ risks and uncertainties. The overarching goal of this study is to develop a new posterior probability model to quantify uncertainties for benchmarking. This is the world's first to establish new insights from the benchmarking of risk and safety across different rail networks. The insights will point out the advantages and practicability of launching safety policies and reducing railway accidents for other rail networks. The new model has been developed using unparalleled long-term accidental data sets, including ‘a trailer an accident’ and ‘causes of the accident’. The investigation adopts a Bayesian approach (via Python) to codify the novel model. The new findings lead to the better understanding into the uncertainty of railway accidents. Five notable rail networks have been selected as case studies. This study has also compared the effectiveness of the decision tree and Petri-net models using the posterior probability and number of injuries and fatalities. Based on the benchmarking outcomes, Chinese and Japanese railway systems denote the lowest risk over other networks, followed by Spanish, French and South Korean rail networks. The study also demonstrates that the novel benchmarking criteria can effectively measure and compare any rail networks’ risk and uncertainties. Its adoption will lead to performance improvement in terms of safety, reliability and maintenance policies of railway networks globally. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Future-proofing nature-based tourism in Canada: a horizon scan of emerging challenges,"Global climate change, biodiversity loss, health crises, and economic instability converge to form a polycrisis that challenges the sustainable planning, management, and operations of parks, protected, and conserved areas (PPCAs) for biodiversity conservation and nature-based tourism (NBT). Utilising a horizon scan methodology for the first time in the tourism field, this paper engaged experts across Canada to identify and critically examine the opportunities and risks associated with emerging challenges anticipated to affect sustainable NBT in PPCAs over the next three decades. Using a modified Delphi technique in three phases, beginning with challenge identification followed by two rounds of scoring to prioritise and rank challenges based on impact and likelihood, eight key challenge themes were identified: (1) demographic change, (2) climate change risk and adaptation, (3) low carbon transition, (4) workforce sustainability, (5) sustainable financing, (6) equitable and effective governance, (7) balancing conservation with visitation, and (8) truth and reconciliation. These insights are critical for practitioners, policymakers, and tourism stakeholders to adapt planning and management efforts, addressing interconnected challenges and stimulating research to enhance the sustainability and resilience of the NBT sector in Canada amid the polycrisis. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Transitioning without confrontation? Shared food growing niches and sustainable food transitions in Singapore,"Following a series of global food crises and an increasing dependence on food imports, the Singaporean government has begun to support local food production as a means to improve the sustainability of its food regime. This extends to the development of state-led ventures which support shared food growing in the city. In parallel, informal citizens’ groups are experimenting with collaborative forms of food provisioning. Both types of initiatives utilise Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to facilitate their practices of shared growing and seek to reorient the current food regime onto a more sustainable pathway. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted with two initiatives representative of both organisational positions, this paper critically examines the efficacy of using a transitions thinking approach to assess their actual and potential contribution to the disruption of the food regime in Singapore. The paper first reviews existing approaches to transitions thinking in order to distil insights for examining shared food growing initiatives in Singapore as niche projects. The broader socio-cultural and political context of Singapore's food system and the food growing niche projects which are emerging within it are then delineated, followed by a strategic niche management (SNM) analysis of the two initiatives. Ultimately, the paper makes two linked contributions: firstly, it diversifies the empirical foundations and the sectoral and geographical reach of sustainability transitions research. Secondly, it provides space for critical reflection on transitions thinking when applied beyond the Western liberal democratic settings from which it emerged. © 2018 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Environmental gaseous pollutants are related to increase of acute coronary syndrome in Valencia region, Spain","Introduction and aims: Environmental pollution are one of the most relevant risk factors to atherosclerosis. To know awareness about the importance of urban air pollution as a trigger for hospital admission due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS), this study analyzed levels of different gaseous air pollutants in the air and its correlation with number of ACS. Methods: Epidemiological data of patients admitted for ACS in five towns during the years 2006–2008 were recovered. Clinical data regarding admissions for ACS were obtained from the hospital admission services. Measures of seven air contaminants were recovered from the environmental stations. Mixed model including sex, age, location, and the average levels of air pollutants contaminants as fixed effects and its interaction were performed. Results: The incidence rate of ACS is higher in man than woman, and higher in older people than young. The maximum ACS were in the last trimester of the year, was the most elevated levels of gaseous pollutants have been found. Levels of NO2, NO, and CO are positively correlated between them, and negatively correlated with O3 levels. All air pollutants analyzed increase the number of ACS hospital admission in the five locations evaluated. Conclusions: Levels of gaseous pollutants are related between them, being the levels of NO2, NO, and CO, positively correlated, and negatively correlated with levels of O3. Number of ACS hospital admission increases with levels of five air gaseous pollutants studied. © 2023 Elsevier España, S.L.U.",Not About Sufficiency
"Constructing an Environmental, Social, And Governance (ESG) Index for Islamic Social Finance Institutions: Empirical Investigation from Indonesia","This study constructs an index to measure the performance of Islamic Social Finance (ISF) Institutions based on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) dimensions. This quantitative research employs the Delphi Analytical Network Process (DANP) and Multistage Weight Index (MWI). The index is constructed using DANP, conducting empirical assessments using MWI, then developing indicators using Focus group discussion (FGD), in-depth interviews, and structured surveys. This study also empirically tests index's implementation on five ISF institutions in Indonesia. The high score of the governance factor in this study indicates that the five ISF institutions are still focused on enhancing governance. This ESG index for ISF institutions create in this research may cannot be applied generally to other nations or institutions. But this ESG-building indicators still can be utilized as a reference for adopting ESG in other institutions. This study contributes to the literature by creating an ESG index for ISF institutions, where more research is needed. The notion of ESG is connected to maqashid sharia and is particularly essential in how institutions execute good governance and social issues while focusing on environmental protection. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

"Supply chain optimization: bibliometric analysis, research structure and future outlook","Purpose: Supply chain (SC) research has boomed over the past two decades. Significant contributions have been made to the field from various analytical and decision-making perspectives. This paper, a comprehensive bibliometric study, aims to identify the key research contributors, institutions and themes. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive knowledge domain visualization of over 1,000 articles, published between 2000 and 2022, is carried out to construct a bird’s eye view of the field in terms of research production, key authors, main publication outlets, geographic disparity of the contributions and emerging research trends. Additionally, collaboration patterns among researchers and institutions are mapped to highlight the communication networks underlying research initiatives. Findings: Results show an explosive growth in the number of articles tackling supply chain optimization (SCO) issues with a significant concentration of the contributions in a relatively small cluster of authors, journals, institutions and countries. Among the many important findings, our analysis indicates that mixed-integer linear programming is the most commonly used model, while robust optimization is the method of choice for handling uncertainty. Furthermore, most SC models are developed at only one level of the organizational hierarchy and consider only one planning horizon. The importance of developing integrated SCO systems is key for future research. Originality/value: The study fills the optimization techniques gap that exists in SC management bibliometric studies and presents a thematic map for the SCO research highlighting the various research foci. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Institutional challenges in putting ecosystem service knowledge in practice,"The promise that ecosystem service assessments will contribute to better decision-making is not yet proven. We analyse how knowledge on ecosystem services is actually used to inform land and water management in 22 case studies covering different social-ecological systems in European and Latin American countries. None of the case studies reported instrumental use of knowledge in a sense that ecosystem service knowledge would have served as an impartial arbiter between policy options. Yet, in most cases, there was some evidence of conceptual learning as a result of close interaction between researchers, practitioners and stakeholders. We observed several factors that constrained knowledge uptake, including competing interests and political agendas, scientific disputes, professional norms and competencies, and lack of vertical and horizontal integration. Ecosystem knowledge played a small role particularly in those planning and policy-making situations where it challenged established interests and the current distribution of benefits from ecosystems. The factors that facilitated knowledge use included application of transparent participatory methods, social capital, policy champions and clear synergies between ecosystem services and human well-being. The results are aligned with previous studies which have emphasized the importance of building local capacity, ownership and trust for the long-term success of ecosystem service research. © 2017 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Multimethod valuation of peatland ecosystem services: Combining choice experiment, multicriteria decision analysis and deliberative valuation","This paper presents a multi-method valuation study using discrete choice experiment, participatory multi-criteria decision analysis and deliberative citizens’ panels to evaluate the value of peatland ecosystem services in southern Finland. All three valuation studies addressed the same scenarios and drew on the same biophysical assessment data to facilitate a comparison of the valuation processes as well as the results. The results indicate that people place high value on regulating and cultural ecosystem services, especially on biodiversity, and less value on energy peat. The experiences sustain the argument that learning is important as people rarely have ordered set of preferences for unfamiliar objects like regulating services. They also illustrate the scope of citizen and consumer preferences and support the assumptions that preferences may change as a result of well-informed group deliberation. In terms of integration, the lesson learned is that regardless of the preference elicitation method, all valuation studies would benefit from structured and participatory approach when defining the scenarios as well as attributes and their levels. Furthermore, full integration is not possible among different valuation methods, which can be conceptualized as value articulating institutions, operating under different rationalities. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Artificial intelligence (AI)-poverty-economic growth nexus in selected BRICS-Plus countries: does the moderating role of governance matter?,"The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) aim to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 (poverty eradication) and SDG 8 (sustainable economic growth), yet the moderating role of governance in artificial intelligence (AI)-poverty-growth nexus remains underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates the AI-poverty-economic growth nexus in selected BRICS-Plus countries (2012–2023), with governance as a moderating variable, using the Cross-Sectional Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) technique. The results show a long-term equilibrium among variables, with unidirectional causality: (i) from growth to AI, and (ii) from AI to poverty and governance quality. The findings highlight AI’s transformative potential in tackling poverty and governance issues, with economic growth enabling AI advancements. This underscores the critical need to integrate AI within governance frameworks to address development challenges effectively. The short-run CS-ARDL results for the growth model indicate that AI and governance boost growth, though their interaction diminishes AI's impact. In the long-run, both sustain growth, with stricter governance moderating AI's potential. For the poverty model, AI increases poverty in the short-run, while governance reduces poverty by improving resource allocation and mitigating AI's impacts. The interaction between AI and governance highlights their role in moderating AI’s adverse effects. In the long-run, AI modestly worsens poverty, while governance alleviates poverty by promoting growth and redistributing AI-driven gains. The policy implications stress improving governance to balance AI’s economic benefits and mitigate poverty, emphasizing equitable resource allocation to harness AI’s potential for sustainable growth. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Heaven and earth: a systematic review of theories on the relationship between religion and environmental behaviour,"Background: Accelerating anthropogenic environmental degradation calls for diverse strategies to promote pro-environmental behaviors. Religion, with its potential to motivate such behaviors, has gained attention, exemplified by the rise of eco-theology. However, the theoretical frameworks connecting religion to environmental behavior remain unclear. This systematic review aims to address this gap. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review was to explore the use of theories employed in studying the relationship between religion and environmental behaviour. Methods: Four databases were systematically searched to retrieve articles linking religion to any type of environmental behaviour using a theory. Results: In forty-six articles that met the eligibility criteria, the relationship between religion and environmental behaviour was depicted using 23 theories. These theories could be categorized based on factors that drive action into six metatheories namely Psychological Need, Independent-Self, Independent-Structure, Communal Need, Top-Down, and Interdependent. Environmental behaviours measured various personal behaviours such as green and organic food consumption, use of green products, and recycling and firm-related behaviour measured mainly via corporate social responsibility. Discussion: Since multiple factors, such as situational context, culture, level of religiosity, gender, and family status, moderate the relationship between religion and environmental behaviour, applying an all-encompassing theory to study this relationship is challenging. Furthermore, inconsistencies in measuring religiosity’s aspects and religious orientation limited the ability to compare different studies. Conclusion: This review offers a metatheoretical classification of theories linking religion and environmental behavior. It provides a foundation for refining theories to enable leveraging religious values in fostering pro-environmental behavior. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of microbial-derived biotics (meta/pharma/post-biotics) on the modulation of gut microbiome and metabolome; general aspects and emerging trends,"Potential effects of metabiotics (probiotics effector molecules or signaling factors), pharmabiotics (pro-functional metabolites produced by gut microbiota (GMB)) and postbiotics (multifunctional metabolites and structural compounds of food-grade microorganisms) on GMB have been rarely reviewed. These multifunctional components have several promising capabilities for prevention, alleviation and treatment of some diseases or disorders. Correlations between these essential biotics and GMB are also very interesting and important in human health and nutrition. Furthermore, these natural bioactives are involved in modulation of the immune function, control of metabolic dysbiosis and regulation of the signaling pathways. This review discusses the potential of meta/pharma/post-biotics as new classes of pharmaceutical agents and their effective mechanisms associated with GMB-host cell to cell communications with therapeutic benefits which are important in balance and the integrity of the host microbiome.

The impact of TMT gender diversity on corporate environmental strategy in emerging economies,"Drawing on upper echelon theory, we examine how top management team (TMT) gender diversity impacts the adoption of environmental standards in emerging countries. We further examine how this impact is affected by women executives’ personal attributes as well as organizational and institutional conditions. Using panel data from 490 firms in three highly polluted emerging countries (China, India and Pakistan) and employing Probit instrumental variable regressions, we find that the proportion of women in TMTs is positively related to the likelihood of ISO 14001 certification and renewal. Additionally, we find that high institutional gender parity, women executives’ power and CSR committees strengthen this relationship. Our findings, which demonstrate a systematic translation of women's values into environmental strategy, make important contributions to literature and practice. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Community participation in assessment of fisheries related ecosystem services towards the establishment of marine protected area in the Greater Cape Three Points area in Ghana,"Effective conservation management combines information obtained from formal scientific research with traditional knowledge derived from communities living within the ecosystem, in an integrated and comprehensive ecosystem assessment. To complement national efforts to establish Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in critical coastal ecosystems to protect nursery areas and spawning grounds in Ghana, two communities in the Greater Cape Three Points area in the Western Region of Ghana were involved in a participatory mapping and assessment exercise as part of an ecosystem-based approach to the establishment of MPAs in the area. The paper presents the processes by which the communities were engaged in identifying and mapping out top five priority ecosystem services (ES) vital for fisheries—an important livelihood source in the area—valuing the prioritized ecosystem services, and identifying and assessing four main anthropogenic pressures threatening the continual provisioning of ecosystem services. The relevance of such community participatory assessment in policy formulation is also discussed in the paper. The paper demonstrates that the livelihoods of rural coastal communities are linked to broader ecosystem functioning. It also shows that when participatory mapping is complemented with perspectives from direct beneficiaries of ES, managers are afforded a holistic insight into the array of issues that feed into a comprehensive management approach which addresses social, economic and ecological concerns. © 2020 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Addressing food and nutrition insecurity in the Caribbean through domestic smallholder farming system innovation,"Smallholder farmers are key actors in addressing the food and nutrition insecurity challenges facing the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), while also minimizing the ecological footprint of food production systems. However, fostering innovation in the region’s smallholder farming systems will require more decentralized, adaptive, and heterogeneous institutional structures and approaches than presently exist. In this paper, we review the conditions that have been undermining sustainable food and nutrition security in the Caribbean, focusing on issues of history, economy, and innovation. Building on this discussion, we then argue for a different approach to agricultural development in the Small Island Developing States of the CARICOM that draws primarily on socioecological resilience and agricultural innovation systems frameworks. Research needs are subsequently identified, including the need to better understand how social capital can facilitate adaptive capacity in diverse smallholder farming contexts; how formal and informal institutions interact in domestic agriculture and food systems to affect collaboration, co-learning, and collective action; how social actors might better play bridging and linking roles that can support mutual learning, collaboration, and reciprocal knowledge flows; and the reasons underlying past innovation failures and successes to facilitate organizational learning. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Not About Sufficiency
Between green and gray: Smog risk and rationale behind vehicle switching,"Smog pollution and its health risk have severe effects on the daily lives of people in China. Most of the contribution to smog in urban areas comes from transportation, making it more severe, dense, and hazardous for health and routine work. The government of China is struggling to mitigate smog pollution by promoting green vehicles and the mode of transportation along with other policy measures. The current study attempts to investigate the intention of people to switch [or Switching Intention (SI)] from motorized vehicles to green vehicles by incorporating the Push-Pull-Mooring model from migration theory and Institutional Theory. The study integrates Smog Knowledge (SK), Smog Health Risk (SHR), and Regulative Environment (RE) as Push factors; Alternative Attractiveness (AA) and Normative Environment (NE) as Pull factors; and Self-efficacy (SE) and Switching Cost (SC) as Mooring factors. This is the first study of its kind to investigate SI for green vehicles. The model explains that Pull and Mooring effects are more effective than are Push effects, with Mooring factors moderating the relationship between some Push factors, the Pull factors, and SI. The government needs to educate people more about their vehicle use, which lead to smog pollution, simultaneously with adoption measures, which will enhance efficacy both at the social and individual level and help the government to implement their policies in a more effective way. © 2019",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the short-term in-field performance of Recovered Nitrogen from Manure (RENURE) materials to substitute synthetic nitrogen fertilisers,"Possible amendments to the European Commission's Nitrates Directive, such as the proposal of ‘RENURE’ criteria for the use of mineral nitrogen (N) bio-based fertilisers (BBFs) as a substitute to the Haber-Bosch derived chemical N fertilisers, is expected to open novel avenues for BBF use in the near future. Short and long-term testing of the RENURE materials in field trials will provide comprehensive insights into their crop response and environmental impacts. In this study, three potential RENURE materials (ammonium nitrate (AN) from stripping/scrubbing, ammonium sulphate (AS) from air scrubbing of pig stables, and pig urine (PU) from separated manure system) were tested in an NVZ to evaluate their short-term N effects. Although the trial experienced some weather-related effects, the selected RENURE materials performed comparably to the chemical N fertiliser with respect to agronomic yield (fresh yieldRENURE materials= 28 – 32 tonne ha−1; fresh yieldSynthetic NPK= 32 tonne ha−1) and post-harvest residual nitrate in soil. The soil biota response analyses demonstrated that, microbial communities responded well to the application of RENURE materials, whereas nematode communities were more structured after AS application in comparison to the chemical N fertiliser. Overall, this short-term trial exhibited comparable performance of tested RENURE materials to the Haber-Bosch-derived N fertiliser, and long term trials are recommended for further result validation. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
"Underground mining fire hazards and the optimization of emergency evacuation strategies (EES): The issues, existing methodology and limitations, and way forward","Underground mine fires are associated with thermal and non-thermal hazards. Thermal hazards are primarily characterized by the release of heat into the underground confined space. The non-thermal hazards are noxious gases primarily carbon monoxide produced from incomplete combustion which may be circulated to other parts of the sub-surface environments through the ventilation network. Consequently, it is paramount to understand the interaction of possible fire scenarios and the underground ventilation system due to the hazards fire poses in such environments to design an appropriate emergency evacuation plan. This work aims to present a comprehensive review of the status of underground mine fire studies, techniques for emergency evacuation planning, the merits and limitations of the existing methods, the current best practices, and the way forward to develop an integrated smart solution for improved safety practices in underground environments. In addition, this study further identifies critical factors based on experimental and numerical fire studies that could substantially improve fire safety and emergency preparedness in underground confined environments, thus optimizing the management of emergency evacuation plans in such environments. © 2023 The Institution of Chemical Engineers",Not About Sufficiency
The effect of financial literacy and green innovation technology on green economic sustainability in emerging countries,"As battery electric vehicles become more prevalent in emerging markets, it is important that policymakers and the public consider their potential to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Through a PLS-SEM analysis, the study revealed that financial knowledge and green innovation were related to the attitude toward sustainability. The study also found that green innovation was associated with the economic sustainability of the country. However, it did not find any significant relationship between financial knowledge and green investment. The study revealed that financial literacy is very important for consumers to adopt sustainable practices. It can help them make informed decisions when it comes to the use of battery electric vehicles. This study was conducted after the Indonesian government stated that it would promote the use of green products. Innovation and green investment can help improve the economic sustainability of a country by increasing people's green attitudes and knowledge. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.",Not About Sufficiency
Experiential Learning for Circular Operations Management in Higher Education,"This research-to-practice article delves into novel learning experiences for operations management education, involving the circular economy and experiential learning. Higher Education academics are required to develop effective learning that actively and impactfully helps nurture in students the essential competency to face sustainable development demands. In operations management education, one possibility is to integrate real-world circular economy challenges into learning activities that address issues concerning solid waste generation in business processes and operations. This type of innovative learning experience involves both conceptual understanding and practical implementation. Accordingly, experiential learning is considered a suitable pedagogy for this purpose in this work because of its hands-on applications, critical thinking, and active engagement. To illustrate this proposition, this paper presents a case study concerning an operations management undergraduate course at a Mexican university. The case study indicates how to translate a situation of solid waste generation in a business into relevant disciplinary experiential learning. The results show that students regarded the learning experience as motivating, interesting, and relevant while widely accomplishing their learning objectives. However, limitations did exist regarding experiential learning, the methodological approach, data collection, and implementation challenges. Future work points to the need for further learning experiences and to improve research reliability, transferability, and validity. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Systematic Literature Review of Open Infrastructure BIM,"Representation and modeling using the building information modeling (BIM) methodology of civil works have become the subject of increasing attention in recent years, thanks to the potential offered by Open Infrastructure BIM (I-BIM). However, the complexity of infrastructure works, i.e., the variety of construction and technological systems, makes Open I-BIM very complex and challenging. The lack of systemic knowledge on the subject is another challenging factor. The aim of the following research work is to provide a synoptic overview of the existing scientific research, accompanied by the most recent studies in the field of computer modeling, its applications, and the main opportunities that Open I-BIM offers to the infrastructure sector. After a thorough review of 198 scientific articles published between 2013 and 2023, this study systematically presents a holistic review and critical reflection on the current status of the use of Open BIM in the infrastructure sector, with a focus on the development of the tools and methods used. The outcome of this work constitutes a systematic review of the literature with a bibliometric analysis on Open I-BIM, which is able to provide a knowledge base for identifying research trends, common problems, and the potential of developed methods. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the effect of real estate market and renewable energy on environmental quality in Belgium,"The current research aims to study the influence of the real estate market and renewable energy on ecological quality in Belgium from 1990 to 2018. The recent study is quite different from the previous empirical literature on environmental quality; it introduces a new discourse on the determinant of environmental quality followed by Belgium's real estate market. This work employed a more robust and advanced econometric technique, that is, the ARDL bootstrap method, to estimate the relationship between the study variables. The empirical findings from the ARDL stimulation revealed that real estate negatively impacts environmental quality in Belgium in the short and long-run periods. The policy implications emanating from the findings suggest that the real estate sector can significantly promote environmental quality by adopting and using renewable energy in construction, design, and buildings. Subsequently, this will reduce waste, energy and carbon emissions within the environment and prioritise using safer and sustainable green-enabled material for real estate development. Again to ensure regulation in the real estate market so that tax revenue generated through real estate would be channelled towards building clean and smart cities, also, ecological and regulatory control should be enforced in the real estate market to foresee the possible reduction in environmental pollution through pollution, this measure will guarantee a green real estate investment that will lead to a sustained environment. © 2023 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.",Not About Sufficiency
Education for Sustainable Development in Spanish engineering degrees. Case study,"The purpose of this work is to present a methodology for analyzing the perception of engineering students about the sustainability learning they have achieved during their university studies. This study has been carried out in the context of the Spanish university system. Specifically, the opinion of 3364 students from nine engineering degrees taught at three universities is analyzed. In the framework of the EDINSOST project, a questionnaire of 34 questions related to four sustainability competencies has been designed and validated. To measure the learning declared by the students, composite indicators have been constructed and validated using factor analysis. The results show that students consider that they have achieved only two thirds of the sustainability competencies they should have on completion of their studies (66.3%). In the nine degrees, the worst results are obtained for the competency “application of ethical principles related to the values of sustainability”, in which the fourth-year students declare having achieved, on average, only 53% of the expected learning outcomes. These results clearly show that engineering degrees should devote more time and effort to include Education for Sustainable Development in the curriculum. The methodology proposed in this work can be easily replicated in other contexts and in other countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating effectiveness of open assessments on alternative biofuel sources,"Biofuels have raised controversy regarding their environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The complexity of biofuel decisions and investments by both industry and society requires integration of scientific knowledge, public information, and values from a diversity of sources. Environmental assessments can identify multiple impacts of different options. Open and collaborative knowledge creation can support decisions in two ways: by building trust and credibility and by developing more robust understanding of key issues. Open assessment is a decision-support method that allows widespread participation in a transparent and freely accessible process. In this article, we evaluate two open assessment case studies concerning biodiesel production. The evaluation compiles the participants’ views regarding the potential of the assessment process to influence decisions in terms of quality of content, applicability, efficiency, and openness. According to the evaluation, openness can be feasibly implemented and is much appreciated by participants. More experience using broad and active participation is needed for further development of methods and tools. However, the currently common practices of closed and disengaged processes limit decision making. In addition, suitable tools and practices, as well as the inclusion of participants with appropriate skills, are needed to facilitate open collaboration. © 2014 ProQuest.",Not About Sufficiency
An international perspective on carbon peaking status between a sample of 154 countries,"The climate change triggered by carbon emissions has significantly impacted the sustainable development of human society. In line with the understanding on the importance of carbon reduction attached by the international community, most countries have set targets for carbon neutrality. The timing of the carbon peak is crucial for assisting countries in progressing towards the objective of carbon neutrality. This study examines the different carbon peak statuses between a sample of 154 countries in terms of carbon intensity, carbon emissions per capita and total carbon emissions. The data analyzed were collected over the period from 1990 to 2020. This study proposed an innovative two-procedure research method for distinguishing whether a country's carbon emissions have peaked, in which the Mann-Kendall trend test and Tapio decoupling model were applied interactively. The peaking statuses are divided into three types: true peaked, false peaked, and under peaked. The findings indicate that most of the sample countries have achieved the true peaked status of carbon intensity, and nearly one third of them in the true peaked status of carbon emissions per capita. Only a few countries in the true peaked status of total carbon emissions. Countries with higher income levels achieved true peaked status earlier in terms of carbon intensity, carbon emissions per capita and total carbon emissions. Countries with a false peaked status are mostly affected by multiple factors across economic, social and political dimensions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Healthy Sustainable Cities and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Sustainable Development Goals Perspective,"The world is experiencing a pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which develops the disease COVID-19. Taking care of yourself and others are attitudes considered more than a norm or suggestion, it is an attitude governed by common sense and also, an act of love. A new reality for many: work at home or with protective equipment; home studies; limitations when leaving home (use of mask, alcohol gel, and temperature measurement in different environments); excessive hygiene; numerous surveys (products, services, medicines, vaccines); hospital products and equipment. The importance and benefits of living in a sustainable city have become even more evident. Investments and emergency aid, water management, waste management, home education, health, are old needs, even more evident in a new reality. A sustainable city aims to develop responsibly, taking into account the triple bottom (economic, social, environmental). Based on this context, the objective of this research is: How the concept of sustainable cities can contribute in a pandemic context. This research aims to contribute theoretically, by addressing a series of measures and actions, foreseen in a sustainable city and that can positively help the population, when they find themselves in a pandemic. Still, there is a practical and social contribution, as the research contributes to the management of cities, aiming for smart, healthy and sustainable cities, focusing on education, security, and public health. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Practices and strategies for adaptation to climate variability in family farming. An analysis of cases of rural communities in the andes mountains of colombia and Chile,"Climate variability imposes greater challenges on family farming and especially on rural communities in vulnerable mountainous regions such as the Andes in Latin America. Changes in rainfall patterns and fluctuations in temperatures cause a greater frequency of extreme events, increased pests, and crop diseases, which even lead to food insecurity in communities that depend on self-production for survival. This is why strategies need to be developed to face this new scenario. Two cases of adaptation experiences to the effects of climate variability in rural communities in Chile (Araucanía Region) and Colombia (Cauca Department) were analyzed on this paper. For this, a mixed methodological approach was adopted that included the analysis of climate data, socioeconomic, and productive characterization of the communities, and a characterization of adaptation practices for both cases. The results show various ways of adapting mainly to changes in the availability and access of water for the development of agriculture and for domestic use. Likewise, it is shown that in order to be successful, the measures for facing climate variability must be part of coordinated strategies under a community-based adaptation approach and not developed in isolation. © 2021 by the authors.

A combinatorial data envelopment analysis with uncertain interval data with application to ICT evaluation,"Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been extensively adopted by firms worldwide due to the significant positive effect on their performance. This fact contrasts with the uncertainty faced by decision makers when entering a country and selecting local firms with which to interact. Consider selecting Decision Making Units (DMUs) according to their relative efficiency, this efficiency being determined via Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) based on the potential inputs consumed and outputs produced. The values of these variables are uncertain and defined through interval evaluations. Assume now that the interactions may be interrupted several times and new DMUs selected in place of previous ones. The new DMUs may require higher or lower amounts of inputs to produce variable amounts of outputs. The consequences derived from the potential realizations resolving the uncertainty should be incorporated into the DEA problem when deciding which DMUs to interact with and in which order. We study the combinatorial decision framework arising from the potential interactions with new DMUs. A numerical example is provided to complement the problem statement and outline the drawbacks of the existing approaches. It is shown that the selected DMUs and their order may differ substantially when accounting for the complementarities existing among all the DMUs. Moreover, the selection process and any subsequent decision vary with the number of modifications considered relative to the DMU initially selected. A case study analyzing the productive and environmental efficiency of a group of European countries displaying uncertain interval levels of ICT development is presented. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Adoption Determinants of Exotic Rice Cultivars in Bangladesh,"Agrarian Bangladesh relies heavily on rice. Since independence, many varieties have been released and targeted to increase productivity, farmers' income, and food security. However, few gained widespread adoption. Moreover, farmers in the border regions are adopting exotic cultivars, and it's gradually spreading throughout the country. But, the reasons for adopting exotic rice cultivars are still unexplored. Using field data from 1,260 farm households and 42 focus group discussions, this study analyzes farmers' preferences for domestic and exotic rice varieties and identifies the factors of adoption linked to design national breeding programs and farmers' welfare. Findings show, exotic varieties (69%) monopolized the area coverage in the dry season, whereas in the wet season, domestic varieties (58%) dominated. Farmers select exotic varieties for their better yield and price, low production costs, high grain quality, resistance to pests and diseases, and ability to withstand stresses. Risk analysis shows domestic varieties adoption is riskier with lower returns. The empirical findings indicate that household characteristics, access to institutions and infrastructure, varietal characteristics, and weather condition, all play a significant role in adoption decisions. National breeding should focus on developing rice varieties in response to market demands and farmer preferences toward sustainable food security in Bangladesh.

"Indigenous Strategies and Adaptive Approaches to Scrabble Recent Climate Crisis in Two Districts (Bankura and Purulia) of West Bengal, India","A population’s susceptibility to climatic change varies spatially as well as temporally. Indigenous and rural people have evolved the sensitivity necessary to recognize any changes that may occur in the environment and to build adaptive strategies in response to climate change due to their intimate relationship with natural ecosystems. This kind of traditional knowledge can be used to design solutions for disaster risk reduction that are cost-effective, inclusive, and sustainable. Traditional communities have spent a lot of time decoding environmental changes and devising intricate plans to adapt. Long-term survivors of climate change and other environmental pressures may provide valuable insights about climate adaptation. In the two districts of West Bengal with the most indigenous people, numerous adaptation strategies and approaches were deciphered during the study. For example, during drought, indigenous people in these places try to use every possible way to procure available nutrients, coupled with unorthodox diets like clotted animal blood, to meet intense nutrient needs. Likewise, the pitcher watering system is very popularly used by the indigenous people of these regions to overcome high salinity and extreme aridity. This study depicts the native techniques and adaptation strategies of these regions and researchers could acquire a few signs to fight the current situations of environmental emergency. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
"Evaluation of preventive, supportive and awareness building measures among international students in China in response to COVID-19: a structural equation modeling approach","Background: Education institutions promptly implemented a set of steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among international Chinese students, such as restrictive physical exercise, mask wear, daily health reporting, etc. Success of such behavioral change campaigns largely depends on awareness building, satisfaction and trust on the authorities. The purpose of this current study is to assess the preventive, supportive and awareness-building steps taken during the COVID-19 pandemic for international students in China, that will be useful for planning such a behavioral change campaign in the potential pandemic situation in other parts of the world. Methods: We conducted an online-based e-questionnaire survey among 467 international students in China through WeChat. The data collection duration was from February 20, 2020 to March 10, 2020 and we focused on their level of awareness, satisfaction, and trust in authorities regarding pandemic measures. Simple bivariate statistics was used to describe the background characteristics of the respondents along with adoption of the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) as the final model to demonstrate the relationship between the variables. Results: In our study, the leading group of the respondents were within 31 to 35 years’ age group (39.82%), male (61.88%), living single (58.24%) and doctoral level students (39.8%). The preventive and supportive measures taken by students and/or provided by the respective institution or authorities were positively related to students’ satisfaction and had an acceptable strength (β = 0.611, t = 9.679, p < 0.001). The trust gained in authorities also showed an acceptable strength (β = 0.381, t = 5.653, p < 0.001) with a positive direction. Again, the personnel awareness building related to both students’ satisfaction (β = 0.295, t = 2.719, p < 0.001) and trust gain (β = 0.131, t = 1.986, p < 0.05) in authorities had a positive and acceptable intensity. Therefore, our study clearly demonstrates the great impact of preventive and supportive measures in the development of students’ satisfaction (R2 = 0.507 indicating moderate relationship). The satisfied students possessed a strong influence which eventually helped in building sufficient trust on their institutions (R2 = 0.797 indicating above substantial relationship). Conclusions: The worldwide student group is one of the most affected and vulnerable communities in this situation. So, there is a profound ground of research on how different states or authorities handle such situation. In this study, we have depicted the types and magnitude of care taken by Chinese government and educational institutions towards international students to relieve the panic of pandemic situation. Further research and such initiatives should be taken in to consideration for future emerging conditions. © 2021, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Education, Financial Development, and Primary Energy Consumption: An Empirical Analysis for BRICS Economies","Energy is life blood of all economies and an indispensable prerequisite for all economic activities and consequently factors influencing the energy consumption are of vital importance. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of education together with financial development on energy consumption in sample of BRICS economies over the 1990–2019 period by means of second-generation cointegration and causality analyses thanks to the small number of empirical studies. The causality analysis unveils a one-way causal effect from education to primary energy consumption, but an insignificant causality between financial development and primary energy consumption. The cointegration analysis uncovers a strong positive effect of education at panel level and in all BRICS economies in the long-term, but financial sector development has a significant positive influence on primary energy use only in South Africa in the long-term. The findings of the study reveal that education considerably increases the primary energy use in the BRICS economies through economic growth channel, but financial sector development has not been a significant determinant of primary energy use yet. However, the BRICS economies should attach more importance to green technology and energy focused growth for sustainable growth and development. © 2022 by the authors.

Analysis of governance systems applied in multifunctional forest management in selected European mountain regions,"The objective of this study is to map and analyse governance systems relevant for the implementation of multifunctional mountain forest management in selected European countries. This paper is based on the FP7 research project Advanced multifunctional forest management in European mountain ranges (ARANGE). Current governance systems relevant for the implementation of multifunctional forest management are analysed in seven case study areas: the Iberian Mountains (Spain), Western Alps (France), Eastern Alps (Austria), Dinaric Mountains (Slovenia), Scandinavian Mountains (Sweden), Western Carpathians (Slovakia) and Western Rhodopes (Bulgaria). Qualitative social research methods were applied for data collection. Semi-structured questionnaire was focused on the following elements of governance: participation and stakeholders interactions and inter-sectorial coordination. The results indicate that forest managers share a general perception of multifunctional forest management being focused on preserving or strengthening several forest functions and services including timber production. They believe that current governance systems basically support multifunctional management of mountain forests. The participatory and inter-sectoral processes are playing an important role in multifunctional forest management in selected European mountain regions. © by Zuzana Sarvašová 2015.",Not About Sufficiency
REDD+ and human rights: Addressing synergies between international regimes,"The making of the REDD+ mechanism in the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has raised specific concerns on how to reconcile incentives for forest carbon sequestration with the protection of the rights of the numerous communities that rely upon forests for their livelihood, shelter, and survival.

I provide an overview of progress toward the establishment of such framework, arguing that concerns over the social impact of REDD+ activities may be addressed by resorting to clearer and stronger links with human rights instruments. © 2013 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Promoting safe and pro-environmental behaviors for sustainable forest management: Integrating technology acceptance model and the norm activation model,"In recent decades, Iran's forest resources have faced severe threats due to overexploitation. This study aims to identify key factors influencing stakeholders' intentions to adopt forest conservation behaviors, utilizing a hybrid framework that combines the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Norm Activation Model (NAM). A survey-based methodology, supported by a questionnaire and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), was employed. The study focused on rural households living in or near the Arasbaran forests of northwestern Iran. Results indicate that the integration of TAM and NAM provides valuable insights into sustainable forest management by addressing both functional and normative motivations. The proposed framework explained 66.4 % of the variance in rural households' intentions to engage in conservation behaviors. Notably, awareness of the consequences of forest conservation emerged as the most significant predictor. These findings suggest that policymakers should prioritize raising awareness about the impacts of forest preservation to foster environmentally responsible behavior and mitigate resource depletion. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Timber certification as a catalyst for change in forest governance in Cameroon, Indonesia, and Peru","Policy instruments targeting environmental, social, and economic sustainability cover both local and global geographies and stem from both the public and private sectors. These policy instruments do not work in silos but interact throughout the regulatory process. In this paper we discuss interactions between public regulations and private certification that affect how forests are managed in three tropical countries: Indonesia, Cameroon, and Peru. We show how the governance regime in each of the countries has evolved in response to environmental and social issues. We focus on the Forest Stewardship Council’s forest stewardship certification as it is the main global certification scheme in the tropical region and look at its role in attaining sustainability in timber production. Case study results from Indonesia, Cameroon, and Peru indicate that certification influences all stages of the policy process: agenda setting and negotiation; implementation, and monitoring and enforcement. Results also suggest that certification introduces positive changes in management practices and improves social and environmental performance. However, its influence in attaining broader-scale sustainability is limited by a low level of uptake, notably in tropical countries where the costs of getting certified and maintaining certification are high and the certification criteria are rather complex, as well as by some of its inherent characteristics, as it can only solve problems at the forest management unit level. © 2016 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Management of the incidence of infectious diseases by applying preventive measures in the weakest period in its cyclicity,"Existing preventive measures have not been entirely efficient. Mainly they are aimed at solving social and economic issues, which demands both time and money. Considering this, it is necessary to find and sustain additional effective measures, based on patterns of development of infectious diseases, which could be more cost-effective. One of such approaches could be based on the theory of self-regulation of parasitic systems, which directs epidemiologists to conducting preventive measures before the rise of the number of cases to prevent increase in the agent’s virulence. Yet this theory does not provide the optimum time for preventive measures. Based on the main statements of the theory of self-regulation of parasitic systems and analysis of annual and/or long-term cyclicity, the article provides substantiation of the theory that the lowest level of incidence is the weakest period in its development. Epidemiological experiments, using bacterial dysentery as an example, showed that preventive administration of polyvalent dysenteric bacteriophage in risk groups (children going to preschool institutions) during two months of the lowest incidence level of the disease appeared to be effective. The positive effect took place in the stages of cyclic increase and decrease of long-term trends. The effect appeared in the groups of children and population in general with most marked decline in disease occurrence in its seasonal peak. The hypothesis that the lowest incidence level is directly related to seasonal climbs of the disease was proved by our earlier studies when we investigated influence of technogenic pollution of the environment on annual incidence rate of more than ten most common infectious diseases with different ways of transmission. Thus, the lowest incidence level of infectious diseases defines their future growth and/or decline, and, therefore, it can be used to conduct preventive measures. © 2021 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

"Global challenge and institutional capacity: Or, how we can refit local administration for the next century","This article explores the question of how locally based administration can be refitted for the next millennium. We use global trends to formulate a new ecology based on open markets, increasing intensity of global interaction, and highly decentralized activities. That ecology produces both positive currents and negative countercurrents. These reciprocating dynamics lead to wealth through urbanization but also to imbalances in investment and growth. The dynamics emphasize the leading role of centrally located regions but also beget greater social disruption; they enhance democracy through a global dissemination of information but also produce heightened expectations, increased citizen demand, and inordinate pressures on local institutions. To manage these pressures, local administration will have to be flexible and resilient. We offer an organizational strategy designed to enhance conventional government by building institutional capacity. Networks of interaction with private, public, and nonprofit sectors are able to maximize participation by citizens, small groups, and mass associations.",Not About Sufficiency

The mediating role of social workers in the implementation of regional policies targeting energy poverty,"This paper aims to provide a socio-political reflection of the role played by social workers in regional policies and of the real needs of households affected by energy poverty. The paper also examines the impact of technical-specialised training on the ability of social workers to prevent and mitigate conditions of household energy poverty in Europe. The adoption of a research-action-participation methodological framework and a training research approach has permitted the opinions of social workers to be collected through surveys, and their central role in implementing regional policies to be highlighted. The conclusions obtained have made possible the construction of a self-diagnosis and data-collection tool which increases the ability of social workers to mediate and implement urgent mitigation measures for energy poverty. Finally, regional policies which aim to mitigate household energy poverty are examined from the professional perspective of social workers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Inhibition of dengue virus infection by mannoside glycolipid conjugates,"Dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, causes severe and potentially fatal symptoms in millions of infected individuals each year. Although dengue fever represents a major global public health problem, the vaccines or antiviral drugs proposed so far have not shown sufficient efficacy and safety, calling for new antiviral developments. Here we have shown that a mannoside glycolipid conjugate (MGC) bearing a trimannose head with a saturated lipid chain inhibited DENV productive infection. It showed remarkable cell promiscuity, being active in human skin dendritic cells, hepatoma cell lines and Vero cells, and was active against all four DENV serotypes, with an IC 50 in the low micromolar range. Time-of-addition experiments and structure-activity analyses revealed the importance of the lipid chain to interfere with an early viral infection step. This, together with a correlation between antiviral activity and membrane polarization by the lipid moiety indicated that the inhibitor functions by blocking viral envelope fusion with the endosome membrane.

Global relationships between time preference and environmental policy performance,"How our governments deal with environmental crises can depend on national culture, including time preference (i.e., short- vs. long-term orientation). Here, we follow up on the hypothesis that long-term orientation increases environmental policy performance. To this end, we use three time preference indices (including a newly constructed index with a wide spatial coverage based on Google search data). Our results show that countries with higher long-term orientation have higher environmental policy performance. This relationship is in most cases because of the positive association of long-term orientation and environmental policy performance with economic development and other factors. Only the analysis with increased spatial coverage (especially to African and Asian countries) using Google long-term orientation shows some results indicating positive relationships when considering economic development and other factors. Still, also in this analysis, the positive relationships are largely because of economic development and other factors. Expanding the spatial coverage when measuring time preference might add insights into the time preference-environmental policy performance relationship. Moreover, the results show that researchers need to control for important factors, especially economic development, when analyzing time preference and environmental policy performance or related questions, such as environmental behavior and culture, as these factors can completely, or at least largely, drive the results. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
MercNet: A national monitoring network to assess responses to changing mercury emissions in the United States,"A partnership of federal and state agencies, tribes, industry, and scientists from academic research and environmental organizations is establishing a national, policy-relevant mercury monitoring network, called MercNet, to address key questions concerning changes in anthropogenic mercury emissions and deposition, associated linkages to ecosystem effects, and recovery from mercury contamination. This network would quantify mercury in the atmosphere, land, water, and biota in terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal ecosystems to provide a national scientific capability for evaluating the benefits and effectiveness of emission controls. Program development began with two workshops, convened to establish network goals, to select key indicators for monitoring, to propose a geographic network of monitoring sites, and to design a monitoring plan. MercNet relies strongly on multi-institutional partnerships to secure the capabilities and comprehensive data that are needed to develop, calibrate, and refine predictive mercury models and to guide effective management. Ongoing collaborative efforts include the: (1) development of regional multi-media databases on mercury in the Laurentian Great Lakes, northeastern United States, and eastern Canada; (2) syntheses and reporting of these data for the scientific and policy communities; and (3) evaluation of potential monitoring sites. The MercNet approach could be applied to the development of other monitoring programs, such as emerging efforts to monitor and assess global mercury emission controls. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).",Not About Sufficiency
"Choice Posture, Architecture, and Infrastructure: Systemic Behavioral Design for Public Health Policy","The demands of many public health contexts and challenges call for conditions that foster effective decision making. Policy designers must make appropriate choices appear viable, accessible, and beneficial. They can do this by harnessing transdisciplinary knowledge about behavioral tendencies, simultaneously integrating insights into end users and non-human agents, and employing design methods for system-level solutions. We propose a “choice triad” model to help practitioners frame transdisciplinary approaches to complex public health challenges and design effective conditions for choice. It has three lenses: choice posture, to reveal human and non-human agents’ predispositions and inclinations; choice architecture, to improve immediate choice environments and encourage preferred actions; and choice infrastructure, to reveal the underlying system structures, processes, and policies that shape how potential public health solutions are accessed and supported. This approach promises to augment traditional design tools and expand current conceptions of available “economies of choice” when crafting behavioral public policy solutions. In combination, these lenses can provide a new conceptual syntax and working model to diagnose and develop solutions within complex public health settings. We introduce two examples to illustrate this model: the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and Covid-19 vaccination efforts in the United States. © 2023 Tongji University and Tongji University Press",Not About Sufficiency
Ontologies of climate change: Reconciling indigenous and scientific explanations for the lack of rain in Namibia,"In Namibia, both Damara pastoralists (ǂNūkhoen) and scientists agree that it rains less frequently than before. To explain their observations, however, scientists refer to carbon dioxide molecules, while the pastoralists point to social tensions, neoliberalism, and failures of the postcolonial state. To understand this discrepancy, I ask whether what scientists call precipitation and what Damara call ǀnanus are really the same thing. Engaging with phenomenological theories, I propose a worldliness continuum that reveals substantial ontological difference between the two. While precipitation occurs independently of humans, ǀnanus encompasses everything—it is life and death. If the two are different things, it is unsurprising that one needs different explanations for them. Acknowledging this creates space to navigate between the recognition of multiple ontologies and the politicization of carbon dioxide emissions.

Thus, a bibliometric and thematic analysis was conducted, involving an examination of 154 recent studies that were clustered around four research streams: (1) tourists’ responsible behavior; (2) residents’ responsible tourism accounts; (3) tourism businesses’ responsible actions; and (4) destination management’s role in responsible tourism, showing that responsible tourism research is predominantly focused on tourists’ responsibility. Tourism businesses and residents are less frequently investigated. Similarly, the role of destination management is only recently emerging, while governments’ contribution to responsible tourism has been neglected in research. Environmental responsibility studies dominate on the tourist and resident level, while corporate social responsibility (CSR) studies prevail on the business level. This literature review identifies research priorities in order to derive an agenda for future research. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Foundation ownership and sustainability,"Concerns about the sustainability of contemporary capitalism have inspired a search for organizational forms that are more concerned with solving environmental and social problems. We examine whether one such model – foundation ownership – where a non-profit foundation owns and controls business companies, is associated with better sustainability outcomes. We hypothesize that foundations prioritize environmental and social objectives over profit maximization, resulting in stronger ESG performance in the companies they own. Using data on listed foundation-owned companies over the period 2003–2020 matched with control groups by firm size and industry, we find that foundation-owned firms have higher environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, particularly in the environmental and social dimensions. They maintained ESG activities during the financial crisis and committed to more significant emission reductions in the post-Paris Agreement period. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of purposeful ownership in promoting corporate sustainability. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Institutional inertia in European fisheries – Insights from the Atlantic horse mackerel case,"Fisheries management has to deal with uncertainty about the genetic composition and the location of fish stocks. If institutions are inert, i.e. unable to adapt to new insights, management may not be effective. This paper analyses fisheries management in Europe which relies on scientific advice feeding into the management decision process. The spatial boundaries of fish stocks define the scientific areas and management areas, which are not necessarily aligned. Even if new scientific information on the stock composition and location leads to changes in scientific areas, the management areas are usually not adjusted. This causes an institutional mismatch which violates the self-imposed good governance principles of the EU. We use the North Sea and the Western horse mackerel stocks to gain some insights in the process of renegotiating new management areas and national fisheries quotas. We find that distributional concerns around allocating quota are a key obstacle for an adjustment of management areas. We suggest to pre-define a transparent mechanism to facilitate adapting management areas to scientific areas. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Developing competitive advantage using the triple bottom line: a conceptual framework,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for a sustainability model to be used by industrial companies for establishing a competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach: Literature is replete with sustainability models for business; however, few of these models are specific to the industrial supply chain market sector. The authors propose a novel approach for comparing/normalizing data from all three components of the Triple Bottom Line (3BL) sustainability model. Findings: A shortcoming of the 3BL sustainability model has been that the data cannot be easily normalized and compared across the three categories of the model. The findings of this paper suggest that it may be possible to develop a model that includes both environmental and social responsibility scales, combined with the more traditional financial data, as a tool for competitive advantage using generalizable data. Practical implications: As the industrial companies continue to put increasing pressure on both the upstream and downstream suppliers in their supply chain to demonstrate sound sustainability practice, this model could serve to provide a company with competitive advantage. Originality/value: This paper proposes a novel approach to assessing environmental, social and financial impact as a tool for competitive advantage. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency

The world of the salt marsh: Appreciating and protecting the tidal marshes of the Southeastern Atlantic coast,"The World of the Salt Marsh is a wide-ranging exploration of the southeastern coast-its natural history, its people and their way of life, and the historic and ongoing threats to its ecological survival. Focusing on areas from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to Cape Canaveral, Florida, Charles Seabrook examines the ecological importance of the salt marsh, calling it ""a biological factory without equal."" Twice-daily tides carry in a supply of nutrients that nourish vast meadows of spartina (Spartina alterniflora)-a crucial habitat for creatures ranging from tiny marine invertebrates to wading birds. The meadows provide vital nurseries for 80 percent of the seafood species, including oysters, crabs, shrimp, and a variety of finfish, and they are invaluable for storm protection, erosion prevention, and pollution filtration. Seabrook is also concerned with the plight of the people who make their living from the coast's bounty and who carry on its unique culture. Among them are Charlie Phillips, a fishmonger whose livelihood is threatened by development in McIntosh County, Georgia, and Vera Manigault of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, a basket maker of Gullah-Geechee descent, who says that the sweetgrass needed to make her culturally significant wares is becoming scarcer. For all of the biodiversity and cultural history of the salt marshes, many still view them as vast wastelands to be drained, diked, or ""improved"" for development into highways and subdivisions. If people can better understand and appreciate these ecosystems, Seabrook contends, they are more likely to join the growing chorus of scientists, conservationists, fishermen, and coastal visitors and residents calling for protection of these truly amazing places. © 2012 by the University of Georgia Press.

"Education, ecology and poverty reduction","Many of the world's poorest people live in rural areas. They depend on environmental resources for their health and well-being. The rural poor depend disproportionately on trees, freshwater streams, pollinators, mangroves, and rainfall (UN Millennium Project 2005). Many rural people have grown up in those rural areas; they come from generations of rural producers-herders, farmers, hunters, and gathers-who collectively possess an unwritten library of local knowledge, intelligence, skills, and technologies about how to survive and thrive on what local ecosystems can provide. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

A Multi-model Air Quality System for Health Research: Road model development and evaluation,"Poor air quality impacts life expectancy and quality of life of populations worldwide. Numerical models generate comprehensive air pollutant concentration datasets, useful for quantifying historic, current and, through projections, future air pollution effects on health. However, it is challenging to accommodate the full range of dispersion and chemistry processes affecting both regional and local scales in a single model. The scientific formulation and evaluation of a new quasi-Gaussian road source dispersion model, ADMS-Local, is presented. This model has been developed as a component for the ‘Multi-model Air Quality System for Health Research’ (MAQS-Health). ADMS-Local accounts for the influence of urban morphology on dispersion, as well as near-road NOX chemistry processes, leading to the spatial resolution of pollutant concentration gradients occurring over distances of a few metres. The model is optimised for use within the MAQS-Health system, where local modelling for each regional model grid cell is run in parallel. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Development strategies to manage village forest in bali,"Presently, there has been deforestation and conversion of forest function within the forest areas. One of the central government’s programs is implementation of village forest. Village forest is state forest that is within the territory of a village, used by the village, for the welfare of the village community. This program has been started to carry out within four villages in Bali province, Indonesia. The objectives of the study are to portrait the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the local institutions in managing village forest, and to recommend the strategic erfforts for the village forest development. Four villages were defined as study sites where are located in the Northern part of Bali island. Data collected by using some techniques, namely: survey, interview, direct observation and documentation. Some key respondents were also selected to interview. Data collected was analyzed by using SWOT analysis and descriptive method. The results of study pointed out that the local institution has function to manage village forest.The problems currently found in the villages related to the damage of forest within the upstream area; the changes of forest function; and the decrease of water storage at the forest level which during the dry season. The local institutions within the villages have the strengths, weakneses, opportunities and threats concerning the management of village forest. It is needed to recommend four strategies for managing village forest, namely Strength-Opportunity (SO), Weakness-Opportunity (WO), Strength-Threat (ST), and Weakness-Threat (WT). © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

"Tweeting like Elon? Provocative language, new-venture status, and audience engagement on social media","This article theorizes and empirically investigates how status and provocative language influence audience engagement with new-venture posts on social media platforms. Using venture capital funding as a status proxy, we analyzed 369,142 Twitter posts by 268 new ventures. We found that status (1) increases engagement with ventures' tweets, and that it (2) moderates the effect of provocative language on audience engagement so that provocative language has a negative effect for low-status ventures but a positive effect for high-status ventures. Post-hoc analyses provide a basis for pragmatic theorizing and explore the effects of status tiers and subdimensions of provocative language. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

Recognizing flood exposure inequities across flood frequencies,"Urban flooding is a growing threat due to land use and climate change. Vulnerable populations tend to have greater exposure to flooding as a result of historical societal and institutional processes. Most flood vulnerability studies focus on a single large flood, neglecting the impact of small, frequent floods. Therefore, there is a need to investigate inequitable flood exposure across a range of event magnitudes and frequencies. To explore this question, we develop a novel score of inequitable flood risk by defining risk as a function of frequency, exposure, and vulnerability. This analysis combines high-resolution, parcel-scale compounded fluvial and pluvial flood data with census data at the census block group scale. We focus on six census tracts within Athens-Clarke County, Georgia that are highly developed with diverse populations. We define vulnerable populations as non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and households under the poverty level and use dasymetric mapping techniques to calculate the over-representation of these populations in flood zones. Inequitable risks at each census tract (approximately neighborhood scale) were estimated for multiple (e.g., 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-year) flood return periods. Results show that the relatively greatest flood risk inequities occur for the 10-year flood and not at the largest event. We also found that the size of inequity is dynamic, depending on the flood magnitude. Therefore, addressing a range of events including smaller, more frequent floods can increase equity and reveal opportunities that may be missed if only one event is considered. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Towards a common oil spill risk assessment framework - Adapting ISO 31000 and addressing uncertainties,"Oil spills are a transnational problem, and establishing a common standard methodology for Oil Spill Risk Assessments (OSRAs) is thus paramount in order to protect marine environments and coastal communities. In this study we firstly identified the strengths and weaknesses of the OSRAs carried out in various parts of the globe. We then searched for a generic and recognized standard, i.e. ISO 31000, in order to design a method to perform OSRAs in a scientific and standard way. The new framework was tested for the Lebanon oil spill that occurred in 2006 employing ensemble oil spill modeling to quantify the risks and uncertainties due to unknown spill characteristics. The application of the framework generated valuable visual instruments for the transparent communication of the risks, replacing the use of risk tolerance levels, and thus highlighting the priority areas to protect in case of an oil spill. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Optimizing renewable energy systems for 100 % clean energy target: A comparative study of solar, hydro, pumped hydro, and battery storage technologies","Addressing global environmental concerns and rising energy demand underscores the urgent need for sustainable renewable energy solutions. This study introduces a novel optimization framework for 100 % hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) tailored for rural electrification, utilizing HOMER software. This study conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of mono-crystalline silicon (m-Si) and poly-crystalline silicon (p-Si) photovoltaic (PV) technologies, integrated with hydro, pumped hydro storage (PHS), and battery storage systems, from both energy performance and economic perspectives. The study examines three scenarios, m-Si and p-Si PV systems with PHS, m-Si, and p-Si PV systems with battery storage, and a direct comparison of the optimal configurations from these scenarios. The results indicate that the p-Si PV/Hybrid/PHS system, with a capacity of 162 kW PV, 25 kW hydro, and 1525 kWh PHS, is the most cost-effective and energy-efficient solution. This system generates 474,399 kWh annually, with a net present cost (NPC) of US$472,528.54 and a cost of energy (COE) of US$0.101/kWh. Its superior economic performance and minimized excess energy make it the optimal choice for sustainable energy generation in the targeted rural area. Sensitivity analysis further underscores the critical role of solar irradiation and hydro flow rates in cost minimization. These findings highlight the importance of site-specific customization of PV technology and storage solutions, offering actionable insights for the design and implementation of sustainable energy systems in rural and off-grid environments. By providing a detailed optimization framework, this study significantly advances the development of renewable energy solutions, with potential applications in similar settings. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Evaluation of the Hydrological Response of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in Socio-Economically Vulnerable Tropical Urban Settlements: A Case Study in La Guapil, Costa Rica, Under Climate Change Scenarios","Urbanization increases the number of impervious surfaces in watersheds, reducing infiltration and evapotranspiration, which increases runoff volumes and the risks of flooding and the pollution of water resources. Nature-based solutions (NBS) mitigate these effects by managing water volume and quality, restoring the hydrological cycle, and creating sustainable livelihoods that can promote socioeconomic equity by providing green space. In light of the aforementioned information, this study analyzes the hydrological response of NBS in La Guapil, a densely populated and socioeconomically vulnerable area of Costa Rica with approximately 80% impervious surfaces, focusing on their effectiveness in stormwater management and improving hydrological conditions. Field data from the study area’s storm drainage system, as well as hydrological analyses, were collected and processed to evaluate RCP8.5 climate change scenarios using the Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) relationship. Three scenarios were proposed: (1) the “status quo”, reflecting current conditions, (2) green roofs and green improvements, and (3) detention ponds and green improvements, evaluated using the SWMM, with the latter scenario also using the Iber model. Simulations showed that Scenario 2 achieved the greatest reduction in peak flow (53.74%) and runoff volume (57.60%) compared to Scenario 3 (peak: 28.37%; volume: 56.42%). Both scenarios demonstrate resilience to climate change projections. The results of this study provide a foundation for further research into NBS in Costa Rica and other comparable regions. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Front end projects benefits realisation from a requirementsmanagement perspective-A systematic literature review,"The recent notable emergence of a body of research in requirements management on one hand and benefits realisation has contributed to addressing a growing need for improved performance in Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) projects. However, front end design (FED) as one of the vital processes in the project life cycle and delivery has attracted limited research to date within this understanding. This paper aims to map current evidence on requirements management in facilitating benefits realisation from an FED perspective. This is to bring about an updated and unified position on requirements management for its impact on design decision making. A systematic review of the literature covering the last ten years (2008-2018) aims first to build understanding and support identification of these emergent conceptual positions and secondly underscore essential requirements and their categorisations that impact on design discourse in FED. One hundred sixty-one peer-reviewed journal papers in the areas of benefits realisation and/or requirements management and/or FED based are identified on a pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thirty-six requirements are identified as important in influencing use case changes important in design decision making broadly grouped into nine major categories. Following analysis, this research finds little evidence supporting an integrated requirements management practice and understanding to support design decision making. The research further finds bias in current research discourse towards four requirements categories (technical, economics, governance and environment); and 14 requirements, dominated by three strategic values, collaboration and project governance, with over 80% share of literature. The least 14 requirements such as ""flow of spaces, social status/aspiration, mobility and integrated design"" among others only account for less than 10% of literature. The authors argue for new research to bridge this gap, highlight the essential role of requirements management and broaden understanding to improve benefits realisation, particularly for FED processes. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Non-timber forest products as poverty traps: Fact or fiction?,"Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are used by billions of rural and urban people globally. Income shares from NTFPs are generally highest among poor communities and households, and consequently, their use has at times been described as a poverty trap. However, there are only a handful of works that have directly examined the existence of poverty traps in relation to NTFPs, and none concluded that poverty traps existed in their specific contexts. Consequently, in this paper, we (i) examined the basis for the argument that NTFP use and reliance does engender poverty traps, and (ii) present a reasoned case as to why the use of and reliance on NTFPs is unlikely to result in poverty traps in most contexts. We end with a call for more comprehensive research into the contexts which might, or do, result in poverty traps emanating from reliance on NTFPs, and until such are forthcoming, some circumspection in linking of the two. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
Land use planning: A potential force for retaining habitat connectivity in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and Beyond,"The grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) is perceived to have been isolated from the population in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem for a century. Better land use planning is needed to thwart progressive intra- and inter-ecosystem habitat fragmentation, especially due to private land development. The dilemma of private lands being intermixed in large landscapes is addressed. This review attempts to identify some land use planning levels and tools which might facilitate dispersal by the grizzly bear and other large mammals. The planning levels discussed include national, regional, state, county and municipal, and federal land management agency. Specific potential federal tools mentioned include zoning, Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, the Endangered Species Act, beyond boundary authority, land exchanges, less-than-fee acquisition and other incentives, the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act, and federal land annexation.

"Catalytic Conversion of Jatropha curcas Oil to Biodiesel Using Mussel Shell-Derived Catalyst: Characterization, Stability, and Comparative Study","Biodiesel represents a promising solution for sustainable energy needs, offering an eco-friendly alternative to conventional fossil fuels. In this research, we investigate the use of a catalyst derived from mussel shells to facilitate biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas oil. Our findings from X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis emphasize the importance of carefully selecting calcination temperatures for mussel shell-based catalysts, with 1100 °C identified as optimal for maximizing CaO content. We identify a reaction time of 6 h as potentially optimal, with a reaction temperature of approximately 110 °C yielding the desired methyl ester composition. Notably, a methanol-to-oil ratio of 18:1 is the most favorable condition, and the optimal methyl ester composition is achieved at a calcined catalyst temperature of 900 °C. We also assess the stability of the catalyst, demonstrating its potential for reuse up to five times. Additionally, a thorough analysis of J. curcas Methyl Ester (JCME) biodiesel properties confirmed compliance with industry standards, with variations attributed to the unique characteristics of JCME. Comparing homogeneous (NaOH) and heterogeneous (CaO) catalysts highlights the potential of environmentally sourced heterogeneous catalysts to replace their homogeneous counterparts while maintaining efficiency. Our study presents a novel approach to sustainable biodiesel production, outlining optimal conditions and catalyst stability and highlighting additional benefits compared with NaOH catalysts. Therefore, utilizing mussel shell waste for catalyst synthesis can efficiently eliminate waste and produce cost-effective catalysts. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Economic globalization-energy diversification nexus and implications for environmental management in China,"Every nation on earth has the responsibility to implement effective environmental management measures for sustainable environmental quality. In doing so, this study scrutinizes the relationship between economic globalisation and energy diversification in the Chinese economy from 1995 to 2022 for designing and implanting policies for environmental management. It uses industrialization, foreign direct investment, foreign remittances, and information & communication technology as supplementary factors into augmented energy diversification demand function. This empirical analysis shows cointegration between the variables, with economic globalisation positively impacting energy diversification. Factors such as foreign direct investment, foreign remittances, and information & communication technology contribute to energy diversity. However, industrialization has an adverse relationship with energy diversification. The relationship forms an inverted-U shaped between economic globalization and energy diversification. Our causality analysis indicates that economic globalization positively causes energy diversification. This study also reveals a reciprocal and beneficial cause-and-effect association between foreign direct investment and energy diversification. Lastly, foreign remittances and information & communication technologies positively cause energy diversification. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

"Mosquito-larvicidal Binary (BinA/B) proteins for mosquito control programs —advancements, challenges, and possibilities","The increasing global burden of mosquito-borne diseases require targeted, environmentally friendly, and sustainable approaches for effective vector control without endangering the non-target beneficial insect population. Biological interventions such as biopesticides, Wolbachia-mediated biological controls, or sterile insect techniques are used worldwide. Here we review Binary or BinAB toxin—the mosquito-larvicidal component of WHO-recognized Lysinibacillus sphaericus bacterium employed in mosquito control programs. Binary (BinAB) toxin is primarily responsible for the larvicidal effect of the bacterium. BinAB is a single-receptor-specific toxin and is effective against larvae of Culex and Anopheles, but not against Aedes aegypti. The receptor in Culex, the Cqm1 protein, has been extensively studied. It is a GPI-anchored amylomaltase and is located apically in the lipid rafts of the larval-midgut epithelium. The interaction of the toxin components with the receptor is crucial for the mosquito larvicidal activity of the BinAB toxin. Here we extend support for the pore formation model of BinAB toxin internalization and the role of toxin-glycan interactions in the endoplasmic reticulum in mediating larval death. BinAB is phylogenetically safe for humans, as Cqm1-like protein is not expected in the human proteome. This review aims to initiate targeted R&D efforts, such as applying fusion technologies (chimera of BinA, chemical modification of BinA), for efficient mosquito control interventions. In addition, the review also examines other areas such as bioremediation and cancer therapeutics, in which L. sphaericus is proving useful and showing potential for further development. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency

Decontamination Strategies and Technologies for Tackling COVID-19 Hospitals and Related Biomedical Waste,"The complexities of waste management have been enhanced by the arrival of the novel coronavirus disease-2019. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, biomedical waste (BMW) is being generating in huge amount worldwide by the isolation ward, institutional quarantine centres, COVID testing facilities and even household quarantine. The major contributors to the waste volume include personal protective equipment (PPE), testing kits, surgical facemasks and nitrile gloves. Discharge of new category of BMW (COVID-waste) is of great global concern to public health and environmental sustainability if handled inappropriately. It has been established that COVID virus survives up to 7 days on waste like facemasks, which may cause exponential spreading of this fatal disease with the waste acing as a vector. As vaccines were not prepared at early phase, to lower the threat of pandemic spread, many protective gears have been used and discarded. Thus, for sustainable environmental management, addressing the issue of proper disposal of COVID-19 related waste is an immediate requirement. Henceforth, in the present article, disinfectant technologies for handling COVID-waste from its separate disposal to collection to various physical and chemical treatment steps have been reviewed. Furthermore, policy briefs on the global initiatives for COVID-waste management has been including. The application of different disinfection techniques has also been discussed with some potential examples effectively applied to reduce both health and environmental risks. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
"Plants used in female reproductive healthcare by the Gujjar tribe of the sub-Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India","Background: About half of India's female population suffers from gynaecological disorders due to lliteracy, poverty, a lack of healthcare resources, and social stigma. Medicinal plants play a vital role in the basic healthcare services of tribal communities in India due to their ease of availability and cost, and their use is also a vital part of the cultural heritage. The study aimed to identify and document the medicinal plants used in female reproductive healthcare by the Gujjar tribe in the sub-Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India. Methods: One hundred twelve informants between 21 and 80 years of age were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaire and open-ended interviews. The documented data was quantitatively analysed by applying frequency of citation (RFC), informant consensus factor (ICF), family importance value (FIV) and the Jaccard's index (JI). Results: The present study documented 90 plant species from 47 families with Leguminosae as the most cited family. The study identified Asparagus racemosus as the most important species based on RFC value. Menstrual disorder and leucorrhoea were among the primary disease categories based on ICF values. Roots were the most commonly used plant parts (22%) and decoction was the major mode of preparation (52%). Conclusions: Asparagus racemosus was one of the most frequently mentioned plant species in the present study. The findings of this investigation are important for documenting and prioritising plant species such as A. racemosus, Abrus precatorius, Bombax ceiba, Moringa oleifera, Curculigo orchioides, Cocculus hirsutus, and Centella asiatica for additional investig,ations. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH",Not About Sufficiency
"Impact of Cyclones and Extreme Floods on Traditional Medicines and Indigenous Knowledge Systems in Chimanimani, Zimbabwe","Indigenous knowledge systems, including traditional medicines, are an important part of the livelihood of many communities around the globe. In sub-Saharan Africa, the use of modern medicines has never fully replaced the indigenous system, and it is estimated that a great majority of the population relies on traditional medicine not only as its primary healthcare option but also as a significant source of income. Despite their wealth of knowledge and practices, indigenous cultures are not exempt from the threat of environmental change. Over the past 10 years, sub-Saharan Africa has experienced more frequent and extreme climate events such as Cyclone Idai and Cyclone Kenneth. There is evidence to show that these extreme weather events are causing noticeable effects not just on human and animal life but also on the life cycles and distribution of plant species, including medicinal plants. This chapter outlines the role of traditional medicines and indigenous/traditional medicinal knowledge systems in public healthcare in Chimanimani, especially during the 2019 Cyclone Idai event, and the impact that the cyclone-induced floods and landslides had on the availability of medicinal plants. Data was collected from in-depth interviews with medicinal practitioners and a questionnaire-based survey of local community members. The study found that, as a result of the tropical cyclone, medicinal plant species mainly along riverine areas were lost, and also some of the traditional medical practitioners were deceased. The effect of the loss of vital medicinal species cannot be overstated as it is likely to have major consequences on the livelihoods of large numbers of vulnerable people who rely on traditional medicines for their primary healthcare needs. The protection of medicinal plant sites is therefore important for the sustenance of traditional medicinal practice. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Not About Sufficiency

It is necessary to assess these infrastructures according to SCOI and provide choices for investment to maximize resource utilization. Therefore, an assessing model of SCOI with 26 general indicators was developed, which covers five most urgently needed infrastructures of these townships in Southwest China, including road transport, sewage treatment, waste disposal, water supply, and gas. In this model, quantitative and qualitative methods are combined to acquire different SCOI of each infrastructure. The result of the SCOI would be an important reference for infrastructure investment. A case study of Jiansheng Town, that is located in the Dadukou district of Chongqing, demonstrates the applicability of the model. It shows the assessing model of SCOI is efficient to identify the most valuable infrastructure that is appropriate for investment with the goal of township’s sustainable development. This study can provide insights for infrastructure investment and management in townships or areas. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
Improving Truthful Reporting of Polluting Firms by Rotating Inspectors: Experimental Evidence from a Bribery Game,"We consider a two-layered review system of environmental regulation where a polluting firm periodically self-reports its emissions to a regulatory authority. The system typically requires a third party to verify the firm’s report and, in addition, an official of the regulatory authority to spot-check. If there are potential gains from corruption, both the verifier and the official might be corruptible. Corruption is more likely in repeated-game situations, as suggested by the literature on corruption experiments. Our experimental design is motivated by the risk of under-reporting in emissions trading schemes where both the verifier and the official are corruptible and focuses on a situation with untruthful reporting and lax enforcement. Our test-bed is a three-player bribery game. We study how different types of rotation—a baseline of fixed matching, a complete rotation treatment, and two incomplete rotation treatments—affect untruthful reporting that requires collusion between three participants in a hierarchical structure. Our findings suggest that complete rotation improves significantly firms’ truthful reporting and verifiers’ truthful verification compared to situations where none is rotated, while incomplete rotation does not have such impact. In our experiment, none of the rotation treatments had a significant impact on the behavior of officials. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Rethinking the impacts of foreign investors on urban development: The city of Macao,"A number of papers in the economics and urban literature find positive impacts of foreign investment on cities and praise the role of foreign investors in urban development. The author argues for a different stance by developing an urban economics model for tourist cities. The model illustrates that in the presence of significant side effects, foreign investors' and a tourist city's preferences regarding openness of the city greatly diverge. Foreign investors tend to shape a city's policymaking toward greater openness. Therefore, policymakers in tourist cities concerned about sustainable development should carefully regulate foreign capital inflows at an optimal level. Evidence from Macao lends support to the theoretical construction. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Not About Sufficiency
"Community-based monitoring, assessment and management of data-limited inland fish stocks in North Rupununi, Guyana","Inland fisheries are important for food security in communities around the world, especially in developing countries. In North Rupununi, Guyana, the state of exploited stocks is poorly understood, and fishery monitoring and assessment are challenging because diverse fishing gears and target species are distributed across a heterogeneous landscape. This complexity created an opportunity for community-based monitoring (CBM) to support data-limited assessment. Standardised CBM was established for the North Rupununi as part of a new inland fisheries management plan initiated by indigenous community groups with support from the government. Quantitative length-based assessments undertaken for target stocks suggested moderate levels of exploitation consistent with local perception. Our study highlights that local experts and community participants with different levels of training can collect accurate biodiversity data. Further development of CBM is important in North Rupununi. We recommend using local ecological knowledge indicators to track spatial and temporal patterns in exploitation and fish stock status. © 2022 The Authors.

Imagining serengeti: A history of landscape memory in Tanzania from Earliest time to the present,"Long before the creation of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, the people of the western Serengeti had established settlements and interacted with the environment in ways that created a landscape we now misconstrue as natural. Western Serengeti peoples imagine the environment not as a pristine wilderness, but as a differentiated social landscape that embodies their history and identity. Conservationist literature has ignored these now-displaced peoples and relegated them to the margins of modern society. Their oral traditions, however, provide the means for seeing the landscape from a new perspective. Imagining Serengeti allows us to see the Serengeti landscape as a book of memory that preserves the ways in which western Serengeti peoples have actively transformed their environment and their societies. Moreover, it strengthens the case for involving local communities in conservation efforts that will preserve African environments for the future. Using a new methodology to analyze precolonial oral traditions, Jan Shetler identifies core spatial images, which are then recontextualized into historical time periods through the use of archaeological, linguistic, ethnographic, ecological, and archival evidence. Imagining Serengeti reconstructs a socioenvironmental history of landscape memory of the western Serengeti spanning the last eighteen hundred years. © 2007 by Ohio University Press All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of online deliberative quality: New indicators using network analysis and time-series analysis,"Online deliberation research has recently developed automated indicators to assess the deliberative quality of much user-generated online data. While most previous studies have developed indicators based on content analysis and network analysis, time-series data and associated methods have been studied less thoroughly. This article contributes to the literature by proposing indicators based on a combination of network analysis and time-series analysis, arguing that it will help monitor how online deliberation evolves. Based on Habermasian deliberative criteria, we develop six throughput indicators and demonstrate their applications in the OmaStadi participatory budgeting project in Helsinki, Finland. The study results show that these indicators consist of intuitive figures and visualizations that will facilitate collective intelligence on ongoing processes and ways to solve problems promptly. © 2021 by the authors.

Do Product Characteristics Affect Customers’ Participation in Virtual Brand Communities? An Empirical Study,"The virtual brand community has become an important marketing tool for companies. A successful brand community marketing strategy should attract a large number of consumers. Although past studies have revealed consumer motivations for participating in virtual brand communities, they fail to answer an important question: Why is it so easy for some virtual brand communities to attract users while others have such difficulty? In this study, product characteristics are hypothesized to be important factors that determine consumer motivation to participate in brand communities. Product characteristics (e.g., product complexity, product symbolism, and product satisfaction) can directly affect how actively consumers participate in brand communities. The results of questionnaires show that product complexity, product symbolism, and product satisfaction have a positive influence on consumers’ willingness to participate in brand communities. Notably, the duration of product use has a regulating effect on the influence of product satisfaction and product symbolism. A long period of product use weakens the influence of product satisfaction on consumers’ willingness to participate in brand communities. On the contrary, a long period of product use strengthens the influence of product symbolism on consumers’ willingness to participate in brand communities. This study enriches the literature on brand community participation and has implications for companies that aim to utilize brand communities for marketing.

"Water scenarios in the Gaza Strip, Palestine: Thirst, hunger and disease","This paper examines the interacting problems which govern poor access to quality drinking water, as well as the related problems of solid waste treatment and recycling. The need for a stable political resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict is paramount. Although long-term solutions to the crisis require a regional political solution, there are several local activities that can reduce the degradation of water supplies and larger eco-systems. These include desalination of seawater and brackish water, water import and domestic water filtration units. The big problem is to allow the groundwater aquifer to recharge over time. Other problems - all caused by the unresolved conflict - are unemployment, land degradation, agriculture limitation, smuggling of pesticides and fertilisers, absence of monitoring and licensing, and the collapse of the political system. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
Foreign Economic Priorities for the Development of Agro-Food Enterprises in European Integration Business Partnership,"Agro-food production is a source of the national food security, the basis for increasing its export potential, meeting domestic demand for agricultural products and food. The relevance of the subject under study is that Ukraine is currently developing the European vector of foreign economic activity. The purpose of this study is to substantiate a set of indicators used to assess the export potential of agro-food enterprises in the European integration business partnership both qualitatively and quantitatively. The authors used general scientific methods (analysis, synthesis), integrated approach, model of the hierarchy of factors influencing the integration business environment on the export potential of enterprises. Permissible tariff quotas for the volume of duty-free exports of crop products, livestock, and processed goods for Ukraine have been allocated. The volume of concentration of production of export-oriented agricultural crops in the enterprises of agro-food production of Ukraine was analysed. It was established that the bulk of agro-food exports are agricultural raw materials, including cereals and oilseeds, vegetable (sunflower) oil. The study estimated the efficiency of corn exports on average per agro-food enterprise in Ukraine under the conditions of currency risks. It was determined that in 2020 the total export costs for 1 tonne amounted to 186.18 USD. Furthermore, it was found that the profit received as a result of export activity for 1 tonne was 76.90 USD. The authors identified the parameters of the regression equation and their estimation in the dependence model of Ukrainian internal prices on export prices for agro-food products on the world market. The gravitational model of the integrated level of the export potential of Ukrainian agro-food enterprises was proposed to stimulate foreign trade on the world market and ensure a stable business partnership with European Union member states. © The Author(s).

Do sustainable banking practices enhance the sustainability performance of banking institutions? Direct and indirect effects,"Purpose: There is a dearth of empirical research examining the influence of various facets of sustainable banking on the environmental sustainability performance (SP) of banks in developing economies like Bangladesh. This study looks at how green banking practices (GBPs), green finance (GF) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices affect SP in both direct and indirect ways. Design/methodology/approach: The research framework of this study was designed based on legitimacy theory to examine the direct and indirect impacts of GBP on environmental SP through GF and CSR practices. Based on a structured questionnaire and convenience sampling, the data were collected from banking institutions to investigate the association among the study variables. Subsequently, the obtained data were evaluated using a well-established structural equation modeling (SEM) approach via SmartPls 4.0 software. Findings: The empirical findings reveal that GBP has a significant direct impact on GF, CSR practices and the banks' SP. Further, the findings show that GF has a direct and significant impact on CSR practices and SP. Likewise, CSR practices have a direct and significant influence on the SP of banks. Additionally, among indirect effects, both CSR practices and GF mediate the association between GBP and SP, whereas GF also has an indirect effect on the relationship between GBP and CSR practices. Surprisingly, the findings demonstrate that CSR practices do not have an indirect effect on the association between GF and SP. Hence, the greater the bank's involvement in green banking activities, the greater the influence of green financing and CSR practices on environmental sustainability. Originality/value: This study adds to the growing body of research in the areas of sustainable banking and environmental sustainability literature by evaluating the link between GBP, CSR practices, GF and SP. Besides, this is a ground-breaking study that examines both direct and indirect effects of different aspects of sustainable banking (GBP, GF and CSR practices) on the SP of the banking industry in an emerging country like Bangladesh. On the theoretical level, it adds to the application and expansion of legitimacy theory in the sphere of banking and finance. It provides new insights into the dynamics of green banking, GF and CSR practices within the framework of legitimacy theory. Hence, the current study offers significant suggestions to managers, academicians and researchers on how to advance the sustainability of the banking industry by adopting green banking, GF and CSR practices. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable development assessment from a capitals perspective: Analytical structure and indicator selection criteria,"Sustainable development assessment has been conducted considering its various dimensions, such as environmental, social, cultural and economic. In this paper, the representation of such dimensions is undertaken from the perspective of the natural, social and built capitals. These dimensions are usually represented by indicators, indexes and systems of indicators, but their abundance in the technical and scientific literatures without adequate analytical structures can impair assessment quality and speed. This study aimed to propose a structure for sustainable development assessment whereby key aspects and indicators can be identified, prioritised and meaningfully used from the perspective of sustainable development capitals. Content analysis of selected international papers and technical reports was undertaken to identify relevant analysis elements and their hierarchical order. This has led to a four-tier framework composed of three capitals, seven categories, 19 subcategories and 52 attributes, each of which can be measured with the aid of one or more locally relevant indicator(s) in the context of sustainable development assessment. Selection criteria for such indicators were compiled from the literature and are presented in terms of their political, management, data quality and economic relevance. This study may contribute to the development and refinement of structured sustainable development indicator systems with less analytical ambiguity, overlapping and gaps, and hence improve the representativeness of future assessment efforts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Approaches between the quality of democracy and Sustainable Development,"Democracy is a set of values in constant improvement that depends on full popular participation to succeed. Equally, Sustainable Development, as it addresses conflicting agendas, has the exercise of citizenship as one of its foundations, so that it enters the governmental agenda and is translated into public policies. Based on these premises, through a qualitative, bibliographic, and documentary research, we sought to identify associations between the quality of democracy and the proximity of a country to the Sustainable Development paradigm. It was evident, from the academic literature, documents, and data crossing, that both concepts are related, with strengthened democracy being an important tool for promoting and consolidating genuinely Sustainable Development. © 2021 Universidade Federal do Parana.

"Analysis of agents, inputs and processes linked to the wastewater treatment plant by septic tank followed by constructed wetland for rural communities","Literature data show the precariousness of access to basic sanitation services, especially in relation to sanitary sewage. Almost half of the Brazilian rural population discharges its effluents through rudimentary septic tanks, which contaminate the environment and generate public health problems. An alternative to minimize the negative impacts of wastewater disposal without prior treatment is the use of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) by a septic tank followed by a constructed wetland (ST+CW). The main objective of this work is to look into the costs and possible bottlenecks associated with the implementation, operation and maintenance of WWTP by ST+CW for rural communities, as well as the legal and normative aspects associated with the decentralized rural sewage service in Brazil. Therefore, a literature review was carried out based on exploratory research on the WWTP decentralized by ST+CW in a cluster under the variables: functioning, community characteristics, institutional implementation arrangements, legal and normative aspects, costs and financing. The present study shows that, although the WWTP by ST+CW is a low-cost solution, it is necessary to consider the bottlenecks associated with the provision of the service, in addition to the need for public policies and to discuss regulatory aspects aimed at the expansion of decentralized and efficient. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

Navigating the transition to sustainable bioenergy in Sweden and Brazil: Lessons learned in a European and International context,"This paper uses a socio-technical approach to explore why the transition towards modern bioenergy has achieved success in some segments and/or countries but not in others. We reflect on the availability of initial socio-technical resources in the form of established platforms, policy motivations, and the roles of different stakeholders. We analyse how socio-technical networks evolved over time in response to enabling policies and interest groups as well as opposition groups in four different bioenergy segments: solid biomass for district heating in Sweden, charcoal for iron and steel industry in Brazil, and ethanol for transport in both countries. The Swedish and Brazilian experiences illustrate the importance of coordinating policies between local and national levels and across sectors in order to advance modern bioenergy platforms. The focus on Sweden - an EU and global bioenergy pioneer - along with Brazil - a recognised global biofuels leader - helps to illustrate the linkages to regional and global markets that are important for European energy transitions. The analysis also emphasizes the need to look beyond the energy sector, considering actors and stakeholders' interests at large, as well as broad boundaries for socio-technical regimes. Our analysis draws on the established literature concerning socio-technical transitions, innovation systems and systems approaches. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Competition for foundation patronage and the differential effects of prestige on the grant market success of social movement organisations,"Extant models of the financial patronage of Social Movement Organisations (SMOs) by private foundations exclusively use population density to account for competition. However, density fails to reveal how SMOs win grants whilst neglecting the strategic decision-making of foundation-investors. Here I recast patronage as a mutualistic network represented by a dynamic bipartite graph wherein SMOs and foundations cooperate across class whilst SMOs compete within class for financial support. A SMO's competitiveness rests with its position in a network-based prestige hierarchy and a foundation's propensity to invest is mediated by its structural position within the grant market. While previous research has predicted a positive monotonic relationship between status and patronage, using Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models I find a tendency for status-based disassortativity in the mutualistic system such that high-status foundations prefer to invest in low-status SMOs. I attribute this counterintuitive finding to foundations' preferences for grantees that can innovate around social problems. Relative to their peripheral counterparts, well-funded SMOs may suffer a rigidity of goals due to the risk of alienating an existing support-base through organisational change. Data consist of 3261 grants given from 2003 to 2007 by 136 private foundations to 66 professional SMOs with nonprofit status loosely mobilised against the notion of anthropogenic climate change. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Bioprospecting: Enhancing the value of biodiversity and intellectual property,"Biodiversity is the fundamental resource for bioprospecting. The three phases of bioprospecting include collection, analysis, and commercialization. Bioprospecting can also include the collection of traditional knowledge relating to the use of genetic resources from local communities. Sharing the benefits of commercialization with the country of genetic resource has to be ensured in bioprospecting. Also where indigenous knowledge is used in development and commercialization of a product, benefit sharing with local communities is imperative. When the resource or traditional knowledge is used for commercialization and benefits not shared with the concerned parties, it leads to biopiracy. Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), creation of Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL), intellectual property rights, and bioprospecting policy are some of the ways to ensure that bioprospecting is done in a sustainable and ethical manner and results in fair benefits for the country and local people from whom the genetic resources are prospected. With increasing awareness and formulation of policies by various nations, bioprospecting has become more difficult for private companies, and the bioprospecting research has been scaled down partly because the exchange of genetic materials has become highly regulated and benefit sharing quite complex. Considerable bioprospecting research has shifted to academic and research institutions. It should be ensured by policymakers in all nations that regulation of exchange of genetic resources and traditional knowledge as well as benefit sharing should be such that they should not come in the way of welfare of mankind as a whole. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2015.",Not About Sufficiency
Pesticide contamination and human health risk factor,"The use of pesticide has become an integral part of modern agricultural practices. Majority of pesticides applied in agriculture are not target specific and during their application they also affect non-target organisms. Repetitive use of pesticide leads to loss of biodiversity. Continuous and non-judicious use of pesticide has leads to increase pesticide contamination in the environment. It is associated with various ecological and health problems. It leads to over three million poisoning cases annually and up to 220,000 deaths, primarily in emerging countries. Pesticides may present instantaneous danger to the user if applied inadequately or without appropriate knowledge of their toxic effects. Occupational exposure to pesticides repeatedly occurs in the case of agricultural workers in open fields and greenhouses, workers in the pesticide industry, and exterminators of house pests. Some are highly toxic and may cause serious illness and even death if spilled on the skin, inhaled, or otherwise used imprecisely. Potential future hazards to human health can be created by pesticide residues that may cause accumulation in the food chain and widespread contamination of the environment. Acute and chronic effect of pesticide contamination cause various carcinogenic, oncogenic, genotoxic and teratogenic effect on the human being. This chapter explores the different types of pesticide, their mode of action, various ways through which pesticide enters our environment (soil, air and water) lead to pesticide contamination. We also learn about the way that how pesticides enters the human body and causes various health effects and also discuss about their future perspectives. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the appropriate grassroots technological innovation for sustainable development,"Grassroots technological innovation (GRTI) is perceived as a source of sustainable development while addressing local problems and needs of people belonging to the bottom of the economic pyramid.

"Genetically Modified Crops in India: Politics, Policies, and Political Economy","The proposed chapter will explore Genetically Modified crops in India in terms of its narrative, state policies, and its political economy. The discourse analysis of the policies on agribiotechnology and GM crop regulation will illuminate its imperative in terms of agrarian, environmental, legal, and development aspects. Agribiotech has been subject of opposite and extreme reaction evoking ardent reinforcement from its jubilant supporters on one hand, to the demand of complete ban by its vehement critics on the other hand. What explains the entailing of complex cultural, ethical, political-economic question on its use in agriculture, generating adverse public reactions from different corners? Why all the debates on the topics are framed in the semantics of extremes? Agricultural policies are shaped by the constant interaction between the state institutions, techno-scientific establishments, and agribusiness industry. A closer study of the prevailing policies will allow to explore the possibilities and opportunities that agribiotech could offer to a developing country like India. Equally important will be to ensure that such agricultural interventions should be juxtaposed against the interest of marginal fragile farmers who are in majority in India. The trade-off of farmers rights, particularly in context of sinister deployment of technology such as Genetic Use Restriction Technology (GURT) are highly questionable and therefore has been rejected by India. Such application of biotech will not only smothers the democratic spaces of the vast farming communities but will aid the consolidation of monopoly over food and farming by global agribusiness. However, the real challenge lies in exploring the ways and means to creatively engage with the discourse of GM crops in order to take advantage of such emerging technologies for the benefit of the masses. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Oxygenated graphitic carbon nitride based electrochemical sensor for dibenzofuran detection,"Dibenzofuran (DBF) is one of the carcinogenic species which is stamped among the ‘pollutants of concern’ by international environmental protection agencies. This tenacious Persistent, Bioaccumulate and Toxic (PBT) compound is generated as a result of industrial effluents, agricultural wastes, aqueous chlorination and by-products of various pharmaceutical processes. Prolonged exposure to DBF results in significant degradation of environment quality and human health, as it has a slower decomposition capability. Furthermore, there are no relevant technologies in the market which can efficiently detect the presence of DBF due to which numerous human lives are being lost because of its after-effects/complications. Thus, the development of an efficient sensor platform for the trace quantification of this highly toxic species is essential and of utmost requirement which then is the novelty of this work. The current study is focused on the development of an electroanalytical sensing platform, based on oxygenated graphitic carbon nitride (O-gCN) nanostructures, for the detection of DBF in water. The electroanalytical activity of O-gCN is studied using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). The developed sensor exhibited a Limit of Detection (LoD) of 1.58 pM, and is found to be selective in the presence of interferants with shelf life of 50 days; thereby demonstrating a huge potential to be translated towards on-field applications. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency

Design Retrospective time-series study. Setting Oxford City (postcode areas OX1-OX4), UK. Participants Adult population living within the postcode areas OX1-OX4 in Oxford, UK from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2021. Primary and secondary outcome measures Hourly NO 2, PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations and meteorological data for the period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2020 were analysed and used as exposures. We used Poisson linear regression analysis to identify independent associations between air pollutant concentrations and asthma admissions rate among the adult study population, using both single (NO 2, PM 2.5, PM 10) and multipollutant (NO 2 and PM 2.5, NO 2 and PM 10) models, where they adjustment for temperature and relative humidity. Results The overall 5-year average asthma admissions rate was 78 per 100 000 population during the study period. The annual average rate decreased to 46 per 100 000 population during 2020 (incidence rate ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.81, p<0.001) compared to the prepandemic years (2015-2019). In single-pollutant analysis, we observed a significantly increased risk of asthma admission associated with each 1 μg/m 3 increase in monthly concentrations of NO 2 4% (95% CI 1.009% to 1.072%), PM 2.5 3% (95% CI 1.006% to 1.052%) and PM 10 1.8% (95% CI 0.999% to 1.038%). However, in the multipollutant regression model, the effect of each individual pollutant was attenuated. Conclusions Ambient NO 2 and PM 2.5 air pollution exposure increased the risk of asthma admissions in this urban setting. Improvements in air quality during COVID-19 lockdown periods may have contributed to a substantially reduced acute asthma disease burden. Large-scale measures to improve air quality have potential to protect vulnerable people living with chronic asthma in urban areas. © 2024 BMJ Publishing Group.

Medicinal Plants and Primary Health Care: The Role of Gender,"This article aims to uncover gender roles in utilisation and management of medicinal plants for primary health care and community well-being. Men (n = 237) and women (n = 242) from 27 villages with a high concentration of indigenous peoples from central India were included in the study. Methods of mental mapping, process documentation, participatory rural appraisal and focused group discussion were employed to collect data. The results demonstrate that both rural men and women have a wealth of traditional knowledge relating to medicinal uses of plants. They are also aware of interconnections between their well-being and the sustainable use of medicinal plants. Gender role analysis in relation to medicinal plants revealed that the collection, processing, storage and utilisation of medicinal plants are largely assigned to women. Similarly, responsibility of transfer of this knowledge to the future generation is women's domain. However, due to increased recognition of ayurvedic medicine, development of organised markets for medicinal plants, and acute poverty and illiteracy among rural people, sustainable utilisation of medicinal plants are threatened. The findings indicate need to recognise gender roles and incorporate indigenous knowledge, for sustainable medicinal plants management through their involvement in decision-making institutions. © 2005, Sage Publications India Pvt.

"Are cascade reservoir systems sustainable agroecosystems? A comparative assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and resource footprint in a Sri Lankan micro-cascade","CONTEXT: Sri Lankan village tank cascades have been classified as a globally important agricultural heritage system (GIAHS) in 2018.Yet, a systematic benchmark of the performance and sustainability of these systems has not taken place to date. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the efficiency, effectiveness and resource footprint of village tank cascade systems with a view towards assessing the resilience of the system as a key contributor to the food production in Sri Lanka, by comparing the above parameters in a selected cascade system at two time points. METHODS: The land uses at two time points, i.e. 1920 and 2020, were studied using historical, primary and secondary data. The study site was Mahakanumulla-Ulagalla village tank cascade located in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Primary data were collected from the site including social, economic, hydrological and ecological parameters. Landscape mapping was conducted and eight parameters under efficiency, effectiveness and resource footprint were calculated and analyzed using collected data for the two time points to compare the cascade status. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The study finds that the structural balance of the cascade system in terms of the ratio between catchment forest, water surface and command area of 5:1:1 has changed to 1:2:1 over a 100 years' period, displaying a clear deterioration. From 1920 to 2020, the agricultural water productivity has increased from 0.65 kg per m3 to 0.81 kg per m3 in the upstream and in the downstream it has increased from 0.65 kg per m3 to 1.00 kg per m3. However, relative to the increase in land productivity (i.e. 2050 kgha−1 to 2962 kgha−1 in the upstream and 2050 kgha−1 to 3009 kgha−1 in the downstream) during the same period, the increase in water productivity has been low. The irrigation water demand has risen from 0.21 million m3 to 0.22 million m3 in the upstream and from 0.28 million m3 to 0.32 million m3 in the downstream. However, the ratio of cascade components has changed causing ecological imbalance in the system with the expansion of home gardens and farm lands. SIGNIFICANCE: Except for water and land productivity, this study reveals a negative trend in parameters of efficiency, effectiveness and resource footprint between the two time points of comparison, which emphasizes the need for restoring the sustainability. We consider the structural balance and ecological sustainability as key factors in managing and restoring comparable village tank cascade systems. In particular, we highlight that this historically sustainable system may not be able to function sustainably today. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Economic growth and environmental sustainability: The role of foreign direct investment and technological innovation on carbon emissions in Ghana,"Debates on foreign direct investment, technological innovation and carbon emission seem unsettling in the literature. We contribute to the literature by investigating the relationships between foreign direct investment, technological innovation, and carbon emissions in Ghana. Using the Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) method, the analysis reveals that foreign direct investment contributes to reduced emissions in the short run but significantly increases carbon emissions in the long run, aligning with the pollution haven hypothesis. This indicates that Ghana may have a robust environmental regulation that ensures eco-friendly foreign direct investments in the short run, with weak enforcement of regulations resulting in high emissions in the long term. Technological innovation in the Ghanaian context contributes to increased CO2 emissions. However, the interaction effect of foreign direct investments and technological innovation reduces carbon emissions, emphasizing the importance of aligning foreign investments with sustainable technological advancements in Ghana. The study also identifies the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) effect, where emissions rise with economic growth but decelerate at higher GDP levels. The findings underscore the need for stronger environmental regulations and a shift towards sustainable, cleaner energy and technological development to mitigate the environmental impacts of economic growth in Ghana and similar developing countries. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Seed producer cooperatives in the Ethiopian seed sector and their role in seed supply improvement: A review,"The role of seed producer cooperatives (SPCs) in the Ethiopian seed sector and their contribution to seed supply improvement have received attention from researchers, policymakers, and development partners. However, limited work has been done in reviewing and documenting their involvement in the seed sector development. In this paper, we review and discuss the SPCs in the Ethiopian seed sector. Specifically, we reflect on the contribution of SPCs to improving seed availability and access in the country. The current liberal market system of Ethiopia creates new opportunities for growth as successful enterprises, but also brings new challenges, such as more intense competition for smallholder producers. The government policy encourages SPCs to engage in seed business. We draw on scientific literature, reports, white papers, project documents, and websites. The review reveals that the seed sector in Ethiopia consists of three seed systems: formal, informal, and intermediary seed systems. Each seed system has a specific contribution to the delivery of seed to farmers, but they vary in their approach and respective strategies. The SPCs are categorized in the intermediary seed system because they have features of both formal and informal seed systems. They play a key role in meeting seed demand and contribute greatly to seed supply improvement through high-volume production of seed, crop, and variety diversification, and seed delivery to farmers. They produce and market the seed through various market channels, including direct sales to farmers, sales through contractual agreement, and sales directly to institutional buyers. Their contribution to improving the seed supply and seed security has received considerable recognition by policymakers and development practitioners. Therefore, government and development partners should support and strengthen SPCs to maximize their success in the seed business and their contribution to improving the seed supply in Ethiopia. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © 2017 Dawit Tsegaye Sisay, Frans J.

Fluorographite-co-polydimethylsiloxane coated polyvinylidene-fluoride membrane for desalination of highly saline water with humic acid in direct contact membrane distillation,"Membranes with amphiphobic properties are crucial for desalination of concentrated saline water with organic foulant by membrane distillation. In this research, we coated Fluorographite (FGi) particles on polyvinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) flat sheet membranes with 0.8% v/v polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as binder by filtration coating method. We evaluated its amphiphobicity via contact angles which were observed by DI water, canola oil and organic solutions as mimicking for oleophobicity. Surface modifications by FGi particles on the surface of membranes was introduced with PDMS binder which brought bifunctionality of amphiphobicity to enhance hydrophobicity and oleophobicity. We also investigated performance of coated membranes in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) with 1 molar concentrated NaCl solution along with humic acid being organic foulant and compared with virgin membrane (M1 membrane) and Liquid entry pressure (LEP) was also evaluated. LEP was measured by dynamic method which shown considerable improvement in coated membranes. M3 membrane showed overall better performance in terms of salt rejection higher than 99.87% and flux as compared to M1 membrane. Furthermore, the evaluation of surface characterizations was done by FESEM with EDX, AFM and FTIR. Surface morphology confirmed the coating of FGi on membrane surface while EDX evidenced increase in atomic percent of fluorine in turn F:C ratio. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
A renewed framework for urban biodiversity governance: Urban pigeons as a case-study,"In a globally urbanizing world, interactions between individuals and nature are progressively decreasing. In this context, it is not uncommon that the presence of some remaining animal species in cities causes problems to urban citizens and results in conflicts among stakeholders. Here, we propose a novel vision of the relations between urban citizens, local authorities and urban nature, taking the example of urban pigeons. We combined ecological and sociological concepts as well as data to propose a new working framework to build an integrative governance of urban nature. We showed how effective it is to change the focus on elements of nature only by including the interrelations between humans and nature. We highlighted the importance of institutional messages when dealing with biodiversity issues. We conclude by calling for a holistic vision in the implementation of policy on urban nature. © NSS-Dialogues, EDP Sciences 2018.",Not About Sufficiency
Mapping the unjust global distribution of harmful fisheries subsidies,"Harmful fisheries subsidies contribute to overfishing leading to environmental and societal impacts. If only fisheries and ecosystems within the subsidising nations’ jurisdiction were affected, then unilateral actions might be sufficient to help safeguard our ocean and the people reliant upon it. However, just as fish move between jurisdictions, so too do the subsidised fishing fleets that target them. As such, the impacts and solutions to subsidies-induced overfishing are often matters of international concern. Mapping the distribution and flows of harmful subsidies is therefore key to understanding these concerns, informing multilateral reform, and empowering impacted nations to strengthen the terms of access to their waters and resources. Here we quantify the amount of harmful fisheries subsidies that supports fishing in the high seas, domestic and foreign waters. We estimate that between 20% and 37% of all harmful fisheries subsidies support fishing in foreign waters or the high seas, that is outside the jurisdictions of the subsidising nations. We show that harmful subsidies primarily originate from nations with high-Human Development Index (HDI), strong fisheries management capacity and relatively sustainable fish stocks, yet disproportionately impact nations with low or very low-HDI, lower management capacity and more vulnerable fish stocks—40% of the harmful subsidies that support fishing in very low-HDI nations waters originate from high-HDI and very-high HDI nations. We show that Asia, Europe, and North America, are net subsidy sources; they provide more harmful subsidies to their fishing fleets than their respective ecosystems are impacted by; while Africa, South, Central America and Caribbean, and Oceania are net subsidy-sinks. This discrepancy between the source of harmful subsidies and the nations that are ultimately impacted is unsustainable and unjust. Prohibiting all harmful subsidies to distant-water fishing and fishing in the high seas—with narrow exceptions for Small Island Developing States—should be prioritised to support the advancement of sustainable and equitable fisheries worldwide. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The cost and distribution of forest conservation for national emissions reductions,"Tropical forest conservation for carbon-emission reductions (REDD+) has historically been implemented in a highly localized, directed manner, which is quickly proving unamenable to the transition towards national-scale REDD+ implementation. National REDD+ forest conservation schemes would arguably ideally adopt more spatially dispersed, voluntary and, presumably, cost-efficient modes. Yet the actual benefit of doing so is uncertain, and the prospect of a renewed reliance on familiar, localized conservation schemes cannot be discounted. An ill-designed scheme threatens costly emission reductions and, ultimately, reduced commitments to emission reductions. Here, we integrate spatial projections of forest conversion and degradation with detailed field surveys of land-use revenues to model the cost efficiency of national conservation in Panama corresponding to three emission-reduction schemes: (i) disperse conservation amenable to voluntary, incentivised landholder participation, (ii) locally-concentrated, implicitly exogenous conservation interventions, and (iii) a middle-ground between these two. Each scheme meets national emission-reduction targets (ERTs) of 5–50% of business-as-usual emissions with minimal real land-use opportunity costs accounting for the uncertainties of land-use change. Real absolute opportunity costs are $4–$62 million for a 10% ERT and 20-year horizon but tend towards the lower quarter of this range. These costs are less than previously estimated and more amenable to current REDD+ funding levels, albeit still apparently a challenge to offset given available REDD+ funding and forest carbon-emission rates. While disperse conservation is invariably most economical according to our models, opportunity costs and efficiencies amongst schemes are relatively comparable for ERTs of ≤15%. This suggests that a continued reliance on REDD+ ‘projects’ during early REDD+ implementation may not entail undue inefficiencies. At ERTs of >15%, opportunity costs increase more rapidly than cost efficiencies decrease, albeit less markedly for the disperse conservation scheme, recommending it for intermediate ERTs. Avoided forest degradation underpins emission-reduction efficiencies, particularly for disperse schemes and at lower ERTs, where it accounts for slightly over ∼50% of avoided emissions. Still, conservation schemes preempt forest degradation less often than expected, considering its low economic value and large national extent, highlighting practical limits to efficient ‘spatial targeting’ of specific agricultural systems. Modelled REDD+ conservation occurs disproportionately in indigenous territories, where opportunity costs are low. Hence most projected forest change / land use in indigenous territories is incorporated within conservation schemes by the 20% ERT. This highlights potential equity issues for least-cost conservation as well as the importance of Amerindian participation in national REDD+ schemes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Development of fishery indicators for local management initiatives - A case study for Plettenberg Bay, South Africa","In attempts to achieve sustainability, ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management are becoming increasingly applicable. Indicators to assess the success of management measures are an important component of this approach. Data from a recreational linefishery are used to develop and propose a simple set of indicators to assess local fishery sustainability. The indicators have been organised within a framework based on the ecological, institutional and social sustainability domains and scored through a rapid assessment matrix. Results indicate that the estuarine, rock-and-surf (coastal) and skiboat-based fisheries in Plettenberg Bay on the south coast of South Africa are presently non-sustainable. The institutional domain had very low scores whereas the socio-economic domain had the highest scores. The validity and usefulness of the indicators as a tool for the development of local fishery management plans are discussed. Copyright © NISC Pty Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Adaptive participation in forest planning contingent on a hypothetical large-scale forest disturbance,"Public involvement in management decisions is a vital requirement for successful adaptive forest management. I suggest that a critical and systematic examination is needed to understand why various publics become involved in forest-related management decisions and, more importantly, how public involvement in forest planning is likely to change under altered biophysical and social conditions caused by large-scale forest disturbances such as invasive species outbreaks. I address this need through a field-based stated preference experiment administered to three communities located near national forests within the eastern United States. I specifically examine three reasons that might compel individuals to become involved in forest planning: the loss of forest-related jobs, the loss of recreational amenities, and the loss of wildlife habitat and also examine the effects of gender on contingent behavior. The data suggest that all three potential losses have significant effects on individuals' behavioral intentions to participate in forest planning. The potential loss of wildlife habitat had the strongest influence on individuals' behavioral intentions. The potential loss of local forest-related jobs and recreational amenities had slightly less influence. Behavioral intentions to participate in forest planning also differed significantly by gender. The results suggest that changes in biophysical and social systems due to large-scale forest disturbances have the potential to dramatically alter public participation in environmental decisionmaking processes. Various factors, including the system properties likely to be affected, the extent to which those properties are affected, and the gender of potential participants, are likely to be key variables that result in new patterns of involvement in forest planning and management decisions. © 2013 by the Society of American Foresters.",Not About Sufficiency
Global climate justice activism: “the new protagonists” and their projects for a just transition,"The contributors to this volume have provided ample evidence to support calls for fundamental, transformative change in the world-system. If there remained any doubts, their analyses show that the capitalist world-system threatens not only the well-being of a majority of the world's people but also the very survival of our planet. Indeed, the urgency of the ecological and economic conditions that many people now face and the immense inequalities that have become more entrenched require that scholars become more consciously engaged in the work of advancing social transformation. Revolutionary change is emergent in movement spaces where people have long been working to develop shared analyses and cultivate collective power and agency by building unity among a diverse array of activists, organizations, and movements. We discuss three examples of transformative projects that are gaining increased visibility and attention: food sovereignty, solidarity economies, and Human Rights Communities. If widely adopted, these projects would undermine the basic processes necessary for the capitalist world-system to function. With these projects, defenders of environmental and social justice not only work to prevent their own (further) dispossession by denying capital its ability to continue appropriating labor and resources from working people and communities, but they also help deepen the existing systemic crisis while sowing the seeds of a new social order. © The Author(s) 2019.",Not About Sufficiency
Determining whether Public Communications Campaigns Based on the The Social Norms Approach are a Viable COVID-19 Prevention Strategy for College Campuses,"The purpose of this study is to (a) outline the formative steps that universities can follow to determine if a media campaign based on the social norms approach (SNA) is a viable method for increasing COVID-19 prevention behaviors among their students, (b) present formative research data collected at a large public land-grant university in the U.S., and (c) as a test case, apply that data to assess the SNA’s viability for promoting COVID-19 prevention behaviors among students at that institution. Over time, a series of fast-track surveys were conducted to determine the descriptive and injunctive norms for four COVID-19 prevention strategies: wearing a mask in public, physical distancing, limiting the size of indoor gatherings, and receiving or planning to get a vaccination. The results demonstrated that, at this particular university, an SNA-based public communications campaign would be a promising strategy for promoting these protective behaviors. First, a clear majority of the survey respondents reported engaging in the behaviors. Second, the respondents perceived the behaviors to be less common than was actually the case, with one exception: wearing a mask. In all four cases, they perceived the behaviors to be less approved of than what the surveys documented. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency

The impacts of corruption on forest loss: A review of cross-national trends,"This research lays out the debates and contradictory findings regarding the impacts of corruption on forest loss in a cross-national context, specifically in low- and middle-income nations. After, I describe how these inconsistent findings may be due to difficulties in untangling the complexities of corruption definitionally and then operationalizing it in a cross-national context. Then, I review the advances in corruption data collection and measurement. Finally, I discuss how these developments in data collection and operationalization have led to an expansion of research on corruption to other aspects of governance, bringing forward several avenues for future research, but also potentially conflating definitions of corruption with governance. Overall, I aim to capture how scholars are studying corruption and forest loss from a cross-national context and what their findings tell us. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Government Subsidy, Green Credit, Carbon Information Disclosure and the moderation effect of Ownership Property: Evidence from Chinese Listed Agriculture-Related Firms","From the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement Protocol, carbon information disclosure has gone from being a theoretical concept to an essential component of carbon trading and management. As agriculture is the second largest source of carbon emissions, the management and disclosure of carbon information of agricultural enterprises cannot be ignored. This paper collected carbon information disclosure data of Chinese agriculture-related enterprises during the eight years from 2012 to 2019,and measured the quality of carbon information disclosure by using content analysis and index method. The impact of government subsidies and green credits on the quality of carbon information disclosure and the moderating effect of ownership property were empirically explored. The results show that both government subsidies and green credits have favorable effects on the quality of carbon information disclosure. Government subsidies and carbon information disclosure quality are negatively moderated by ownership property, while green credit and carbon information disclosure quality are positively moderated by ownership property. This study fills a research gap in agricultural carbon information disclosure, expanding the study of the theory of carbon information disclosure and inventing the research subject. The results of this study may contribute to the development of more effective rules and policies to support agriculture-related firms to improve the quality of carbon information disclosure, and they may also be of interest to stakeholders such as banks and government policy makers. © 2023, Success Culture Press.

The tragedy of the inland lakes,"Increased pressure on communal fishing grounds is testing the traditional regulations among fishing communities who should preserve inland waters’ productive capacity and ecological values. Inland lakes in Benin are a typical case in point. With the mounting number of fisherfolk and pollution from densely populated urban areas the threat of overfishing and water degradation looms large. This paper questions whether customary rules of fishing communities can cope with current and future challenges. A survey among 839 fisherfolk found that agreements to control shared waters are virtually absent and remain unmonitored while mistrust and loss of faith in community members and government institutions result in low levels of organization. It is alarming to note the high incidence of conflicts that end violently, the prevailing food insecurity and a high illiteracy rate limiting employment to low-paid wage labour. Solutions to identified constraints go beyond the individual, requiring collective action and a platform where fishing communities can take matters into their own hands to avert a tragedy of the inland waters.

Reducing smoking at the workplace: Implementing a smoking ban and hypnotherapy,"Smoking cessation programs may be an important component in the implementation of worksite smoking policies. This study examines the impact of a smoke-free policy and the effectiveness of an accompanying hypnotherapy smoking cessation program. Participants in the 90-minute smoking cessation seminar were surveyed 12 months after the program was implemented (n = 2642; response rate = 76%). Seventy-one percent of the smokers participated in the hypnotherapy program. Fifteen percent of survey respondents quit and remained continuously abstinent. A survey to assess attitudes toward the policy was conducted 1 year after policy implementation (n = 1256; response rate = 64%). Satisfaction was especially high among those reporting high compliance with the policy. These results suggest that hypnotherapy may be an attractive alternative smoking cessation method, particularly when used in conjunction with a smoke-free worksite policy that offers added incentive for smokers to think about quitting. © 1995, The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.",Not About Sufficiency
"Distributional justice, effectiveness, and costs of current and alternative solar PV incentive schemes in Switzerland","Like many other countries, Switzerland offers various incentives to promote residential solar PV, but not all households have equal access to them. Using a microsimulation approach based on merged data from the Swiss Household Budget Survey and Household Energy Demand Survey, we evaluate the current Swiss incentive scheme in terms of how equally the internal rates of return of PV installations, the amounts of obtainable incentives, and the saving months to accumulate the investment are distributed across households. The current, regionally heterogeneous scheme is then compared with alternative, nationally uniform designs based on the required public spending, effectiveness in promoting profitable and affordable PV, and distributional equality. The current scheme leads to a large disparity in the economic profitability of installations and incentive amounts obtainable across various socio-demographics. Larger, the highest-income, and rural households can obtain more incentives and install more profitable PV systems. Lower-income households must save the longest to install PV. Incentive schemes with a nationally uniform investment grant or a feed-in tariff threshold could offer a good alternative to the current scheme in terms of justice, public spending, and effectiveness. The insights on heterogeneous versus uniform PV incentives and the developed methodology could be transferred elsewhere. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the adoption rates of improved technology in traditional poultry farming: Evidence from rural Togo,"The adoption of improved agricultural technologies is known to significantly improve incomes, create more wealth, alleviate poverty and contribute to rural development in many developing countries. The Government of Togo, through the National Programme for Agricultural Investment and Food Security (PNIASAN) and the Agricultural Sector Support Project (PASA), and with financial support from the World Bank and help from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), provides assistance to smallholder farmers in improved technology adoption in traditional poultry farming (ITTPF) for wealth creation, food security and poverty alleviation. However, for any technology or emerging agricultural practices, awareness and exposure are necessary conditions for their adoption. And because these two factors are not distributed randomly in the population of potential adopters, not taking them into account will lead to estimates of population adoption rates that are not informative of the true demand for the technology, and to inconsistent estimates of the parameters of the adoption model. In this study, we evaluate the adoption rates of ITTPF among farmers in Togo. Data was collected from 400 farmers in 2014, prior to the introduction of ITTPF, and again five years later. This data was then analysed using inverse propensity score weighting and parametric estimation of adoption regression models. The results of the estimates indicate that the average treatment effect (ATE), which represents the mean potential adoption rate of the population, is 57%, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET), which represents the mean potential adoption rate in the exposed subpopulation, is 60%, the population mean joint exposure and adoption rate (JEA) is 13%, and the population selection bias (PSB) is 3%. The sample adoption rate (JEA) implies a population adoption gap of -47% due to a lack of exposure and adoption by a sufficient size of the population. The PSB is insignificant and indicates that all the sampled farmers had an almost equal opportunity of adopting ITTPF. The study reveals that the sample adoption rate does not consistently estimate the true population adoption rate. Hence, controlling for non-exposure and selection biases is a perquisite to acquiring consistent estimates of ITTPF adoption rates. The findings indicate a relatively high supply-demand gap for ITTPF that justifies investment in its further dissemination and adoption in Togo for optimal positive impact on potential outcomes and the welfare of farmers. © 2022,African Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics.All Rights Reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"The interplay of identity fusion, social norms, and pro-environmental behavior: an exploration using the dictator game: Identity Fusion & Environmental Decision","This research investigated how identity fusion with environmental issues interacts with social norms to shape pro-environmental behaviors, elucidating the psychological structure underlying environmental ideological engagement. Building upon a measure of identity fusion that captures both relational and doctrinal components of Zmigrod ideology framework, we found that higher identity fusion positively predicted donations to an environmental association in a Dictator Game paradigm. Importantly, results revealed an interaction between identity fusion and norm source on donation amounts. For individuals lower in environmental identity fusion, pro-environmental norms had a greater impact when originating from a source sharing their worldview (low-fused) compared to a distant group (high-fused). However, for individuals with high fusion, norm source proximity did not significantly impact donations. By illuminating this interplay between the relational and doctrinal facets of ideological thinking, this research advances understanding of the social and psychological motivators of environmental actions. These findings highlight the importance of considering identity alignment and social dynamics in fostering ecological engagement. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency

Case studies in co-benefits approaches to climate change mitigation and adaptation,"Attempts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions or manage the effects of climate change traditionally focus on management or policy options that promote single outcomes (e.g., either benefiting ecosystems or human health and well-being). In contrast, co-benefits approaches to climate change mitigation and adaptation address climate change impacts on human and ecological health in tandem and on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The article engages the concept of co-benefits through four case studies. The case studies emphasize co-benefits approaches that are accessible and tractable in countries with human populations that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. They illustrate the potential of co-benefits approaches and provide a platform for further discussion of several interdependent principles relevant to the implementation of co-benefits strategies. These principles include providing incentives across multiple scales and time frames, promoting long-term integrated impact assessment, and fostering multidimensional communication networks. © 2016 Newcastle University.",Not About Sufficiency

A feminist ethos for caring knowledge production in transdisciplinary sustainability science,"Transdisciplinary Sustainability Science has emerged as a viable answer to current sustainability crises with the aim to strengthen collaborative knowledge production. To expand its transformative potential, we argue that Transdisciplinary Sustainability Science needs to thoroughly engage with questions of unequal power relations and hierarchical scientific constructs. Drawing on the work of the feminist philosopher María Puig de la Bellacasa, we examine a feminist ethos of care which might provide useful guidance for sustainability researchers who are interested in generating critical-emancipatory knowledge. A feminist ethos of care is constituted by three interrelated modes of knowledge production: (1) thinking-with, (2) dissenting-within and (3) thinking-for. These modes of thinking and knowing enrich knowledge co-production in Transdisciplinary Sustainability Science by (i) embracing relational ontologies, (ii) relating to the ‘other than human’, (iii) cultivating caring academic cultures, (iv) taking care of non-academic research partners, (v) engaging with conflict and difference, (vi) interrogating positionalities and power relations through reflexivity, (vii) building upon marginalised knowledges via feminist standpoints and (viii) countering epistemic violence within and beyond academia. With our paper, we aim to make a specific feminist contribution to the field of Transdisciplinary Sustainability Science and emphasise its potentials to advance this field. © 2021, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Harlan’s Crops and Man: People, Plants and Their Domestication, Third Edition","A scientific and historical study of crops and their age-old relationship with human civilization The cultivation and harvesting of crops have been at the heart of human culture and development for thousands of years. As we have grown from hunter-gatherers into agrarian societies and industrial economies, our ongoing relationship with the plants that feed us and support our manufacturing has also evolved. So too, of course, have those plants themselves, with the combined forces of shifting climates, selective plant breeding, and genetic modification all working to alter their existence in profound and fascinating ways. Coming some 30 years after its previous incarnation, the third edition of Harlan’s Crops and Man marks an exciting re-examination of this rich topic. Its chapters lay out the foundations of crop diversity as we know it, covering topics that range from taxonomy and domestication to the origins of agricultural practices and their possible futures.

Empirical case study of a digitally enabled energy community with prosumers and P2P trading,"Background: An ’energy community’ can add socioeconomic components to microgrids and has recently been solidified as the regulatory concept of a ’Citizen Energy Community’ by the European Union. Such energy communities can further be supplemented with digital capabilities. This paper provides insights from a 13-month case study on a digitally enabled energy community with prosumers with limited ability to provide manual demand response, who were enabled to engage in peer-to-peer trading of local energy generation. Results: Long-term willingness to pay for local sustainable electricity in the market environment was lower than expected. Overall willingness and ability to provide manual demand response might be low. Participants’ use of the provided digital tools were at least partly driven by their desire to control energy costs. Conclusions: Repeat interaction with the energy community’s market and its inherent complexities might limit the ability of energy communities to provide technical and economic benefits. This diminishes the appeal of corresponding business models. One direction to make energy communities more attractive to regulators and utilities is the conceptualization, design, and empirical evaluation of systems that lead to low perceived complexity for participants while enabling high levels of external automated control. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency

THE ATMOSPHERIC AIR QUALITY ANALYSIS AND THE HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT FOR THE KAZAN CITY POPULATION (THE REPUBLIC OF TATARSTAN),"Monitoring of atmospheric air in the city of Kazan was performed based on average annual concentrations of the Air Pollution Observation Stations (APOS) of three administrations: The Federal Budgetary Healthcare Institution “Center of Hygiene and Epidemiology in RT (Tatarstan)” (FBHI “H&E Center in RT”), Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of RT (MEPNR of RT) and Federal State Budgetary Institution “Territorial Administration for Hydrometeorological and Environmental Monitoring in RT” (FSBI “TAHEM in RT”). Two Kazan districts with population size equal to one third of the city (the Vakhitovsky and the Sovetsky ones), where APOS of all three administrations were compactly located, were identified for the study. Control data differ in pollutants priority and quantitative estimation of certain pollutants. Non-carcinogenic risk evaluation results on chemical effluence with vehicle emissions had no discrepancies (unacceptably high total risk level in Vakhitovsky and Sovetsky city districts, HI was greater than 6.0); however, danger coefficients obtained from the data of the Federal State-Funded Healthcare Institution «Hygienic and Epidemiological Center in the Republic of Tatarstan» far exceed similar results of other agencies. Verification of the available sampling techniques and development of a single approach to analysis and evaluation of the environmental pollution by harmful substances are required for a consistent risk assessment by monitoring agencies. © 2022 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

Individual- and community-level impacts of volunteer environmental monitoring: a synthesis of peer-reviewed literature,"Citizens have long contributed to scientific research about the environment through volunteer environmental monitoring programs. Their participation has also resulted in outcomes for themselves, their communities, and the environment. This research synthesizes 35 peer-reviewed journal articles that reported such outcomes through 2012. This collection of articles was derived from a pool of 436 peer-reviewed journal articles about participatory environmental monitoring. Reported outcomes for participants and communities ranged from increasing personal knowledge and community awareness to changing attitudes and behaviors, building social capital, and ultimately, influencing change in natural resource management and policies. Mixed results were reported in regard to citizen participation in natural resource decision-making processes and in terms of participant knowledge gain. Future research recommendations that address identified knowledge gaps include the following: (1) assessing knowledge beyond the basic content of the subject of monitoring to better address the value of volunteer environmental monitoring as a public participation tool; (2) conducting independent research across programs to enable null or negative outcome reporting, understand commonalities of outcomes across programs, and make linkages between outcomes and program characteristics; (3) carrying out rigorous research that includes data collection and statistical analysis focused on the effectiveness of citizen participation in decision making; (4) assessing the time component of outcome achievement to inform the volunteer monitoring community; and (5) conducting additional research to identify changes in attitudes and behaviors, particularly geared toward minimizing losses in biodiversity and impacts of climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
The Multidimensionality of Trust: Applications in Collaborative Natural Resource Management,"Despite the long-recognized importance of trust in the natural resources management literature, few have drawn upon the breadth of other disciplines' investigations of trust to inform their work. This article represents an effort to break down the concept of trust into its component parts in an attempt to reorganize trust theory in a robust and practical way for collaborative natural resource management. We describe four forms of trust relevant to collaborative (and other forms of) natural resource management: dispositional trust, rational trust, affinitive trust, and procedural trust. By delineating different forms of trust, their antecedents, and their potential consequences for collaborative natural resource management, we aim to provide a useful and consistent lexicon and framework for use by researchers and practitioners in the human dimensions of natural resource management. © 2015, Copyright Marc J.

"The nexus between crude oil production, human development and economic growth in Cameroon (1977–2019)","This paper explores the asymmetric and symmetric influence of the human development index (HDI), economic growth, CO2 emissions and inflation on crude oil production (COP) in Cameroon from 1977 to 2019. The Zivot-Andrews and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests verified stationarity, the ARDL and NARDL models were applied to assess asymmetric and symmetric effects and finally, causality was established by the Toda-Yamamoto test. The results conclude that economic growth and CO2 emissions have a negative impact on COP in the long term, while in the short term the HDI and inflation have a positive impact. The presence of an asymmetric influence of HDI and economic growth in the short term, and an asymmetric influence of CO2 emissions and inflation on COP in the long term. A two-way connection between economic growth and COP. A unidirectional link between the HDI, CO2 emissions and inflation on COP.

Praeclariat: Theorising Precarious Labour Geographies of Solar Energy,"Rapid development of solar energy is reconfiguring global labour geographies. Beneath the formal economy of solar exists a hidden infra-economy of informal and marginalised labourers that toil in valuable yet precarious nodes of solar development (i.e. mining, generation, disposal). These labourers comprise a lumpenproletariat class (or solar lumenproletariats) that is defined by its informality, flexibility, precarity and disposability. Through political struggles and reflexivity, the lumenproletariats develop class consciousness. Although still precariously positioned in solar’s infra-economy, they develop a praeclarus (Latin: “bright”) understanding of their shared class interests and become praeclariats resisting the reproduction of solar capital. Solar praeclariats unified in class struggle can alter the exploitative relations of production and usher in a truly “just” low-carbon energy transition. © 2020 The Author.

"Climate Change and Energy Futures - Theoretical Frameworks, Epistemological Issues, and Methodological Perspectives","Critically re-imagining our energy systems is a major task for addressing climate change. Technological change or market signals do not automatically create new energy futures. Rather, political priorities and action shape the ambitions behind energy transitions. In response, this special issue is dedicated to re-thinking energy futures related to climate change, with attention to the social values and norms, hierarchical structures, and social imaginaries underlying decision-making in a carbon-constrained world. Three cross-cutting themes run across this special issue. First, the papers identify new ways of envisioning and creating low-carbon energy futures that engage a range of social actors. Second, the papers highlight the need for analyses that bridge the global and local scales. Third, this issue emphasizes the importance of dialogue across disciplinary perspectives to strengthen the role of environmental social science in decision-making and community responses to climate change and energy futures. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
"(Mis)Led by an Outsider: Abusive Supervision, Disengagement, and Silence in Politicized Bureaucracies","Employing loyal external appointees has been identified as a key strategy used by incumbents to gain control over the state bureaucracy. This phenomenon is known as politicization and has been associated with democratic backsliding. Frequently, career civil servants perceive these appointees as illegitimate outsiders, leaders whose main objective is to ensure political compliance rather than advance the organization's mission. In this study, we explore how civil servants interpret the presence of outside leaders in their organizations in the context of politicization and how this influences their job attitudes and behaviors. We use a mixed methods exploratory sequential design to examine a recent case of politicization in environmental agencies in Brazil. First, we interviewed 25 civil servants who reported an environment of abuse, fear, disengagement, and alienation due to the actions of outside leaders. We identified silence (both defensive and acquiescent) as a key outcome of this process. We extended and confirmed these findings with a quantitative study using a new sample of 255 civil servants. This second study allowed us to test the relationship between the variables identified in the qualitative analysis. Our combined findings indicate that politicization may reduce the effectiveness and capability of public agencies not only because some external appointees lack competence or a commitment the organization's mission (as suggested by previous studies), but also because their behaviors and decisions can have a significant negative impact on civil servants' job attitudes and behaviors. © 2023 The Author(s).

The degrowth alternative: A path to address our environmental crisis?,"Degrowth is a planned economic contraction in wealthy countries that reduces production and consumption—and, by extension, greenhouse gas emissions and stresses on global ecosystems—to sustainable levels within ecological limits. This book explores the idea of degrowth as an economic alternative to offer a more sustainable and just future. A growing number of scientists and scholars now recognize that a system that continues to prioritize economic growth will prevent us from effectively addressing the dual environmental crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. To establish the case for degrowth, the text opens by posing critical questions about our current system and identifying its limitations, as well as discussing the ineffectiveness of ""false solutions"" that seem to offer something new but would actually preserve the status quo. The concept of degrowth is then fully introduced along with a discussion of core principles and goals as well as major critiques and questions. The book explores what living in a degrowth society would entail and the policies needed to support degrowth. Finally, the work concludes by examining the opportunities and challenges for degrowth and a successful transition to a sustainable steady-state economy. This book provides an advanced introduction to the environmental issues around degrowth for students, scholars and activists interested in economic alternatives, sustainability and the environment. © 2021 Diana Stuart, Ryan Gunderson and Brian Petersen.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change solutions: Beyond the capital-climate contradiction,"Climate Change Solutions represents an application of critical theory to examine proposed solutions to climate change. Drawing from Marx's negative conception of ideology, the authors illustrate how ideology continues to conceal the capital-climate contradiction or the fundamental incompatibility between growth-dependent capitalism and effectively and justly mitigating climate change. Dominant solutions to climate change that offer minor changes to the current system fail to address this contradiction. However, alternatives like degrowth involve a shift in priorities and power relations and can offer new systemic arrangements that confront and move beyond the capital-climate contradiction. While there are clear barriers to a systemic transition that prioritizes social and ecological well-being, such a transition is possible and desirable. © 2020 Diana Stuart, Ryan Gunderson, and Brian Petersen.

Carbon neutralization in Yunnan: harnessing the power of forests to mitigate carbon emissions and promote sustainable development in the Southwest forest area of China,"This paper explores the concept of ""carbon peak and carbon neutrality"" and its impact on Yunnan Province, a key region in China's southwest forest area. It uses data from the National Forest Resources Inventory, biomass conversion factor method, and carbon dioxide emission measurement algorithm to estimate forest carbon sequestration and increment during nine National Forest Resources Inventory periods. The paper also compares carbon emissions to carbon absorption, revealing a gap between emissions and absorption. The paper proposes a carbon neutralization path from three levels: forest carbon sequestration supply, demand, and market. It suggests that Yunnan Province should combine the ""carbon emission reduction and carbon neutralization"" plan with the provincial circumstances, afforestation, and reforestation, reducing deforestation and forest degradation, increasing forest carbon sequestration supply, and building a database for supply information. It also accounts for carbon dioxide emissions from polluting enterprises and encourages industries to engage in forest carbon sequestration to promote Yunnan's energy structure transformation and industrial structure upgrading. The government should establish a cooperation mechanism with farmers, forestry departments, financial institutions, and carbon trading platforms to achieve carbon sequestration benefits. The study aims to advance Yunnan's efforts to reduce CDE and become emissions-free from a variety of perspectives and fields. The novelty of the study covers several factors such as forest types, carbon storage capacity, and forest management practices. Based on available information and remote sensing techniques, and examines the potential of present forest capture of carbon in the province of Yunnan. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Stepping into safety: a systematic review of extended reality technology applications in enhancing vulnerable road user safety,"Purpose: In alignment with the European Union’s Vision Zero initiative to eliminate road fatalities by 2050, leveraging technological advancements becomes crucial for addressing the challenges of vulnerable road users (VRUs), and for mitigating the impact of human error. Despite increasing scholarly interest in applications of extended reality (XR), a research gap persists, particularly in the role of XR in transportation safety. Therefore, the aim of the study was to fill this gap through a systematic literature review to evaluate comprehensively the potential scope and practical applicability of XR technologies in enhancing the safety of VRUs. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review was undertaken, following PRISMA guidelines meticulously, in which 80 relevant articles from databases, such as Scopus and Science Direct, were identified and analysed. Findings: The results of the analysis revealed the potential of XR beyond pedestrians and cyclists, and highlighted a lack of research about the impact of XR with regard to the personal traits or abilities of VRUs. The results of a thorough analysis confirmed the potential of XR as a promising solution for an approach to collaborative co-creation in addressing the safety challenges of VRUs. In addition, the integration of eye-tracking with virtual reality emerged as a promising innovation for enhancing the safety of vulnerable road users. Research limitations/implications: Theoretical implications include enhancing the understanding of applications of XR in VRUs’ safety and providing insights into future research possibilities and methodological approaches. Valuable insights into search strategies and inclusion-exclusion criteria can guide future research methodologies. Practical implications: Practically, the findings from the study offer insights to assist urban planners and transportation authorities in incorporating XR technologies effectively for VRUs safety. Identifying areas for further development of XR technology could inspire innovation and investment in solutions designed to meet the safety needs of VRUs, such as enhanced visualisation tools and immersive training simulations. Originality/value: The findings of previous research underscore the vast potential of XR technologies within the built environment, yet their utilisation remains limited in the urban transport sector. The intricacies of urban traffic scenarios pose significant challenges for VRUs, making participation in mobility studies hazardous. Hence, it is crucial to explore the scope of emerging technologies in addressing VRUs issues as a pre-requisite for establishing comprehensive safety measures. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
"Ecotourism as a paradigm shift in conservation and community livelihoods in the Southern African region: Opportunities, challenges and lessons learnt","This chapter examines ecotourism as a tool for improving conservation and communities’ livelihood in the Southern African region. The literature on ecotourism and community-based tourism in the Southern African context were reviewed and analysed thematically. The findings suggest that ecotourism in the region is in its infancy. The region has many potential attractions for ecotourism which remain untapped, particularly cultural attractions. Evidence suggests that ecotourism is instrumental in the improvement of natural and cultural conservation while also enhancing the livelihood of local communities. Elsewhere, it has also brought unintended detrimental consequences in the areas of culture and traditional economic activities. The sector is faced by challenges that range from the low capacity of local communities to exploit ecotourism opportunities, poor tourism infrastructure, low linkage with other economic sectors and inadequate governance mechanisms. By implication, ecotourism can be effective in enhancing the conservation of tourism resources and the livelihoods of the local communities. However, this can only be achieved if the region expands ecotourism to other unexplored potentials and the identified challenges are addressed through inclusive and responsible ecotourism development. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Lesego Senyana Stone, Moren Tibabo Stone, Patricia Kefilwe Mogomotsi and Goemeone E.J.

Retrospect and prospect of Geographical Sciences in China: A comparison with the Strategic Directions for Geography in the USA,"Understanding the Changing Planet: Strategic Directions for the Geographical Sciences (UCP), published by the National Research Council (USA), and its comments in The Professional Geographer propose that uppercase and plural ""Geographical Sciences"" (GS) is the strategic direction for geography in the next decade for better understanding of our rapidly changing planet. According to these comments, UCP valued technologies and tools excessively (""task""), and did not pay much attention to methodology (""discipline""). Actually, both ""task"" and ""discipline"" are geographical wings, especially in the time of ""big science"". Enlightenment from UCP and its comments is the strategic direction that should be balanced between ""task"" and ""discipline"", GS should be a three-dimensional construct of a disciplinary system, methodology, and technologies and tools, and this system should be scientific humanism based on scientific spirit and directed by humanism. During the last 60 years, Chinese geographers devoted themselves to GS, including practice and theory. Obviously progress and outlook are proposed as interdisciplinary GS, Earth Surface Sciences (ESS) and Geographical Construction (GC). The disciplinary system of GS is very complex, and is composed of such human knowledge domains as sciences, technologies, engineering, and philosophy. The main mission is to research the open, complex, and macro earth system (not only scientifically, but also humanistically), and one significant methodology is ""comprehensive integration of qualitative and quantitative means"" (CIQQM). At the same time, another changing direction in Chinese geography is Human-Economic Geography (HEG). © 2013 Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Not About Sufficiency
Drivers of global tourism carbon emissions,"Tourism has a critical role to play in global carbon emissions pathway. This study estimates the global tourism carbon footprint and identifies the key drivers using environmentally extended input-output modelling. The results indicate that global tourism emissions grew 3.5% p.a. between 2009-2019, double that of the worldwide economy, reaching 5.2 Gt CO2-e or 8.8% of total global GHG emissions in 2019. The primary drivers of emissions growth are slow technology efficiency gains (0.3% p.a.) combined with sustained high growth in tourism demand (3.8% p.a. in constant 2009 prices). Tourism emissions are associated with alarming distributional inequalities. Under both destination- and resident-based accounting, the twenty highest-emitting countries contribute three-quarters of the global footprint. The disparity in per-capita tourism emissions between high- and low-income nations now exceeds two orders of magnitude. National tourism decarbonisation strategies will require demand volume thresholds to be defined to align global tourism with the Paris Agreement. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of Ecosystem Service Values of Urban Wetland: Taking East Lake Scenic Area in Wuhan as an Example,"Urban wetlands represent a significant ecosystem type within urban landscapes. The quantitative assessment of their ecological service value holds great significance in guiding and improving the urban habitat. However, due to the insufficient spatial resolution of traditional low-to-medium resolution remote sensing imagery for surface monitoring, previous studies have conducted relatively limited research on the ecosystem services of urban wetlands. In this paper, based on multi-source data including multi-scale remote sensing data, a spatial-temporal fusion model and multiple ecological parameter inversion models were employed to invert three key ecological parameters at high spatial resolution, thereby assessing the ecosystem service values (ESVs) of urban wetlands. Taking the East Lake Scenic Area (ELSA) in Wuhan as an example, the dynamics of its ecosystem services’ value components were comparatively analyzed. The results indicate that, while the total value of ecosystem services declined slightly in 2015 compared to 2011, there was a notable increase in their value to CNY 3.219 billion by 2019, which represents a doubling of the total value relative to 2011. This trend could be primarily attributed to a significant rise in cultural services within the region. Specifically, the value of tourism services reached CNY 2.090 billion in 2019, representing a threefold increase compared to 2011. This demonstrates that ecosystem services in the ELSA have been significantly optimized and enhanced through associated ecological projects. Further research should investigate the mechanisms by which urbanization affects these crucial ecosystem services, particularly the characterization of cultural services in urban wetlands, and develop more effective strategies to enhance urban resilience and sustainable development. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
New trends in sustainability reporting: Exploring the online sustainability reporting practices by Irish universities,"This study is to understand the current status of online sustainability reporting (SR) practices by Irish universities. The paper reveals that online SR is in its infancy at the sample universities and there is significant room for improvement. Irish universities have initiated using web-based SR to inform their stakeholder groups, but they tend to report symbolic contents rather than substantive ones. The findings indicate that online SR practice by Irish universities is for the purpose of gaining legitimacy rather than satisfying the information needs of stakeholders. The assessment of online SR practices serves as a first step to help the universities use new technologies, in particular the internet, to improve the dialogue with stakeholders. This paper reminds universities that they should seek more than merely to meet the minimum acceptable level of online SR disclosure in society.

The causal effect of private transport on life satisfaction among older adults and the mediation effect of social participation in China,"Private transport constitutes the prerequisite for the freedom of mobility and facilitates accessibility for activities of older adults. Abundant studies have been conducted on the association between car ownership and life satisfaction in Western countries where cars dominate private transport. However, as the most prevalent and conventional private transport in China, cars and e-bikes have not received adequate attention. Using 2015 and 2018 datasets from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, we apply the Propensity Score Matching–Difference in Differences to investigate how private transport influences the multi-dimensional life quality of older adults. Furthermore, we focus on the mediation effect of social participation on the above causal effect. Our findings reveal that car and e-bike ownership have a causal impact on older adults' life satisfaction, while the influence of e-bike ownership is multi-dimensional. The relationship between car ownership and life satisfaction is mediated by social participation regarding exercise and voluntary activities. However, the mediation effects of mahjong and exercise activities are statistically significant between e-bike ownership and the multi-dimensional life quality of older adults. Understanding the life quality of older adults related to private transport is essential for guiding travel mobility and the life quality of older adults in China. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Energy transition and policy perception acuity: An analysis of 335 high-energy-consuming enterprises in China,"High-energy-consuming enterprises characterized by “high pollution, high energy consumption and high material consumption” have posed a serious challenge to countries in promoting energy transition, and countries around the world, especially developing countries, should pay urgent attention to the issue of energy consumption by high-energy-consuming enterprises. In this study, we systematically reviewed relevant theories of energy transition, constructed an energy transition dictionary. Then, we analyzed the annual report texts of 335 publicly listed companies in high-energy-consuming enterprises from 2013 to 2022 and performed a frequency analysis of the keywords in the energy transition dictionary. Next, we employed the game combination empowerment method to calculate the Energy Transition Index (ETI) of high-energy-consuming enterprises. By analyzing the 2013–2022 annual report data of Chinese listed companies, we investigated the relationship between Policy Perception Acuity (PPA) and energy transition. Additionally, we examined this relationship across the eastern, central, and western regions of China, confirming our findings through a machine learning algorithm. We draw the following conclusions: First, from 2013 to 2022, the ETI of high-energy-consuming enterprises has exhibited a fluctuating upward trend in phases., but the overall level remains relatively low, with a distinct geographic distribution trend characterized by higher levels in the western regions, stagnation in the central regions, and lower levels in the eastern regions. Secondly, the PPA of energy-consuming enterprises can greatly enhance the effectiveness of their energy transition, and this influence primarily manifests in the advancement of green energy innovation and the development of cleaner production practices. Thirdly, PPA has a notable positive incentivizing impact on ETI in the western region, with a less discernible effect in the central region, but with a certain degree of disincentive effect in the eastern region. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Corruption and regulatory compliance: Experimental findings from South African small-scale fisheries,"Although corruption is often mentioned as an obstacle to fisheries management, its negative effects have seldom been investigated empirically in a systematic manner. This article examines the impact of corruption on regulatory compliance among South African small-scale fishermen. Results from scenario experiments with 181 participants confirm that perceived corruptibility of the enforcing authority corrodes the willingness to comply with regulations. Both grand and petty types of corruption have significant effects. Attitudes related to moral support of the regulations, perceived inclusion in the decision making leading to regulations and an individual record of law breaking all affect the willingness to comply. However, these effects are trumped by the relative size of the negative impact of corruption. These findings underline the importance of curbing corruption involving public officials in the small-scale fisheries sector. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
A new new property,"Charles Reich's visionary 1964 article, The New Property, paved the way for a revolution in procedural due process. It did not, however, accomplish Reich's primary stated goal: providing those dependent on government assistance the same security that property rights long have offered owners of real property. As Reich himself predicted, procedural rights have proven largely ineffectual, especially for low-income people. In the half-century since he wrote, growing wealth inequality and repeated cutbacks in antipoverty programs have produced the pervasive disempowerment he predicted, but concentrated in one segment of society. This is incompatible with a healthy democracy. Reich found that government largesse had become functionally equivalent to more traditional forms of property. Other analogies to property concepts can also protect low-income people, supporting recognition of the most important assets low-income people have, many of which are relational rather than tangible. Like long-time trespassers obtaining ownership rights through adverse possession, families that have long lived together in this country should be able to continue doing so despite the unlawful immigration status of some of their members. The law should value the communities that offer mutual support to low-income people in much the same way as it does common interest communities. Principles of equity that long shielded less sophisticated people against sharp operators should be revived to protect low-income people's homes against abusive foreclosures. And modern Takings Clause doctrine should recognize subsistence government benefits as property. A regime of property law that secures that which is most essential to the well-being of a broad swath of society, rather than just those items disproportionately held by the wealthy, will best promote social, economic, and political participation by all people.",Not About Sufficiency
Rhetoric and frame analysis of ExxonMobil's climate change communications,"This paper investigates how ExxonMobil uses rhetoric and framing to shape public discourse on climate change. We present an algorithmic corpus comparison and machine-learning topic model of 180 ExxonMobil climate change communications, including peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and advertorials in The New York Times. We also investigate advertorials using inductive frame analysis. We find that the company has publicly overemphasized some terms and topics while avoiding others. Most notably, they have used rhetoric of climate “risk” and consumer energy “demand” to construct a “Fossil Fuel Savior” (FFS) frame that downplays the reality and seriousness of climate change, normalizes fossil fuel lock-in, and individualizes responsibility. These patterns mimic the tobacco industry's documented strategy of shifting responsibility away from corporations—which knowingly sold a deadly product while denying its harms—and onto consumers. This historical parallel foreshadows the fossil fuel industry's use of demand-as-blame arguments to oppose litigation, regulation, and activism. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
A collaboratively-derived science-policy research agenda,"The need for policy makers to understand science and for scientists to understand policy processes is widely recognised. However, the science-policy relationship is sometimes difficult and occasionally dysfunctional; it is also increasingly visible, because it must deal with contentious issues, or itself becomes a matter of public controversy, or both. We suggest that identifying key unanswered questions on the relationship between science and policy will catalyse and focus research in this field. To identify these questions, a collaborative procedure was employed with 52 participants selected to cover a wide range of experience in both science and policy, including people from government, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry. These participants consulted with colleagues and submitted 239 questions. An initial round of voting was followed by a workshop in which 40 of the most important questions were identified by further discussion and voting. The resulting list includes questions about the effectiveness of science-based decision-making structures; the nature and legitimacy of expertise; the consequences of changes such as increasing transparency; choices among different sources of evidence; the implications of new means of characterising and representing uncertainties; and ways in which policy and political processes affect what counts as authoritative evidence. We expect this exercise to identify important theoretical questions and to help improve the mutual understanding and effectiveness of those working at the interface of science and policy. © 2012 Sutherland et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Land tenure and farm management efficiency: The case of smallholder rubber production in customary land areas of Sumatra,"This study assesses the impact of land tenure institutions on the efficiency of farm management based on a case study of rubber production in customary land areas of Sumatra, Indonesia. Using the modes of land acquisition as measures of land tenure institutions, we estimated tree planting, revenue, income, and short-run profit functions, and internal rates of return to tree planting on smallholder rubber fields. We find generally insignificant differences in the incidence of tree planting and management efficiency (defined as residual profits) of rubber production between newly emerging private ownership and customary ownership. This is consistent with our hypothesis that tree planting confers stronger individual rights, if land rights are initially weak (as in the case of family land under customary land tenure systems). On the other hand, short-term profits are higher on land that is rented through share tenancy. This result indicates that rubber trees are over-exploited under renting arrangements due partly to the short-run nature of the land tenancy contracts and partly to the difficulty landowners face in supervising tapping activities of tenants in spatially dispersed rubber fields.",Not About Sufficiency

Revisiting Spatial Justice and Urban Parks in the Post-COVID-19 Era: A Systematic Literature Review,"Urban parks, integral to city life, have long contributed to the well-being of residents through various ecosystem services. Previous studies consistently highlighted unequal park distribution and access, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these disparities. From a spatial justice perspective, this review examines urban parks’ roles during the pandemic, the impact on equity and access, and how evolving park usage characteristics inform future management challenges. Analysing 53 peer-reviewed studies and 11 online materials from January 2020 to April 2023, this review reveals a significant increase in park visitors during the pandemic, causing challenges in accommodating the surge due to lockdown measures. The findings underscore physical and social justice dimensions, revealing disparities in park access during COVID-19. These challenges prompt reevaluating urban parks’ potential for well-being and ecosystem benefits, advocating for inclusive decision-making to enhance community resilience and socialisation.

However, the use of elephants in tourism is a fairly new development within Nepal. Because the health and welfare of tourism elephants is vital to the conservation of wild individuals, this book offers an assessment of captive elephant needs and an examination of their existing welfare statuses. Numerous NGOs and INGOs are now active in elephant lives, and many advocacy organizations have arisen with the goal of changing tourism practices and improving captive elephant welfare. This book seeks to examine the motivations of these NGOs and INGOs, and to consider their ethical approaches to elephant health and welfare. Are the motivations of these organizations similar enough to work together towards a common goal, or are their ethical norms so different that they get in one another's way? Using an ordinary language and ethics framework, this text aims to identify the norms of cultures and organizations and reframe them in ways which may allow for more successful interactions. © Michelle Szydlowski 2024.

Manure recycling from urban livestock farms for closing the urban–rural nutrient loops,"Rapid urbanization in developing countries is attracting urban livestock farming, which is associated with feed nutrient imports and manure nutrient accumulations. Here, we report on manure nutrients (N, P and K) production on urban livestock farms in Addis Ababa and Jimma in Ethiopia, and estimate manure recovery on these farms and its recycling in urban, peri-urban and rural crop farms. Estimates were based on data from farm surveys, statistics, literature and model calculations. Urban livestock farms had on average 13 tropical livestock units and positive N, P and K balances. Urban crop farms had negative N and K balances, and did not use manure from urban livestock farms. We estimated that 0.5–2.6 Gg N, 0.2–0.8 Gg P and 0.9–3.7 Gg K can be collected in manure from the 5,200 urban livestock farms in Addis Ababa year−1, and can be recycled in crop land. Two manure allocation strategies were explored: balanced P fertilization and balanced N fertilization. The former allowed greater precision in matching nutrient supply to demand, and was associated with greater manure transport and distribution, up to rural areas. Manure recycling has several benefits: synthetic fertilizer savings (75–300 million Ethiopian Birr year−1 for Addis Ababa), soil fertility replenishment, and reductions in water pollution. However, there are various cultural, educational and institutional barriers for manure recycling. We argue that more quantitative data and scenario analyses are needed for deliberative decision making and for exploring more sustainable development pathways of urban livestock farms, re-connected to crop farms via manure recycling. © 2020, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Comparative Mechanical and Durability Characteristics of WMA Mixtures Made with the Medical Waste Filler and Limestone Filler,"Investigation of the effect of fillers on pavement performance shows that medical waste (MW) can be used in place of traditional limestone (LS) mineral filler in hot-mix asphalt compositions. Furthermore, warm mix asphalt (WMA) issues with moisture damage and permanent deformation should be resolved. However, the mechanical and durability properties of WMA mixtures containing MW as a mineral filler still need to be determined. This study investigates the viability of using MW in place of LS mineral filler in WMA compositions. WMA mixes were made using 5% synthetic zeolite (by weight of asphalt cement). Two WMA mixes were produced: a reference mix with LS filler at 6% (by weight of aggregate) and another with MW at 6%. The mechanical and durability characteristics that were evaluated included the semi-circle bending test, deformation strength in the Kim test, indirect tension strength, tensile strength ratio (durability), Marshall stability, and Marshall quotient. In contrast to mixtures with LS filler, the results showed that using MW as a filler replacement in WMA mixtures improved Marshall stability and Marshall quotient by 18.45% and 32.52%, respectively. Indirect tensile strength also showed enhancement for both unconditioned and conditioned by 21.67% and 65.81%, respectively; besides, tensile strength ratio and deformation strength were improved by 33.64% and 27.82%, respectively. The parameters in the semi-circular bending test, such as maximum load, total fracture energy, and critical J-integral, all showed a noticeable improvement. This offers advantages like enhanced resistance to cracking, fatigue, and rutting while meeting requirements for Marshall characteristics, moisture susceptibility, deformation strength in Kim, and J-integral. Furthermore, applying life cycle cost analysis revealed that using MW as a mineral filler in WMA mixtures has the potential to save money, preserve landfill space, satisfy sustainable development goals, and address the moisture damage and permanent deformation issues associated with WMA. Furthermore, an optimization table based on the performance measurements performed was created to select the type of mixture for any field applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
THE EFFECTS OF ICT ON ENVIRONMENT QUALITY: THE ROLE OF GREEN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IN ASIAN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,"To address the existing environmental challenges, the contributions of ICT and green technological innovation have gained considerable scholarly attention in recent decades. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of ICT penetration including green technological innovation on environmental quality in selected Asian developing countries, using data spanning the period 1990-2018. The long-run relationships among the variables are confirmed using panel ARDL and robust least squares techniques. The results suggest that environmental pollution diminishes after a threshold level of ICT development is attained. However, a significantly decreasing influence of green technological innovation is found on carbon emissions, leading to increased energy efficiency by promoting carbon-peaking and carbon neutrality goals. Furthermore, a bidirectional causality running from carbon emissions to ICT penetration and green technological innovation is affirmed by the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test. Therefore, more sound fiscal incentives must be implemented to further strengthen the efficient use of ICT products along with green technological innovation. © 2022 AESS Publications.

Mitigation and adaptation options for rainfed agriculture in West Asia and North Africa,"Climatic change and land degradation are the most serious threats affecting the sustainability of land resources in West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region. Mitigation or adaptation interventions should be implemented using database on climate and climatic variation, characterization of local climatic changes, rainfall variability, drought occurrence and probability of extreme weather events, impacts on food production and security, and health of rural communities. Technologies for improving rainfed farming need to focus on optimizing the use of water runoff, innovative soil moisture conservation practices, developing new cropping system, management practices adapted to new temperature and moisture regime, innovative packages for production of high cash crops suitable for small holdings and tolerant to moisture and temperature stresses, conservation of agro-biodiversity, and low cost and energy efficient-farming system. Governments are called to establish national system to implement drought mitigation strategy that covers disaster risk management and treat it as top national priority. Plans to help farmers to endure extreme events should be among sustained institutional national policy. Emergency plan to provide aid to rural farmers during such events should help them to stay on their farms and avoid forced migration and accelerating land degradation. Improving farmer’s livelihood under stress conditions may be achieved by adopting broad base food security strategy integrating rainfed sector with others such as livestock in order to increase products’ added values and obtain better return. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.",Not About Sufficiency
"20-year follow-up study of physical morbidity and mortality in relationship to antipsychotic treatment in a nationwide cohort of 62,250 patients with schizophrenia (FIN20)","Antipsychotics are effective in preventing relapses of schizophrenia, but it is generally believed that their long-term use is harmful for patients’ physical well-being. However, there are no long-term studies which have verified this view. This nationwide, register-based cohort study aimed to assess the risk of hospitalization due to physical health problems, as a marker for severe physical morbidity, and the risk of all-cause mortality, as well as of cardiovascular and suicidal death, associated with antipsychotic use in all patients treated for schizophrenia in inpatient care between 1972 and 2014 in Finland (N=62,250), with up to 20 years of follow-up (median: 14.1 years). The use of antipsychotic drugs (i.e., use of any antipsychotic compared with non-use) and the use of specific antipsychotics were investigated, and outcomes were somatic and cardiovascular hospitalization, and all-cause, cardiovascular and suicide death. Hospitalization-based outcomes were analyzed by a within-individual design to eliminate selection bias, comparing use and non-use periods in the same individual by stratified Cox model. Mortality outcomes were assessed by traditional between-individual Cox multivariate models. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for any somatic hospitalization and cardiovascular hospitalization were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98-1.03) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.92-1.07) during use of any antipsychotic compared to non-exposure periods within the same individual. The aHRs were 0.48 (95% CI: 0.46-0.51) for all-cause mortality, 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57-0.67) for cardiovascular mortality, and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.43-0.62) for suicide mortality during use vs. non-use of any antipsychotic. The most beneficial mortality outcome was associated with use of clozapine in terms of all-cause (aHR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.36-0.43), cardiovascular (aHR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.47-0.64) and suicide mortality (aHR=0.21, 95% CI: 0.15-0.29). The cumulative mortality rates during maximum follow-up of 20 years were 46.2% for no antipsychotic use, 25.7% for any antipsychotic use, and 15.6% for clozapine use. These data suggest that long-term antipsychotic use does not increase severe physical morbidity leading to hospitalization, and is associated with substantially decreased mortality, especially among patients treated with clozapine. © 2020 World Psychiatric Association",Not About Sufficiency
The use of life cycle-based approaches in the food service sector to improve sustainability: A systematic review,"With the prevalence of eating out increasing, the food service sector has an increasing role in accelerating the transition towards more sustainable and healthy food systems. While life cycle-based approaches are recommended to be used as reference methods for assessing the environmental sustainability of food systems and supply chains, their application in the food service sector is still relatively scarce. In this study, a systematic review was conducted to examine the use and effectiveness of life-cycle based interventions in improving the sustainability of food services. This review found that life-cycle based approaches are not only useful for identifying hotspots for impact reduction, but also for comparing the performance of different sustainability interventions. In particular, interventions targeting the production phase, such as promoting dietary change through menu planning in which high-impact ingredients (e.g., animal products) are replaced with low-impact ingredients (e.g., plant foods), had the highest improvement potential. Interventions targeting other phases of the catering supply chain (e.g., food storage, meal preparation, waste management) had considerably lower improvement potentials. This review article provides valuable insights on how the sustainability of the food service sector can be improved without the burden shifting of impacts, which interventions to prioritise, and where knowledge gaps in research exist. A key recommendation for future research is to focus on combined life cycle thinking approaches that are capable of addressing sustainability holistically in the food service sector by integrating and assessing the environmental, social and economic dimensions of interventions. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Complication and failures of central vascular access device in adult critical care settings,"Objectives: To examine the proportion and rate of central venous access device failure and complications across central venous access device types in adult intensive care. Data Sources: A systematic search was undertaken in the electronic databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health in September 2017. Study Selection: Included studies were of observational (prospective and retrospective) or interventional design and reported central venous access device failure and complications in adult ICU settings. Studies were excluded if they were published prior to November 2006 or not reported in English. Two reviewers independently screened articles, assessed eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Data Extraction: Data were extracted on the primary outcome, central venous access device failure, and secondary outcomes: central venous access device complications (central line-associated bloodstream infection, catheter-related bloodstream infection, catheter-related thrombosis, occlusion, catheter removal due to suspected infection, dislodgement, breakage, and local infection). Patient and device data and study details to assess the study quality were also extracted. Data Synthesis: A total of 63 studies involving 50,000 central venous access devices (396,951 catheter days) were included. Central venous access device failure was 5% (95% CI, 3-6%), with the highest rates and proportion of failure in hemodialysis catheters. Overall central line-associated bloodstream infection rate was 4.59 per 1,000 catheter days (95% CI, 2.31-6.86), with the highest rate in nontunneled central venous access devices. Removal of central venous access device due to suspected infection was high (17%; 20.4 per 1,000 catheter days; 95% CI, 15.7-25.2). Conclusions: Central venous access device complications and device failure is a prevalent and significant problem in the adult ICU, leading to substantial patient harm and increased healthcare costs. The high proportion of central venous access devices removed due to suspicion of infection, despite low overall central line-associated bloodstream infection and catheter-related bloodstream infection rates, indicates a need for robust practice guidelines to inform decision-making surrounding removal of central venous access devices suspected of infection.

"Linking Green Human Capital, Green Transformational Leadership, Green Dynamic Capabilities, and Green Innovation: A Moderation Model","Although the notion of green human capital (GHC), as a critical component of green intellectual capital (GIC), has acquired significant attention among researchers and practitioners, its relationship with green innovation (GI) performance continues to remain unclear. The present research aims to address this knowledge gap by distinguishing GI adoption and integration in the context of developing countries, i.e., Morocco. Based on natural resource-based view (NRBV), this study evaluates the direct effect of GHC on GI. Most importantly, this research examines the moderating role of green dynamic capabilities (GDCs) and green transformation leadership (GTL) on the link between GHC and GI. Using a quantitative exploratory approach, data were obtained from 201 knowledge-intensive SMEs in Morocco. PLS Path Modeling (PLS-SEM) is applied to test the hypotheses. The results demonstrated that GTL is a critical underlying mechanism that moderates GHC and GI’s relationship. However, results confirmed the negative moderation of GDCs for the relationship between GHC and GI. This research opens up a new way for environmental management practices that can help knowledge-intensive SMEs to achieve green products and process innovation. Thus, this study incites top management teams (TMT) to give more importance to GHC as a critical source of green business innovation and sustainable competitive advantage. © 2023, Success Culture Press.

"Analysis of land use/land cover changes and driving forces during the period 1992-2022: a case study of Jinan City, China","This research aims to quantify the spatial pattern of urban land use/land cover (LULC) change while considering environmental effects. This paper integrates historical Landsat imagery, The Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI), geographical information system (GIS), and socioeconomic data to determine the spatial-temporal urban LULC dynamics and the conversion of LULC in response to the rapid urbanization from 1992 to 2022. Principle component analysis and multiple linear regression are used to determine and model the relationship between the socioeconomic factors and the changes for identifying the driving forces. The results indicate that impervious surfaces have exponentially increased, expanding more than two times from 2,348 to 4,795 km2, in contrast to bare lands, which drastically declined by 95%, from 1,888 to 87 km2. Water bodies have always been relatively fewer, at approximately 100 km2. In addition, the majority of farmland in Jinan City is concentrated in the northern region with a steady area in the range of 2,100-2,900 km2, while the majority of woodland located in the southern region declined from 3,774.52 km2 (37%) to 3,088.28 km2 (30%).

"Positive Press, Greener Progress: The Role of ESG Media Reputation in Corporate Energy Innovation","While the role of media in monitoring corporate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices is increasingly prominent, limited research focuses on the sustainable impact of corporate ESG reputation from an energy strategy perspective in the media context. To address this critical research gap, this study utilizes news report data from Baidu News and patent text data of Chinese A-share listed companies (2012–2022), applying machine learning and text analysis methods to construct indicators for ESG news sentiment and corporate energy innovation (CEI). Drawing on reputation theory, the study finds that positive ESG sentiment conveyed by media significantly enhances CEI, primarily by alleviating financing constraints and fostering awareness of green business practices. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive impact of ESG news sentiment on CEI is more pronounced in high-energy-consuming firms and in regions with better green finance development and stronger ESG governance. The content and attention of ESG news also exhibit distinct heterogeneity, particularly in the environmental and social dimensions. The findings underscore the importance of integrating media-driven ESG monitoring mechanisms into energy strategies to promote corporate long-term sustainable development. © 2025 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Influencing factors and mechanism of tourists’ pro-environmental behavior – Empirical analysis of the CAC-MOA integration model,"Tourism has been perceived as an environmentally friendly industry for a long term, but the negative impact of tourist irresponsible behavior on the environment cannot be ignored. Tourists’ pro-environmental behavior is crucial to the destination’s sustainable development. Taking stimulus-organism-response theory as a framework, this study explores the factors and mechanisms influencing tourists’ pro-environmental behaviors by integrating cognitive-affective-conative (CAC) theory and motivation-opportunity-ability (MOA) theory. Through the PLS-SEM analysis with 548 questionnaires, the driving mechanism of tourists’ pro-environmental behavior was deeply explored. The results indicate that tourists’ environmental knowledge, participation motivation, and opportunity have significant positive effects on pro-environmental behavior, but the role of participation ability on tourists’ pro-environmental behavior is not confirmed. Tourists have significant environmental self-identity and environmental commitment, and these affections actively promote tourists’ pro-environmental behavior. Except for the participation ability, the other three factors, respectively, influence tourists’ environmental behavior through the mediating effects of environmental self-identity and environmental commitment. Given the limited literature integrating CAC and MOA theories within research on tourists’ pro-environmental behavior, these findings provide new perspectives for future research. This research enriches the literature on the factors influencing tourist pro-environmental behavior and also provides practical guidance for promoting tourists’ pro-environmental behavior.

"Sulfate Formation by Photosensitization in Mixed Incense Burning-Sodium Chloride Particles: Effects of RH, Light Intensity, and Aerosol Aging","Elevated particulate sulfate concentrations have been frequently observed in coastal areas when air masses are influenced by continental emissions, especially combustion sources like biomass burning. We studied the SO2 uptake by laboratory-generated droplets containing incense smoke extracts and sodium chloride (IS-NaCl) under irradiation and found enhanced sulfate production over pure NaCl droplets, attributable to photosensitization induced by constituents in IS. Low relative humidity and high light intensity facilitated sulfate formation and increased the SO2 uptake coefficient by IS-NaCl particles. Aging of the IS particles further enhanced sulfate production, attributable to the enhanced secondary oxidant production promoted by increased proportions of nitrogen-containing CHN and oxygen- and nitrogen-containing CHON species under light and air. Experiments using model compounds of syringaldehyde, pyrazine, and 4-nitroguaiacol verified the enhancements of CHN and CHON species in sulfate formation. This work provides experimental evidence of enhanced sulfate production in laboratory-generated IS-NaCl droplets via enhanced secondary oxidant production triggered by photosensitization in multiphase oxidation processes under light and air. Our results can shed light on the possible interactions between sea salt and biomass burning aerosols in enhancing sulfate production. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
Dual-threshold effect of resources and governance on the role of regulations in green innovation: Novel insights from a four-regime panel approach,"Diverging from existing literature that predominantly examines the individual impacts of environmental regulations, financial resources, and governance focus on green innovation, our study introduces an innovative theoretical framework based on institutional theory, resource-based view, and attention-based view to elucidate the collective interplay of these factors in “going green.” Employing a state-of-the-art threshold regression with two threshold variables, our empirical results highlight that only when critical values for both financial resources and governance focus on environmental concerns are simultaneously achieved, does the negative influence of environmental regulations on green innovation transform into a positive effect. Furthermore, less than 10% of observations enter the corresponding threshold interval, with financial resources acting as a peripheral condition in contrast to the central role of governance focus. These findings have significant practical implications for the implementation of environmental regulations and green financial policies, particularly in China and similar emerging economies, where governmental intervention remains pivotal in environmental stewardship. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Analyzing the relationship between energy efficiency and environmental and financial variables: A way towards sustainable development,"The literature has mainly relied on an annual and short span of data to analyze the relationship between energy, environmental and financial indicators. This study analyzes the relationship between energy efficiency, energy research, pollution mitigation, and FinTech by applying two novel methods-the causality test in the frequency domain [11] and the causality test in the time domain (Shi et al., 2018; 2020)- on the daily data from June 17, 2016 to November 16, 2021. Empirical results from the frequency domain test report that pollution mitigation temporarily causes energy efficiency only in the short run while energy efficiency Granger causes it in the short, medium, and long run. Furthermore, energy efficiency can predict FinTech in the short, medium, and long-run; on the other way, FinTech Granger causes energy efficiency in the long and medium run, suggesting a permanent causality relationship. Empirical results from the time-varying test show a bidirectional relationship between energy efficiency, and environmental and financial variables, especially with very high significant episodes around the recent pandemic collapse. Policymakers should promote the launch of financial technologies that will provide finance through green bonds for energy efficiency improvements as well as energy efficiency improvements for pollution mitigation. Further policy implications are discussed in the study. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Dynamics and driving forces of change in Ethiopian smallholder livestock production system,"The study was conducted in Northwest Ethiopia to investigate the dynamics and driving forces of change in the smallholder livestock production system. The research approaches include use of secondary and primary data. The primary data was collected; including key informant interviews, focus group discussions, workshops and field observation. The data were collected for a time frame of 10 years (from 2002-2012). Qualitative data analysis was done by using the ATLAS-ti version 7 software. The most important changes in all three watersheds during 2002-2012 were: reduction in livestock herd or flock size; shift in livestock species composition and purpose, such as focusing on sheep, using horses and mules for different purposes; abandoning goats; decrease in livestock productivity; however, some farmers have attempted to improve the livestock husbandry. These changes are driven by the interaction of various driving forces that can be categorized into political (policy, institutional), economic, social, technological and ecological. Therefore, interventions to be made by concerned stakeholders (farmers, development practitioners, researchers, policy makers, etc.) to improve the production system in the study areas need to focus on addressing the various and complex driving forces through a system wide and context-specific approach. © 2016, Fundacion CIPAV.

Economic assessment of a serial production system with random imperfection and shortages: A step towards sustainability,"Recent paradigm shifts in production modeling have evolved away from only economic considerations and toward the three pillars of sustainability: economic, environmental, and social, in order to accomplish sustainable development goals. While production modeling research has undergone a radical shift, quite a few studies in the production management literature have addressed sustainability challenges. These classic sustainable production models are only applicable to single-stage production systems and overlook a variety of real-world situations associated with random defective output and resulting shortages during demand fulfillment. To address this concern about developing sustainable strategies for multi-stage production, this paper analyzes a cleaner multi-stage production management system for carbon emissions reduction and active participation in corporate social responsibility activities, while also advancing the system economically. Three scenarios of random imperfect proportion are constructed, and a reworking opportunity is implied to clean the multi-stage production system. A planned backorder policy is advised to address anticipated shortages and improve the system's service level. Analytical optimization techniques are used in the developed situations to determine the appropriate batch size and backorder quantity, hence minimizing the system's overall cost and achieving global optimum solutions. Numerical evaluation and sensitivity analysis are used to conduct a comparative examination of the model scenarios. Significant managerial insights are developed to demonstrate the suggested cleaner multi-stage production model's actual relevance. According to the model results, a lower batch size is the optimal strategy in response to increasing holding and CSR activity costs, but otherwise for the setup cost in a serial production system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Cannabis policy impacts public health and health equity,"Over the past several decades, more than half of all U.S. states have legalized cannabis for adult and/or medical use, but it remains illegal at the federal level. The public health consequences of cannabis policy changes have not been comprehensively evaluated. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health tasked the National Academies with reviewing cannabis and cannabinoid availability in the U.S., assessing regulatory frameworks for the industry with an emphasis on equity, and describing strengths and weaknesses of surveillance systems for cannabis. The resulting report finds that there has been limited federal guidance to states regarding protecting public health, which has led to inconsistent protection across the states. The report recommends a strategy to minimize public health harms through stronger federal leadership, a robust research agenda, and more. © 2024 by the National Academy of Sciences.

Justice and flood risk management: reflecting on different approaches to distribute and allocate flood risk management in Europe,"This paper compares the inherent notions of justice in four different approaches to flood risk management in Europe. As protection against flood risks becomes increasingly difficult, dilemmas of justice emerge: some benefits from flood protection measures whereas others loose. Decisions on whom to protect differentiate between upstream and downstream or left and right side of a river. This raises a central but barely discussed conflict: what (or rather who) should be protected against inundations? This question deals in essence with justice. Justice concerns questions over fairness in the allocation of resources, capital and wealth across different members of society. There are different and contradicting concepts of justice, which differ in interpretations of fair resource allocation and distributions. ‘What’s the right thing to protect’ is thus a question of concepts of justice. This contribution is not an attempt to answer this fundamental question, but it offers a debate on how different concepts of justice provide different answers. These answers will then be related to flood risk management approaches in England, the Netherlands, Germany, and Austria. © 2016, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Natural flood management: Opportunities to implement nature-based solutions on privately owned land,"The implementation of Natural Flood Management (NFM), as an example of a nature-based solution (NbS), is promoted as a risk reduction strategy to support sustainable flood risk management and climate change adaptation more widely. Additionally, as an NbS, NFM aims to provide further multiple benefits, such as increased biodiversity and improved water quality as well as improved mental health. The implementation of NbS often needs private-owned or managed land, yet can create conflicts between the different stakeholders which can undermine the social consensus required for successful implementation. Consequently, a main question is how the multiple benefits and requirements of NFM can be delivered to meet the different goals of the wide variety of stakeholders who must be involved. This article discusses the challenges and potential of implementing NFM as an alternative to the traditional technical mitigation measures in flood risk management. We outline four opportunities in the implementation of NFM: physical conditions of the catchment, social interaction, financial resources, and institutional setting. Their importance is then demonstrated and compared to different examples across the globe. Nevertheless, the core drivers reflect the social interaction and institutional setting and the role of stakeholders in the successful implementation of NFM.This article is categorized under:Engineering Water > Planning WaterHuman Water > Water GovernanceScience of Water > Water ExtremesWater and Life > Conservation, Management, and Awareness",Not About Sufficiency

Energy Consumption and Human Well-Being: A Systematic Review,"Understanding the relationship between energy use and well-being is crucial for designing holistic energy policy. The latter has to both effectively mitigate climate change driven by current fossil-based energy systems as well as promote human development, which requires energy. While a significant body of research investigates this relationship, study designs differ significantly, so findings cannot be easily generalized. This machine learning-aided review provides an overview of the current state of the literature examining this relationship. We highlight and discuss methodological differences between the studies, including their perspective (top-down or bottom-up), spatial scope, and the respective energy and well-being indicators used. The review reveals that most research takes a top-down perspective, analyzing country-level data across multiple countries. These studies typically find a positive relationship between energy use and well-being, and most confirm the existence of a saturation effect. We reveal that countries in the Global South are underrepresented in current studies. Bottom-up studies focus on specific countries or country groups using household-level data, yielding more nuanced findings that can be further disaggregated by consumption domain. We find that energy and well-being indicators differ substantially across studies, yet the implications of this choice are not always sufficiently discussed. The review shows and discusses the current shift from production- to consumption-based energy indicators. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

This Special Issue presents a selection of papers to cover key research priorities identified in road and rail transport, low carbon transport, and gender and inclusive transport. The state of knowledge has produced a sound basis for setting priorities for applied research in the second part of the programme. Applied research is directed to delivering high volume transport that contributes to economic growth and social development, and that is more resilient to the impact of climate change in LICs in Africa and South Asia. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Key themes in public health,"‘The growth of public health courses aimed at undergraduates has created a new need for textbooks that are appropriate and stimulating. Miranda Thurston has succeeded in producing something which strikes the right note. It is wide ranging in scope without being superficial and is accessible to the young learner. It is a sort of ‘Wiki’. Just what the aspiring public health practitioner ordered.’ - Professor John R. Ashton C.B.E., President of the UK Faculty of Public Health. Key Themes in Public Health comprises a series of introductory essays exploring key themes and concepts in public health. Ranging from political and economic concern with improving population health and reducing health inequalities, to debates about how to protect populations from new health threats, as well as a concern with individual responsibility for lifestyles and behaviour, the themes discussed include: determinants of health, globalisation, evidence, climate change, ethics, development, poverty, risk and population. Presenting provocative ways of thinking about key ideas in a concise fashion, each essay provides a basic grounding in the relevant theme as well as a departure point for further study by: Defining the theme in an accessible way Placing each idea in its particular social, political, economic and historical context Illustrating its application and significance for public health Identifying and exploring issues surrounding each of the themes This text provides an accessible overview for students new to public health who want to get to grips with the full range and complexity of this diverse and multidisciplinary field. © 2014 Miranda Thurston.",Not About Sufficiency
Food benefit and climate warming potential of nitrogen fertilizer uses in China,"Chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer has long been used to help meet the increasing food demands in China, the top N fertilizer consumer in the world. Growing concerns have been raised on the impacts of N fertilizer uses on food security and climate change, which is lack of quantification. Here we use a carbon-nitrogen (C-N) coupled ecosystem model, to quantify the food benefit and climate consequence of agronomic N addition in China over the six decades from 1949 to 2008. Results show that N fertilizer-induced crop yield and soil C sequestration had reached their peaks, while nitrous oxide (N2O) emission continued rising as N was added. Since the early 2000s, stimulation of excessive N fertilizer uses to global climate warming through N2O emission was estimated to outweigh their climate benefit in increasing CO 2 uptake. The net warming effect of N fertilizer uses, mainly centered in the North China Plain and the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River Basin, with N2O emission completely counteracting or even exceeding, by more than a factor of 2, the CO2 sink. If we reduced the current N fertilizer level by 60% in 'over-fertilized' areas, N2O emission would substantially decrease without significantly influencing crop yield and soil C sequestration. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Secondary resource curse's formation and transmission mechanism based on environmental externality theory,"Due to developing countries' original intention of implementing circular development, secondary resource factories should have reduced environmental pollution. However, the reality of the situation has proved that the recycling of secondary resources may causes serious damage to the local environment. By comparing the similarities of primary resource exploitation and secondary resource recycling, this paper proposes the concept of the ""secondary resource curse"" based on environmental externality theory, which is compared with the ""resource curse"". The secondary resource curse's formation and transmission mechanisms are analyzed from the intraindustry, interindustry, and interregional perspectives. The essential pollution causes of the secondary resources industry in developing countries are found from these three aspects: (1) the enterprise's economic efficiency, the effects of different secondary resource recycling technologies on negative environmental externalities, and the reasons for ""adverse selection of technology"" in secondary resource factories are explained, which is shown that, in the case of regulatory loopholes, one-sided pursuit of economic profit may lead to the pollution problem of secondary resource enterprises; (2) the negativeexternalities of upstream stakeholders in the industrial chain implies that the manufacturers and consumers of products should be responsible for their clean recycling; and (3) the phenomenon of transregional resources recycling indicates that the environmental pressure in the inflow region is aggravated significantly when there is no extra compensation from outflow region for recycling and disposal of hazardous waste. Hence, we must adopt policy package for recycling secondary resources at different levels and minimize the negative externalities caused by resource recovery. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Effective and economical treatment of low-grade nickel laterite by a duplex process of direct reduction-magnetic separation & rotary kiln-electric furnace and its industrial application,"An innovative technical route has been proposed to improve recycling efficiency of Ni and Fe from low-grade nickel laterite via the duplex process between direct reduction-magnetic separation and rotary kiln-electric furnace. The results indicated that the high‑nickel concentrates produced from direct reduction-magnetic separation process, which were combined with optimization of slag types can not only increase the grade of furnace burdens and decrease quantity of slag, but also improve the fluidity of slag and smelting efficiency as well as reduce the power consumption of smelting. For the industrial application of duplex process, a preferable stainless-steel master alloy with 10.02% Ni was obtained at a lower cost of 8420 RMB/t than that of 8731 RMB/t for a stainless-steel master alloy containing 8.14% Ni in conventional rotary kiln-electric furnace process, and the recovery of nickel also increased from 91.27% to 95.51%, which shows an obvious superiority for treating the low-grade nickel laterite. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Restoring a flow regime through the coordinated operation of a multireservoir system: The case of the Zambezi River basin,"Large storage facilities in hydropower-dominated river basins have traditionally been designed and managed to maximize revenues from energy generation. In an attempt to mitigate the externalities downstream due to a reduction in flow fluctuation, minimum flow requirements have been imposed to reservoir operators. However, it is now recognized that a varying flow regime including flow pulses provides the best conditions for many aquatic ecosystems. This paper presents a methodology to derive a trade-off relationship between hydropower generation and ecological preservation in a system with multiple reservoirs and stochastic inflows. Instead of imposing minimum flow requirements, the method brings more flexibility to the allocation process by building upon environmental valuation studies to derive simple demand curves for environmental goods and services, which are then used in a reservoir optimization model together with the demand for energy. The objective here is not to put precise monetary values on environmental flows but to see the marginal changes in release policies should those values be considered. After selecting appropriate risk indicators for hydropower generation and ecological preservation, the trade-off curve provides a concise way of exploring the extent to which one of the objectives must be sacrificed in order to achieve more of the other. The methodology is illustrated with the Zambezi River basin where large man-made reservoirs have disrupted the hydrological regime. © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.",Not About Sufficiency
"Communicating climate change as a generational issue: experimental effects on youth worry, motivation and belief in collective action","Generations differ in their contribution to climate change and susceptibility to its effects. Contextualizing climate change as an intergenerational issue may therefore alter public engagement. We report a pre-registered, online experiment with a youth sample (N = 500, aged 16–24 years) in Ireland that tested whether highlighting generational differences in descriptions of climate change affects (i) worry about climate change, (ii) perception of others’ worry, (iii) belief in collective action and (iv) pro-environmental intentions. We also tested the effect of correcting young people’s misperceptions about how concerned older generations (aged 40+) are. The generational narrative amplified self-reported worry about climate change, from 5.42 (SD = 1.45) on a 7-point rating scale in the control group to 5.76 (SD = 1.18) among those who read the generational narrative (d = 0.26). Those who read the generational narrative also believed their close friends (M = 5.14, SD = 1.32) and other peers (M = 5.28, SD = 1.19) were more worried than those who read the control narrative (M = 4.85, SD = 1.48 and M = 5.03, SD = 1.19, respectively; ds = 0.20). There were no significant effects of contextualizing climate change as an intergenerational issue on perceived worry among older people, belief in collective action or pro-environmental intentions. Providing accurate information on older people’s worry, however, boosted belief in collective action, particularly for the majority who initially underestimated it (M = 4.22 out of 7, SD = 1.14 vs. M = 4.63, SD = 1.18, d = 0.36). The results have implications for communications with young people about climate change. Correcting underestimations of concern about climate change between socio-demographic subgroups may help to foster engagement. Policy highlights Communications that highlight generational differences in the causes and effects of climate change may be unhelpful; they increase worry among young people without motivating them to act. Most young people underestimate how worried older people are about climate change and this misperception correlates with belief that people are less likely to work together to mitigate climate change. Providing accurate information on how worried older people are boosts belief in collective action, but only among the majority of young people who underestimate it. Communications about climate change likely benefit from avoiding highlighting differences between socio-demographic subgroups and correcting misperceptions where they exist. © 2024 The Author(s).

"U-Net Performance for Beach Wrack Segmentation: Effects of UAV Camera Bands, Height Measurements, and Spectral Indices","This study delves into the application of the U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) model for beach wrack (BW) segmentation and monitoring in coastal environments using multispectral imagery. Through the utilization of different input configurations, namely, “RGB”, “RGB and height”, “5 bands”, “5 bands and height”, and “Band ratio indices”, this research provides insights into the optimal dataset combination for the U-Net model. The results indicate promising performance with the “RGB” combination, achieving a moderate Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.42 for BW and an overall accuracy of IoU = 0.59. However, challenges arise in the segmentation of potential BW, primarily attributed to the dynamics of light in aquatic environments. Factors such as sun glint, wave patterns, and turbidity also influenced model accuracy. Contrary to the hypothesis, integrating all spectral bands did not enhance the model’s efficacy, and adding height data acquired from UAVs decreased model precision in both RGB and multispectral scenarios. This study reaffirms the potential of U-Net CNNs for BW detection, emphasizing the suitability of the suggested method for deployment in diverse beach geomorphology, requiring no high-end computing resources, and thereby facilitating more accessible applications in coastal monitoring and management. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Efficiency dynamics in Latin American healthcare reforms: a comprehensive growth mixture analysis within institutional theory,"Purpose: This study examines the efficiency dynamics of public health service providers in Colombia between 2010 and 2021. In order to achieve this objective, a data panel is utilized to assess the effectiveness of 841 institutions across three levels of complexity (1, 2 and 3) in providing patient care, taking into account user satisfaction from 2010 to 2021. Design/methodology/approach: By employing growth mixture analysis (GMA) and other statistical techniques, we may identify unique efficiency profiles among hospitals with different levels of complexity. Findings: The results demonstrate varied efficiency patterns, with certain profiles generally retaining or improving efficiency over time, while others observe fluctuations or reductions. Efficiency outcomes are significantly impacted by factors such as capital investment, operational costs and workforce mix. Efficiency levels can be improved by making strategic investments in capital infrastructure and implementing effective operational cost management. Originality/value: Changes in the healthcare market conditions in recent years in Colombia have compelled healthcare providers (IPS) to transform themselves into sustainable organizations. © 2024, Claudia Isabel Vivas Tobar, Diana Escandon-Barbosa, Jairo Salas-Paramo and Víctor Giménez.",Not About Sufficiency
TOD in the Spatial Plans of HSR Station Areas,"With the rapid development of high-speed railways (HSR) in China, HSR-based transit-oriented development (TOD) has spread around the country.Although local governments claim that the HSR station areas are planned according to TOD principles, scholars argue that these Chinese HSR station areas actually cause unsustainable development.This paper explores (1) what success factors should be included in a TOD plan for HSR station areas, and (2) to what extent are these factors considered in the plans for Chinese HSR station areas? We adopt content analysis as a method to compare the master plans for 15 HSR station areas in China.This study reveals that most of the factors in the plans for HSR station areas deviate from TOD principles, especially in small and medium-sized cities.We argue that TOD in HSR station areas is mainly used by Chinese local governments as a tool to promote expansion in suburban areas. © 2022 TU Delft.

The social cost of carbon,"This article surveys the literature on the economic impact of climate change. Different methods have been used to estimate the impact of climate change on human welfare. Studies agree that there are positive and negative impacts. In the short term, positive impacts may dominate, but these are sunk benefits that will obtain regardless of abatement policy. In the longer term, there are net negative impacts. Poorer people tend to be more vulnerable to climate change. Estimated aggregate impacts are not very large, but they are uncertain and incomplete. Estimates of the marginal impacts suggest that greenhouse gas emissions should be taxed and that the emission reduction targets announced by politicians are probably too ambitious. Estimates of the willingness to pay for climate policy suggest that lay people are probably more concerned than experts about the total impact of climate change, whereas lay people and experts agree on estimates of the incremental impact of carbon dioxide emissions. © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

Structure and function of soil microbial communities in fertile islands in austral drylands,"Fertile islands are an important determinant of ecosystem functioning in drylands. These resource-rich patches are maintained by complex interactions among biotic and abiotic factors. Soil microorganisms are responsible for essential ecosystem processes and could affect the ability of fertile islands to capture and cycle nutrients, both directly and indirectly enhancing the fertile island effect. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the attributes of soil microbial communities (abundance and activity), elucidate key drivers of the fertile island effect and analyze relationships with a range of soil parameters (physicochemical). The soils under shrub canopies had higher values of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and soil basal respiration (SBR) rates than soils from intercanopy spaces. However, no differences were observed in Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) or in fungal and bacterial abundances between the microhabitats. Soil nutrient stocks (NPK) and pH values had a positive correlation with MBC and SBR. Also, a positive correlation was observed for fungi abundance and the K content of the soil. We also observed a positive correlation between the bacterial abundance and soil N content. This study suggests that M. tridens can be considered a keystone species that generates fertility islands, critical for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The keystone role that M. tridens plays in this system underscores the importance of improving our understanding of these interactions (plant–soil-microorganisms), especially important as drylands expand and aridity increases due to climate change in the second half of this century. © 2022 Ecological Society of Australia.",Not About Sufficiency
Hospitality that cares: a qualitative investigation into small foodservice businesses’ social responsibility,"This study adopted Spence’s (2016) theorization of small business social responsibility (SBSR) to investigate how small hospitality foodservice businesses express and implement their social responsibility through prioritization of their key stakeholders. Using an abductive research methodology, 38 semi-structured interviews were conducted with small foodservice businesses located in Sheffield, UK. The findings revealed that these businesses exhibited three distinct types of business orientation, growth, value, and social entrepreneurship, which led to different interpretations and expressions of their SBSR. Prioritization of employees was important to these small businesses as they are crucial pivots of the service experience and important in the implementation of their SBSR. This study has evolved the SBSR understanding for hospitality businesses, which enriches the corporate social responsibility (CSR) scholarship by encompassing a better understanding of how small businesses prioritize different domains of responsibility in their interpretation of SBSR, through explaining the influential role of business orientation. The findings can support new and existing small hospitality business owners in making purposeful organizational changes. © 2023 The Author(s).

Developing a geographic information capacity (GIC) profile for disaster risk management under United Nations framework commitments,"The capacity to utilize geographic information is a critical element of disaster risk management. Although access to and use of geographic information system (GIS) technology continues to grow, there remain significant gaps in approaches used by disaster risk management stakeholders to understand geographic information needs, sources, and information flow—ultimately limiting the efficacy of management efforts. To address this problem, we introduce the concept of geographic information capacity (GIC) to measure and analyze the ability of stakeholders to understand, access, and work with geographic information for disaster risk management. We propose a framework for assessing GIC, the GIC Profile, which we situate within a review of disaster risk management-relevant frameworks. We evaluate the GIC Profile using two case study countries at the first (sub-national) geo-administrative boundary level. Chi-square analyses suggest GIC across equivalent regional units within each country is relatively uniform, and that this uniformity is comparable between nations despite significant difference in overall capacity. Contributions of the GIC Profile to disaster risk management research are twofold. First, this is a first attempt to develop a profile based on key indicators for quantifying GIC highlights critical areas for capacity improvement, allowing decision makers to identify and prioritize pathways to strengthen disaster risk management programs. Through this initial effort, a decision tool has been developed which may enhance decisions on how to utilize GIS in support of disaster risk management. This tool is iterative and can be updated as new events occur to maximize GIS benefits, ultimately reducing disaster risks and their potential consequences. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Exploring atmospheric environmental drivers of asthma among children in Shanghai, China: Evidence-informed policies are required","It is important to identify atmospheric environmental drivers of childhood asthma because asthma is the most common chronic disease in children globally. We provided an overview of the impacts of exposure to atmospheric environmental factors (e.g., meteorological factors and air pollutants) on childhood asthma, based on a series of studies with the cutting-edge environmental epidemiological methodology in Shanghai, China. Overall, we found that the prevalence of asthma among the children aged 3–7 years had increased by approximately 7 fold, from 2.1% in 1990 to 14.6% in 2019. Most meteorological factors (i.e. daily mean temperature, temperature difference, air pressure, air pressure difference, precipitation, relative humidity, sunshine and wind speed) and air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and O3) were significantly associated with childhood asthma (p < 0.05), but meteorological factors appeared to play more important roles than air pollutants in the occurrence of asthma exacerbations. We also found that temperature variability was significantly associated with the elevated relative risk of daily outpatient visits for childhood asthma (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we conducted a systematic review on climate change adaptation measures and childhood asthma and found that there were a number of adaptation measures proposed for childhood asthma in response to climate change, including vulnerability assessment, improving ventilation and heating, enhancing community education, developing forecast models, and early warning systems. However, the effectiveness of most adaptation measures, except for improving ventilation and heating in winter, have not been explored and quantified. Since asthma is sensitive to the variation of atmospheric environmental conditions, it is critical to develop and implement appropriate climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies as global heating becomes apparent. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Wasted GDP in the USA,"Whether or to what extent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can measure human development is disputed. This article develops a notion of “wasted GDP”, with a case study on the performance of the USA based on analysis of Human Development Index (HDI) data. Like Herman Daly’s notion of ‘uneconomic growth’, the perspective of wasted GDP addresses the benefits and costs of economic growth and favors prioritization of policies that promote genuinely sustainable wellbeing. Over the last three decades, the USA has fallen behind several other highly developed countries in the HDI, despite solid economic growth. More than 20 countries, large and small, now outperform the USA on the Human Development Index, and 27 countries currently do better than the USA by nonincome HDI. 21 countries outperform the USA by this measure despite having a lower GDP per capita. The notion of “wasted GDP” implies that GDP is wasted if it does not support welfare. While a country´s welfare performance is measured by nonincome HDI, a comparison with better-performing countries that have a lower GDP indicates the share of GDP that is wasted from a human development perspective. The results, based on highly conservative estimates, show that the top 5 performers by lowest GDP per capita achieve better outcomes than the USA with an average GDP per capita that is 37.5% lower. All better performers achieve better outcomes with an average GDP per capita that is 26.9% lower. Without any wasted GDP, the annual US CO2 emissions could have been at least 1.268 million tonnes lower (all better performers estimate) and possibly as much as 1.767 million tonnes lower (top 5 performers estimate), accounting for 3.6–5.0% of global emissions. Similarly, the USA´s material footprint could have been between 2.625 million and 3.659 million tonnes lower, accounting for 2.7–3.8% of humanity´s global material footprint. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptive governance in carbon farming policies,"This book discusses a variety of different perspectives involved in biodiversity management and bio-sequestration projects in Australia, working towards achieving adaptive governance in carbon farming. It not only examines landholders' motivation but also the challenges of integrating biodiverse forests into the agricultural landscape. Drawing on the contrast between science and policy stakeholders' views on carbon farming and the practical challenges of achieving adaptive governance, the book discusses the significant gap between theory and practice encountered in this field of study. The book suggests ways of improving the decision-making capacity of government officials and policymakers involved in managing carbon and biodiversity markets, as well as introducing measures to promote adaptive governance by engaging landholders in more effective land conservation. Climate change is a pressing issue on the global political agenda, and this book makes an important contribution to the ongoing debate.

Laboratory of Social Innovation in Water Engineering and its effect on the provision of drinking water service in rural areas and marginalized urban areas,"The provision of drinking water service in rural areas and marginalized urban areas is a challenge, mainly due to the dispersion that communities and the environment where they are located due to their isolation and difficult access. Data from the United Nations Organization indicate that 884 million people in the world and approximately 7 million in Mexico do not have access to drinking water. On average, only 75% of homes in rural areas receive drinking water through a pipe.Among the benefits provided by this service are the increase in well-being and the development of economic activities.Aware of the importance of prioritizing the supply of drinking water, particularly in vulnerable areas, the laboratory for social innovation in water engineering emerged in this institution with the purpose of designing, building, and sustainably operating drinking water supply systems.This paper presents the results of the impact of the innovation laboratory on students to design a water pipeline, from a nearby source of supply to a community that lacks drinking water supply.

Influence of rapid laser heating on differently matured soot with double-pulse laser-induced incandescence,"For accurate laser-induced incandescence (LII) measurements of soot properties it is of great importance to understand the nature of the physical processes involved during rapid laser heating. In this work, we investigate how well-characterized differently matured fresh soot from a soot generator responds to rapid laser heating. For this purpose, a double-pulse LII setup is used with 10 μs time separation between the pulses using various combinations of two common LII wavelengths (532 and 1064 nm). Detection is performed at two wavelength bands for fluorescence analysis, and additionally elastic light scattering is used for mass loss analysis during heating. We investigate how the LII signal changes with pre-heating laser energy, specifically by fluence curve analysis to estimate the influence of thermal annealing, sublimation and laser-induced fluorescence interference. It is shown that extensive absorption enhancement occurs for all types of soot as the soot is thermally annealed, which is manifested through decreasing dispersion coefficient ξ and an increasing absorption coefficient E(m,λ). When comparing young and mature soot, a much larger impact of sublimation can be observed in the fluence curves of the mature soot. Also, we observe an enhanced contribution of laser-induced fluorescence for the young soot when performing LII measurements using 532 nm, which is suggested to originate from vaporized carbon fragments with an aromatic structure. This work further shows the potential of utilizing double-pulse arrangements for increasing the detectability of poorly absorbing soot, but also it highlights the impact of laser heating on soot, which may be important to avoid interferences when performing soot diagnostics. © 2022 The Author(s).

A comprehensive review of the natural history of Helicobacter pylori Infection in children,"Across populations of children, Helicobacter pylori prevalence ranges from under 10% to over 80%. Low prevalence occurs in the U.S., Canada, and northern and western Europe; high prevalence occurs in India, Africa, Latin America, and eastern Europe. Risk factors include socioeconomic status, household crowding, ethnicity, migration from high prevalence regions, and infection status of family members. H. pylori infection is not associated with specific symptoms in children; however, it is consistently associated with antral gastritis, although its clinical significance is unclear. Duodenal ulcers associated with H. pylori are seldom seen in children under 10 years of age. H. pylori-infected children demonstrate a chronic, macrophagic, and monocytic inflammatory cell infiltrate and a lack of neutrophils, as compared with the response observed in adults. The effect of H. pylori infection on acid secretion in children remains poorly defined. The events that occur during H. pylori colonization in children should be studied more thoroughly and should include urease activity, motility, chemotaxis, adherence, and downregulation of the host response. The importance of virulence determinants described as relevant for disease during H. pylori infection has not been extensively studied in children. Highly sensitive and specific methods for the detection of H. pylori in children are needed, especially in younger pediatric populations in which colonization is in its early phases. Criteria for the use of eradication treatment in H. pylori-infected children need to be established. Multicenter pediatric studies should focus on the identification of risk factors, which can be used as prognostic indicators for the development of gastroduodenal disease later in life. © 2000 IMSS.",Not About Sufficiency
Mining threats in high-level biodiversity conservation policies,"Amid a global infrastructure boom, there is increasing recognition of the ecological impacts of the extraction and consumption of construction minerals, mainly processed as concrete, including significant and expanding threats to global biodiversity. We investigated how high-level national and international biodiversity conservation policies address mining threats, with a special focus on construction minerals. We conducted a review and quantified the degree to which threats from mining these minerals are addressed in biodiversity goals and targets under the 2011–2020 and post-2020 biodiversity strategies, national biodiversity strategies and action plans, and the assessments of the Intergovernmental Science–Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Mining appeared rarely in national targets but more frequently in national strategies. Yet, in most countries, it was superficially addressed. Coverage of aggregates mining was greater than coverage of limestone mining. We outline 8 key components, tailored for a wide range of actors, to effectively mainstream biodiversity conservation into the extractive, infrastructure, and construction sectors. Actions include improving reporting and monitoring systems, enhancing the evidence base around mining impacts on biodiversity, and modifying the behavior of financial agents and businesses. Implementing these measures could pave the way for a more sustainable approach to construction mineral use and safeguard biodiversity. © 2024 The Authors.

Exploring Perceptions of the Impact of Climate Change in three Regions in Peru,"Climate change is directly or indirectly attributed to human activity and is considered the greatest threat to public health of the 21st century. It has impacts on access to water, food, agriculture and livelihoods, and people's health. The objective of this article is to evaluate the perceptions of climate change in children, adolescents, authorities and representatives of youth organizations, women’s organizations and organizations that work with children in the regions of Cusco, Loreto and Piura, in Peru. We conducted a qualitative study using Photovoice with twelve adolescents and in-depth interviews with twenty-two key stakeholders. For the analysis, thematic analysis of the narratives in the photos and of the interviews were used. Extreme changes in weather were identified in all three regions. In the Cusco region they recognized the change in temperature with droughts and frosts, while in Loreto and Piura they showed an increase in rain intensity. In general, these changes affected agriculture. The care of water as a resource, both in its access and quality, was a great concern for all the participants. The study concludes that the concept of climate change as such is not identified, however, they describe changes and variations in theweather that affect their daily activities, particularly agriculture. A cross-cutting theme for all regions was the care and use of the water resource. In addition, young people were particularly enthusiastic about collaborating on future initiatives against climate change. © 2021, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru.

Governing the Interlinkages between the Sustainable Development Goals: Approaches to Attain Policy Integration,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of 2015 form a universal and integrated policy agenda to be realized over the next 15 years. One of the targets is the attainment of policy coherence for sustainable development, which requires the individual goals to become interlinked. This article's main research interest lies in assessing how national governments and their competent ministries interpret and strive to implement the target of policy coherence for sustainable development. Drawing on the Voluntary National Reviews submitted in 2016 and 2017 by six countries, this study shows that at the national level, the links among the different goals and the idea of policy integration are subject to divergent interpretations. The differences observed do not stem from the interlinkages of the SDGs as defined by the United Nations, neither do they result from different levels of income or degree of political centralization. Instead, the respective domestic policy-making processes are likely to explain the implementation strategies adopted by the individual states. For example, the implementation approach adopted by the government of Turkey suggests that path-dependency is critical, whereas the Colombian approach consists of defining new policy measures and institutional arrangements. © 2017 The Authors.

Enhancing HVAC multivariable system performance through hybrid modeling and direct Nyquist Array control,"This study explores a closed-loop multivariable control system for HVAC systems. A hybrid distributed parameter-lumped model was developed using MATLAB’s System Identification Application, resulting in a transfer function matrix. The Direct Nyquist Array (DNA) control strategy was applied, dividing the HVAC system into two SISO loops, each equipped with PID controllers. Stability analysis confirmed system stability according to the Nyquist criterion. Simulation of the system under DNA control showed improved performance over the open-loop setup, with faster response times of nearly 1 s and overshoots between 7% and 15%, maintaining thermal comfort and occupant satisfaction. The system effectively managed ambient heat transfer variations, maintaining desired airflow rate and air temperature. The closed-loop setup exhibited robustness against disturbances, quickly returning to steady-state values. Settling times ranged from 1 to 2 s with minimal impact on HVAC performance. Overall, the closed-loop multivariable DNA control with SISO PID controllers proved reliable for enhancing energy efficiency and thermal comfort in HVAC systems. Practical application: This study provides a comprehensive framework for multivariable control in HVAC systems, significantly benefiting built environment professionals by enhancing energy efficiency and occupant comfort. By applying advanced control strategies, the research offers practical solutions for optimizing HVAC performance, reducing operational costs, and ensuring sustainability in building management. The detailed analysis and methodologies presented can be directly implemented to improve system reliability and responsiveness, thereby supporting professionals in creating smarter, more resilient, and environmentally friendly built environments. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Entering the era of limits and scarcity: The radical implications for social theory,"The article argues that contemporary social theory has not recognized the significance of Limits to Growth. A global overshoot in resource consumption suggests we are at a dramatic turning point in human history, the end of the era of constant 'wealth' expansion and the beginning of an era of severe limits and scarcity. This has profound implications for critical social thought, and for addressing current social problems. Recognizing limits will influence the form that a sustainable and just society must take, and transitions to it. Radical and large scale 'de-growth' involves localized, cooperative, frugal, self-sufficient and self-governing lifestyles, settlements and systems. Key elements in the required 'Simpler Way' are discussed as workable and attractive. More importantly, the article argues that these transitions are non-negotiable; no alternative can resolve the predicament of limits. There are important implications for transition theory and practice. Social theory will pursue new directions in this context, with greater convergence around support for an Anarchist perspective on social goals and means. © 2019, Journal of Political Ecology.; L'article soutient que la théorie sociale contemporaine n'a pas reconnu l'importance de Limits to Growth.

Cela a de profondes implications pour la pensée sociale critique et pour résoudre les problèmes sociaux actuels. Reconnaître les limites influera sur la forme qu'une société durable et juste doit prendre et sur les transitions qui en découlent. La «décroissance» radicale et à grande échelle implique des modes de vie localisés, coopératifs, frugaux, autosuffisants et autonomes. Les éléments clés de la «Simpler Way» (Voie plus simple) requise sont discutés comme étant exploitables et attrayants. Plus important encore, l'article affirme que ces transitions ne sont pas négociables; aucune alternative ne peut résoudre le problème des limites. Il y a des implications importantes pour la théorie et la pratique de la transition. La théorie sociale poursuivra de nouvelles directions dans ce contexte, avec une plus grande convergence autour du soutien d'une perspective anarchiste sur des objectifs et des moyens sociaux. © 2019, Journal of Political Ecology.",Not About Sufficiency
Efficiency criteria and dual techniques for some nonconvex multiple cost minimization models,"In this study, we investigate a class of multi-objective variational control problems governed by nonconvex simple integral functionals. Concretely, we establish and prove (necessary and sufficient) efficiency criteria and dual techniques for some nonconvex multiple cost minimization models. To this aim, we extend and use the concept of (Ψ,ω)-invexity to the case of multi-objective variational control problems. Thereafter, by assuming (Ψ,ω)-invexity, (strictly) (Ψ,ω)-pseudoinvexity and/or (Ψ,ω)-quasiinvexity of the involved functionals, we state the sufficient efficiency criteria and associate a dual problem for the considered model. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Climate Ethics: Environmental Justice and Climate Change,"Climate change is perhaps the most important issue of our time and yet despite the urgency of the problem, the measures necessary to mitigate it have not been implemented. International cooperation has not been forthcoming and there remains a general reluctance towards any major change of lifestyle. Given the urgency of the problem, why has so little been done? In Climate Ethics Joerg Tremmel and Katherine Robinson identify the reasons behind this crucial paradox and propose a way forward. In the first part of the book the authors provide an accessible account of the basics of climate change. In clear and accessible terms they explain the science behind climate change and demystify the complicated terminology that so often hinders a proper understanding of the subject. They identify the substances that cause climate change, reveal which industries are responsible and which aspects of people's everyday lives have the highest emissions connected with them. They explore the consequences of ignoring climate change and, importantly, analyse the obstacles to addressing the issues. In the second part of the book the authors introduce the concept of climate ethics, and explore its importance at a personal, national and international level. They place it firmly at the centre of any successful resolution of the challenges associated with climate change. They review the classical theories of justice and how they relate to climate change, and they examine the complex ethical and moral questions that need to be addressed if long-term solutions are to be found. What moral responsibility do we have to future generations? How should we share out emission rights? Do we take into account past emissions, allowing those who have historically caused more pollution fewer emissions rights than developing countries? Who is to finance the measures to abate climate? And just what is the fairest approach to the politics of climate change on a global scale? The result is an original and timely engagement with one of the most pressing problems facing us and future generations. © 2014 Joerg Tremmel and K. Robinson.",Not About Sufficiency
Socioeconomic backwardness and vulnerability to climate change: evidence from Uttar Pradesh state in India,"This study tests the thesis that ‘vulnerability to climate change is not only a result of biophysical events alone but also influenced by the socioeconomic conditions in which climate change occurs’. The study chose Uttar Pradesh (UP), a state in India, for its importance in the nation's food and nutrition security programme and its high sensitivity to climate change. It uses an indicator approach to see which districts of UP are the most vulnerable to climate change, and attempts to identify the factors on a set of explanatory variables. The study finds that infrastructurally and economically developed districts are less vulnerable to climate change; in other words, vulnerability to climate change and variability is linked with social and economic development. This observation is corroborated by the findings of relational analysis wherein livestock, forestry, consumption of fertilizer, per capita income, and infant mortality rate are observed to be important correlates of vulnerability to climate change. © 2016 University of Newcastle upon Tyne.",Not About Sufficiency
Financial economy: Evolutions at the edge of crises,"This book examines how contemporary financial economy evolved as the predominant economic system, and why unabated accumulation of financial capital takes place in such systems. It reviews the mechanics of accumulation of wealth by tracing the historical roots of financial capital. Traversing the evolutions of capitalist systems since the 1850s till recent times, Financial Economy provides a lucid and logical explanation of the phenomenon. It uses a new methodology based on economic circuit of stocks and flows following the early ideas of the French economists of the 18th century and the contemporary Circuit school. It provides an alternative framework for studying economic systems design, keeping aside the orthodox neoclassical analysis of equilibrium market exchange. Further, it highlights the global financial circuit, the state of the current digitalised economy with electronic money transfers, consumer’s decision-making and expected future earnings, and questions the relevance of some fundamental concepts of economics as well as economic policies. Using a notion of sequential economy, it also shows how present economic activities are treading upon the future. This book will interest students and researchers of advanced macroeconomics, political economy, heterodox economics, economic history, and evolutionary economics. The historical account of the evolutions of capital, interest, and corporate structures will also be of interest to general readers. © 2018 Smita Roy Trivedi and Sutanu Bhattacharya.",Not About Sufficiency
Therapeutic landscape research evidence in eco-neighbourhood design,"This book presents how to recreate therapeutic landscapes in everyday places of eco-neighbourhoods. The concept of eco-neighbourhoods goes beyond the traditional form of a residential district. Eco-neighbourhoods are characterized by many aspects related to sustainability, including protection of the environment, building social capital, ensuring a high quality of life with low economic costs, and promoting social and environmental justice. The presented work aims to systematize these phenomena and interpret them. The action to take care of our common home, the Earth, starts locally. Creating townscapes that can promote everyday health could improve the standards of living on our planet. In both hemispheres, the majority of people live in cities; therefore, examples of good practices described in this book come from all inhabited continents. Education is the most empowering tool, which can change the future for many. Implementing eco-neighbourhoods may bring well-deserved change and hope to people in less-favoured locations of the globe. This book will be of interest to practitioners and students of architecture, civil and environmental engineering, landscape design, spatial management, urban planning, and related fields. © 2025 Monika Trojanowska.

Positive and negative spillover of pro-environmental behavior: An integrative review and theoretical framework,"A recent surge of research has investigated the potential of pro-environmental behavior interventions to affect other pro-environmental behaviors not initially targeted by the intervention. The evidence evaluating these spillover effects has been mixed, with some studies finding evidence for positive spillover (i.e., one pro-environmental behavior increases the likelihood of performing additional pro-environmental behaviors) and others finding negative spillover (i.e., one pro-environmental behavior decreases the likelihood of additional pro-environmental behaviors). Different academic disciplines have investigated this question, employing different methodologies and arriving at divergent findings. This paper provides a unifying theoretical framework and uses the framework to review the existing research on pro-environmental behavior spillover. Our framework identifies different decision modes as competing mechanisms that drive adoption of initial pro-environmental behaviors, with different consequences for subsequent pro-environmental behaviors, leading to positive, negative, or no spillover. Attribution of the initial pro-environmental behavior to either an external motivator (e.g., a price signal) or internal motivator (e.g., self-identity) also matters. In addition, the characteristics of and similarity between initial and subsequent pro-environmental behaviors can be expected to moderate predicted spillover effects. We explore the implications of our model for policymakers and practitioners, and suggest key areas where future research on the topic would be most beneficial. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
The exposome in human evolution: From dust to diesel,"Global exposures to air pollution and cigarette smoke are novel in human evolutionary history and are associated with at least 12 million premature deaths per year. We investigate the history of the human exposome for relationships between novel environmental toxins and genetic changes during human evolution in six phases. Phase I: With increased walking on savannas, early human ancestors inhaled crustal dust, fecal aerosols, and spores; carrion scavenging introduced new infectious pathogens. Phase II: Domestic fire exposed early Homo to novel toxins from smoke and cooking. Phases III and IV: Neolithic to preindustrial Homo sapiens incurred infectious pathogens from domestic animals and dense communities with limited sanitation. Phase V: Industrialization introduced novel toxins from fossil fuels, industrial chemicals, and tobacco at the same time infectious pathogens were diminishing. Thereby, pathogen-driven causes of mortality were replaced by chronic diseases driven by sterile inflammogens, exogenous and endogenous. Phase VI: Considers future health during global warming with increased air pollution and infections. We hypothesize that adaptation to some ancient toxins persists in genetic variations associated with inflammation and longevity. © 2019 by The University of Chicago Press.

Office workers’ sick building syndrome and indoor carbon dioxide concentrations,"This study attempted to determine whether any association exists between sick building syndrome (SBS) and indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. We evaluated SBS among 111 office workers in August and November 2003. The environmental conditions in the office, including CO2 concentrations, temperature, relative humidity, and fine particulatematter (PM2.5), were continuously monitored. The most prevalent symptoms of the five SBS groups were eye irritation and nonspecific and upper respiratory symptoms. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) models show that workers exposed to indoor CO2 levels greater than 800 ppm were likely to report more eye irritation or upper respiratory symptoms. © 2012 JOEH, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
In pursuit of goodwill? The cross-level effects of social enterprise consumer behaviours,"Social innovation and social enterprises have not only changed the concept of operating nonprofit organisations but have also blurred the line between society and business. The current social purpose environment is dynamic and continuously evolving, with firms needing to balance dual social-business goals. This paper employs the decomposed theory of planned behaviour to deconstruct goodwill and commerce factors and analyses the behavioural intentions of consumers when they are purchasing social enterprise products and services. Additionally, this study uses a cross-level perspective to examine the role of reference groups and adopts a hierarchical linear model for verification. The results suggest that consumer behavioural intention increases with the level of perceived behavioural control. Attitude is the main factor influencing consumer purchases of social enterprise products and services. Furthermore, consumers consider the opinions of members of their reference groups when purchasing social enterprise products. This study suggests that social enterprises can communicate service concepts and strengthen product links by highlighting their goodwill-related nature. They should also increase the transparency of organisational operations to enhance consumer confidence in social enterprise products and positive goodwill connectivity. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Green policies and sustainable development in Saudi Arabia,"This chapter discusses the political economy of energy in Saudi Arabia and of the potential impediments and opportunities linked to the timely energy transition. Increasing domestic oil consumption is a prime concern. It is an open question what this choice will bring about given the changing dynamics of the oil players in the international markets. At the same time, current political action is undertaking various diversification plans and environmental initiatives. A question remains on whether the pace of change and commitment to it are sufficient. While energy transition entails several risks for the current socio-economic and industrial structure, it also comes with opportunities linked to the long experience with energy sector developments, capital availability and related labour policies in Saudi Arabia. The analysis concludes that policy making should consider more carefully these opportunities and build on them a resilient energy sector and socio-economic transformation. © Stella Tsani and Indra Overland 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
"Some inconvenient truths about decarbonization, the hydrogen economy, and power-to-X technologies","The decarbonization of the energy sector has been a subject of research and of political discussions for several decades, gaining significant attention in the last years. It is commonly acknowledged that the most obvious way to achieve decarbonization is the use of renewable energy sources. Within the context of the energy sector decarbonization, many mainly industrialized countries recently started developing national plans to establish a hydrogen-based economy in the very near future. The plans for green hydrogen initially try to (a) target sectors that are difficult to decarbonize and (b) address issues related to the storage and transportation of CO2-free energy. To achieve almost complete decarbonization, electric power must be generated exclusively from renewable sources. In so-called Power-to-X (PtX) technologies, green hydrogen is generated from electricity and subsequently converted to another energy carrier which can be further stored, transported and used. In PtX, X stands, for example, for liquid hydrogen, methanol or ammonia. The challenges associated with decarbonization include those associated with (a) the expansion of renewable energies (e.g., high capital demand, political and social issues), (b) the production, transportation, and storage of hydrogen and the energy carriers denoted by X in PtX (e.g., high cost and low overall efficiency), and (c) the expected significant increase in the demand for electrical energy. The paper discusses whether and under which conditions the current national and international hydrogen plans of many industrialized countries could lead to a maximization of decarbonization in the world. It concludes that, in general, as long as the conditions for generating large excess amounts of green electricity are not met, the quick establishment of a hydrogen economy could not only be very expensive, but also counterproductive to the worldwide decarbonization efforts. © 2024 The Author",Not About Sufficiency
What the Fire Has Left Behind: Views and Perspectives of Resin Tappers in Central Greece,"Resin tapping has long been an important traditional economic activity in less advantaged areas that serves as a source for income to local populations as well as an important management tool intricately linked with ecosystem services. In Greece, the majority of the remaining resin tappers are located in communities close to Pinus halepensis stands in the northern part of Evia Island. However, on 3 August 2021, a wildfire burned more than 50,000 Ha in the region, bringing the remaining resin tappers to a standstill. This paper aims to examine the views of 89 resin tappers in N. Evia and their perspectives on their profession as expressed during personal interviews. According to the participants’ replies, resin production is expected to bounce back to pre-fire levels in 40 years. A considerable portion of those interviewed (39.3%) were forced to work in other professions near their communities during the period that followed the fire. They were very dissatisfied by the fire management and initial mitigation actions, and fairly satisfied by the ecosystem recovery works that followed. However, they have high expectations for employment in a seven-year long government-funded support program which will allow them to continue living in their communities, and in this context they are willing to make a professional shift to forest operations work. In this context, the role of state authorities is expected to be crucial. The provision of vocational training and financial incentives could be decisive in preventing them from transitioning to alternative production sectors. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatial and Temporal Evolution of the Chinese Artificial Intelligence Innovation Network,"Sustainable development has become a concern of all countries globally, and Artificial Intelligence technology emerges at this historic moment. However, few researchers have studied the innovation activities of the Artificial Intelligence industry from the macro-level. This paper focuses on the topological structure and the spatial pattern of the AI patent citation network in China over from 2000–2016. Our main research results are as follows: The network has experienced a striking growth in terms of the size and the number of linkages since 2000, but it has also developed unequally across regions. In the later stages, the network has formed a scale-free network that exhibits small-world property. The network nodes have shown an assortative trait property while weighted preferential attachment has not been significant. In addition, the high values of centrality and numerous linkages between nodes concentrate in the eastern part of China, especially in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Bohai Rim. Our results suggest that the AI innovation policies should expand the targets of technological exchange and cultivate more nodes as intermediaries of local knowledge transmission necessary to expand the network and develop the AI industry. © 2022 by the authors.

The spatio-temporal interactions between rapid urbanization and multiple ecosystem services at the county scale in the Poyang Lake Basin,"This study evaluated and compared the spatial and temporal interactions between the comprehensive urbanization level (CUL) and different ecosystem services (ESs) in the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB) using Pearson’s correlation analysis, the coupled coordination degree model, and the geographically and temporally weighted regression model with counties in the PLB as the unit of analysis. The results revealed that, from 2000 to 2020, the CUL at county level in PLB grew faster in general, and the spatial layout of each urbanization indicator was relatively similar. Habitat Quality (HQ), Water Purification (WP) and Water Yield (WY) all showed an increasing trend, while Carbon Storage (CS) and Soil Conservation (SC) all showed a decreasing trend, and there was a large difference in the spatial distribution of ESs. Except for WP, there is a significant negative correlation between urbanization indicators and ESs indicators, with correlation coefficients ranging from −0.84 to −0.22. The coupling coordination of PLB is gradually improving, but the overall level is not satisfactory, and most of the counties are in the state of incongruity. HQ has the highest negative interaction effect with CUL, and the main positive and negative interaction areas are located in the north-central region. © 2025 The Author(s).

A Food Waste Mobile Gamified Application Design Model using UX Agile Approach in Malaysia,"Food waste is a significant worldwide issue in landfill management. Due to improper implementation, technology applications related to food waste collection and its management system are still lacking in practice. The available applications have yet to address the issue of food waste management. Constructing an interactive mobile application is necessary for managing food waste collection for the decomposition process using Black Soldier Fly (BSF) treatment. Furthermore, as the mobile application requires participation from various user backgrounds, maintaining user involvement has become a priority. Gamification has emerged as one of the approaches that might favourably affect individual engagement behaviour. A comprehensive game element design is required where it focuses on how gamification can influence user engagement. This study aims to model the food waste gamified mobile application design to benefit Malaysia's decomposition ecosystem. It includes gamification, management features, and data visualization for reporting and will involve users from households, businesses, and the BSF farm. This paper presents the modelling process of a new mobile application design for this concept of study. The UX agile approach was used in gathering and designing the application requirements as it allows for active participation from all stakeholders. The result shows that the experts agree on the application design. This research will indirectly benefit the BSF industry in Malaysia, and it will have a significant impact on gamification, user experience, and food waste management in the direction of a sustainable environment. © 2022.

Comparative analysis of the gut microbiota in centenarians and young adults shows a common signature across genotypically non-related populations,"Gut microbiota is among the factors that may be involved in healthy aging. Broader and geographically spread studies on gut microbiota of centenarians can help in identifying a common signature of longevity. We identified an endogamous Indian population with high centenarian prevalence. Here, we compared the gut microbiota composition and fecal metabolites of a centenarians group (˜100 years) with young people (25–45 years) of the region with the high centenarian prevalence and the nearby region of low centenarian prevalence to decipher microbial-related longevity signatures. Also, we compared our results with publicly available datasets of similar groups including 125 centenarians from three countries (Italy, Japan, China). Our comparative analysis resulted in higher biodiversity within Ruminococcaceae in centenarians, with respect to younger adults, irrespective of their nationality. We observed bacterial signatures that are common among extremely old people of different nationality. Comparative metabolites profiling identified the fecal metabolic signature of extreme aging in the Indian study population. Our analysis of the co-occurrence network and bimodal distribution of several taxa suggested the establishment of a pervasive change in the gut ecology during extreme aging. Our study might pave the way to develop gut microbiota based biomarkers for healthy aging. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Conservation and Development: Justice, Inequality, and Attitudes around Bwindi Impenetrable National Park","Do national parks promote development in their immediate surroundings? And is local development instrumental in the success of conservation goals? We investigated allocation of opportunities and burdens around a national park in Uganda. Our findings suggest that direct benefits from conservation and development projects may promote distributional justice by compensating for park-related damages, but are too limited in their coverage to impact development. Indirect benefits related to transportation, health, education, and security affect a far greater segment of the population. Furthermore, the benefits of conservation tend to increase local economic inequality. Contrasting tendencies in terms of distributional justice and economic equality can partly be explained by the human geography of national parks and this geography must be taken into account if broad development goals are to be achieved. Improved local attitudes towards the park seem to have resulted from a complex of effects rather than any single development initiative. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
Halophyte plants and their residues as feedstock for biogas production—chances and challenges,"The importance of green technologies is steadily growing. Salt-tolerant plants have been proposed as energy crops for cultivation on saline lands. Halophytes such as Salicornia europaea, Tripolium pannonicum, Crithmum maritimum and Chenopodium quinoa, among many other species, can be cultivated in saline lands, in coastal areas or for treating saline wastewater, and the biomass might be used for biogas production as an integrated process of biorefining. However, halophytes have different salt tolerance mechanisms, including compartmentalization of salt in the vacuole, leading to an increase of sodium in the plant tissues. The sodium content of halophytes may have an adverse effect on the anaerobic digestion process, which needs adjustments to achieve stable and efficient conversion of the halophytes into biogas. This review gives an overview of the specificities of halophytes that needs to be accounted for using their biomass as feedstocks for biogas plants in order to expand renewable energy production. First, the different physiological mechanisms of hal-ophytes to grow under saline conditions are described, which lead to the characteristic composition of the halophyte biomass, which may influence the biogas production. Next, possible mechanisms to avoid negative effects on the anaerobic digestion process are described, with an overview of full-scale applications. Taking all these aspects into account, halophyte plants have a great potential for biogas and methane production with yields similar to those produced by other energy crops and the simultaneous benefit of utilization of saline soils. © 2021 by the authors.

The post-politics of the green economy in Turkey: Re-claiming the future?,"The green economy is often defined as an economic configuration that results in improved human well-being and social equity, while reducing (or at least decoupling from) environmental risks. It is elusive, and can be read as a new way of ensuring and maintaining capital accumulation accompanied by neoliberal austerity policies, where a green rationale is required to maintain the structural roots of the global political economy. As such, critics often identify its self-contradictory nature, in giving legitimacy and coherence to a number of public policies. This article critically examines the post-politicisation of the green economy, by tracing its social construction and meaning-making. In doing so, it follows the green economy debate in the post-politicization of the environment in Turkey, a rapidly developing country with significant socio-ecological challenges. The analysis suggests that the green economy will become more important at Turkey tries to meet international environmental agreements. The article sheds light on its preparatory report for the Rio+20 Summit, titled Turkey's sustainable development report: claiming the future 2012. We find that the green economy serves as a useful discursive tool to legitimize a state-facilitated, market-driven, full-frontal assault on ecosystems in Turkey, particularly in the energy sector. We argue that a clear rejection of such framings and the development of alternatives to post-politicization, are the two key challenges facing the environmental movement in the country. © 2020, University of Arizona Libraries.",Not About Sufficiency
Opinions of preschool teachers and pre-service teachers on environmental education and environmental awareness for sustainable development in the preschool period,"This research is a qualitative study to determine the opinions of preschool teachers and pre-service teachers on environmental education and environmental awareness for sustainable development. The phenomenology approach, which focuses on individuals' own experiences and the meaning of a phenomenon, was used in this direction. The study group of the research consisted of 68 preschool teachers and 72 pre-service preschool teachers. In the study, a semi-structured interview form consisting of open-ended questions was used as a data collection tool. The content analysis technique was used in the analysis of the data obtained from the interview form. According to the research results, it can be said that pre-service teachers have more theoretical knowledge than teachers and teachers have more practical knowledge than pre-service teachers. This can be explained by the fact that the knowledge that pre-service teachers obtain at university is quite new, they spend more limited time with children within the scope of applied courses, teachers communicate much more with children every day and they are more distant from theoretical knowledge. Furthermore, it can be said that teachers and pre-service teachers are sensitive towards environmental problems, interested in environmental education, willing and open to development. © 2019 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Socioeconomic value of Savannas,"The socioeconomic benefits associated with savannas are strongly determined by land use, which, in turn, is heavily influenced by land tenure system. Customary or communal tenure systems predominate across the savannas of Africa. During the era of colonization by Europeans, livestock ranching became one of the prevailing modes of land appropriation and use by settlers in the savannas of Africa, the Americas, and Australia. Today, two broad livestock farming systems exist in savannas: commercial ranching and subsistence or semi-commercial pastoralism. The socioeconomic value of livestock, and hence of savanna vegetation, is quite different between these two systems. Savannas are central to the sustainability of the livelihoods of millions of rural households who depend on them for direct provisioning of resources, as well as a means of making a living. They also make a significant contribution to the economies of countries, through revenue generated from the wildlife industry, commercial livestock farming, and the timber industry. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Analyzing the nexus between energy transition, environment and ICT: A step towards COP26 targets","In line with the Sustainable Development Goals and the recent COP26 summit, energy transition, low carbon emissions and technology have become extremely important subjects in the agenda of governments and policymakers. The present study thus discusses the nexus between energy transition, economic growth, CO2 emissions and information and communications technology (ICT) in BRICS countries applying the novel GMM-PVAR method proposed on the annual data for the period 2000–2017. This method is strong to the issue of endogeneity which is commonly faced in the context of panel data analysis but mostly ignored in the literature. The findings of this research demonstrate that carbon emissions have a positive and significant effect on energy transition; similarly, raising economic growth augments the consumption of energy transition. Furthermore, ICT is found to be a significant choice in the development of energy transition and the solution of environmental challenges. Overall, technological factors in addition to economic and environmental factors also have great roles in the development of renewable energy and energy transition. Thus, results from this study call for government supports to develop ICT across the BRICS countries. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
A Novel Strategy for Waste Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithm with IoT Based Intelligent Waste Management System,"Internet of Things (IoT) has now become an embryonic technology to elevate the whole sphere into canny cities. Hasty enlargement of smart cities and industries leads to the proliferation of waste generation. Waste can be pigeon-holed as materials-based waste, hazard potential based waste, and origin-based waste. These waste categories must be coped thoroughly to make certain of the ecological finest run-throughs irrespective of the origin or hazard potential or content. Waste management should be incorporated into ecological preparation since it is a grave piece of natural cleanliness. The most important goalmouth of waste management is to maintain the pecuniary growth and snootier excellence of life by plummeting and exterminating adversative repercussions of waste materials on environment and human health. Disposing of unused things is a significant issue, and this ought to be done in the best manner by deflecting waste development and keeping hold of cost, and it involves countless human resources to deal with the waste. These current techniques predominantly focus on cost-effective monitoring of waste management, and results are not imprecise, so that it could not be developed in real time or practically applications such as in educational organizations, hospitals, and smart cities. Internet of things-based waste management system provides a real-time monitoring system for collecting the garbage waste, and it does not control the dispersion of overspill and blowout gases with poor odor. Consequently, it leads to the emission of radiation and toxic gases and affects the environment and social well-being and induces global warming. Motivated by these points, in this research work, we proposed an automatic method to achieve an effective and intelligent waste management system using Internet of things by predicting the possibility of waste things. The wastage capacity, gas level, and metal level can be monitored continuously using IoT based dustbins, which can be placed everywhere in city. Then, our proposed method can be tested by machine learning classification techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest algorithm. The proposed method is investigated with machine learning classification techniques in terms of accuracy and time analysis. Random forest algorithm gives the accuracy of 92.15% and time consumption of 0.2 milli seconds. From this analysis, our proposed method with random forest algorithm is significantly better compared to other classification techniques. © 2022 G. Uganya et al.",Not About Sufficiency
"The role of village land forest reserves in the implementation of land use plans: Experience from the REDD+ initiative, Tanzania","The role of Village Participatory Land Use Plans (VPLUPs) and associated Village Land Forest Reserves (VLFRs) under the REDD+ initiative is a fairly new concept with limited information on the success of its implementation. This study examined community perceptions of VPLUPs as well as their perceptions of the inclusion of VLFRs in these plans in the Kilosa district of Tanzania. A mixed method research design, which integrates participatory community mapping (PCM), focus group discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews (KIIs), direct observations and household interviews were applied. Results indicated a significant involvement of the respondents (84%) in the process of implementation of VPLUPs, especially in meetings (95%). A significant majority (91%) favoured the inclusion of VLFRs in VPLUPs. Most of the respondents (85%) were satisfied with the implementation process of VPLUPs and most (94%) were willing to adhere to VPLUPs initiatives. Both challenges to and supportive factors for the implementation of VPLUPs were identified by the respondents. Due to the current high levels of participation in the initiative and potentially agreeable outcomes, it is concluded that VPLUPs and VLFRs might contribute to sustainable implementation of the REDD+ initiative. © 2018 Commonwealth Forestry Association. arights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Relationship between energy consumption and environmental sustainability in OECD countries: The role of natural resources rents,"This study investigates the impact of disaggregated energy consumption and natural resources on environmental sustainability for the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. To this end, CO2 emissions, ecological footprint and carbon footprint data covering the period 1980–2016 are used as proxies for environmental deterioration. The study applies an advanced panel data estimation tool, augmented mean group (AMG) estimator, for the long-run estimation, that allows dependencies across countries and heterogeneity in the slope parameters. The findings of the study indicate that non-renewable energy has a detrimental effect on the environment, while renewable energy reduces deterioration in the environment in terms of ecological footprint and carbon footprint. Natural resource extraction contributes to increasing CO2 emissions, whereas its role is not statistically significant in ecological footprint and carbon footprint. The study provides empirical evidence revealing the requirement for efficient and sustainable natural resource utilization, together with the increasing rate of renewable energy in the energy mix to achieve a sustainable environment and development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Examining the role of nuclear and renewable energy in reducing carbon footprint: Does the role of technological innovation really create some difference?,"The deployment of energy sources is considered the compassion of several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Countries should keep balance with the three major proportions of the global energy trilemma: energy security, affordability, energy access, and ecological balance to construct a solid basis for competitiveness and prosperity. In this regard, this study examines the influence of nuclear energy, technological innovations, renewable energy, non-renewable energy, and natural resources on carbon footprint in the highest nuclear energy-producing countries from 1990 to 2019. To do this, we developed an inclusive and comprehensive empirical investigation and applied modern econometric approaches. Panel second-generation long-run cointegration advocates long-run associations among the series. The findings reveal that nuclear and renewable energy consumption extensively improve environmental excellence. Conversely, technological innovations and non-renewable energy significantly reduce environmental sustainability. Moreover, natural resources play an adverse role in long-run. The findings of the panel causality test discovered unidirectional causality is running from carbon footprint to nuclear energy. Additionally, bidirectional causality exists between technological innovations, renewables, non-renewables, and natural resources with carbon footprint. This recommends that these nations should integrate energy policy activities and develop energy strategy consistency by harmonizing the vital global nuclear energy aspects to assist a well-calibrated energy structure. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

The traditional approach of non-profit organizations can be reinterpreted as a form of institutional entrepreneurship providing society with new ideas and values. In a globalized post crisis ethical governance, institutional entrepreneurs will be as useful as social entrepreneurs. Governments are looking for a grassroots sector able to counterbalance the forces of the market. Considering the partial failure of alterglobalization, this invitation may be a last opportunity for non-profit organizations to make a socio-political contribution. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Indigenous Resource and Institutional Capital: The Role of Local Context in Embedding Sustainable Community Development,"Although scholars agree that local context is critical in a firm's commitment to sustainable development, questions remain about how this context plays a role in achieving simultaneous goals of sustainable community development and firm strategic success. By sampling two groups of firms differentiated according to their adoption of a weak or strong orientation to sustainable development, this author searched for relevant explanations from the local context that help to answer this very question. Results point to indigenous resource and institutional capital, the combination of which assists the firm in its ability to embed sustainable development. Whereas more tangible forms of capital assist in the strategy implementation process, less tangible forms of capital influence the strategy formulation process. What is more, firms tended to progress sequentially in the appropriation of these forms of capital as a result of the strengthening of the relationship with contextual stakeholders. © 2012 SAGE Publications.",Not About Sufficiency
A first analysis on the need to integrate ecological aspects into financial insurance,"It is known that financial insurance can address the economic impacts of a natural disaster, but some ecological aspects can play a crucial role in mitigating the overall risks for socio-ecological systems. To better strengthen the study of these relations, the aims of this paper are: (1) to analyze the main research topics of the scientific literature on ecological and/or financial-economic insurance to face natural disasters, through a co-word network analysis; (2) to analyze the temporal trends of the total Gross Insurance Premium and Meteorological and climatological extreme events in 29 OECD countries; and (3) to carry out a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of some selected variables in order to conceptualize a first empirical model combining financial-economic and ecological insurance to face natural disasters. The literature review has shown a predominance of topics related to financial insurance (about 60%), and the co-word map of key words has highlighted a common space where economic and ecological insurances interact. PCA highlighted three major components explaining 90.6% of the overall variation and discriminating aspects more related to the “financial” insurance, from those related to the “ecological” insurance. More in detail, PC1, which represents the financial insurance, explains the 60.4% of variation, PC2 and PC3 that represent surrogates of the “ecological” insurance explain respectively the 19.6% and the 10.6% of variation. On the basis of the application of the proposed empirical model, countries with high levels of financial and ecological preparedness have been identified. The next steps of this research will be focused on a pilot study area where a quantitative assessment will be applied to better define the landscape contribution to natural disaster risk mitigation, the analysis of the role of social capital through a cross-scales approach, in terms of policies and management strategies, and the investigation of innovative economic tools to take into account specific payment for ecosystem services in the context of natural disasters. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impacts of EU Cohesion Policy on Sustainable Tourism: The Case of POSEUR in Algarve,"Sustainable tourism is a main priority of European Union policies, with the aim of mitigating the potential harmful consequences of this sector on a given territory. The main research goal of this article is to better understand the impact of the public investments financed via EU Cohesion Policy in the tourism sector in the Portuguese Algarve NUT2. This paper focuses on the Portuguese Operational Programme for Sustainability and Efficient Use of Resources (POSEUR 20142020), which was an operational programme of a Portuguese framework to implement EU Cohesion Policy funds in Portugal between 2014 and 2020, and was specifically focused on supporting sustainable development processes. The sustainability performance of POSEUR in the Algarve was evaluated in five different dimensions of analysis: (1) low-emissions economy, (2) adaptation to climate change, (3) risk prevention and management, (4) environmental protection, and (5) resource efficiency. The results showed that POSEUR had a low impact in almost all dimensions in the Algarve, apart from the adaptation to climate change dimension, which exhibits a high impact score, mostly due to the support given for carrying out the Plans for Adaptation to Climate Change (PAAC). © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable Development Aspects of Smart Environments and Green Technology: Case of Environmental Law,"This article discusses the importance of smart environments and green technology for sustainable development and their relationship with environmental law. Smart environments are physical spaces that aim to improve quality of life, increase efficiency and promote sustainability through the integration of various technologies. Green technology covers innovations that aim to reduce environmental impact, protect resources and reduce pollution. In this article, we examine the potential for smart environments and green technology to combine to reduce environmental impact, stimulate economic growth, and promote social justice. We also consider the impact of these technologies on environmental law and the legal implications of their implementation. Environmental law includes legal frameworks that aim to protect natural resources, maintain biodiversity and reduce pollution. However, the effective implementation of this law faces several challenges, including legal uncertainty, lack of oversight, and institutional barriers. Smart environments emphasize the critical importance of green technology and environmental law for sustainable development. Through technology, policy and social collaboration, we can address environmental challenges, promote social equity and build more resilient and inclusive societies. However, a determined commitment and collaboration is required to achieve these goals. We must prioritize investments in smart, green solutions and strengthen legal frameworks to ensure a sustainable future for future generations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

Building Blocks for a Precautionary Approach to the Use of Nanomaterials: Positions Taken by Trade Unions and Environmental NGOs in the European Nanotechnologies Debate,"As partners in the European capacity-building project NanoCap, trade unions and environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have established positions on the development of nanotechnologies. Key in their positioning is their view that the use of nanomaterials with currently unknown occupational and environmental hazards must have consequences for the risk management and use of nanoproducts. They have made proposals for responsible manufacturing and for applying the precautionary principle to the use of nanoproducts and they urgently call for the acceptance and the operationalization of a precautionary approach by the industry and governments. The trade unions and NGOs are calling for transparency and openness regarding processes and products that contain nanomaterials and have proposed specific tools for nanomaterial use that put the precautionary principle into practice, including the principles no data → no exposure and no data → no emission. The proposed tools also include compulsory reporting of the type and content of nanoparticles applied in products, a register of workers possibly exposed to nanoparticles, and the use of nano reference values as guides to assess workplace exposure to nanoparticles. © 2011 Society for Risk Analysis.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing stakeholder perceptions of landscape and place in the context of a major river intervention: A call for their inclusion in adaptive management,"Adaptive management strategies are required to manage multi-actor and multifunctional river landscapes. Such strategies need to be inclusive of perspectives of different stakeholders. We present a case study of a pilot engineering project in the Dutch river Waal, which drastically changed the appearance of the river landscape. We study perceptions of four stakeholder groups (residents, recreational anglers, recreational boaters and shipping professionals) regarding the impacts of this intervention on landscape values, including aesthetics, naturalness, biodiversity, flood safety and accessibility. Results show that stakeholders differ in which functions of the river landscape they find important and how they perceive the longitudinal dams to influence the landscape. They also differ in levels of place attachment and trust in the responsible authority. Shipping professionals stand out for their more negative evaluations of the dams compared to the other stakeholders, while especially residents demonstrate high levels of place identity and connection with nature. Residents also feel that the dams are improving flood risk safety in the area, and they positively evaluate knowledge and skills of Dutch water managers. These results provide water managers with much needed insights into landscape functions valued by different stakeholder groups and those perceived as most endangered by landscape interventions. © 2020 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Agroforestry-Based Ecosystem Services: Reconciling Values of Humans and Nature in Sustainable Development,"Agroforestry as active area of multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary research aims to bridge several artificial divides that have respectable historical roots but hinder progress toward sustainable development goals. These include: (1) The segregation of ""forestry trees"" and ""agricultural crops"", ignoring the continuity in functional properties and functions; the farm-scale ""Agroforestry-1"" concept seeks to reconnect perennial and annual, woody and nonwoody plants across the forest-agriculture divide to markets for inputs and outputs. (2) The identification of agriculture with provisioning services and the assumed monopoly of forests on other ecosystem services (including hydrology, carbon storage, biodiversity conservation) in the landscape, challenged by the opportunity of ""integrated"" solutions at landscape scale as the ""Agroforestry-2"" concept explores. (3) The gaps among local knowledge of farmers/agroforesters as landscape managers, the contributions of social and ecological sciences, the path-dependency of forestry, environmental or agricultural institutions, and emerging policy responses to ""issue attention cycles"" in the public debate, as is the focus of the ""Agroforestry-3"" concept. Progress in understanding social-ecological-economic systems at the practitioners-science-policy interface requires that both instrumental and relational values of nature are appreciated, as they complement critical steps in progressing issue cycles at the three scales.

"Just Dead, Not Alive: Reconsidering Belief in Contradictory Conspiracy Theories","A well-established finding is that beliefs in contradictory conspiracy theories (e.g., Princess Diana was murdered vs. faked her own death) are positively correlated. This is commonly interpreted as evidence that people systematically believe blatant inconsistencies. Here, we propose that the field has insufficiently acknowledged a compelling alternative explanation: Disbelieving both conspiracy theories also yields a positive correlation. In four preregistered studies (total N = 7,641 adults), online participants evaluated 28 sets of contradictory conspiracy theories. Although the positive correlation was replicated in all cases, this was mostly due to participants who believed the official versions of these events (e.g., Princess Diana died in a car accident). Among participants who disbelieved these official stories, the correlation was inconsistent at best. A mini meta-analysis revealed a negative correlation among these participants, which was particularly due to the dead-or-alive cases. Apparently, researchers should reconsider the notion of systematic belief in contradictory conspiracy theories. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
"Trade-offs in adapting to changes in climate, land use, and water availability in california","Changes in land use and land cover, water systems, and climate are inextricably linked, and their combined stresses have had severe impacts in many regions worldwide. Integrated adaptation planning can support adaptive capacity by helping institutions manage land and water resources at regional to local scales. Linkages between these stressors mean that planners are often faced with potential trade-offs, and how to couple social and environmental sustainability remains a key question. We explore these questions in California’s Central Coast, a region that is already experiencing serious water shortages, housing shortages, rapid expansion of perennial agriculture, and severe droughts that are projected to become worse with climate change. Linked models of land use change (the Land Use and Carbon + Water Simulator [LUCAS-W]), water resources (LUCAS-W), and climate (the Basin Characterization Model [BCM]) produced forecasts of exposure to regional changes at 270-m resolution. We worked with regional stakeholders to develop a matrix of nine vulnerability measures that assessed key sensitivities to these changes. Each vulnerability measure combined one of the three exposure projections with spatial datasets representing one of three sensitivity communities (agricultural, domestic, or ecological). We assessed how five scenarios of land-use and water management strategies under consideration by regional planners could provide institutional, top-down adaptive capacity, and whether there were trade-offs in sustainable development goals for these communities. We found that specific land and water management strategies could greatly reduce regional vulnerability, particularly programs to cap water extractions to sustainable levels. The most dramatic trade-off was between the strategy of water demand caps that increased risk of habitat loss and ecosystem preservation that increased water vulnerability. However, trade-offs were usually limited and spatially localized, suggesting local tailoring of the strategies we assessed could reduce them. Trade-offs were more frequent across exposure classes (land use vs. water vs. climate changes) rather than sensitivity classes (agricultural vs. domestic vs. ecological communities), suggesting win-win opportunities for natural resource management. Our vulnerability maps can inform prioritization efforts for local adaptation planning. © 2023 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
People and Data: solving planetary challenges together,"The advancement of computing and information collection technologies has created vast amounts of data describing the world surrounding us. Yet, our planet continues to face unprecedented challenges, including climate change and biodiversity loss. How do we effectively use this information in an open and collaborative way to tackle these planetary-scale issues? We propose a stronger synergistic integration between people and data as we work toward a healthy planet: crowd empowerment in the collection and analysis of data as well as in the identification and implementation of actionable solutions. We use our unique experience as a diverse winning team of the EY Better Working World 2022 global data challenge to illustrate the great potential and current limitations of such an approach. With the objective of fighting biodiversity loss, we were asked to develop a predictive frog multi-species distribution model using occurrence data, gathered from the FrogID app, and environmental conditions. Despite the great potential of global data challenges focused on planetary health, they comprise about 6% of all challenges in the last 5 years. Moreover, though open in principle, in practice, pre-existing disparities limit the inclusion of a diverse crowd. To address existing gaps, we propose practical guidelines to realize the “People and Data” vision: fostering collaboration, seeking funding, enhancing diversity, and ensuring long-term sustainability. In this way, we can tackle the great challenges our world is facing. Copyright © 2024 Vanalli, Howerton, Yang, Tran and Hu.",Not About Sufficiency
Geospatial Ecological Footprint Calculators Through Participatory and Collective Processes,"The Environmental Office of the University of A Coruña has developed a series of participatory tools that calculate the carbon footprint of an individual in various areas (energy, mobility, water use, and waste generation). There are easy-to-use carbon footprint calculators available internationally, but they lack a focus on prevention and adaptation to local scenarios. Resolving this shortcoming at the Galician level was the main objective of the tools developed, aimed at the general population and particularly their use in collective projects at all levels of education. These tools make people aware of the impact on the environment and consumption habits. Formulated for educational purposes, Emapic-OMA tools contribute to the dissemination of alternatives to reduce environmental impacts, helping to move toward more sustainable lifestyles, as required by the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, these online calculators allow to locate the participants. This helps to identify geographical areas with different behaviors and establish appropriate policies in each region. Each calculator works independently, but participants can associate their answers to have a more complete view of the carbon footprint they generate. Depending on the answers to the questions asked, different parameters such as CO2 emissions generated per year or amount of waste produced are calculated. The individual results are also compared with the country average and the established targets. Specific recommendations are made for each participant according to the results obtained. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
"Methodological Proposal to Evaluate Touristic Activity with Local Sustainability Criteria in the Hydrographic Sub-Basins of the Huasteca Potosina, Mexico","This work presents a methodological proposal based on a system of sustainability indicators through the Framework for the Evaluation of Natural Resource Management Systems Incorporating Sustainability Indicators, from which a comparative analysis of the Huasteca Potosina tourism systems was carried out, with the purpose of establishing interregional comparison standards. The indicators allowed the monitoring and evaluation of the degree of sustainability of the sub-basins by means of initiatives of citizen participation in the processes of planning of the main tourist destinations in the regional scope. In this way, it was possible to identify the conditions that limit and strengthen the development of sustainability in tourism, in order to foster a reflection on the commitments that can be adopted by tourism service providers to carry out actions that promote equity and improve the living conditions of the inhabitants of the local communities through the adequate conservation and restoration of the ecosystems from an ecological and social context that allows to develop an alternative model of sustainable tourism. The results generated criteria to formulate recommendations that contribute to the sustainable development of the region through the decision-making of the local population and the public administration; this is why this article is essential for the creation of measurement tools used to determine the evaluation methods for tourism activity in rural areas. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Gene expression associations with body mass index in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis,"Background/objectives: Obesity, defined as excessive fat accumulation that represents a health risk, is increasing in adults and children, reaching global epidemic proportions. Body mass index (BMI) correlates with body fat and future health risk, yet differs in prediction by fat distribution, across populations and by age. Nonetheless, few genetic studies of BMI have been conducted in ancestrally diverse populations. Gene expression association with BMI was assessed in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) in four self-identified race and ethnicity (SIRE) groups to identify genes associated with obesity. Subjects/methods: RNA-sequencing was performed on 1096 MESA participants (37.8% white, 24.3% Hispanic, 28.4% African American, and 9.5% Chinese American) and linear models were used to assess the association of expression from each gene for its effect on BMI, adjusting for age, sex, sequencing center, study site, five expression and four genetic principal components in each self-identified race group. Sample-size-weighted meta-analysis was performed to identify genes with BMI-associated expression across ancestry groups. Results: Within individual SIRE groups, there were zero to three genes whose expression is significantly (p < 1.97 × 10–6) associated with BMI. Across all groups, 45 genes were identified by meta-analysis whose expression was significantly associated with BMI, explaining 29.7% of BMI variation. The 45 genes are expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types and are enriched for obesity-related processes including erythrocyte function, oxygen binding and transport, and JAK-STAT signaling. Conclusions: We have identified genes whose expression is significantly associated with obesity in a multi-ethnic cohort. We have identified novel genes associated with BMI as well as confirmed previously identified genes from earlier genetic analyses. These novel genes and their biological pathways represent new targets for understanding the biology of obesity as well as new therapeutic intervention to reduce obesity and improve global public health. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Moving Towards Sustainability? An Analysis of CITES' Conservation Policies,"The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has been criticised for following a narrow preservationist agenda centred on protecting charismatic species through trade-restrictive policies that disregard the livelihood strategies of communities living alongside wildlife. More recently, however, parties to CITES have embraced the sustainability discourse and taken steps to address the socio-economic dimensions of wildlife trade. This paper examines the policies developed by CITES' Parties at four recent meetings, with a view to determining whether they are founded on a holistic understanding of socio-environmental dynamics. It concludes that CITES' conservation approach remains rooted in a conception of sustainability that treats people and wildlife as separate entities, and where species conservation takes priority over human development. Nonetheless, CITES does appear to be moving towards a more all-encompassing perception of sustainability where focus is on ecosystems rather than ensuring the survival of single species. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.",Not About Sufficiency
SECURING SOUTH AFRICAN STUDENTS A PLACE IN A SCIENCE COMMUNITY THROUGH CONSTRUCTIVIST CONFIRMATIVE ASSESSMENT,"Upon first entering the programme, Bachelor of Science (BSc) students are expected to adapt to a discipline-specific environment within a given university discourse community. Thus, writing within a scientific discourse convention becomes an important field of interest, especially for students who register for a BSc degree for the first time at a health science university in South Africa. However, language lecturers can approach assessment strategically to benefit science students. To this end, some assessment types can be used to assess integrated science subjects and language. That strategy would be ideal because it could determine students’ proficiency levels. Therefore, this paper discusses the results of a laboratory report-writing test written by students first entering HSU against this background. This paper is embedded in a study about the assessment of students’ laboratory report-writing skills upon first entering their courses. The study followed a quantitative approach with an exploratory research design. Purposive sampling was employed to select students who sat for a confirmative laboratory report writing criterion-referenced test before instruction could commence at the university. The students’ written laboratory reports were marked and analysed following a marking guide regarding the aim, approach, method and findings of an experiment conducted in Grade 12. The study found that the students performed poorly in the laboratory report-writing test. © 2024, Department of General Linguistics, Stellenbosch University.

Performance enhancement of a diesel engine using nanoparticle-enriched algae biodiesel-diesel blends with an electrostatic precipitator for nanoparticle emission control,"This study focuses on the development of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) system to mitigate nanoparticle emissions from a diesel engine fueled by aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticle-enriched algae biodiesel-diesel blends. Spirulina microalgae biodiesel was blended with diesel fuel at concentrations of 15 % and 30 %, and the energy and environmental performance were evaluated in a single-cylinder engine. To enhance the overall efficiency, 100 ppm of Al2O3 nanoparticles were dispersed into the fuel blends, and the improvements in energy and environmental metrics were assessed. A two-stage ESP was installed at the engine exhaust to capture emitted nanoparticles, which were collected on ESP plates. The results revealed that increasing the biodiesel concentration led to a rise in brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by 11.3 %, a reduction in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 10.4 %, and an increase in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by 7.4 %. However, emissions of hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) decreased under these conditions. Conversely, the incorporation of Al2O3 nanoparticles into the fuel blend reduced BSFC by 5.9 %, decreased NOx emissions by 10.4 %, and improved BTE by 8.1 %, while further lowering HC and CO emissions. To evaluate the ESP's nanoparticle suppression capabilities, characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy were applied to both synthesized nanoparticles and those collected from the ESP plates. The findings confirm that the ESP effectively captures a broad range of particles, including agglomerated nanoparticles and combustion by-products, significantly reducing particulate emissions from the engine exhaust. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Thermal energy storage co-benefits in building applications transferred from a renewable energy perspective,"Although one of the main aims of using renewable energy sources in building applications is to reduce the environmental impact caused by the high global energy demand of buildings, it can also produce other positive effects, known as co-benefits. Thermal energy storage technologies are often used in building applications, either integrated into the renewable system or independently, for energy savings or energy efficiency reasons. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to identify the co-benefits of the use of thermal energy storage in buildings by cross-sectorizing the renewable energy and thermal energy storage sectors. To this end, this article first reviews the literature on the co-benefits of renewable energy for building applications, followed by an evaluation on how these co-benefits can be attributed to thermal energy storage in buildings. As a result of a keywords analysis, the main co-benefits of thermal energy storage were identified related to environmental, health, economic, cost, and policies aspects. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Transition management for sustainable personal mobility: The case of hydrogen fuel cells,"In the Dutch National Environmental Policy Plan 4 it has been recognised that persistent environmental problems (such as global warming caused by greenhouse gases) cannot be solved by traditional policy instruments or by technological innovation alone. Transitions are necessary and have been defined as long-term, continuous processes in which a society or a subsystem changes fundamentally - interconnected changes that reinforce each other in technology, the economy, institutions, ecology, culture, behaviour and belief systems. One of the examples where transitions are necessary is in the realm of mobility. Although there is currently no accepted single strategy, promising new options are increased multimodal chain mobility (in order to reduce car mobility), and a transition towards a sustainable fuel infrastructure. In the last few years leadin g car companies have been investing in fuel-cell technologies, possibly requiring new infrastructures based on hydrogen. Innovation in the direction of hydrogen fuel cells requires a future vision that is shared by many stakeholders, collaboration between many public and private stakeholders, and experimentation in bounded socio-technical experiments, in which second-order learning processes take place about the nature of the technology, about collaboration between stakeholders with various interests, and about sustainable solutions for the future.

LC-IMPACT: A regionalized life cycle damage assessment method,"Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is a lively field of research, and data and models are continuously improved in terms of impact pathways covered, reliability, and spatial detail. However, many of these advancements are scattered throughout the scientific literature, making it difficult for practitioners to apply the new models. Here, we present the LC-IMPACT method that provides characterization factors at the damage level for 11 impact categories related to three areas of protection (human health, ecosystem quality, natural resources). Human health damage is quantified as disability adjusted life years, damage to ecosystem quality as global species extinction equivalents (based on potentially disappeared fraction of species), and damage to mineral resources as kilogram of extra ore extracted. Seven of the impact categories include spatial differentiation at various levels of spatial scale. The influence of value choices related to the time horizon and the level of scientific evidence of the impacts considered is quantified with four distinct sets of characterization factors. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method with an illustrative life cycle assessment example of different fuel options in Europe (petrol or biofuel). Differences between generic and regionalized impacts vary up to two orders of magnitude for some of the selected impact categories, highlighting the importance of spatial detail in LCIA.

Quantitative analysis of natural resource regulations leading to coastal ecosystems sustainability: Mexico as a case study,"One of the issues identified in natural resources management leading to overexploitation has to do with a limited or weak legislative framework. The aim was to analyze a quantitative approach evaluating the contribution of different legislative instruments of Mexico on coastal ecosystems sustainability. A case study was employed, and a practical appraisal method that allows identification of sustainability criteria embedded in the legislative instruments was generated. Forty-three Mexican legislative instruments were evaluated, and 60 sustainability attributes were considered. Trends and consistency regarding objectives, times of law application, orientation to systems or to resources, legal and institutional interactions, scientific support, unpredicted impacts of productive activities (non-regulated) and performance evaluation were analyzed. A multivariate analysis was performed to map the interrelations among legislative instruments. On a global scale, legislative instruments only fit in 25% of global sustainability attributes when compared with the two references defined as ideal. Multiple objectives and some systemic approaches were well represented among the analyzed instruments, and regulation of some coastal areas and ecosystems, such as reefs, need to be deeply strengthened. It can be concluded that the proposed approach is useful to obtain a rapid appraisal to evaluate the overall contribution of legislative instruments on ecosystems sustainability. This information will guide legislative authorities in the development of instruments that could strengthen legislative framework in order to efficiently promote ecosystems sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
GUIDEBOOK FOR ALIGNING PRACTICES AND STEERING MULTI-SYSTEM CHANGE: From Intervention to Social Change II,"Building on the work of the authors’ previous volume, the Guidebook for Aligning Practices and Steering Multi-System Change translates cutting-edge theoretical concepts into the language and applied toolkits of change practitioners. This empirically grounded and theoretically sophisticated book provides policymakers and change-managers methods and toolkits for conceptual modelling of change when handling cross-sectoral issues. The authors both ‘zoom in’ to the granular unfolding change of everyday life and ‘zoom out’ to examine the ‘big picture’ of socio-technical systems such as energy, mobility, food and healthcare. In addition to the social practice theories introduced in the first volume, the authors draw on the multi-level perspective that underpins sustainability transition studies and combine two theories. They are also inspired by the Deep Transition concept that tackles multi-systems change. Bridging the gap between the theorisation of sustainability transitions and practical guidelines, it will appeal to policymakers, sustainability project managers and students of management, social and political sciences, technology and innovation. © 2025 Triin Vihalemm, Margit Keller and Maie Kiisel.",Not About Sufficiency
"A REVIEW OF MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION-MAKING METHODS FOR BUILDING ASSESSMENT, SELECTION, AND RETROFIT","Multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) has experienced significant growth in recent years, owing to its capac-ity to integrate even contradictory criteria. This study conducted a comprehensive literature review of MCDM for assessing, selecting, and retrofitting buildings. The bibliometric search used a search algorithm in specialized databases. A filtering and expansion process was done by reviewing references, and 91 relevant articles were selected. The analysis revealed that in a group of studies, socioeconomic criteria were used to assess the vulnerability of buildings. On the other hand, some research integrated the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, social, and environmental) along with safety consid-erations when identifying optimal retrofit alternatives. Classic MCDMs are prevalent in research within this field. Among the most used methods, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed for criteria weighting, Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) for constructing vulnerability indices, and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for building retrofitting. This literature review contributes to the path toward a holistic renovation of the existing building stock, providing recommendations for future research to improve decision-making solutions for integrating the safety and sustainability of existing buildings. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Divergent growth paths: Conflict, state capacity, and convergence clubs in Sub-Saharan Africa","Understanding the patterns of economic convergence in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is crucial for explaining the diverse growth trajectories observed across the region. This study investigates the presence of convergence clubs in GDP among 37 SSA countries from 1992 to 2022, departing from the foundational neoclassic economic theories. Employing the Phillips and Sul club convergence methodology, the study identifies four distinct convergence clubs, rejecting the hypothesis of overall convergence towards a single equilibrium. This finding highlights the developmental challenges across SSA. A subsequent analysis using an ordered logit model explores the determinants of club membership, revealing that state capacity, conflict, and business environment significantly influence SSA countries likelihood of belonging to a higher GDP club while foreign direct investment impact appears to be conditional on these very same factors. These results highlight the critical need for development organizations such as the World Bank or the United Nations to take a more nuanced and context-specific approach to their projects in Sub Saharan African countries. Aligning development interventions with the root causes of divergence identified in this study, such as weak state capacity or conflict, can unlock the potential for transformative and equitable progress in SSA. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The effects of agricultural technological progress on deforestation: What do we really know?,"Increasing agricultural yields seem an obvious way to satisfy increasing demands for food and fuel while minimizing expansion of agriculture into forest areas; however, an influential literature worries that promoting agricultural innovation could enhance agriculture's profitability thereby encouraging deforestation. Clarifying the effects of agricultural technological progress on deforestation is therefore crucial for designing effective policy responses to the challenges faced by global agriculture. In this article we review the empirical evidence on these effects and synthesize estimates of future global cropland expansion. Our main insights are that: (i) the empirical evidence on a positive link between regional technological progress and deforestation is much weaker than what seems generally accepted; (ii) at a global level, most analysts expect broad based technological progress to be land saving; however, composition effects are important as low-yield, land-abundant regions are likely to experience further land expansion. Toward the future, empirical work understanding how localized technological progress in agriculture transmits through international trade and commodity markets will help to bridge the gap between the findings of local, econometric, studies on the one hand and global, model based, studies on the othe. © The Author 2014.

In this paper, written by a group of youth activists, civil society organisation leaders, educators and climate scientists, we track the journey that a group of young change-makers and local government officials (in the age range 15–24) have taken in securing a seat at the policy table. The challenges, caveats and course corrections that have been taken in the Johannesburg Youth Climate Action Plan (YCAP) process and the wider country, are interrogated. This YCAP Johannesburg experiment provides a useful learning exercise for subsequent CC policy and practice engagements in the country and elsewhere. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
"Effective mainstreaming of agricultural emissions into climate action agenda: The case of institutions and smallholder dairy production systems, Western Kenya","Small-scale farming production systems are integral drivers of global sustainability challenges and the climate crisis as well as a solution space for the transition to climate compatible development. However, mainstreaming agricultural emissions into a climate action agenda through integrative approaches, such as Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA), largely reinforces adaptation– mitigation dualism and pays inadequate attention to institutions’ linkage on the generation of externalities, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This may undermine the effectiveness of local–global climate risk management initiatives. Literature data and a survey of small-scale farmers’ dairy feeding strategies were used in the simulation of GHG emissions. The effect of price risks on ecoefficiencies or the amount of GHG emissions per unit of produced milk is framed as a proxy for institutional feedbacks on GHG emissions and effect at scale. This case study on small-scale dairy farmers in western Kenya illustrates the effect of local-level and sectoral-level institutional constraints, such as market risks on decision making, on GHG emissions and the effectiveness of climate action. The findings suggest that price risks are significant in incentivising the adoption of CSA technologies. Since institutional interactions influence the choice of individual farmer management actions in adaptation planning, they significantly contribute to GHG spillover at scale. This can be visualised in terms of the nexus between low or non-existent dairy feeding strategies, low herd productivity, and net higher methane emissions per unit of produced milk in a dairy value chain. The use of the Sustainable Food Value Chain (SFVC) analytical lens could mediate the identification of binding constraints, foster organisational and policy coherence, as well as broker the effective mainstreaming of agricultural emissions into local–global climate change risk management initiatives. Market risks thus provide a systematic and holistic lens for assessing alternative carbon transitions, climate financing, adaptation–mitigation dualism, and the related risk of maladaptation, all of which are integral in the planning and implementation of effective climate action initiatives. © 2021 by the authors.

Eudaimonic well-being of islanders: Does tourism contribute? The case of the Aeolian Archipelago,"This study investigates the contribution of tourism to the well-being of island residents. Recent literature on eudaimonic well-being informs the research. A phenomenological approach was used during the field research carried out in small island destinations: the Aeolian Archipelago (Sicily, Italy). Three themes were identified from data analysis. Islanders’ narratives document the search for a well-lived life and support the role of tourism in creating opportunities to enrich residents’ lives. The results reveal that a eudaimonic approach to the investigation of well-being can offer insights on the connection between tourism and residents´ well-being. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Anticipating the social fit of CCS projects by looking at place factors,"Understanding the factors influencing the acceptance of carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects is key for the projects’ deployment and for accelerating the global mitigation of CO2 emissions. While anticipating the ways in which “places” can potentially affect a technology's deployment is relevant to mitigating social risks, social aspects are often omitted or included late in site selection processes. Here, we present a methodology to include place factors upstream in the site-screening process based on a literature review of former CCS implementation processes and maps of potential locations. We identified the place factors that had been determinative for the acceptance of or opposition to 38 CCS projects. Then, the usability of geographic information system (GIS) maps to represent social factors around potential storage sites in Switzerland was assessed. Our results show that place factors have positively influenced 22 and negatively impacted 16 projects in the past. In addition, it is possible to visualize several factors around potential CO2 storage locations, while unmappable factors must be explored at later stages. We conclude that awareness of place factors coupled with reflection on the values pushed by the technology will likely enable better site choices. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
Dietary monoterpenoids and human health: Unlocking the potential for therapeutic use,"Natural products are widely used in different aspects of our lives – from household cleaners and food production, via cosmetics and aromatherapy, to both alternative and traditional medicine. In our research group, we have recently described several monoterpenoids with potential in the antiviral and anticancer therapy by allosteric targeting of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Prior to any practical application, biological effects on human organism must be taken in concern. This review article is focused on the biological effects of 5 monoterpenoids on the human health previously identified as AhR antagonists with a therapeutic potential as antiviral and anticancer agents. We have thoroughly described cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and anticancer effects, as well as known interactions with nuclear receptors. As clearly demonstrated, monoterpenoids in general represent almost an inexhaustible reservoir of natural compounds possessing the ability to influence, modulate and improve human health. © 2024 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM)",Not About Sufficiency
Achieving sustainability requires systemic business transformation,"Non-technical summary Achieving sustainability requires that businesses transform; however, it is virtually impossible in today’s competitive environment for individual businesses to do what is needed to bring about systemic transformation. Instead, it is the context around businesses, including the public policy environment and changes by major actors, which must shift so that the pressures, constraints and demands on businesses can epimimetically drive their competitive instincts in the direction of wellbeing for all. Technical summary Businesses and economic systems are implicated in the need to come into much better harmony with the realities of nature and in support of better human dignity and wellbeing to achieve sustainability in what is here called an epimimetic process. This article argues that while it is occasionally possible for leaders and companies to transform in the direction of sustainability or flourishing for all, it is unlikely that enough individual businesses can transform sufficiently while relying on an individual basis to achieve transformation. The context that constitutes the ecosystem in which businesses operate needs to change so that businesses themselves can change. Transforming businesses means significant change to the ‘what’ of businesses and their ecosystems – the purposes, perspectives, powers, practices and performance criteria shape businesses both internally and as external pressures. Businesses are unlikely to transform until the surrounding ecosystem demands that they do so. Social media summary Individual businesses need public policy, activist and peer support to achieve systemic change towards sustainability. © The Author(s), 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of Taiwanese civil society organizations in cross-strait relations,"Despite the instability of the political relationship between Taiwan and Mainland China, cross-strait activities such as trade, education, marriage and travel have prospered. While the main focus of current academic research has been on security and economic relationships between the two governments, relatively little attention has been paid to social interactions or the role of civil society actors. This book investigates the role of Taiwanese civil society organizations in shaping the relationship between Mainland China and Taiwan. It explores the role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in building confidence and peace and shows that Taiwanese CSOs hold a very complicated position which has in fact added to tensions. Waisová's research looks closely at the roles civil society organizations play in conflict transformation, reconciliation and peacebuilding, the modalities of playing such roles, and the challenges facing them. It will be of interest to students and scholars researching cross-strait relations and also to conflict resolution think-tanks, policy makers and policy analysts. © 2018 Šárka Waisová.

Understanding the role qualitative methods can play in next generation impact assessment,"Since its inception, impact assessment (IA) has been perceived by many to be a largely technical, quantitative exercise. However, as jurisdictions shift towards a more sustainability-oriented IA that accounts for a wider range of social, cultural, economic, health and well-being, and equity implications of proposed projects and strategic initiatives, values and subjectivity come more to the fore. Making predictions now needs innovative, and rigorous applications of qualitative methods that enable meaningful inclusion of diverse knowledges, values, and information sources, whilst at the same time giving confidence to decision makers and other stakeholders about the evidence base. Adopting such qualitative methods in practice is hindered by a lack of clarity of the role of qualitative methods in the delivery of sustainability-oriented IA. Guided by findings from a thematic analysis of primary data gathered through an international survey supplemented by semi-structured interviews and a workshop, the novel contribution of this paper is to clarify how and why qualitative methods can best contribute to the effective delivery of next generation IA. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Agribusiness vs. public health: Disease control in resource-asymmetric conflict,"In the context of modern civilization, the ecology of infectious disease cannot be described by interacting populations alone, as much of the modeling literature presumes. As a matter of first principle, formalisms and their statistical applications must account for the anthrosphere from which pathogens emerge. With that objective in mind, we first formally examine strategies for controlling outbreaks by way of environmental stochasticities human institutions help set. Using the Data Rate Theorem, we next explore disease control regimens under asymmetric conflicts between agribusiness interests rich in resources and State public health agencies and local communities constrained by those very resources. Military theory describes surprising successes in the face of such an imbalance, a result we apply here. Abduction points to strategies by which public health can defeat agribusinesses in its efforts to control agriculture-led pandemics, the heavy health, and fiscal costs of which multinationals routinely pass off to the public. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

An integrated framework for ethical and sustainable digitalization,"Dynamically developing digitization initiatives among public institutions and private companies necessitate a balanced approach to digital ethics. Several frameworks and legal regulations have been adopted to clarify and define the various ethical challenges in digital contexts. These initiatives often accentuate one of three components: data security, data governance, or digital strategy. However, an integrated approach is required to meet the current demand for an ethical and sustainable approach to digitalization and address the growing number of challenges occurring in handling data and related peripheral components. This paper develops the concept of an integrated framework to incorporate all relevant aspects of digital ethics by combining three categories of digital contexts: law and regulations, ethics and justice, and environmental sustainability. The core of this integrated framework, the Fribourg sustainable digital ethics framework (FSDEF), consists of two boundary conditions of sustainable development: social thresholds of justice and ecological planetary boundaries. It also incorporates numerous other frameworks and standards, including value-based engineering and IEEE standards. © 2021 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
Cascade effects and sea-urchin overgrazing: An analysis of drivers behind the exploitation of sea urchin predators for management improvement,"Marine ecosystems generate a wide variety of goods and services, but are globally deteriorating due to multiple drivers associated with anthropogenic activities. Intense fishing pressure can lead to changes in structure and function of marine food webs. Particularly overfishing of predatory species at high trophic levels can cause cascading effects leading to ecosystem degradation, affecting both marine organisms and people dependent on them. In the Western Indian Ocean region, intensive fishing takes place and degradation of coral reefs and seagrass beds has been documented. One reason behind this degradation is overgrazing by increasing numbers of sea urchins. An essential step towards better management is to thoroughly understand the drivers leading to such changes in ecosystems. Against this background, the general aim of this study was to gain understanding about whether sea urchin predators in the WIO region are fished, and to identify the drivers behind the fishing of these species. The study had four objectives: (i) to document if and how predatory fish eating sea urchins are caught in smallscale fisheries, (ii) to assess if, and if so why, sea urchin predators are targeted species, (iii) to assess if and to what degree local ecological knowledge (LEK) on ecological complexity involving sea urchins and their predators (e.g. trophic cascades) is present among local fishers, and (iv) to identify fishers' suggestions for management that can reduce problems linked to sea urchin overgrazing. The results show that all investigated species of sea urchin predators are fished by local small-scale fishers. Most sea urchin predators are not actively targeted, are not popular local food fish, and have minor use and economic importance for fishers. This stands in sharp contrast to their ecological keystone role by controlling sea urchin populations. The fishers' awareness and LEK were weak and partly lacking. Management suggestions targeted mostly the symptoms of food web changes rather than the drivers behind them.Based on the results we suggest that management of degraded ecosystems, as a result of food web changes, should encompass a wide variety of strategies and scales. Specific suggestions for sea urchin predator management are education of local stakeholders on destructive gear effects and food web complexity, further investigations of catch- and release fishing as well as the use of selective gears. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Dispersed Urban-Stormwater Control Improved Stream Water Quality in a Catchment-Scale Experiment,"Traditional urban drainage degrades receiving waters. Alternative approaches have potential to protect downstream waters, but widespread adoption requires robust demonstration of their feasibility and effectiveness. We conducted a catchment-scale experiment over 19 years to assess the effect of dispersed stormwater control measures (SCMs), measured as a reduction in effective imperviousness (EI) on stream water quality in six sites on two streams. We compared changes in those sites over 7 years as EI decreased, to changes in the 12 preceding years, and in three reference and two control streams. SCMs reduced phosphorus concentrations and summer temperature to reference levels in dry weather where EI was sufficiently reduced, but effects were smaller with increased antecedent rain. SCMs also reduced nitrogen concentrations which were influenced by septic tank seepage in all sites. SCMs had no effect on suspended solids concentrations, which were lower in urban than in reference streams. SCMs increased electrical conductivity: along with reduced temperature this is evidence of increased contribution of groundwater to baseflows. This experiment strengthens inference that urban stormwater drainage increases contaminant concentrations in streams, and demonstrates that such impacts are reversible and likely preventable. Variation in degree of water quality improvement among experimental sites suggests that achieving reference water quality would require SCMs with large retention capacity intercepting runoff from nearly all impervious surfaces, thus requiring more downslope space and water demand. EI is a useful metric for predicting stream water quality responses to SCMs, allowing better catchment prioritization and SCM design standards for stream protection. © 2022.

The multiple meanings of the Cameraria ohridella biological invasion in Paris's Green Areas,"The article presents a study of the various meanings given by different actors to the biological invasion of Cameraria ohridella in Paris's green spaces. This insect of unknown origin has spread throughout Europe, mining the leaves of horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), a tree species widely distributed in European capital cities. The elaboration of a map of actors allowed the identification of the stages in the bioinvasion management. The research shows that: i) despite the existence of specialized regional and international species monitoring organizations, the key alert networks were of an informal nature; ii) Paris's Green Areas Directorate assessed and treated the invasive species with a rationale that did not include other sectors of society; iii) the effectiveness of the adopted measures was undermined by the fact that the Green Areas Directorate does not control all the parks or gardens within the city. Owners/managers acted independently, so allowing the development of new sources of infestation. The article concludes that the invasiveness of an ecosystem is not only shaped by its ecological traits but also by social organizations and policies. © 2009 Landscape Research Group Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

"Green infrastructure connectivity analysis across spatiotemporal scales: A transferable approach in the Ruhr Metropolitan Area, Germany","Developing green infrastructure (GI) has drawn increasing attention as a strategic planning approach for advancing urban sustainability. The connectivity of green spaces, a central principle of GI, has been considered in planning studies regarding its structure and functions for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services delivery; however, aspects of GI connectivity across temporal and spatial scales are rarely addressed. This paper aims to develop and apply a method for the GI connectivity analysis at multiple spatiotemporal scales. A transferable and multi-scale workable approach is presented to reveal the changes of structural and spatial heterogeneity of urban GI. Our method includes i) morphological spatial patterns analysis for central and green corridors recognition, ii) a graph-based quantification of GI connectivity based on the Conefor model, and iii) least-cost path analysis for identifying potential green corridors. We apply the GI connectivity analysis method in the Ruhr Metropolitan Area (RMA), one of Europe's largest agglomerations. We use spatial Urban Atlas data from 2006 to 2018. At the metropolitan scale, we find that GI connectivity in the RMA decreases 3.9% from 2006 to 2018, even though the general distributions of GI changes only slightly. With reference to the municipal scale from 2006 to 2018, four major types of GI connectivity changes were discovered in RMA's 15 cities, namely consistent decreasing, consistent increasing, increase followed by decrease, and vice-versa. Our findings provide new evidence on GI connectivity changes across a twelve-year difference and at metropolitan and municipal scales, as well as the identification of priority areas for increasing GI connectivity. It provides insights on the evolving and heterogenous nature of GI connectivity in support of decision-making for more sustainable metropolitan development for people and nature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Product line strategy and environmental impact oriented to carbon tax constraints,"Under the constraints of the government's carbon tax policy, manufacturers have to consider whether to develop low-carbon product lines or adjust their existing product lines to promote carbon reduction. Therefore, we construct three models to explore the impact of consumer product acceptance on manufacturers' product line strategies under the carbon tax policy. Furthermore, we also investigate the social welfare and environmental impacts of manufacturers' different product line strategies. We find that manufacturers prefer to produce both low-carbon and ordinary products, but they may have worse negative impacts on the environment. We show that social welfare is not always better when manufacturers produce low-carbon products than ordinary products. Interestingly, we find that when carbon taxes are higher, it may be more profitable for manufacturers to produce ordinary products than low-carbon products and that manufacturers producing low-carbon products may lead to worse environmental impacts.

Unveiling effect of iron on pyrolysis of bisphenol A epoxy by comparisons of product characteristics and reaction mechanisms,"Bisphenol A epoxy (BAEP) is a widely-used material in daily life, and increasing BAEP wastes are being generated. Pyrolysis is a potential technology for BAEP recovery, but conventional processes are inefficient and high energy-consuming. Herein, Fe-catalyzed pyrolysis process was proposed, and comprehensive comparisons were performed on characteristics of products obtained from BAEP pyrolysis in the presence and absence of iron. The results demonstrated that the addition of iron reduced the decomposition temperature of BAEP by approximately 10–20 °C and promoted the generation of gaseous products, in addition, the appropriate conditions were determined as the iron content of 4%, pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C, holding time of 90 min, and heating rate of 5 °C/min. Moreover, based on the analyses of Py-GCMS for volatiles and XPS for residues, the catalytic mechanism was revealed as the facilitation effect of iron on the conversion of lattice oxygen to adsorbed oxygen. This work would be conducive to energy saving and light products production during BAEP pyrolysis and offer valuable references for studies on the recovery of some other organic materials/wastes. © 2023 The Institution of Chemical Engineers",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of renewable energy and agriculture on mineral resources rents: Do economic and environmental aspects matter,"The global shift towards renewable energy and sustainable agricultural practices has gained significant momentum in recent years. This transition has not only been driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change but also by the potential economic benefits and the conservation of mineral resources. The impact of renewable energy and agriculture on mineral resource rents is a significant issue today. With the increasing concern of global warming, reducing emissions and increasing renewable energy sources is more pressing than ever. As a result, there is growing interest in using renewable energy sources and agricultural practices to replace the traditional use of mineral resources. This paper examines the impact of renewable energy and agriculture productivity on mineral resource rents in China from 1971 to 2019, using economic growth and total greenhouse gas emissions as moderating variables. The result explains that mineral depletion, agriculture value-added, and economic growth are positively associated with natural resources, while fossil fuel energy consumption and CO2 emissions are negatively associated with natural resources. The policy implications of mineral depletion in China are concerning. In order to address the issue, China needs to develop a comprehensive plan that addresses the depletion of mineral resources and its effects on the environment and economy. In particular, developing strategies to reduce the reliance on coal power and to encourage more sustainable energy sources should be a priority. Policies to protect and restore agricultural land and water quality should also be implemented. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Does Financial Deepening Foster Clean Energy Sustainability over Conventional Ones? Examining the Nexus between Financial Deepening, Urbanization, Institutional Quality, and Energy Consumption in China","Energy availability and the selection of suitable energy sources have substantial implications on both economic and environmental sustainability, and it is because the environmental protection cost is directly linked to overall energy inclusion in the economy. Thus, the importance of clean energy has been noticed in the literature regardless of the economic structure. The purpose of the study is to discover the effects of financial deepening (FD), urbanization (UR), and institutional quality (IQ) on China’s energy consumption. Annual time series date for 1985 to 2019 utilized for documenting the coefficients of explanatory variables by implementing both linear and nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (ARDL) and the Fourier-TY causality test. In terms of the test statistics for combined and Maki cointegration, the study revealed that a long-run association prevails in the empirical nexus. Moreover, the symmetric and asymmetric framework established long-run associations. Referring to the coefficients of financial deepening, UR, and governmental effectiveness, the study found a statistically significant and favorable impression of REC. While financial deepening and governmental effectiveness unveiled negatively influenced NREC and fossil energy consumption. The asymmetric linkage between explained and explanatory variables was confirmed through the execution of a standard weld test with a null symmetry. The asymmetry coefficients of FD, UR, and IQ were positive and statistically significant at the 1% level in both the long and short runs. The directional causality revealed feedback hypothesis holds in understanding the causal relationship between explanatory factors and RE usage.

Periovulatory PM2.5 constituent exposures and human clinically recognized early pregnancy loss: Susceptible exposure time windows and high–risk constituents,"Evidence for effects of PM2.5 chemical constituent exposures during the periovulatory period on pregnancy complications was limited. We explored the associations of maternal PM2.5 and constituent exposures from the 12th week before to 4th week after ovulation with human clinically recognized early pregnancy loss (CREPL). From July 2017 to January 2024, 828 CREPL and 828 normal early pregnancy (NEP) participants were recruited in Tianjin, China. Daily residential exposures to PM2.5 and five main constituents of all participants were estimated using data of the Tracking Air Pollution in China platform. Nonlinear and linear associations between weekly pollutant exposures and CREPL were estimated using conditional logistic regression models combined with distributed lag nonlinear and distributed lag models, respectively. The risk of CREPL increased with per 10 μg/m³ increment in PM2.5 and per 1 μg/m³ increment in sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium exposures during specific weeks from the 5th week before to 2nd week after ovulation, with the largest OR (95% CI) of CREPL associated with PM2.5, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium being 1.73 (1.07, 2.78), 1.71 (1.18, 2.46), 1.80 (1.12, 2.90), and 1.61 (1.01, 2.56), respectively. CREPL was positively associated with the 10th to 90th percentiles exposure to organic matter during the 2nd and 3rd week after ovulation. In analyses for constituent residuals, the five constituents were all independently related to CREPL, with organic matter being the highest risk constituent, and nitrate and ammonium affecting at the initial stage of preantral follicle development. In conclusion, periovulatory PM2.5 and constituent exposures were associated with increased risk of CREPL. Women planning a pregnancy are advised to take exposure precautions starting from the follicular development period. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Prediction of Consumers’ Adoption Behavior of Products with Water Efficiency Labeling Based on Hidden Markov Model,"Water efficiency labeling, an environmental protection label, can provide consumers with products’ water-saving information, guide consumers to choose high-efficiency water-saving products, and encourage residents to save water. Data were obtained from a questionnaire survey among 526 respondents in Zhengzhou, China. The study constructed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to predict consumers’ adoption behavior of products with water efficiency labeling. The adoption probability of consumers at different perceptions and water-saving awareness for products with water efficiency labeling and the state transition probability of consumers’ adoption behavior of products with water efficiency labeling were calculated. Consumers’ adoption behavior of products with water efficiency labeling in different situations is predicted. The research found: (1) When the degree of perception remains unchanged, the improvement of consumers’ water-saving awareness will promote their adoption of products with water efficiency labeling and increase the probability of continuous adoption behavior. (2) The state of consumers’ adoption behavior depends on the last adoption behavior. Furthermore, as the state level increases, the dependency on adoption behavior becomes more vigorous. (3) HMM is suitable for predicting consumers’ adoption behavior of products with water efficiency labeling and has high accuracy. The research findings can provide a theoretical basis and decision-making reference for the government and enterprises to formulate relevant guiding policies and promotion strategies. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Thermoeconomic assessment of an innovative combined cooling, heating, and power system based on biomass combustion, TCO2 cycle, absorption chiller, and desalination","Biomass processing toward sustainable production offers an appropriate way of environmental protection together with supplying the required energy demand for industrial/urban applications.

"China’s New Housing Security Model: Evaluation of the Job–Housing Balance in Affordable Rental Housing, Shanghai","The Chinese government’s recent low-income housing scheme aims to tackle housing challenges faced by the urban floating population. A notable shift in this initiative is the focus on the job–housing balance. This study proposes that the spatial interaction between land designated for affordable rental housing and land for commercial facilities serves as a fundamental metric for evaluating this equilibrium, providing insights into the effectiveness of China’s nascent affordable housing efforts. Drawing on post-2021 data, when China’s revamped affordable housing policy took effect, our research examines the spatial distribution of affordable rental housing and commercial service land in Shanghai. By employing coupled coordination models and local entropy metrics, we delve into the supply equilibrium and pragmatic interrelation of these land types. Our findings reveal localized clustering in the spatial arrangement of rental and commercial land within Shanghai. Zones in the urban core exhibit a supply balance, while the peripheries display diminishing accessibility between these land types. Core urban areas have a lower supply balance but higher accessibility, whereas urban fringes face both low supply balance and low accessibility. These study outcomes have significant implications for strategic planning and the construction of affordable rental housing. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Low-Energy Photoresponsive Magnetic-Assisted Cleaning Microrobots for Removal of Microplastics in Water Environments,"In the global ecosystem, microplastic pollution pervades extensively, exerting profound and detrimental effects on marine life and human well-being. However, conventional removal methods are usually limited to chemical flocculation and physical filtration but are insufficient to remove extremely small microplastics. Therefore, developing a comprehensive strategy to address the threat posed by microplastics is imperative. Here, we report a low-energy photoresponsive magnetic-assisted cleaning microrobot (LMCM) composed of photocatalytic material (Ag@Bi2WO6) and magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4), which can be used for the active removal of microplastics from water environments. Due to the diffusion electrophoresis effect, the low-energy photoresponsive cleaning microrobots (LCMs) are formed by spontaneous assembly of Ag@Bi2WO6, which can continuously adsorb microplastics in a water environment. Particularly, the effective attraction distance of LCMs on microplastics exceeds 100 μm. After assembling the Fe3O4 nanoparticles, LMCMs can clean microplastics in groups from water environments under the control of a magnetic field. Utilizing precision manipulation and group control, LMCMs demonstrate a remarkable 98% cleaning efficiency in 93 s and can be recovered under the control of the directional magnetic field. This eco-friendly and energy-efficient microrobot is expected to provide a viable strategy to tackle the threat of microplastics or promote industrial microplastic removal. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency

How to promote carbon emission reduction in buildings? Evolutionary analysis of government regulation and financial investment,"Buildings account for a significant portion of global carbon emissions, necessitating strategies to accelerate decarbonisation in the construction sector. This research aims to analyse the behavioural strategies and interactions among governments, construction enterprises, and financial institutions in promoting building carbon emission reduction (CER) through an integrated regulatory and market-driven approach. A novel three-party evolutionary game model is developed that incorporates government regulation policies, the profit-driven nature of construction enterprises, and the investment incentives of financial institutions. Numerical simulations using MATLAB were performed to evaluate the dynamic replication and evolutionary stabilities of stakeholder strategies under different scenarios. Residential project M in Beijing was chosen as a realistic environment for simulation and analysis. The results demonstrate that stringent government regulation can incentivize financial institutions to increase their investments in CER initiatives. However, construction enterprises may still resist decarbonisation efforts if the costs outweigh the economic benefits. A two-pronged approach combining “command-and-control” regulation and “market-facilitation” interventions is proposed to effectively align stakeholder interests. This study provides valuable insights into leveraging both regulatory instruments and market-based incentives to drive the transition towards sustainable construction practises. Policy recommendations are offered to create an enabling environment that encourages the active participation of all stakeholders in achieving net-zero emission targets for buildings. The novelty lies in the development of an integrated tripartite evolutionary game framework that coherently captures the dynamics among regulators, industry players, and financial institutions, thus supporting low-carbon policymaking in the construction domain. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Digital Technology Increases the Sustainability of Cross-Border Agro-Food Supply Chains: A Review,"The increasing prominence of climate change, geopolitical crises, and global economic slowdown highlights the challenges and structural deficiencies of traditional cross-border agro-food supply chains.

The carbon emission reduction effect of green fiscal policy: a quasi-natural experiment,"Carbon emission reduction is crucial for mitigating global climate change, and green fiscal policies, through providing economic incentives and reallocating resources, are key means to achieve carbon reduction targets. This paper uses data covering 248 cities from 2003 to 2019 and applies a multi-period difference-in-differences model (DID) to thoroughly assess the impact of energy conservation and emission reduction (ECER) fiscal policies on enhancing carbon emission (CE1) reduction and carbon efficiency (CE2). It further analyzes the mediating role of Green Innovation (GI), exploring how it strengthens the impact of ECER policies. We find that: (1) ECER policies significantly promote the improvement of carbon reduction and CE2, a conclusion that remains robust after excluding the impacts of concurrent policy influences, sample selection biases, outliers, and other random factors. (2) ECER policies enhance CE1 reduction and CE2 in pilot cities by promoting green innovation, and this conclusion is confirmed by Sobel Z tests. (3) The effects of ECER policies on CE1 reduction and the improvement of CE2 are more pronounced in higher-level cities, the eastern regions and non-resource cities. This research provides policy makers with suggestions, highlighting that incentivizing green innovation through green fiscal policies is an effective path to achieving carbon reduction goals. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Treatment and Resource Utilization of Gaseous Pollutants in Functionalized Ionic Liquids,"With the rapid development of science, technology, and the economy of human society, the emission problem of gas pollutants is becoming more and more serious, which brings great pressure to the global ecological environment. At the same time, the natural resources that can be exploited and utilized on Earth are also showing a trend of exhaustion. As an innovative and environmentally friendly material, functionalized ionic liquids (FILs) have shown great application potential in the capture, separation, and resource utilization of gaseous pollutants. In this paper, the synthesis and characterization methods of FILs are introduced, and the application of FILs in the treatment and recycling of gaseous pollutants is discussed. The future development of FILs in this field is also anticipated, which will provide new ideas and methods for the treatment and recycling of gaseous pollutants and promote the process of environmental protection and sustainable development. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Resource dependence and air pollution in China: Do the digital economy, income inequality, and industrial upgrading matter?","Air pollution has emerged as a substantial threat to China’s sustainable development. What remains overlooked is the resource dependence on the control of air pollution. At the same time, the resource curse may be broken by the growing digital economy, which will in turn reduce air pollution. To examine this problem, a total of 225 Chinese prefecture-level cities were selected from 2011 to 2018 to investigate the associations among resource dependence, the digital economy, and air pollution, and further, explore the mediating effect of income inequality and industrial upgrading. The primary findings are enumerated as follows: First, resource dependence is positively correlated to air pollution; second, the digital economy negatively regulates the effect of resource dependence on air pollution, that is, as the digital economy grows, air pollution decreases via resource dependence as a whole. However, a noteworthy phenomenon is that the negative moderating effect is evidently heterogeneous and is especially prominent in central China and non-resource-based cities; third, income inequality and industrial upgrading play a mediating role between resource dependence and air pollution; fourth, the digital economy can significantly influence the process where resource dependence affects air pollution via income inequality and industrial upgrading. These findings indicate the direction in the development of new strategies for different regions. Alleviating resource dependence is an important way of air pollution control. In particular, the main focus on mitigating air pollution should be adjusted to the level of income inequality and industrial structure. And the empirical results call for a strong emphasis on the digital economy for higher air quality in resource-based cities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Given the growing global research on SES and its applications, it is crucial to explore the advancements and challenges in SES research and their implications. This study conducted a bibliometric analysis using CiteSpace along with a formal review of peer-reviewed literature on SES research. The findings indicate that SES has gained significant attention, evidenced by an ever-increasing number of published articles. There is close cooperation between authors/countries that have published in this field. Environmental science (40.61%), environmental studies (35.74%), and ecology (26.85%) are the main disciplinary categories in SES research. Additionally, this study identified four major themes within SES studies: 1) theoretical frameworks and research methods; 2) dynamics and drivers; 3) synthetical evaluation; and 4) management practices based on the SES principle. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced by SES research along with potential solutions moving forward. Future investigations should prioritize multi-source data collection techniques and technologies, explore interactions between social and ecological systems, engage in long-term social-ecological research endeavors, and strengthen multi-objective and cross-scale integrated management, thereby facilitating knowledge-based policymaking and practical applications. This review provides novel insights into the current progress within the field of SES while also highlighting existing challenges—ultimately contributing towards an enhanced understanding of SES that can be effectively integrated into policymaking efforts and management. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Recent developments, challenges, and prospects of dietary omega-3 PUFA-fortified foods: Focusing on their effects on cardiovascular diseases","Dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Dω-3 PUFAs) have been extensively studied and have been proven to offer notable benefits for heart health. Scientific meta-analysis strongly endorses them as potent bioactive agents capable of preventing and managing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Fortification of foods with Dω-3 PUFAs is a potential strategy for enhancing Dω-3 PUFA intake in an effort to continue strengthening public health outcomes. This review analyzed recent trends in the fortification of foods with Dω-3 PUFAs in relation to technological developments, challenges linked to the method, and future scope. Additionally, recent clinical trials and research on the effect of Dω-3 PUFA-fortified food consumption on cardiovascular health are reviewed. Technological trends in fortification methods, namely microencapsulation- and nanoencapsulation, have made considerable progress to date, along with excellent stability in both processing and storage conditions and favorable bioaccessibility and sensory attributes of fortified foods. There is a tremendous deal of promise for cardiovascular health based on recent clinical trial findings that fortifying food with Dω-3 PUFAs decreased the incidence of heart disease, blood pressure, and lipid profiles. In summary, substantial progress has been made in addressing the challenges of Dω-3 PUFA fortification. However, further multidisciplinary research is needed to inculcate effectiveness toward achieving the maximum possible Dω-3 PUFAs to protect against the harmful effects of CVDs and continue global health progress. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The need to integrate flood and drought disaster risk reduction strategies,"Most research on hydrological risks focuses either on flood risk or drought risk, whilst floods and droughts are two extremes of the same hydrological cycle. To better design disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures and strategies, it is important to consider interactions between these closely linked phenomena. We show examples of: (a) how flood or drought DRR measures can have (unintended) positive or negative impacts on risk of the opposite hazard; and (b) how flood or drought DRR measures can be negatively impacted by the opposite hazard. We focus on dikes and levees, dams, stormwater control and upstream measures, subsurface storage, migration, agricultural practices, and vulnerability and preparedness. We identify key challenges for moving towards a more holistic risk management approach. © 2020",Not About Sufficiency
Nourishing student success and wellbeing: Unveiling the impact of food environments on student food security challenges through a case study from Montana,"Food insecurity among U.S. college and university students surpasses respective levels in the general population. Previous research has primarily focused on demographic and economic explanations, neglecting other risk factors such as student place of residence and specific food environments. In addition, most studies have been conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, which further exacerbated food security challenges. To address these gaps, our comprehensive case study at Montana State University (MSU) assessed risk factors for student food insecurity, considering food access and the students’ food environments. From March to November 2020, we collected online survey responses from a diverse sample of 443 MSU students. Approximately one–third experienced food insecurity during this period, with their food insecurity status linked to housing type and academic level. Despite students' reported knowledge of healthy diets and cooking skills, consuming inadequate and insufficient food had a significant impact on their dietary quality, well-being, and physical and mental health. Just under half of the surveyed students (44%) reported increased difficulties in accessing food due to the pandemic. Addressing food insecurity among college students is crucial for their well-being and academic success, not only because of additional stressors such as COVID-19. Dealing with food insecurity requires improving economic situations and creating a reliable and diverse food environment that ensures affordable, healthy, safe, convenient, desirable, and sustainable food options. Special increased support from universities and governments should be given to students living off-campus. By recognizing these unique challenges and implementing targeted interventions, we can foster a supportive food environment for students. © 2023 by the Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Green chemistry,"A grand challenge facing government, industry, and academia in the relationship of our technological society to the environment is reinventing the use of materials. To address this challenge, collaboration from an interdisciplinary group of stakeholders will be necessary. Traditionally, the approach to risk management of materials and chemicals has been through inerventions intended to reduce exposure to materials that are hazardous to health and the environment. In 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act encouraged a new tact-elimination of hazards at the source. An emerging approach to this grand challenge seeks to embed the diverse set of environmental perspectives and interests in the everyday practice of the people most responsible for using and creating new materials - chemists. The approach, which has come to be known as Green Chemistry, intends to eliminate intrinsic hazard itself, rather than focusing on reducing risk by minimizing exposure. This chapter addresses the representation of downstream environmental stakeholder interests in the upstream everyday practice that is reinventing chemistry and its material inputs, products, and waste as described in the ""12 Principles of Green Chemistry"". © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Assessing the potential impact on extractive industries of IFC's revised social standards,"The International Finance Corporation (IFC) adopted its Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability and Performance Standards in April, 2006. These standards are aimed at encouraging better management of environmental and social risk in major capital investments. They are often used as de facto benchmarks or regulatory guidelines in oil, gas and mining projects, even where IFC is not directly involved. The eight Performance Standards cover key operational areas: environmental and social management systems, including risk assessment and evaluation (PS1 ); labor and working conditions (PS2); resource efficiency and pollution prevention (PS3), community health, safety and security (PS4); land acquisition and involuntary resettlement (PS5); biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of living natural resources (PS6); indigenous people (PS7); and cultural heritage (PS8). In January, 2012, IFC issued revised standards based on three years' experience with them. This paper focuses on IFC's revised social performance standards (PS 1, PS5 and PS7, with reference to others) and analyzes their potential impacts on the oil, gas and mining industries. These standards introduce broad-based concepts that will require many companies to modify their existing development strategies. Such concepts include a defined hierarchy of stakeholder engagement; access to natural resources as a potential impact on land acquisition and resettlement; the importance of ecosystem services to human communities; and ""Free, Prior and Informed Consent"" during project development (FPIC). For each social standard, we focus on (a) new requirements or significant modifications of existing requirements; (b) expected pathways for implementation; (c) desired outcomes; and finally, (d) how compliance with new requirements might be assessed.

Investigating the feasibility of agro-waste briquettes as a sustainable energy source in Borno state Nigeria as pathways for post-conflict and instability recovery,"The growing energy demand and lack of access to clean energy sources call for the development of more energy for cooking in households, briquettes produced using agricultural materials and related biomass have the capacity for utilization as an energy source. This study aims to introduce briquettes as an alternative energy source for cooking within conflict-affected communities in Borno State, northeastern Nigeria, where factors relating to the high cost of charcoal, security constraints, and the environmental impact of tree cutting have sparked apprehension and raised concerns. The study demonstrates the likelihood of adopting briquettes as a cooking fuel alternative in communities recovering from insurgency. Using assessment tools such as household surveys, Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), involving a total of 536 questionnaires administered to respondents; KII was administered to 37 respondents and 9 FGDs with cooperatives and dealers in traditional fuel were conducted. From the results 73% of the community relies on charcoal as their primary fuel source, since the majority (68.7%) appeared to be low-income households, 24.1% reported that the high cost of charcoal is a major hindrance to continued usage. However, despite the communities showing potential in briquettes, only 3.7% are aware of briquettes as an alternative option for cooking energy indicating the adoption of briquettes being low in the region. A situational assessment was carried and sensitization strategies were recommended as means to enhance livelihoods and build resilience within the community. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

Household adoption of smog protective behavior: a comparison between two Chinese cities,"This study compares residents of two Chinese cities–one with a high risk and one with a low risk of air pollution, in terms of their smog experience, reliance on smog information sources, risk perception, attribution of responsibility and intention for adoption of protective behavior regarding smog. The results indicate that the two cities differ considerably in their smog experience, somewhat less so in reliance on smog information sources and risk perception, and very little in protective behavior. Using multiple regression analyses, the study revealed a basic chain of reaction in which demographic characteristics and location cause smog experience and smog information, smog experience and smog information cause risk perception, risk perception causes attribution of responsibility, and attribution of responsibility causes intention to adopt protective behavior. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed and recommendations for further research are suggested. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Quality Evaluation and Obstacle Identification of Human Settlements in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau Based on Multi-Source Data,"The unique high/cold environment of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) limits the natural distribution of the population living there and threatens local residents’ health. Thus, exploring the quality of human settlements in this area is of great significance. In this study, 5 first-level indicators and 25 second-level indicators were initially selected, and the entropy TOPSIS method was used to determine the weight of each indicator and evaluate the quality of the human settlements in each county of the QTP. Then, the coefficient of variation and spatial autocorrelation were used to analyze the spatial differences in human settlement quality. Finally, the obstacle degree model was used to identify those obstacles that affect the quality of the human settlements in the QTP. This study has gathered important findings. (1) The human settlement quality in these counties can be divided into 18 high-level areas, 45 mid- and high-level areas, 44 mid-level areas, 79 mid- and low-level areas, and 28 low-level areas. (2) In terms of spatial patterns, the north is higher than the south, the east is slightly higher than the west, and the surrounding area is higher than the interior. (3) In the clustering model, the high–high clustering trend is mainly concentrated in the north of the QTP, whereas the south-central part of the QTP and the zone where Tibet, Qinghai, and Sichuan meet exhibit obvious low–low clustering. (4) The variability of human settlement quality occurs in the order of Sichuan < Yunnan < Gansu < Xinjiang Autonomous Region < Tibet Autonomous Region < Qinghai. (5) The main first-level obstacles affecting human settlement quality in the counties of the QTP are living conditions, construction level of public service facilities, and infrastructure. The main second-level obstacles are the number of living service facilities, the number of residential districts, and the density of the road networks. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The Vanishing and Renewal Landscape of Urban Villages Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing: The Case of Haidian District in Beijing,"How to recognize the land use change in urban villages during dynamic transformation in Haidian District, Beijing, has become a hot topic with the promotion of urban renewal. The GF-1 high-resolution remote sensing images of 2013, 2015, and 2020 were used in this study to reflect the land use change in urban villages before and after urban renewal by using a hierarchical machine learning recognition method based on scene-based and random forest classification. The overall scale of urban village blocks in Haidian was 10.46 km2, showing the distribution pattern along the traffic arteries in 2013. In 2015, it dropped to 10.11 km2. The scale of urban village blocks in 2020 decreased to 1.02 km2, 9.75% of that in 2013. Three kinds of urban village renewal logic are revealed by further taking Chuanying Village as an example: “urban village–blue–green space”, “urban village–real estate”, and “urban village–municipal facilities”. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Alarming contagion effects: The dangerous ripple effect of extreme price spillovers across crude oil, carbon emission allowance, and agriculture futures markets","The inherent financial interconnections between crude oil prices, carbon emission allowances, and agriculture commodity futures warrant a thorough investigation as fossil energy consumption, carbon emissions, and agriculture plants are three critical components of global environmental protection. This paper aims to quantify not only the normal (mean quantile) static and dynamic spillover effects among them in both time and frequency domains but also the more critical extreme spillovers that occur across various time horizons. Additionally, we explore the vital role of carbon futures in hedging risk and enhancing the performance of oil and agricultural portfolios. Empirical results indicate that, under extreme market situations, the total spillovers among oil, carbon, and agriculture commodity futures are much larger than those under normal conditions. Furthermore, soybean and corn are generally the most potent information transmitters over other futures in the time domain, while carbon emission allowance futures act as an obvious spillover receiver at both normal and extreme market conditions across various time frequencies. Both the total spillover and the net spillover are centered at a short-term frequency (i.e., one to four weeks). Finally, we find that carbon futures can contribute to improving the hedge effectiveness and performance of oil and agricultural portfolios. These findings have valuable implications for policymakers, relevant producers/consumers, as well as futures investors. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
A bibliometric analysis of food security and urbanization: insights and implications,"This study conducts a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the intersection between Food Security and Urbanization (FSU), aiming to identify key themes, emerging trends, and research gaps. Using statistical analysis, co-word analysis, and social network analysis, we map the intellectual landscape and global collaboration networks in FSU research. The findings reveal the dominant contributions from the United States and China, with China’s extensive international collaborations highlighting opportunities for future research. A key observation is the disconnect between urbanization and food security studies, underscoring the need for a more integrated approach to research. The study extends Sustainable Development Theory and Urban Metabolism Theory by incorporating socio-economic and environmental dimensions, demonstrating that urbanization’s impact on food security differs across developed and developing countries. The research highlights emerging interdisciplinary themes, such as urban agriculture and socio-economic resilience, aligning with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). This study lays the foundation for future research on the synergies between urbanization and food security, promoting a more sustainable development trajectory.

Green Economy and sustainable development,"Significant progress has been made over the last three decades through international conferences and reports to seize the opportunities of sustainable development in view of the challenges of climate change, the limited carrying capacity of the Earth, and degrading ecosystems. In 2015, the UN General Assembly agreed on Sustainable Development Goals to guide their forward-looking Agenda 2030. Sustainable development emphasizes the enhancement of environmental, social and economic resources, with all three of them being critical to meet the needs of current and future generations. But despite the concept's penetration into many segments of society and the rise of environmental policies throughout the world, the impact on global environmental trends has been limited. Bottlenecks in the way sustainable development has been approached in practice - with a focus on environmental protection and negative externalities - provide a basis for understanding the evolution of the Green Economy concept. In the aftermath of the last world economic crisis, the Green Economy gained attention as a concept that could overcome the connotation of environmental protection as a cost factor slowing down economic development and bring the environment and the economy into a positive relationship, in which the environment becomes an opportunity rather than a constraint, and a new driving force for economic development. Sustainability remains the vital long-term goal, but the Green Economy is describing a pathway to sustainable development. To put emphasis on the importance of including social aspects, the concept of the Green Economy has evolved and many organizations now refer to an 'inclusive Green Economy'. As a key feature, the Green Economy promotes investments in specific areas - also broadly referred to as green sectors - which either restore and maintain natural resources or increase efficiency in their use. These investments can lead, as any other public investment, to the creation of jobs, generation of income and development of new markets but with less emissions, resource degradation and environmental pollution. While each country has its own national conditions and the design of a Green Economy and related policies will vary, key characteristics for the process of 'greening' can be described by: (i) an increase in the share that 'green sectors' contribute to the Gross Domestic Product as well as in a country's population that is employed in these sectors; (ii) decoupling of economic growth from resource use and environmental impact; (iii) an increase in public and private investment going into green sectors; and (iv) a changing composition of aggregated consumption in which the share of environmentally friendly products and services increases. Building on UNEP's report 'Towards a Green Economy', areas of policy-making which provide key enabling conditions for a Green Economy transition include: (i) promoting investment and spending in areas that stimulate a Green Economy (e.g. in technology, infrastructure or infant industries); (ii) limiting government spending in areas that deplete natural capital through a reduction of environmentally harmful subsidies; (iii) establishing sound regulatory frameworks that create rights, incentives, minimum standards and prohibit the most harmful forms of behaviour and substances; (iv) addressing environmental externalities and existing market failures by employing taxes and market-based instruments that promote green investment and innovation; and (v) strengthening international governance in areas where international and multilateral mechanisms regulate economic activity in addition to national laws. Depending on their current level of development, countries have different capacities to initiate and implement policy reform and cope with transformative change. Other supporting actions are therefore needed to increase capacity and strengthen institutions, provide training and skill enhancement to the workforce, and improve general education on sustainability. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2016.",Not About Sufficiency
Drivers of Hot Spots and Hot Moments of Denitrification in Agricultural Systems,"Denitrification, the most poorly understood process in the nitrogen (N) cycle, is of great interest as it can significantly reduce pools of reactive N and act as a source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). A particular study challenge is that small areas (hot spots) and brief periods (hot moments) of denitrification frequently account for a high percentage of N gas flux activity. Our study utilized sites within the U.S. Department of Agriculture Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Network to understand the importance of potential drivers of such hot spots and hot moments of denitrification in agricultural systems. We quantified in situ denitrification rates in intact soil cores from three LTAR sites – Upper Chesapeake Bay (UCB), PA, Central Mississippi River Basin (CMRB), MO, and Gulf Atlantic Coastal Plain (GACP), GA – by directly measuring dinitrogen (N2) and N2O production via the Nitrogen-Free Air Recirculation Method (N-FARM). Each site provided an opportunity to study a different potential driver of denitrification: landscape-scale topography (UCB), soil confining layers (CMRB), and ecosystem-scale climate (e.g., drying-rewetting events; GACP). At the UCB site, wetter, low topographic positions released a higher proportion of N2:N2O, suggesting that N removal does not result in increased greenhouse emissions. Results at the CMRB site show evidence that confining features, like hard clays, could drive denitrification hot spots. Similarly, such features at the GACP site could drive denitrification hot spots (at depth) and hot moments (drying-rewetting). These results suggest that denitrification is a significant sink for excess agricultural N at multiple scales, which may inform management decisions in the future. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

"Global Climate Change Policy: Analysis, Economic Efficiency Issues and International Cooperation","This book considers climate change from an economic and international policy perspective. It argues that an emissions trading systems (ETS) should first be adopted in all G20 countries with those national ETS then integrated into a global ETS. The topic of global warming is at the forefront of international discussions, especially given recent environmental policy changes in the US under Presidents Trump and Biden and the emergence of the Fridays For Future movement. Combatting climate change does not necessitate a trade-off between economic growth and climate policy provided that the latter is consistently linked to new economic policy. Policymakers should support innovation, effective redistribution policies and modern mobility concepts. Moreover, there are crucial links between financial market dynamics and price dynamics in ETS. If measures discussed here are coordinated effectively in the EU/G20, and at the global level, then climate neutrality could be achieved. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Prospects for regional cooperation on environmental impact assessment in mainland southeast Asia,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a central process in sustainable development to mitigate the anticipated impacts of development projects. Every national government in mainland Southeast Asia has, or is in the process of developing, legislation on environmental governance and shares a common interest in implementing and enforcing EIA. Yet despite the fact that significant environmental impacts occur across borders, no multi-country EIA agreements have yet been passed and implemented. Increased regional cooperation could present an opportunity to address this gap, potentially linked to ASEAN or other regional organizations. Based on this hypothesis, a consultative research process under the auspices of the Mekong Partnership for the Environment interviewed 127 key stakeholders in five countries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam) to assess the positions, levels of influence and readiness to cooperate on EIA principles and standards. Using a political economy approach, the research team found strong support among government and non-governmental stakeholders alike for reform of national EIA procedures, increased public participation and the development of regional EIA standards. At present, government officials in some countries favour increased cooperation, while others express reservations and concerns about the value of such cooperation. The article explores the underlying interests and incentives behind these varied standpoints and concludes with a discussion of possibilities for regional institutions, national governments and donor agencies to advance cooperation on environmental governance. © 2015 ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute.",Not About Sufficiency
Decarbonization in democracy,"Conventional wisdom holds that democracy is structurally ill equipped to confront climate change. As the story goes, because each of us tends to dismiss consequences that befall people in other places and in future times, the people cannot be trusted to craft adequate decarbonization policies designed to reduce present-day, domestic carbon emissions. Accordingly, U.S. climate change policy has focused on technocratic fixes that operate predominantly through executive action to escape democratic politics-with vanishingly little to show for it after a change in presidential administration. To help craft a more durable U.S. climate change strategy, this Article scrutinizes the purported incompatibility of decarbonization and democratic politics. It argues that well-designed citizen input and control could advance U.S. efforts to address climate change, rather than hinder them. To foster such input and control, the Article contends that decarbonization can be disaggregated into three distinct questions: (1) whether to decarbonize, (2) how fast to decarbonize, and (3) how to decarbonize. Although people's tendencies to prioritize the present and the local may render them ill equipped to answer the first two questions, the third question, how to decarbonize, is different. That question focuses on the shape we want our economy and communities to take in the decades to come and is thus amenable to more citizen engagement. The Article then traces how more citizen engagement and empowerment on this question of how to decarbonize could advance decarbonization efforts. Across partisan lines, Americans consistently prioritize clean energy to a degree not reflected in our national climate politics, institutions, or energy system. These dynamics suggest that reforms that shift decisionmaking authority away from the energy industry, and into the hands of communities and citizens, have the potential to transform the political economy of decarbonization. After making the case for more citizen control of decisions around how to decarbonize, the Article offers two complementary reforms to help achieve this aim, which venture well beyond the standard administrative law solution set. It proposes that states should: (1) harness the power of public utility law to require utilities to better gauge and respond to their customers' values, and (2) offer communities more control over their energy supply to counteract utilities' economic and political dominance. © 2020 American Statistical Association.

Changing levels of job satisfaction among local environmental enforcement officials in China,"As a result of multiple waves of administrative reforms in the past three decades, China's civil service has become more profeßionalized. Yet public employees appear to have become increasingly dißatisfied in recent years. Based on questionnaire surveys and interviews with environmental enforcement officials in a southern city, this paper traces changes in the job satisfaction levels of these officials between 2000 and 2014. It shows that satisfaction with the extrinsic rewards received and overall job satisfaction declined during this period. These downward trends partly reflected the increasingly challenging institutional environments faced by the officials: rising political and societal demands, inadequate fiscal and personnel resources, and limited enforcement authority. In addition, as the officials became more highly educated and profeßionalized, mißion match became a stronger antecedent of job satisfaction. These findings suggest the importance of meeting the motivational needs of a more profeßionalized workforce. Copyright © SOAS University of London, 2019.",Not About Sufficiency

Climate Change and Migration: Security and Borders in A Warming World,"Climate Change and Migration: Security and Borders in a Warming World works at the intersection of three fields-environmental studies, security studies, and immigration studies. It argues that climate-induced migration has been increasingly framed as a security concern by policy makers and analysts. Although people will undoubtedly migrate internally and across borders as a form of adaptation to global warming, treating such migration as a security threat to North Atlantic countries is an inappropriate response. It takes crucial energy and political capital away from efforts to mitigate GHG emissions, adapt to climate change, and pursue development strategies that have environmental concerns at their core. Securitizing climate-induced migration is politically successful; it may play easily to constituencies anxious about immigration and climate change. But it does not address more fundamental issues. It also results in a willingness to support authoritarian transit states as an ostensible bulwark against unwanted migration. The book focuses on the Sahel and other sub-Saharan regions in Africa, as these regions are cast as the source of climate-induced migration flows first to North African countries, with the European continent as the final destination. It is based on the natural science scholarship on the impact of climate change on Africa. Strikingly, there is evidence that environmental change actually reduces migration pressures. In the case of the Sahel and sub-Saharan Africa, when migration does occur it is more likely to be oriented not toward European destinations to the north but to megacities of the African coast. This is a profound dynamic and needs to be addressed, but not by a security-minded approach by North Atlantic officials and electorates. © 2011 by Oxford University Press.

Beyond a transport node? What residents want from transforming railway stations,"Transport planning authorities and operators in various countries are planning far-reaching transformations of secondary railway stations into so-called mobility hubs with the aim to foster rail-based and intermodal mobility. The transformations of railway stations do not only affect the transportation network, but also the urban fabric surrounding railway stations. Projects of this nature, therefore, require a deeper understanding of the preferences of local residents, the key users of such hubs. We developed a three-stage adaptive survey experiment with a random sample of 2,028 adult residents in the perimeter of three secondary railway stations in Switzerland to identify preferences towards four potential railway station functions: public transport provision, access to multimodality, retail and services, and stations as a public space. The main findings are that the transportation function is the top priority, followed by the public space function. Other functions, such as retail, services, and multimodal mobility, are less preferred by residents. The findings reveal the importance of also considering non-commercial functions of these hubs and that residents are viewing railway station as more than merely transport hubs or shopping centres; they are considered key neighbourhood components that shape local identities through their role as public spaces. © 2023 The Author(s).

Generalized Additive Models of Climatic and Metabolic Controls of Subannual Variation in pCO2 in Productive Hardwater Lakes,"Spatiotemporal variation in climate and weather, allochthonous carbon loads, and autochthonous factors such as lake metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration) interacts to regulate atmospheric CO2 exchange of lakes. Understanding this interplay in diverse basin types at different timescales is required to adequately place lakes into the global carbon cycle and predict CO2 flux through space and time. We analyzed 18 years of data from seven moderately hard lakes in an agricultural prairie landscape in central Canada. We applied generalized additive models and sensitivity analyses to evaluate the roles of metabolic and climatic drivers in regulating CO2 flux at the intra-annual scale. At mean conditions with respect to other predictors, metabolic controls resulted in uptake of atmospheric CO2 when surface waters exhibited moderate primary production but released CO2 only when primary production was very low (<8 μg/L or when dissolved nitrogen was elevated (>2,000 μg/L), implying that respiratory controls offset photosynthetic CO2 uptake under these conditions. Climatically, dry conditions increased the likelihood of in-gassing, likely due to evaporative concentration of base cations and/or reduced allochthonous carbon loads. While more research is required to establish the relative importance of climate and metabolism at other timescales (diel, autumn/winter), we conclude that these hard fresh waters characteristic of continental interiors are mainly affected by metabolic drivers of pCO2 at daily-monthly timescales, are climatically controlled at interannual intervals, and are more likely to in-gas CO2 for a given level of algal abundance than are soft water, boreal ecosystems. ©2018.

THE POTENTIAL OF THE SDG FRAMEWORK TO PROMOTE EQUALITY THROUGH WASH INITIATIVES,"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by the UN member states in September 2015. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) replace the Millennium Development Goals. SDG 6 for WASH calls for universal and equitable access to these services by 2030. In this chapter we review the potential of the SDG framework to promote equality through WASH initiatives. We outline two key principles for action - universality and interconnectedness - before illustrating how these can be applied in the context of three challenges to accelerating progress: inequalities, urbanisation and climate change. We make an assessment of what is needed to put this rhetoric into practice, through national plans, policy changes, data, financing, and political will. The design, implementation, and monitoring of WASH programmes can be an entry point to attaining a range of SDG targets - on reducing inequalities within and between countries; for the sustainable services in small towns and informal settlements; and in adapting to climate change. We argue that WASH interventions can and do successfully contribute to equality outcomes and that the 2030 Agenda has the potential to further amplify this through its focus on universality and interconnectedness. Achieving this requires that WASH practitioners develop their capacity to work in an integrated way in support of government leadership, strengthened institutional arrangements (coordination, service delivery arrangements, accountability and regulation), sustainable WASH budgeting and financing, planning, monitoring and review. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Oliver Cumming and Tom Slaymaker. individual chapters, the contributors",Not About Sufficiency
‘Minilivestock’ farming: Who is farming edible insects in Europe and North America?,"An innovative food sector is emerging in North America and Europe: edible insects. Eating insects is not new; farming insects for human consumption is novel. This article provides an overview of entomophagy to contextualise this upsurge in ‘minilivestock’ farming. It also charts the rise of ‘feeder’ insect farms, because their ability to mass rear invertebrates – for exotic pets, reptiles and other insectivores – is of much interest to those starting and intensifying edible insect farms. A descriptive characterisation of frontier farmers will be provided by preliminary profile findings from 17 semi-structured pilot interviews with people with varying experience of rearing feeder and/or food insects. Since conventional livestock workers were the ‘forgotten pillar’ in agricultural research, this article affords timely insights into the socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle interests and farming experiences of ‘entopreneurs’ shaping this new ‘insect industry’. © The Author(s) 2018.",Not About Sufficiency

Spatial planning and climate change,"Spatial planning has a vital role to play in the move to a low carbon energy future and in adapting to climate change. To do this, spatial planning must develop and implement new approaches. Elizabeth Wilson and Jake Piper explore a wide range of issues in this comprehensive book on the relationship between our changing climate and spatial planning, and suggest ways of addressing the challenges by taking a longer-sighted approach to our preparation for the future. This text includes: an overview of what we know already about future climate change and its impacts, as we attempt both to adapt to these changes and to reduce the emissions which cause them the role of spatial planning in relation to climate change, offering some theoretical and political explanations for the challenges that planning faces in the coming decades a review of policy and legislation at international, EU and UK levels in regard to climate change, and the support this gives to the planning system case studies detailing what responses the UK and the Netherlands have made so far in light of the evidence ways to help new and existing urban developments to reduce energy use and to adapt to climate change, through strengthening the relationships between urban and rural areas to avoid water shortage, floods or loss of biodiversity. The authors take an evidence-based look at this hugely important topic, providing a well-illustrated text for spatial planning professionals, politicians and the interested public, as well as a useful reference for postgraduate planning, geography, urban studies, urban design and environmental studies students. © 2010 Elizabeth Wilson and Jake Piper.

Green shoots of recovery: the impact of a mental health ecotherapy programme,"Branching Out is a 12-week ecotherapy programme for clients who use mental health services within the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. Over the course of a year 110 clients attended the programme, of whom 77 (70%) completed the course. In order to ascertain the outcomes of the programme and the elements that appeared to facilitate change, semi-structured interviews with clients (n=28) and two focus groups with clinicians (n=5 and n=3) from the referring services were conducted.The data gathered therein was analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA). From the results, five themes emerged as client outcomes. These were: improvements to mental well-being, improvements to physical health, provision of daily structure and routine, transferable knowledge and skill acquisition, and increased social networking and social skills development. Three themes pertaining to the service logistics (team building and social inclusion, contrast of environments and work and recognition) emerged as potential explanations for the client outcomes. There was a perception among clients and clinicians that Branching Out represented a ‘stepping stone to further community engagement’. The results reflect a recovery-oriented approach to health care. The limitations of the evaluation and implications for the future are discussed. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Not About Sufficiency

How do cooperative renewable energy projects stand the test of public policy regimes? The cases of MOZES in the United Kingdom and Bretagne énergies citoyennes in France,"With British and French policy regimes that do not encourage cooperative energy projects, how can one explain the emergence of these initiatives over the past decade? Based on the analysis of two projects in Lorient and Nottingham, this paper tests the hypothesis of partnerships between local authorities and citizen groups as a tool to overcome the obstacles created by national policy regimes. In the case of Lorient, the author shows that the cooperation between the municipality and Bretagne énergies citoyennes (BEC) creates opportunities to mitigate the evolution of feed-in-tariffs. In the case of Nottingham the author shows that the initiative initially planned by Meadows Ozone Energy Services Limited (MOZES) is altered by the policy regime, as the partnership capacity between MOZES and Nottingham City Council is too weak to bypass the barriers established by the national regime. © P.

"Planning, development pressure, and change in green infrastructure quantity and configuration in coastal Texas","Land-use change is a lead driver of ecological degradation in coastal regions. By guiding where development and open space are located, local land use plans are theorized to be an important tool to protect green infrastructure in coastal areas and their related services. Higher quality plans are expected to lead to greater protection of green infrastructure (GI). Using multiple linear regression, we test whether the presence and quality of comprehensive plans are related to change in GI landscape configuration between 2000 and 2016 in cities along Texas’ coast. We find that comprehensive planning and plan quality are negatively associated with change in GI quantity and landscape pattern. Our results suggest that, in Texas, planning is mostly reactive; development pressure and environmental degradation likely lead to both loss of green infrastructure and city adoption of comprehensive plans. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
"Transforming cross-cultural water research through trust, participation and place","Indigenous voices in government-led natural resource management planning processes are often marginalised, misinterpreted, or excluded. Third parties, including government-employed geographers, can act as knowledge brokers in defining Indigenous values and interests so they might be included in government planning processes. This paper reviews and assesses a research partnership that evolved to document the complex and diverse ecological and hydrological values held by Ngan'gi speakers about the Daly River and connected water places in the Northern Territory, Australia. The development of trust through the slow building of a relationship based on place-based dialogue, a key aspect of participatory action research (PAR), created the foundation from which a mutually beneficial and respectful research partnership was able to, and continues to, evolve. Both research partners' perspectives are revealed here to articulate why the research partnership was deemed a success. Key lessons learned from the research partnership include the importance of trust, respect for place-based learning, researcher and institutional flexibility, and awareness of the intricacies of relationship building and the benefits that research engagement can bring to Indigenous people and communities. We aim to further dialogue among geographers and interested disciplines as to the potential for PAR methods to foster mutually beneficial Indigenous-non-Indigenous research partnerships. © 2016 Institute of Australian Geographers.",Not About Sufficiency
"Climate change: Disruption, risk and opportunity","Climate change is disruptive because virtually all aspects of our lives are best located in the Goldilocks zone: the place where it is “not too hot and not too cold but just right”. Rising greenhouse gases are heating the globe faster than has ever occurred before, and record-breaking intense, extreme weather is becoming more common. In the last three years unexpectedly severe hurricanes, heatwaves and forest fires have affected millions of people. What makes disruption dangerous? I suggest low predictability, high scale, speed and lack of reversibility are good guides. Risks to health are direct and indirect and include also the “transition risks” associated with responses to climate change. Sometimes disruption is welcome because it provides opportunities for radical action that would not be possible otherwise: in this vein, it has been argued that climate change is “not just a challenge, but the greatest public health opportunity of the 21st century”. The co-benefits agenda (justifying climate interventions on the basis of positive outcomes in other sectors) is beguiling: it promises a relatively smooth way forward, but might an emphasis on win-win interventions distract from the radical changes that are needed? There are other reasons for caution – the intersection of climate and health policies may contain trade-offs as well as synergies, and the prospect of future gains that outweigh immediate losses is seldom, on its own, sufficient to change in-grained behaviours and policies. © 2019 KeAi Communications Co., Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Land restoration in food security programmes: synergies with climate change mitigation,"Food-insecure households in many countries depend on international aid to alleviate acute shocks and chronic shortages. Some food security programmes (including Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program-PSNP - which provides a case study for this article) have integrated aid in exchange for labour on public works to reduce long-term dependence by investing in the productive capacity and resilience of communities. Using this approach, Ethiopia has embarked upon an ambitious national programme of land restoration and sustainable land management. Although the intent was to reduce poverty, here we show that an unintended co-benefit is the climate-change mitigation from reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increased landscape carbon stocks. The article first shows that the total reduction in net GHG emissions from PSNP's land management at the national scale is estimated at 3.4 millionMgCO(2)ey(-1) - approximately 1.5% of the emissions reductions in Ethiopia's Nationally Determined Contribution for the Paris Agreement. The article then explores some of the opportunities and constraints to scaling up of this impact.Key policy insights Food security programmes (FSPs) can contribute to climate change mitigation by creating a vehicle for investment in land and ecosystem restoration.Maximizing mitigation, while enhancing but not compromising food security, requires that climate projections, and mitigation and adaptation responses should be mainstreamed into planning and implementation of FSPs at all levels.Cross-cutting oversight is required to integrate land restoration, climate policy, food security and disaster risk management into a coherent policy framework.Institutional barriers to optimal implementation should be addressed, such as incentive mechanisms that reward effort rather than results, and lack of centralized monitoring and evaluation of impacts on the physical environment.Project implementation can often be improved by adopting best management practices, such as using productive living livestock barriers where possible, and increasing the integration of agroforestry and non-timber forest products into landscape regeneration.",Not About Sufficiency
Perceived Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility and Employees’ Innovative Behavior: A Stimulus–Organism–Response Perspective,"Drawing from the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model, this study examines how and under what circumstances perceived environmental corporate social responsibility (ECSR) affects innovative behavior of employees in the context of environmental protection. Using a sample of 398 employees from different firms in the high energy-consuming industry of China, the results indicate that, at first, perceived ECSR provides a positive effect on organizational identification. Secondly, organizational identification has a positive influence on the innovative behavior of employees. Thirdly, organizational identification plays an important mediating effect between perceived ECSR and the innovative behavior of employees. Fourthly, both the effect of perceived ECSR on organizational identification and the indirect effect of perceived ECSR on the innovative behavior of the employees via organizational identification will be stronger when the levels of organizational trust are high. These findings add new insights into the perceived ECSR-employees’ innovative behavior relationship and provide important managerial implications for enhancing ECSR perception to improve the innovative behavior of employees.

A new dietary guideline balancing sustainability and nutrition for China's rural and urban residents,"Diets have important but often complex implications for both environmental quality and nutrition. We establish a production-oriented life cycle model to quantify and compare the farm-to-gate environmental impacts and food nutritional qualities underlying rural and urban diets in China from 1980 to 2019, a period of rapid urbanization and socioeconomic changes. The environmental impacts of rural diets were generally higher than those of urban diets, but this gap reduced after 2000. Environmental and nutritional values varied considerably across the 31 Chinese provinces due to their different food intakes and dietary structures. Dietary changes coinciding with urbanization increased greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication potential, and nutritional quality, but decreased energy consumption and acidification potential. Based on our results, we propose a new dietary guideline to mitigate environmental impacts and improve nutritional quality. © 2022 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Multi-scenario simulation and carbon storage assessment of land use in a multi-mountainous city,"Scientific prediction and assessment of land use types and their carbon storage potentials in urban areas under various future development scenarios hold significant practical importance for guiding urban territorial spatial planning and landscape regulation. This study, based on three phases of high-precision land use data in the central urban area of Guiyang City, utilizes the PLUS-InVEST model to simulate and evaluate the dynamics of land use and its carbon storage potential in a multi-mountainous city area under three future development scenarios. The results indicate that, between 2008 and 2018, the cultivated land and urban remnant mountainous (URMs) in the Guiyang build-up area decreased by 94.17 km2 and 13.32 km2, respectively. Concurrently, the area of artificial surfaces and green land increased by 77.2 km2 and 26.4 km2, respectively. Under the Ecological Conservation-Prioritized (EC) scenario, Guiyang City's land use pattern emphasizes the protection of natural green spaces and restricts the conversion of artificial surfaces to other land types. This scenario results in the highest carbon storage and sustains positive growth in the economic value of carbon sequestration. Conversely, under the Economic Development-Prioritized (ED) scenario, artificial surfaces continue to expand, leading to the lowest carbon storage and the most severe loss in the economic value of carbon sequestration. Notably, when constrained by red-line protection policies, the total carbon storage exhibits positive changes across all three simulation scenarios. These findings provide valuable reference and basis for future territorial spatial planning and landscape regulation aimed at sustainable development goals in multi-mountainous cities. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Academic air travel has a limited influence on professional success,"Lowering the growth in greenhouse gas emissions from air travel may be critical for avoiding dangerous levels of climate change, and yet some individuals perceive frequent air travel to be critical to their professional success. Using a sample of 705 travellers at the University of British Columbia, we investigated the influence of career stage, research productivity, field of expertise, and other variables on academic air travel and the associated emissions. This is the first time that research has evaluated the link between observed air travel and academic success. First, we compared air travel behaviour at different career stages and found that individuals at the start of their careers were responsible for fewer emissions from air travel than senior academics. Second, since career advancement may depend on an academic's ability to form partnerships and disseminate their research abroad, we investigated the relationship between air travel emissions and publicly available bibliometric measurements. We found no relationship between air travel emissions and metrics of academic productivity including hIa (h-index adjusted for academic age and discipline). There was, however, a relationship between emissions and salary that remains significant even when controlling for seniority. Finally, based on the premise that academics studying topics related to sustainability may have greater responsibility or motivation to reduce their emissions, we coded 165 researchers in our sample as either “Green” or “Not-green.” We found no significant difference between Green and Not-green academics in total air travel emissions, or in the types of emissions that might be easiest to avoid. Taken together, this preliminary evidence suggests that there may be opportunities, especially for academics who study topics related to climate and sustainability, to reduce their emissions from air travel while maintaining productive careers. © 2019",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of AI applications on corporate green innovation,"In the context of China's efforts to achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, this study examined the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) applications on corporate green innovation (CGI) and the mechanism underlying such impact. Based on the panel data of 5209 Chinese listed firms from 2003 to 2022, this study empirically analyzed the relationship between AI applications and CGI using text analysis and econometric methods. The results revealed that AI applications significantly positively affect CGI. Additionally, media attention positively moderates the relationship between AI applications and CGI efficiency. Heterogeneity analysis further revealed the significantly different roles of various factors (e.g., region, industry, and nature of corporate ownership) in the relationship between AI applications and CGI. Our findings provide empirical support for the role of AI applications in achieving China's carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, and are of both theoretical and practical significance to promoting green transformation in China's economic development. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Modelling the asymmetric impact of fintech, natural resources, and environmental regulations on ecological footprint in G7 countries","Ecological sustainability is one of the utmost agenda for policymakers across the world. In this dimension, identifying the innovative role of Fintech is imperative to ensure an efficient resource allocation with inclusive economic and environmental performance. G7 countries are divergent in resource endowment, technological advancement, financial integrity, environmental controls and structural shifts. Therefore, the study employs the nonlinear method of moments quantile regression (MMQR) for the empirical investigation to evaluate the asymmetric influence of Fintech, natural resources rent, and ecological regulations on ecological footprints (EF) from 2000 to 2020. The pre-requisite analysis affirms the abnormal data distribution and structural variations. The estimated outcomes demonstrate that Fintech significantly reduces EF across all quantiles except the highest (0.95th) quantile. Likewise, ecological governance significantly discourages the EF from lower to higher quantiles and has large parameter coefficients at higher ecological deficits. In contrast, natural resources significantly increases EF from lower to upper EF quantiles, whereas the positive marginal influences are prominent at upper quantiles. The robustness check verifies the consistent results. Panel causality analysis exhibits a one-way causal relationship between Fintech, environmental regulations, and EF and a two-way causality connection among natural resources, economic growth, and EF. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Nexus between green investment and technological innovation in BRI nations: What is the role of environmental sustainability and domestic investment?,"The critical role of technological innovation has been extensively investigated by considering various aspects of macro-fundamentals across the world. Although the determents of technological innovation have been investigated predominantly from the perspective of firms, the role of macro-fundamentals is yet to be extensively explored. The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of green investment, measured by renewable energy; domestic investment measured by gross capital formation; and environmental sustainability measured by carbon emission on technological innovation in BRI nations for the period 2000–2021. The study used a cross-sectional dependency test, a unit root test following CADF and CIPS, an error correction-based panel cointegration test, ARDL, CS-ARDL, and a nonlinear ARDL. Furthermore, the directional causalities were documented by performing the heterogeneous causality test. Taking into account the findings of the study, it is revealed that green investment and domestic investment are positively connected with technological innovation in BRI nations, while environmental sustainability is correlated negatively and statistically significant to technological innovation. Furthermore, the asymmetric investigation established asymmetric effects from green investment, environmental sustainability, and domestic investment to technological innovation. According to the asymmetric coefficients, the positive and negative shocks of green and domestic investment disclosed positive and statistically significant links with technological innovation, whereas the asymmetric shocks in environmental sustainability revealed adverse ties to technological innovation in BRI nations. The study documented the unidirectional causal effects from green investment to technological innovation [GI→TI] and technological innovation to environmental sustainability [TI→ES]. Furthermore, the study documented bidirectional casualties between domestic investment, foreign direct investment, financial development, and technological innovation [TI←→DI; TI←→FDI; TI←→FD]. The study suggested that domestic capital formation and environmental protection in BRI nations should be actively promoted to accelerate technological innovation. Furthermore, the study postulated that investment in research and development should be encouraged with incentives for technological innovation.

Can green process innovation improve both financial and environmental performance? The roles of TMT heterogeneity and ownership,"The overuse of natural resources has caused many environmental concerns. Green process innovation (GPI) has been seen as an effective solution that can benefit both industry and society. However, prior studies have not fully examined the contingent mechanisms of the relationship between GPI and both environmental and financial performance. This study fills this research gap. Using the data of 172 manufacturing firms (including 104 state-owned and 68 non-state-owned manufacturing firms) in China, this work investigates the impacts of GPI on both environmental and financial performance, with a particular focus on the moderating roles of top management team (TMT) heterogeneity and firm ownership. The results present valuable findings. First, we found that GPI has a significant positive effect on firms' environmental performance. We also show that although GPI does not improve firms' financial performance significantly in the short term, additional analysis demonstrated that three-year-lagged GPI does indeed have a positive effect on firms' financial performance. Second, we established that strong TMT heterogeneity enhances the link between GPI and firms' environmental and financial performance. Third, we revealed that the relationship between GPI and firms' financial performance is enhanced for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), but, surprisingly, that the link is weakened for SOEs. Overall, the findings of this study present new implications for academics, managers, and policymakers, as they uncover the impacts of GPI on environmental and financial performance by leveraging levels of TMT heterogeneity and firms' ownership status. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Structure and Resilience of Industrial System under Impacts from Major Events: An Empirical Study Based on Networks Constructed with Input-output and Integer Programming Approaches,"A comprehensive examination on the structure and resilience of the industrial system, and their changes in the context of major events, contributes to a deep understanding about the relationships of production cooperation among industries and maintains the stability of the system; moreover, this is helpful for scientifically allocating production resources and promoting the transformation and upgrading of industries. This paper takes input-output tables as the data foundation, and combines complex network theory with integer programming method to construct an “input-output-integer programming” complex industrial linkage network; furthermore, it explores the variations in the structure and resilience of China’s industrial system. The empirical results show that: i) The structure of the industrial system significantly impacts the GDP growth rate, and the denser the former is, the faster the latter is, and vice versa. Over the past decade since 2011, the structure has become increasingly loose; ii) major events, such as stimulative economic policies implementation and supply-side structural reform, shorten the distance for resource transfer between industries and improve the structure of the industrial system, but their impacts on the system are localized; however, the events like european debt crisis escalation, China-US trade friction intensification, and COVID-19 outbreak extend the distances, resulting in negative shocks and widespread impacts; iii) compared to in periods of high-speed economic growth, the structure of the industrial system loosens in times of medium to low growth, leading certain industries to play an “intermediary” role cross a large range to coordinate resource allocations and satisfy production demands. This phenomenon is particularly evident during China-US trade frictions and COVID-19; iv) from 2011 to 2020, the resilience of the industrial system consistently remains at a high level but exhibits a weakening trend. Driven by relevant economic policies and market reforms, the system significantly improves its defense, adaptation, and recovery capabilities in the face of impacts from major events. © 2024 Science China Press.

Community Bargaining with Urban Growth: The Case of J Village in Guangzhou,"The past several decades have seen China undergo a rapid urbanization process. During periods of economic prosperity, cities expropriate outlying lands, often villages, for economic development with the support of various local and national government programs designed to encourage urban expansion. However, the autonomy of the villages has not been paid enough attention. How does incorporation into an urban development zone affect the community identity and autonomy of a village? How does the village bargain with external urban institutions? This research is based on ethnographic research and interviews conducted in 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2021. The results reveal that villagers are generally willing to accept the loss of their collective land in exchange for a larger share of the promised prosperity of industrialization, but over time they tend to find that the immediate benefits of expropriation are outweighed by long-term costs. They lose the support of the state and are exposed to new vulnerabilities, such as pollution and economic instability. Indeed, they agree to undertake unknown future risks in exchange for short-term gains. They cannot gain the right to the city, but gradually lose control of the village. © 2022 by the authors.

Mitigation versus adaptation: climate-change-related appeals and pondering the future,"Purpose: Responding to a recent editorial call for sustainable development (Truong and Saunders, 2021), this study aims to explore the persuasiveness of climate-change-related appeals. Design/methodology/approach: Three scenario-based experiments were conducted to test the effect of climate-change-related appeals on persuasion, the underlying mechanism causing that effect and associated boundary conditions. Statistical results were based on analysis of variance, mediation and moderation analysis. Findings: Adaptation-oriented appeals are more persuasive than mitigation-oriented appeals. Specifically, adaptation (versus mitigation) appeals activate a self-regulation process that encourages people to think about the future, making them more likely to address climate change. This effect is salient when consumers’ environmental concerns are low. Practical implications: To boost message persuasiveness, marketers and public policymakers could construct abstract and long-horizon climate-change-related appeals and provide prompts or interventions to promote people’s elaborations about potential outcomes. Social implications: To boost message persuasiveness, marketers and public policymakers could construct abstract and long-horizon climate-change-related appeals and provide prompts or interventions to promote people’s elaborations about potential outcomes.

Towards Carbon Neutrality: Carbon Emission Performance of Science and Technology Finance Policy,"Combining technology with finance is the focus of supporting economic structure adjustment, and environmental benefits are also the proper meaning of the policy. Using the panel data of 274 cities in China from 2006 to 2017, this paper examines the impact of the Science and Technology Finance Policy (STFP) on carbon emission intensity in pilot cities and the transmission mechanisms through the difference-in-differences method and further explores the impact of STFP on the carbon emission intensity in neighboring cities. The results show that (1) STFP has significantly reduced carbon emission intensity in pilot cities and has dynamic effects, which gradually increase over time. There is significant heterogeneity in the carbon emission reduction effect of STFP, which produces stronger policy effects in first and second-tier cities and cities with higher information levels. (2) STFP achieves carbon emission reduction effects through three main pathways: the total factor productivity improvement effect, innovative elements agglomeration effect, and industrial structure optimization effect. (3) The STFP and national e-commerce demonstration policy have an interactive effect, and the two jointly contribute to the reduction in carbon emission intensity. From the perspective of a spatial effect, STFP has a radiation effect; that is, STFP not only reduces local carbon emission intensity but also curbs the carbon emission intensity in neighboring areas. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Estimating GDP by Fusing Nighttime Light and Land Cover Data,"Accurate information on gross domestic product (GDP) is essential for better understanding the dynamics of regional economies and urbanization processes. Satellite based nighttime light datasets can well track GDP in urban areas, however, they are difficult to be used in suburban, rural and sparsely populated areas. Thus, this study explored the potential of GlobeLand30 and relief degree for improving the ability of VIIRS Nighttime Light data of GDP estimation. Firstly, we calculated the Moran’s Index (Moran’s I) to measure spatial auto-correlation of GDP. At provincial level, Moran’s I Index of GDP is 0.14, Z value is 2.29. While at the prefecture city level, it is 0.11 and 14.54, respectively. Then, we compared the results derived from geographically weighted regression (GWR) and OLS models (i.e., R2, root mean square error, corrected Akaike information criteria and residuals). Both models suggest that land cover information can significantly improve GDP estimation performance, and total nighttime light (TNL) is the most important economic indicator for estimating GDP. The coefficients of the GWR model for TNL at the provincial and prefecture levels are 1.75 and 1.19, respectively, which are significantly larger than the coefficients for other factors such as land cover and terrain undulation. In addition, the GWR model performed better than OLS model in GDP estimation at both provincial and prefecture levels, and prefecture-level models can better depict the spatial variation in detail. In provincial-level models, GWR could account for 93% of economic development, while OLS could only reflect 82%. Likewise, in prefecture-level models, R2 of GWR model improved almost 50% compared with that of OLS model. © 2024 The Author(s).

‘Dual Carbon Goals’ enhances policy integration: analysing recent changes in China’s national climate policy,"China recently set out to achieve the goal of reaching carbon peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, the so-called ‘Dual Carbon Goals’ (DCGs), making climate change enjoy the highest-ever political salience. The DCGs entail a new policymaking paradigm under which climate goals are required to be integrated into all relevant sectors. Based on a quantitative content analysis of policy documents enacted by 41 national governmental agencies, we found that the DCGs has led to significant increase in the level of climate policy integration (CPI). Despite the overall rise of CPI, our findings revealed notable differences in CPI among governmental agencies. We proposed a three-factor framework to explain what drives the variance in CPI. Through a chronological analysis, this study examined the evolution of China’s national climate policy portfolios across 12 policy domains. Our results showed that China’s sectoral climate policy has experienced dramatic changes in both scope and scale. This study provided an in-depth understanding of Chinese climate policy mix to mitigate climate change and contributed to existing literature by filling a research gap–the lack of empirical analysis on whether, how, and to what extent CPI occurs in Chinese context. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency

With these latent factors, a factor analysis evaluation model (FAEM), divided into factor analysis model (FAM) and comprehensive evaluation model (CEM), was established. The FAM was used to explore the effect of observed variables on the high capital cost of prefabrication, while the CEM was used to evaluate comprehensive cost management level on prefabrication projects. Case studies were conducted to verify the models. The results revealed that collaborative management had a positive effect on capital cost of prefabrication. Material increment costs and labor costs had significant impacts on production cost. This study demonstrated the potential of on-site management and standardization design to reduce capital cost. Hence, collaborative management is necessary for cost management of prefabrication. Innovation and detailed design were needed to improve cost performance. The new form of precast component factories can be explored to reduce transportation cost. Meanwhile, targeted strategies can be adopted for different prefabrication projects. The findings optimized the capital cost and improved the cost performance through providing an evaluation and optimization model, which helps managers to evaluate cost management level of prefabrication and explore key inducers for high capital cost. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"An investigation of the complementary effects of technology, market, and design capabilities on exploratory and exploitative innovations: Evidence from micro and small-sized tech enterprises in China","Technology, market, and design are important driving forces for enterprise innovation activities. Unfortunately, their combined effects on exploratory and exploitative innovations are less clear, especially for micro and small businesses critical to the economy. By using data from a two-stage survey of 357 micro and small-sized tech enterprises (MSTEs) in the fast-developing region of Foshan, this study investigates how diverse complementarities between technology, market, and design capabilities contribute to exploratory innovation and exploitative innovation. The results reveal how distinct contributions from the capabilities affect exploratory and exploitative innovations in differentiated ways. Specifically, exploratory innovation benefits from the three-way complementarity of technology, market, and design capabilities, whereas exploitative innovation only benefits from the two-way complementarities between technology and market capabilities and between market and design capabilities. These findings contribute to the resource-based view (RBV) literature, while providing managers with guidelines to improve capability investment and allocation decisions that foster exploratory and exploitative innovations. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Fine Particulate Matter Bound Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Carbonaceous Species in Delhi’s Atmosphere: Seasonal Variation, Sources, and Health Risk Assessment","This study was carried out to determine sources and health risks of fine particulate (PM2.5) bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and carbonaceous species in the ambient atmosphere of Delhi. Aerosol samples were collected from October 2017 to September 2018 in an institutional cum residential area of Delhi. Annual PM2.5 level was found to be 124.3 ± 107.6 µg/m3 which exceeded the Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) by over three times. Sixteen US EPA priority PAHs’ concentration exhibited a seasonal trend of winter > monsoon > summer with annual mean level of 83.6 ± 48.0 ng/m3. Winter and summer (p < 0.05), and monsoon and summer (p < 0.05) values were significantly different. Low-molecular-weight (LMW) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) PAHs contributed about 34.4% and 65.6% to Ʃ16PAHs, respectively. Annual mean organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) levels were 21.5 ± 16.1 µg/m3 and 20.1 ± 20.5 µg/m3, respectively, with a mean OC/EC ratio of 1.8 ± 2.6. Winter OC and EC values showed significant mean difference from summer and monsoon (p < 0.01) with a seasonal trend of winter > summer ≈ monsoon. Molecular diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis identified vehicular emission as the leading source of these species followed by biomass and coal combustion, industrial emissions, and volatilization of petroleum and its products. Regional and trans-boundary incursion of pollutants was also identified with the help of back trajectories and concentration weighted trajectories. Carcinogenic PAHs contributed ̴41.4% to the aerosol PAHs load. Incremental cancer risk assessment estimated ̴ 25 additional cancer cases per million population due to lifetime inhalation exposure to PAHs at their observed concentration in Delhi. © 2021, Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy Sciences.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy–poverty–climate vulnerability nexus: an approach to sustainable development for the poorest of poor,"The livelihood of indigenous people, residing in the forest fringe area of developing countries like India, are primarily dependent on the forest. These forest fringe communities represent the country’s poorest people and are the most vulnerable due to their high dependency on natural resources, lack of energy, unemployment, poor quality of life and poor socio-economic conditions. Additionally, climate change and lesser adaptive capacity have further exacerbated their struggle to meet their livelihoods. Thus, alleviating poverty, strengthening adaptive capacity to climate change and improving energy access are interlinked and complementary to each other, forming an energy–poverty–climate nexus. The study attempted to understand and analyse the nexus between poverty, energy access and climate vulnerability of the most impoverished villages of India. The study was conducted in 29 forest fringe villages, spread in Mandla and Hoshangabad districts of the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The state has the distinction of having the highest forest cover and tribal population in the country. A detailed household survey was conducted to assess poverty, climate vulnerability and energy access of 325 households by using progress out of poverty index (PPI), climate change vulnerability index (CCVI) and energy access index (EAI), respectively. The data were collected through interview sessions with the respondents in the regional language. After computing scores of all indices, correlation, regression and chi-square were applied to test the integration of these three variables to understand the energy–poverty–climate nexus. The study found a nexus between energy access, poverty and climate vulnerability and also identified 14 indicators, which significantly influenced the nexus. These indicators were related to agriculture, energy, income and infrastructure, and education and awareness that together help to form an institutional framework for sustainable development. The framework suggests the formation of a block-level committee for monitoring and evaluation, a district-level committee for mobilizing funds, and a state-level inter-departmental committee for planning and implementation. Furthermore, the analysis on scores of different indices revealed that parameters like economic class, type of livelihood options/occupation and education level of a household may be the appropriate indicators for the selection of households to prioritize the target beneficiaries of programmes and policies related to poverty, energy and climate change in the forest fringe villages of India. Based on this, a site-specific framework was designed to act and prioritize programme implementation to achieve sustainable development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Subterranean eco-dystopia in Istanbul: the concreted segregation of Tarlabaşı,"The underground layers of cities are constantly concreted with urban transformation projects. The studies on built environment mainly focus on the morphological changes, related dispossessions and observable aspects of urban landscape. However, the environmental costs of transformations are not limited to the impacts of above-ground interventions. In Istanbul, the major impact of subterranean interventions is the destruction of water and soil ecosystems as well as its multi-layered heritage as the large-scale urban transformation decisions are primarily applied to historic neighbourhoods where the existing building stock was appropriated by the urban precariat. The urban transformation projects in historic neighbourhoods of Istanbul come into question with socio-economic dispossessions rather than environmental justice. In this manuscript, the main aim is to address the socio-ecological impacts of planning and architectural design decisions disregarding subterranean construction density, through the case of Tarlabaşı in Istanbul. Tarlabaşı represents one of the most emblematic case in Istanbul’s urban resistance history and evokes eco-dystopias, which may be attributed to the decisions that justify stigmatisation. With the context, conceptual frame and scope set by these problem definitions, while considering urban inequality a pre-condition of environmental justice, this manuscript examines the correlation between environmental policies, social stigmatisation and flexed environmental values in planning and architecture culture via local political ecology. The methodology employed in the study is based on qualitative analysis of the stages and legal decisions involved. Archival documents on the study area were used to identify the local variables contributing to the deterioration of socio-ecological unity for future discussions. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Variable kinship patterns in Neolithic Anatolia revealed by ancient genomes,"The social organization of the first fully sedentary societies that emerged during the Neolithic period in Southwest Asia remains enigmatic,1 mainly because material culture studies provide limited insight into this issue. However, because Neolithic Anatolian communities often buried their dead beneath domestic buildings,2 household composition and social structure can be studied through these human remains. Here, we describe genetic relatedness among co-burials associated with domestic buildings in Neolithic Anatolia using 59 ancient genomes, including 22 new genomes from Aşıklı Höyük and Çatalhöyük. We infer pedigree relationships by simultaneously analyzing multiple types of information, including autosomal and X chromosome kinship coefficients, maternal markers, and radiocarbon dating. In two early Neolithic villages dating to the 9th and 8th millennia BCE, Aşıklı Höyük and Boncuklu, we discover that siblings and parent-offspring pairings were frequent within domestic structures, which provides the first direct indication of close genetic relationships among co-burials. In contrast, in the 7th millennium BCE sites of Çatalhöyük and Barcın, where we study subadults interred within and around houses, we find close genetic relatives to be rare. Hence, genetic relatedness may not have played a major role in the choice of burial location at these latter two sites, at least for subadults. This supports the hypothesis that in Çatalhöyük,3–5 and possibly in some other Neolithic communities, domestic structures may have served as burial location for social units incorporating biologically unrelated individuals. Our results underscore the diversity of kin structures in Neolithic communities during this important phase of sociocultural development. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Just transition through “commoning” coastal wetlands in growing and shrinking communities in Japan,"Coastal wetlands, such as tidal flats, saltmarshes, and mangroves, have provided a variety of ecosystem services to us since human history began. Until around the 1970s, they were often managed as commons, but increasingly they have been privatized or taken into public ownership and destroyed through industrialization and capitalist management strategies, despite the people whose livelihoods depend on fishing these wetlands. However, in recent decades, restoration of coastal wetlands has been happening around the world. This article utilizes the current discussions on commoning—returning privatized or publicly owned resources into community managed ones—and how the restoration of coastal wetlands could bring just transition, beginning with our coastal communities in Japan. The article looks at how local communities with growing populations could adopt past core common management principles, while local communities with shrinking populations consider new approaches. These include informing in-situ and ex-situ people about the multiple benefits of commoning; tightening membership of a new common around extractive resources, while widening it around management tasks; and sharing labor accounts with ex-situ community members. Commoning of coastal wetlands could provide new opportunities not only for local communities to obtain resources, but also for self-governance strategies to achieve just transition for the future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
How Investor Sentiment Affects Corporate Environmental Behavior?,Environmental protection is not a monologue for businesses. The financial market al.so influences the environmental protection of businesses. Combine the text analysis method and entropy value TOPSIS method to construct an index to evaluate the environmental protection of enterprises. The theoretical analysis is followed by empirical analysis using multiple regression. Data from the China Economic and Financial Research Database. It is found that: (Akram et al. 2023) high investor sentiment can effectively promote corporate environmental protection; (Chen and Zhao 2022) financial status plays the role of mediating effect; (Adebayo and Alola 2023) external analysts’ attention can positively influence this relationship; (Siddique et al. 2021) the nature of ownership of the enterprise can cause the effect of heterogeneity; and (Wang et al. 2021) the impact of investor sentiment on corporate environmental protection becomes larger after the proportion of managerial shareholding crosses a threshold. The most innovative point of this study is the construction of a new indicator to evaluate corporate environmental protection from the aspects of corporate environmental protection attitude and environmental protection achievement. This study extends the literature on capital markets and corporate environmental protection. It also provides empirical evidence for firms to increase management shareholding. © University of Tehran 2024.,Not About Sufficiency
An assessment of the media's portrayal of murders at Chinese mines,"Mining-related crime in China has been understudied, although such cases have been repeatedly reported. These cases are also referred to as ‘Blind Shaft murders’, a phrase associating these murders with a movie in which co-workers were killed, and the deaths made to look like an accident as a means of extorting compensation from the mine owner to keep the incident quiet. This study is the first known study to review how Chinese newspapers have covered such murders and the blame that ensued. It finds that the media adopted a suspect-centred reporting style: the media overemphasized the suspects’ past private lives, and it depicted them as being from poor mountainous areas and portrayed them as leading a deviant lifestyle. In contrast, in the media reporting for the victims, only cases of mentally disabled or otherwise newsworthy victims attracted much media attention. An examination of the circumstances surrounding the murders revealed that the murders were driven by the opportunities provided by a combination of weak safety regulations, weak enforcement, and the actors’ opportunistic behaviour. The media meanwhile tended to frame the cause of such murders as individual manifestations of the evils of human nature and was less likely to point to the loopholes provided by the mining safety management system. This study further discusses the reasons for the media's frame choices and their possible effects on society and policymaking. It maintains that unlike the situation in which the demise of canaries in a coalmine would prompt miners to flee from their mining shafts, the media framing of such murders has so far failed to similarly act as a precursor for policy change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Evaluation of Smart Energy Management Systems and Novel UV-Oriented Solution for Integration, Resilience, Inclusiveness and Sustainability","At present, energy has become an indispensable part of our lives. While we are enjoying the benefits energy bring to us, we are facing challenges, such as ever-increasing energy consumption, limited energy resources, lack of robustness and resilience in response to unexpected disturbances, safety and security issues, costly impact on the environment and human health, and energy inequality. The transformation into the smart energy management system further aggravates these problems and introduces new challenges, such as the costly construction of smart facilities. In this paper, we evaluate, from the UV perspective, the challenges of the energy system and the current status of the smart energy management system based on the framework of closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that an effective smart energy management system should take into consideration of the interaction between the smart energy management system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart city infrastructure, smart environ-mental protection management, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity, and also study how the smart energy management system would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study enables us to improve preparedness, coordination adaptiveness, safety, robustness resilience of current smart energy management system and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve the energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption through hybrid, integrative needed-based data acquisition, proactive communication and information sharing, adaptive decision making based on hierarchical knowledge level across spatiotemporal levels, human-involved and hybrid action. © 2020 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Frailty on COVID-19 Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 16 Cohort Studies,"Background: Frail patients are increasingly vulnerable to stress, which is mainly manifested by a reduced physiologic reserve in metabolic and immune systems and neuromuscular system. Several studies found a significant association of frailty with COVID-19 severity to support the evidence for the application of frailty assessment. However, there were contradictory results in other studies. Thus we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the current studies to investigate impact of frailty on COVID-19 outcomes and provide evidence-based decisions in clinical practice. Objective: We aimed to synthesize the current studies to investigate impact of frailty on COVID-19 outcomes and provide evidence-based decisions in clinical practice. Design: A systematic review and Meta-analysis of 16 cohort studies. Participants: Patients with COVID-19. Methods: A systematic retrieving for potential literature was conducted in several public electronic databases, including Medline(OvidSP), EMBASE, Pubmed and Chinese databases(China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and Weipu) on August 1, 2020. The literature research was updated on October 26, 2020. Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort studies was used for quality assessment. RevMan (Version 5.3) and Stata 14.0 were used to synthesize the pooled effects. Results: According to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, sixteen studies of 4324 patients were included in the final analysis. Frailty was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality among patients with COVID-19, with pooled adjusted odds ratios of 1.81 (95% confidence intervals:1.48,2.21, I2=87.0%, P<0.001). The result was consistent in stratified analysis to according to age, patient source, definitions of frailty, study quality, and adjustment method. Frailty was significant associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 severity, admission to intensive care unit, application of invasive mechanical ventilation, long-length stay. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we found frailty was significantly associated with an increased risk of clinical adverse events (all- cause mortality, COVID-19 severity, admission to the intensive care unit, application of invasive mechanical ventilation, long-length stay). Given the epidemic of COVID-19 and shortage of medical resources, paying more attention to screening frailty would contribute to disease management and resource allocation among patients with COVID-19. © 2021, Serdi and Springer-Verlag International SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
The Role of Passive Investors in Corporate Governance and Socially Responsible Investing: Evidence from Shareholder Proposals,"We study whether the substantial rise in passive ownership reshapes activist shareholders’ behavior in sponsoring shareholder proposals, which shareholders use to address issues they believe are crucial for the sustainable growth of a company. Our findings reveal a positive impact of passive investors on the initiation of governance, socially responsible investing (SRI), and an aggregate of both proposals. Interestingly, we show that managerial ability and board co-option potentially moderate their link. In the subsequent analysis, we note a constructive influence of passive investors on post-initiation outcomes, evidenced by an increase in withdrawal and voting percentage of proposals corresponding to heightened levels of passive ownership. These findings suggest that passive investors foster communication between activists and management and endorse the case even when it progresses to the voting stage. More importantly, the market values these proposals positively as reflected in higher observed buy-and-hold returns. Finally, our results are robust to instrumental variable analysis using Russell reconstitution as an exogenous shock. Taken together, our study offers broad implications that passive investors can indirectly engage in promoting sustainable practices by encouraging activist investors to sponsor governance and socially responsible proposals, a collaborative approach where shareholders contribute to sustainability efforts. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Fuzzy-based multi-criteria decision analysis of environmental regulation and green economic efficiency in a post-COVID-19 scenario: the case of China,"The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak posed serious threats not only to global health but also to the worldwide development regime. The experts, economists, policymakers, and the governments expressed their pledges and determinations to adapt and mitigate climate change. Policymakers and governments have started adopting green growth and development strategies. The progress moves further to achieve green economic efficiency (GEE) to achieve economic, social, and environmental development. One of the major challenges has been promulgating and strictly implementing environmental regulations and policies vis-à-vis green growth and development. China, having the second largest economy, has started its voyage to achieve GEE. However, there are multiple challenges on the way to the green economy. The objective of the present stud is to analyze environmental regulation and GEE in China using fuzzy-based multi-criteria decision analysis. To serve this purpose, the study identifies 5 alternative strategies to achieve GEE while considering 10 criteria and 48 sub-criteria in the context of environmental regulations in China. The Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been employed to rank criteria and sub-criteria to the goal. The Fuzzy VIekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method has been used to rank the alternative strategies of GEE. The proposed model unveiled resource efficiency and green purchasing as the best strategy to achieve GEE in the Chinese economy followed by local production. The study provides a comprehensive insight into the green development process to achieve GEE in the Chinese economy in the post-COVID-19 world. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
"Public awareness, behavior and preventive practices of the rural people in the adaptation to smog episodes","Smog has emerged as one of the biggest issues facing Pakistan and many other nations in recent decades. However, this crucial environmental issue has received less attentions of measuring public perception and awareness of air pollution and the connections between it and smog prevention in a Pakistani context especially with respect to rural areas. A questionnaire based study was designed to evaluate the rural people perception, awareness and preventive practices to cope with severe episodes of smog in district Kahnewal, South Punjab, to fill this gap. The results indicated that majority of the respondents comes from working in the city accounting for 36.44% of the total income. About 85% of the people in the villages have moderate to a good level of understanding regarding smog pollution. Moreover, around 84% of the people in the villages were considering smog to be a moderate to very severe problem. Television news and weather forecasts (34%) were found to be the most often used source of information on smog. About 44% of respondents were using facemasks while 32% of the participants had reduced their outdoor activities as potential protection measures against smog. The findings of this study can help to improve the understanding of public awareness of smog pollution in rural people of Pakistan, thereby encouraging greater public involvement in smog prevention and management, contributing significantly to the broader goal of sustainable development. © 2025 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

Untangling the forces behind carbon emissions in China's industrial sector - A pre and post 12th energy climate plan analysis,"The Chinese government announced the 12th Energy Climate Plan in March 2011, demonstrating a strong commitment to addressing energy and climate change and setting specific targets for reducing industrial carbon emissions. The study assesses China's industrial carbon emissions under the 12th Energy & Climate Plan framework. This study evaluated two scenarios to value its findings. In the first scenario, the study evaluated the whole sample period (2000−2020); subsequently, the time frame of the study was divided between two stints (pre- period (2000−2010)) and (post-period (2011−2020)). The study applied the logarithmic Mean Divisia Index to decompose the contributing factors to industrial carbon emissions and the Tapio decoupling model to analyze the decoupling states of the industrial sector of thirty provinces and three regions (eastern, western, and central). Based on the additive LMDI decomposition, the factors that contribute most to industrial carbon emission are carbon intensity, energy intensity, and economic activity-1. Twenty-one provinces experienced a change in the decoupling state between the pre-and post-period periods. Ten provinces experienced weak decoupling in the post-period. Fifteen provinces changed to strong decoupling. At the same time, the two provinces experienced recessive decoupling and expensive coupling. One province changed to weak negative decoupling in the post-period. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
Green Wars: Conservation and Decolonization in the Maya Forest,"Global conservation efforts are celebrated for saving Guatemala's Maya Forest.

Even as Q'eqchi's participate in conservation, Green Wars amplifies their call for material decolonization by recognizing the relationship between Indigenous peoples and the land itself. © 2018 by Megan Ybarra.",Not About Sufficiency
"Examining the drivers of inclusive growth: A study of economic performance, environmental sustainability, and life expectancy in BRICS economies","Achieving a balance between economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social well-being remains a pressing challenge for emerging economies. This study examines the factors contributing to inclusive growth in the BRICS countries, concentrating on the connections between life expectancy, environmental sustainability, and economic growth. We perform wavelet-based data analysis from 1990 to 2022 to investigate the dynamic time–frequency relationships between life expectancy (LEO) and essential variables such as GDP, CO2 emissions, RNE consumption, and population growth (PGP). The results show that although economic development and industrialization often increase life expectancy, they also hurt the environment, as most BRICS countries have a positive link between CO2 emissions and life expectancy at birth. The findings also indicate that short-term economic and infrastructural disturbances prevent the immediate effects of renewable energy usage on life expectancy. Furthermore, because population increases burden healthcare systems and resources, inclusive growth faces substantial hurdles. The study provides insights into the importance of green energy and demographic management in fostering sustainable and inclusive growth, and it underscores the challenges of striking a balance between economic development, social well-being, and environmental sustainability in emerging nations. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"Social Capital in Korea: Relational Capital, Trust, and Transparency","This article starts by distinguishing two different types of social capital, that is, societal moral resource capital and relational capital. Social capital as a societal moral resource is best characterized in Putnam's works. Social capital as the relational mobilization of information and control is best conceptualized by Coleman. By contrasting these two aspects of social capital, and by contextualizing the peculiarity of social relations in East Asian countries, this article explores the characteristics of social capital in Korea. For that purpose, I focus on the working of relational capital, or inmaek, in the creation and reproduction of social inequality. Moreover, I calculate the macro-level transformation of Korean society in terms of the role of societal moral resources. © 2015 The Japan Sociological Society.",Not About Sufficiency
Variation of bacterial community diversity and composition in saline-alkali soils reclaimed with flood irrigation and crop cultivation is driven by salinity and edaphic factors,"Reclamation is crucial for improving the fertility and productivity of saline-alkali soils, but the evolution of soil bacterial communities during the course of reclamation, which is an important feedback of soil micro-ecosystem, has received little attention. This study was conducted to investigate the variation of bacterial community diversity and composition in reclaimed saline-alkali soils based on space-for-time substitution, elucidate the underlying ecological mechanisms of bacterial community assembly processes, and identify the key driving factors of bacterial community evolution. The soil bacterial communities in undeveloped saline-alkali land and farmlands with different reclamation history (1–4, 5–6, and 10–25 years) in the Yellow River Delta, China, was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Soil bacterial diversity was found to increase significantly with reclamation history, and the entire bacterial community composition varied remarkably in the saline-alkali soils at different stages of reclamation. Halophilic and halotolerant bacteria dominated in the soils of undeveloped saline-alkali land (33.7 %), but their abundance diminished largely in the reclaimed soils. Analysis of bacterial community assembly processes suggested that heterogeneous selection dominated the change of bacterial communities in the saline-alkali soils that had been reclaimed for 1–4 years (52.8 %), 5–6 years (93.1 %), and 10–25 years (94.4 %). Salinity, soil organic carbon, pH, and moisture content were found to be the key environmental factors driving the evolution of bacterial communities in the reclaimed saline-alkali soils. While salinity directly shaped the bacterial community diversity, the other key drivers primarily governed the composition of bacterial communities in the saline-alkali soils during reclamation. These findings shed light on the probable ecological mechanisms of assembly processes and the environmental factors driving the soil bacterial communities during reclamation of saline-alkali lands, which could help better understand the evolution of soil bacterial communities under declining saline stress and optimize strategies to improve the agroecosystem health of saline-alkali lands. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Archetypal crop trait dynamics for enhanced retrieval of biophysical parameters from Sentinel-2 MSI,"We present a new method for estimating biophysical parameters from Earth Observation (EO) data using a crop-specific empirical model based on the PROSAIL Radiative Transfer (RT) model, called an ‘archetype’ model. The first-order model presented uses maximum biophysical parameter magnitude, phenological and soil parameters to describe the spectral reflectance (400–2500 nm) of vegetation over time. The approach assumes smooth variation and archetypical coordination of crop biophysical parameters over time for a given crop. The form of coordination is learned from a large sample of observations. Using Sentinel-2 observations of maize from Northeast China in 2019, we map reflectance to biophysical parameters using an inverse model operator, synchronise the parameters to a consistent time frame using a double logistic model of LAI, then derive the model archetypes as the median value of the synchronised samples. We apply the model to estimate time series of biophysical parameters for different cereal crops using an ensemble framework with a weighted K-nearest neighbour solution, and validate the results with ground measurements of different crops collected near Munich, Germany in 2017 and 2018. The results show R values greater than 0.8 for leaf area index (LAI) and leaf brown pigment content (Cbrown), with an RMSE of 0.94 m2/m2 for LAI and 0.15 for Cbrown. The chlorophyll content (Cab) and canopy water content (CCw) were retrieved at a higher level of accuracy, with R values around 0.9 and an RMSE of 6.59μg/cm2 for Cab and 0.03 g/cm2 for CCw. Comparison of forward-modelled hyperspectral reflectance with independent ground measures shows that the retrieved parameters account for 90% of the variation in canopy reflectance, with an overall RMSE of around 0.05 in reflectance units. The retrievals for all terms are mostly within 1σ when measurement and prediction uncertainty are taken into account, except for some early and late season issues in leaf and canopy water due to the complexity of canopy structure and understory during these periods. The approach provides a new form of constraint for the simultaneous estimation of biophysical parameters from EO and greatly reduces the rank of the problem. It is suitable for monitoring crop conditions where biophysical parameters vary smoothly over time consistently with each archetype form. The approach can be refined for other canopy types and canopy representations and could provide strong constraints on expected smoothly-varying canopy features to aid in the interpretation of EO signals across different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating policy and ecology systems to achieve path dependent climate solutions,"The Paris Agreement emphasizes regional “bottom-up” policy solutions to address climate change. We argue that efforts to develop these regional solutions require treating ecological and policy processes as interacting together. Through this approach, policy decisions affect ecological processes, and subsequent ecological changes create feedbacks into policy and political processes. Such a re-orientation can help uncover heretofore hidden “policy triggers”, thereby offering new and perhaps more durable climate solutions. We illustrate this with a case example of the interplay among boreal forest natural resource management policies that created path dependent extractive industries, which in turn, triggered path dependent carbon cycling processes within boreal ecosystems, causing higher carbon emissions. The ability to apply path dependency analysis in general, and identify creative solutions in particular, requires a much more systematic conversation between ecological and policy sciences. We illustrate how path dependent innovations can be identified and triggered, through our own integration of ecological and path dependency analysis: the use of arguably “easy to change, but hard to reverse” policy decisions over hunting licenses. This trigger is not just identified because it is consistent with climate science for managing predator-prey relationships towards lower carbon emissions, but because it holds promise in creating a durable solution even in the face of pressures to reverse course. Hence, the policy is also expected to help lower carbon emissions, in the same way forestry policies (inadvertently) helped increase carbon emissions over a century ago. Our goal is not to argue that this is the only or best solution that might emerge from integrating policy and ecological sciences, but rather to highlight how unforeseen, practical solutions can be nurtured when fostering conversations among largely qualitative historically inclined policy scientists that focus on the complex casual impacts of non-generalizable “critical junctures”, and largely quantitative ecologists seeking general patterns with complex ecosystems. We advance the significant work underway by path dependency focused policy scientists by calling for greater integration of knowledge across these disciplines that currently tend to treat knowledge from the other as “exogenous” shocks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Managing nitrogen to restore water quality in China,"The nitrogen cycle has been radically changed by human activities1. China consumes nearly one third of the world’s nitrogen fertilizers. The excessive application of fertilizers2,3 and increased nitrogen discharge from livestock, domestic and industrial sources have resulted in pervasive water pollution. Quantifying a nitrogen ‘boundary’4 in heterogeneous environments is important for the effective management of local water quality. Here we use a combination of water-quality observations and simulated nitrogen discharge from agricultural and other sources to estimate spatial patterns of nitrogen discharge into water bodies across China from 1955 to 2014. We find that the critical surface-water quality standard (1.0 milligrams of nitrogen per litre) was being exceeded in most provinces by the mid-1980s, and that current rates of anthropogenic nitrogen discharge (14.5 ± 3.1 megatonnes of nitrogen per year) to fresh water are about 2.7 times the estimated ‘safe’ nitrogen discharge threshold (5.2 ± 0.7 megatonnes of nitrogen per year). Current efforts to reduce pollution through wastewater treatment and by improving cropland nitrogen management can partially remedy this situation. Domestic wastewater treatment has helped to reduce net discharge by 0.7 ± 0.1 megatonnes in 2014, but at high monetary and energy costs. Improved cropland nitrogen management could remove another 2.3 ± 0.3 megatonnes of nitrogen per year—about 25 per cent of the excess discharge to fresh water. Successfully restoring a clean water environment in China will further require transformational changes to boost the national nutrient recycling rate from its current average of 36 per cent to about 87 per cent, which is a level typical of traditional Chinese agriculture. Although ambitious, such a high level of nitrogen recycling is technologically achievable at an estimated capital cost of approximately 100 billion US dollars and operating costs of 18–29 billion US dollars per year, and could provide co-benefits such as recycled wastewater for crop irrigation and improved environmental quality and ecosystem services. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Characterizing the Particle Composition and Cloud Condensation Nuclei from Shipping Emission in Western Europe,"Commercial shipping is considered as an important source of air pollution and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). To assess the climatic and environmental impacts of shipping, detailed characterization of ship plumes near the point of emission and understanding of ship plume evolution further downwind are essential. This airborne measurement study presents the online characterization of particulate phase ship emissions in the region of Western Europe in 2019 prior to new international sulfur emission controls becoming enacted. More than 30 ships from both the sulfur emission control area (SECA) in the English Channel and the open sea (OS) are measured and compared. Ships within the SECA emitted much less sulfate (SO4) compared with those at OS. When shifted to a lower apparent fuel sulfur content (FSC) at similar engine loads, the peak of the fresh ship emitting the particle number size distribution shifted from around 60-80 nm in diameter to below 40 nm in diameter. The emission factors (EFs) of sulfate are predicted to decrease by around 94% after the 2020 regulation on ship sulfur emission in the open ocean. The EFs of refractory black carbon (rBC) and organic compounds (Org) do not appear to be directly affected by the lower sulfur contents. The total number concentration for condensation nuclei (CN) >2.5 nm and >0.1 μm are predicated to be reduced by 69 and 56%, respectively. Measured plume evolution results indicate that the S(IV) to S(VI) conversion rate was around 23.4% per hour at the beginning of plume evolution, and the CCN and CN >2.5 nm ratio increased with plume age primarily due to condensation and coagulation. We estimate that the new sulfur emission regulation will lead to a reduction of more than 80% in CCN from fresh ship emissions. The ship-emitted EFs results presented here will also inform emission inventories, policymaking, climate, and human health studies. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
Correcting science misinformation in an authoritarian country: An experiment from China,"People rely on heuristic cues to evaluate messages. An increasing number of studies found corrective messages useful in correcting misinformation, and the correction effect varies on heuristic cues. Existing studies, however, mostly focus on correction effects in the Western context. This study aims to compare the effects of corrective messages with different heuristic cues in an authoritarian society. We focused on the cues that suggest government authoritativeness. Using an online experiment, we compared the impacts of correction sources (official vs. professional vs. layperson) and tones (formal vs. conversational) on the believability of the correction. The results indicated corrections from a government source and delivered in a formal tone were more believable in China. In addition, we examined the moderating role of attitude congruence. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Structure, Functions, and Interactions of Dryland Ecosystems","Understanding the interactions between the structures and functions underlying regime shifts in dryland social-ecological systems (SESs) and how they respond to climate change is critical for predicting and managing the future of these ecosystems. Due to the high spatiotemporal variability and sensitivity of drylands ecosystem to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, it is challenging to predict the state shifts of dryland SESs. This theme delves into the mechanisms and geographical heterogeneity of resilience and the maintenance of the stability of dryland SESs that involve threshold behaviors. We emphasized the importance of considering both biotic and abiotic factors to identify the factors that drive the evolution of ecosystem structures and functions in drylands. The research frontier involves understanding how ecohydrological and socioeconomic processes drive the evolution of dryland SESs in a geographically diverse and scale-dependent context, developing comprehensive indicators, models, and multivariable approaches, and the development of effective management strategies that can maintain the sustainability of dryland SESs in the face of ongoing global environmental changes. © The Editor(s)(if applicable) and The Author(s)2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Board Supervision Capability and Sustainability Report Disclosure Quality: Evidence From Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Taiwan's Construction Industry,"This study explores the effect of board supervision capability on sustainability reporting quality among publicly listed small- and medium-sized enterprises in Taiwan's construction industry from 2018 to 2022. Ordinal logit regression analyses are conducted. The results reveal that board supervision capability determines whether a firm will voluntarily engage in sustainability reporting strategies, which is a key factor for effectively meeting stakeholder needs. Further analysis of board supervision capability in firms of different ages indicates that the relationship between board supervision capability and sustainability reporting quality varies by firm age. This study also provides empirical evidence confirming that board supervision capability is among the key factors affecting sustainability reporting quality. © 2025 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Public investment on renewable energy R&D Projects: The role of geopolitical risk, and economic and political uncertainties","Recently, there has been growing concern about the impacts of geopolitical tension as well as economic and political uncertainties on the decision-making process of governments when it comes to allocating resources for renewable energy R&D. This paper employs the panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), cross-sectional panel autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) and Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) technique to examine the impacts of geopolitical risk, economic and political uncertainties, renewable energy technologies innovations, government financial affordability and CO2 emissions on government spending on renewable energy research and development projects. The novel aspects of the panel ARDL and CS-ARDL methodologies lie in their ability to capture both short-run and long-run dynamics within a panel data framework, as well as their ability to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships under investigation. The empirical results presented in this paper indicate that in the face of ongoing geopolitical tension, as well as economic and political uncertainties, financially capable governments continue to increase their investments in renewable energy R&D in the long run. This strategic move aims to safeguard the supply of renewable energy, uphold economic and political policy credibility, maintain a first-mover advantage, and establish control over the intellectual property rights associated with renewable energy technology. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Herders and herdsmen: The remaking of pastoral livelihoods in Laikipia, Kenya","Pastoralists have long overlapped with wildlife in rangelands of sub-Saharan Africa. With growing recognition of the importance of wildlife outside of protected areas, conservation efforts are increasingly managed through hybrid governance activities worldwide, activities which often involve pastoralists. These efforts are especially prevalent in East African rangelands where pastoralists, livestock, and wildlife commonly overlap outside of formal protected areas. Laikipia County, Kenya, is one region renowned for abundant and diverse wildlife species sustained outside protected areas through a collective of conservation activities among private landowners and pastoral group ranches. Little research has considered pastoralists’ roles in the region’s conservation efforts or the ways that those efforts shape local livelihoods. Based on data from interviews, surveys, and participant observation, this article uses a case study approach to demonstrate how some of Laikipia’s pastoralists are increasingly drawn into professional herding jobs with powerful landowners involved in joint commercial ranching and wildlife conservation activities. This has caused many pastoralists to shift from traditional livestock ownership in favour of livestock caretaking for other owners, with substantial implications for livelihoods. This study offers empirical evidence for the importance of considering how diversifying pastoral livelihoods entwine with hybrid conservation processes outside protected areas. © The Author(s). 2017.",Not About Sufficiency

International climate change law and state compliance,"A solution to the problem of climate change requires close international cooperation and difficult reforms involving all states. Law has a clear role to play in that solution. What is not so clear is the role that law has played to date as a constraining factor on state conduct. International Climate Change Law and State Compliance is an unprecedented treatment of the nature of climate change law and the compliance of states with that law. The book argues that the international climate change regime, in the twenty or so years it has been in existence, has developed certain normative rules of law, binding on states. State conduct under these rules is characterized by generally high compliance in areas where equity is not a major concern. There is, by contrast, low compliance in matters requiring a burden-sharing agreement among states to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to a ‘safe’ level. The book argues that the substantive climate law presently in place must be further developed, through normative rules that bind states individually to top-down mitigation commitments. While a solution to the problem of climate change must take this form, the law’s development in this direction is likely to be hesitant and slow. The book is aimed at scholars and graduate students in environmental law, international law, and international relations. © 2015 Alexander Zahar.",Not About Sufficiency
"Prediction of drought-induced reduction of agricultural productivity in Chile from MODIS, rainfall estimates, and climate oscillation indices","Global food security is negatively affected by drought. Climate projections show that drought frequency and intensity may increase in different parts of the globe. These increases are particularly hazardous for developing countries. Early season forecasts on drought occurrence and severity could help to better mitigate the negative consequences of drought. The objective of this study was to assess if interannual variability in agricultural productivity in Chile can be accurately predicted from freely-available, near real-time data sources. As the response variable, we used the standard score of seasonal cumulative NDVI (zcNDVI), based on 2000–2017 data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as a proxy for anomalies of seasonal primary productivity. The predictions were performed with forecast lead times from one- to six-month before the end of the growing season, which varied between census units in Chile. Predictor variables included the zcNDVI obtained by cumulating NDVI from season start up to prediction time; standardised precipitation indices derived from satellite rainfall estimates, for time-scales of 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months; the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Multivariate ENSO oscillation indices; the length of the growing season, and latitude and longitude. For each of the 758 census units considered, the time series of the response and the predictor variables were averaged for agricultural areas resulting in a 17-season time series per unit for each variable. We used two prediction approaches: (i) optimal linear regression (OLR) whereby for each census unit the single predictor was selected that best explained the interannual zcNDVI variability, and (ii) a multi-layer feedforward neural network architecture, often called deep learning (DL), where all predictors for all units were combined in a single spatio-temporal model. Both approaches were evaluated with a leave-one-year-out cross-validation procedure. Both methods showed good prediction accuracies for small lead times and similar values for all lead times. The mean Rcv 2 values for OLR were 0.95, 0.83, 0.68, 0.56, 0.46 and 0.37, against 0.96, 0.84, 0.65, 0.54, 0.46 and 0.38 for DL, for one, two, three, four, five, and six months lead time, respectively. Given the wide range of climates and vegetation types covered within the study area, we expect that the presented models can contribute to an improved early warning system for agricultural drought in different geographical settings around the globe. © 2018",Not About Sufficiency
The Next Green Frontier: Legal Readiness for Climate Finance,"The international debate has increasingly shifted attention to the crucial issue of environmental protection, focusing interest on the transition to a green economy. From the Sustainable Development Goals to COP28 of the UNFCCC in Dubai, the goal is to move toward an economic development model based on decarbonization. In this context, finance has acquired an increasingly active role through the mobilization of capital directed toward sustainable projects. Green finance is increasingly active and can take on the role that everyone expects as an irreplaceable ally in achieving the climate objectives set out in Paris in 2015; however, several aspects still need to be improved, such as the uniformity of standards and certification criteria. But sadly, many green bonds are actually of little use from an environmental point of view. This is mainly due to a regulatory framework that is still too weak. Green bonds currently cover, in fact, a multitude of realities, with funding for projects that only have a green label. And among the issuers are some subjects well-known for the pollution they produce. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Klaus Bosselmann, Kathryn Gwiazdon, and Virginia Zambrano; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
The Web of Sustainable Water Security,"Whilst the authors engaged in this book offer numerous perspectives from many disciplines, there appears to be consensus on one element of water challenges: that solutions lie as much outside the watershed as within it. Working within what Allan (1998) has called the ‘problemshed’, there is nonetheless the likelihood that the different approaches take us in dissonant or even competing directions. We thus run the risk of collectively developing an inadequate version of the robust yet flexible conceptualisation of water security that, I think, is required. The peril that serves to guide this chapter is that our efforts serve to develop policy that leads to selective (i.e., our own) temporary water security, at the cost of water insecurity for others. © 2013 Bruce Lankford, Karen Bakker, Mark Zeitoun, and Declan Conway, selection and editorial material; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
Adjustment of the marine ecological red lines in China,"The marine ecological red lines (MERLs) is an institutional innovation of the Chinese government to seek a balance between ecological protection and social development. China’s MERLs was designated in 2017, but there are problems such as insufficient consideration of areas of high ecological importance and lack of convergence with marine functional zoning. This paper carries out the adjustment of the MERLs in China by constructing the methods of marine ecological importance assessment and human activities disposal assessment, and the results show that after the adjustment, the type and distribution pattern of China’s MERLs is more reasonable, the areas of high ecological importance in the MERLs increases significantly, the intensity of human activities in the MERLs declines significantly, and the unification with the use of marine space is realized. China’s adjustment of the MERLs is based on scientific assessment and realizes the coordination of development and protection, which can provide a reference for global marine ecological protection. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
From responsible sourcing of wastes to sustainable energy consumption in the blue hydrogen supply chain: Case of nearshoring in Nuevo Leon,"Despite global uncertainties, Mexico has become the largest supplier to the United States, emphasizing its growing role in cultivating resilient supply chains. Nearshoring practices from Mexico and Canada to the U.S. present new production opportunities. Increasingly, U.S. consumers place a premium on sustainable consumption, so blue hydrogen plants must be sourced responsibly. This paper firstly goes beyond economic motivations, aiming to formulate a multi-stage methodology for assessing suppliers of municipal solid waste for blue hydrogen plants, marking a pioneering effort in catering to the environmentally conscious preferences of U.S. consumers. The purpose of this work is to examine a case study of Blue Hydrogen production in Nuevo Leon, emphasizing the importance of developing responsible sourcing criteria for waste suppliers to limited blue hydrogen plants. The developed hybrid approach integrates various methodologies, including Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH), fuzzy rough sets, hierarchical fuzzy rough analysis, Fuzzy rough WASPAS, TOPSIS, and Best-Worst Method (BWM), providing a comprehensive framework for decision-making under uncertainty. Key findings include the identification of water conservation (E2) and job creation (S2) as the top environmental and social criteria, respectively. Supplier WC2 was identified as the top-performing waste collector, achieving a final score of 4.77. This structured methodology prioritizes product categories for hydrogen consumption, considering sustainability criteria and U.S. consumer preferences, thereby offering valuable insights for businesses navigating this evolving landscape. © Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",Not About Sufficiency
A bibliometric-based analysis of research advances in the field of nitrogen monitoring in wheat,"In order to keep up the research dynamics in the field of nitrogen monitoring in wheat, this paper explores the current status and content evolution through visual analysis. Using bibliometric methods, we mined the trend of publications, subject areas, countries, institutions, journals and highly cited papers, research hotspots, and theme evolution between 1990 and 2022, and analyzed the intersection of disciplines and the concentration of literature. The research found that the global publication volume is generally on the rise, and China is the fastest growing country in recent years, but it can be further improved in terms of the number of local citations and the total number of citations. The field of wheat nitrogen monitoring has changed from one single discipline to multidisciplinary, the hotspots have evolved from the analysis of a single physiological process to the monitoring of remote sensing, crop modeling, growth simulation, and other directions. The research hotspots have evolved from the early stage of single physiological process analysis to the direction of digital agriculture, forming two major research nodes in the world represented by China and the United States. Six of the top ten authors are from China, and China occupies six seats in the top ten organizations, and China ranks in the top in all four indicators of highly cited papers. As time goes on, the tendency of teamwork and international cooperation has become evident, and the proportion of collaborative publications between China and the top ten countries is 31.48%. Agronomy journals are the main publications, with Field Crops Research being the most representative. The results show that the cross-disciplinary trend has become more and more obvious, the development trend of research hotspots and fields has become clearer and clearer, and in the future, the in-depth cooperation among different countries, disciplines, and teams will bring greater and more far-reaching opportunities. © 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

A global synthesis reveals gaps in coastal habitat restoration research,"Coastal ecosystems have drastically declined in coverage and condition across the globe. To combat these losses, marine conservation has recently employed habitat restoration as a strategy to enhance depleted coastal ecosystems. For restoration to be a successful enterprise, however, it is necessary to identify and address potential knowledge gaps and review whether the field has tracked scientific advances regarding best practices. This enables managers, researchers, and practitioners alike to more readily establish restoration priorities and goals. We synthesized the peer-reviewed, published literature on habitat restoration research in salt marshes, oyster reefs, and seagrasses to address three questions related to restoration efforts: (i) How frequent is cross-sector authorship in coastal restoration research? (ii) What is the geographic distribution of coastal restoration research? and (iii) Are abiotic and biotic factors equally emphasized in the literature, and how does this vary with time? Our vote-count survey indicated that one-third of the journal-published studies listed authors from at least two sectors, and 6% listed authors from all three sectors. Across all habitat types, there was a dearth of studies from Africa, Asia, and South America. Finally, despite many experimental studies demonstrating that species interactions can greatly affect the recovery and persistence of coastal foundation species, only one-fourth of the studies we examined discussed their effects on restoration. Combined, our results reveal gaps and discrepancies in restoration research that should be addressed in order to further propel coastal restoration science. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Policy recommendations for the zero energy building promotion towards carbon neutral in Asia-Pacific Region,"The present global trend towards decarbonization under the Paris Agreement encourages regions and economies to explore possible ways to reduce energy intensity and minimize emissions into the environment. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), which accounts for 60% of world energy demand, aims to reduce energy intensity by 45% from 2005 levels by 2035 and double the share of renewable energy in the energy mix between 2010 and 2030. The promotion of Zero Energy Building (ZEB) was considered the most efficient way to respond to these goals in the building sector. A comprehensive review of progress over the past decade and a comparison of the definitions, standards and goals of ZEB in the five biggest economies of APEC (Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States) was carried out. In 2020, these five economies announced a carbon neutral goal towards 2050/2060, which will significantly affect the building sector in the foreseeable future. According to the progress review of ZEB over the last decade, this paper analyzes gaps in the building sector towards zero emissions by 2050 and proposes 10 policy recommendations covering multi-aspect and multi-factor in the APEC. The research will help steer more efficient and effective ZEB policies towards zero energy/emissions in the building sector in the Asia-Pacific region. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Forecasting the Effect of Migrants’ Remittances on Household Expenditure: COVID-19 Impact,"The unexpected pandemic has provoked changes in all economic sectors worldwide. COVID-19 has had a direct and indirect effect on countries’ development. Thus, the pandemic limits the movements of labour forces among countries, restricting migrants’ remittances. In addition, it provokes the reorientation of consumer behaviour and changes in household expenditure. For developing countries, migrant remittances are one of the core drivers for improving household well-being. Therefore, the paper aims to analyse how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected household expenditure in Ukraine, as being representative of a developing country. For this purpose, the data series were compiled for 2010 to the second quarter of 2021. The data sources were as follows: Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, The World Bank, and the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. The core variables were as follows: migrants’ remittances and expenditure of households by the types. The following methods were applied to achieve the paper’s aims: the Dickey–Fuller Test Unit Root and the ARIMA model. The findings confirmed that COVID-19 has changed the structure of household expenditure in Ukraine. Considering the forecast of household expenditure until 2026, it was shown that due to changes in migrants’ remittances, household expenditure in all categories tends to increase. The forecasted findings concluded that household expenditure on transport had the most significant growth due to changing migrants’ remittances. © 2022 by the authors.

The Impact of the Green Finance Reform and Innovation Pilot Zone on the Green Innovation—Evidence from China,"This article uses the “Green Finance Reform and Innovation Pilot Zone” promulgated in 2017 as an example to construct a quasi-natural experiment and uses the difference-in-difference method to test the impact of the implementation of the “Green Finance Reform and Innovation Pilot Zone” on the green innovation activities. It was found that the policy promotes the quantity and quality of corporate green innovation. The mechanism test showed that policy promotes the R&D investment and expands the credit scale. The study further found that green finance policies enhance the green innovation of enterprises as government environmental regulation is strengthened. Finally, green innovation by state-owned enterprises is more strongly promoted in the pilot green finance reform and innovation zones, and green innovation by enterprises in non-polluting sectors is more sensitive to the policy, with a heterogeneous pattern of policy effects in eastern and non-eastern China. Therefore, green finance policies should be promoted to achieve an effective combination of financial resource allocation and corporate green innovation to promote the construction of ecological civilization. © 2022 by the authors.

Risk Management Effects of Insurance Purchase and Organization Participation: Which Is More Effective?,"Insurance purchase and organization participation in risk management is of great practical significance for stabilizing agricultural production and household income. The aims of this study were to analyze farm households’ choices of insurance purchase and organization participation, and their effects on crop revenue and its higher-order moments using the multinomial switching endogenous regression (MESR) model. The results showed that the adoption of insurance and organization was significantly affected by household head characteristics, farm household characteristics, and cropland attributes. Insurance purchase, organization participation, and their joint adoption contributed to the increase in crop revenue and decrease in crop revenue variance, and the benefits were larger when adopting two risk management tools in combination. When skewness was taken into account in risk management analysis, insurance purchase, organization participation, and their joint adoption resulted in a reduction in the probability of crop failure, of which, participating in organizations was the most effective. Efforts should be put forth to improve the functioning and effectiveness of agricultural insurance and organization to promote the adoption of risk management tools. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The incentive effects of the macro tax burden on economic growth: A negative or positive incentive effect? Analysis based on panel data,"Utilizing macroeconomic panel data from 2010 to 2022 of 31 provinces in China, this paper employed the fixed effect model, the random effect mode, the robust test method, the system GMM estimation method, the instrumental variables method (IV), and subregional heterogeneity analysis to conduct an empirical investigation into the effect of China's small-caliber macro tax burden, large-caliber macro tax burden and the burden of various major taxes and fees on economic growth. The research revealed that the small-caliber macro tax burden exerts a positive incentive effect on economic growth, while the large-caliber macro tax burden acts in the opposite way. The tax burden of VAT and CIT is relatively moderate, which can stimulate a positive incentive effect on economic growth. However, the tax burden of total nontax income and individual income tax is too heavy and overburdens negatively economic growth. Moreover, this paper reveals regional heterogeneity in the effects of China's small-caliber and large-caliber macro tax burdens and the burden of major taxes and fees on economic growth. Drawing from the findings of this study and considering the specific context of China, this paper offers several policy recommendations for optimizing China's tax system. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Behaviors and mechanisms of cadmium/lead adsorption by natural bamboo fibers modified with succinic acid.,"After pretreatments of alkalization and acidification, the natural bamboo fibers underwent esterification reaction with succinic acid to produce modified bamboo fibers. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated that, after modification, the electronegative carboxyl and ester groups in bamboo fibers increased, and their microstructure changed from dense and flat to wrinkled and porous simultaneously. The adsorption experiments showed that the modified bamboo fibers achieved significantly higher adsorption rates of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) than natural bamboo fibers (up to 47.37% and 44.57%, respectively), and could also be applied to a wider pH value range. The adsorption of Cd and Pb by modified and unmodified bamboo fibers conformed to both Langmuir and Freundlich thermodynamic models.Besides, after modification the maximum adsorption capacity (Qm) of the bamboo fibers for Cd and Pb increased from 8.9687mg/g and 11.5075mg/g to 26.1780mg/g and 32.3625mg/g respectively, indicating that the modification process of succinic acid increased the adsorption sites of the bamboo fibers, and thus improved their adsorption capacity of Cd/Pb, which can provide a new idea for the modification and upgrading of biosorbent materials. © 2024 Chinese Society for Environmental Sciences.

The results show that (1) individual driving factors do not constitute the necessary conditions for a high level of mariculture industry development, but the necessity of the three conditions—research funding, industry intensification and nearshore seawater quality—shows a general increasing trend; and (2) the results of the path analysis show that a total of seven configuration paths for a high level of development are generated, which can be further classified into “organization-led and technology synergistic”, “technology-organization-environment multiple-driven type”, and “technology-environment dual-driven type”. Based on the panel data, this study explores the impact of spatial and temporal changes in factor combinations on the development level of mariculture and provides a theoretical basis and practical insights for the development of locally adapted execution pathways. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Central environmental protection inspection and carbon emission reduction: A tripartite evolutionary game model from the perspective of carbon neutrality,"Since the carbon neutrality target was proposed, many countries have been facing severe challenges to carbon emission reduction sustainably. This study is conducted using a tripartite evolutionary game model to explore the impact of the central environmental protection inspection (CEPI) on driving carbon emission reduction, and to study what factors influence the strategic choices of each party and how they interact with each other. The research results suggest that local governments and manufacturing enterprises would choose strategies that are beneficial to carbon reduction when CEPI increases. When the initial willingness of all parties increases 20%, 50%–80%, the time spent for the whole system to achieve stability decreases from 100%, 60%–30%. The evolutionary result of “thorough inspection, regulation implementation, low-carbon management” is the best strategy for the tripartite evolutionary game. Moreover, the smaller the cost and the larger the benefit, the greater the likelihood of the three-party game stability strategy appears. This study has important guiding significance for other developing countries to promote carbon emission reduction by environmental policy. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"The Impact of Chinese Public Environmental Awareness on Environmental Behavior: An Analysis Based on China National Surveys in 2003, 2010 and 2021","Environmental awareness and behavior play a crucial role in the improvement of the environment. Five dimensions of environmental awareness are considered here including environmental values, environmental knowledge, environmental responsibility, environmental ability and environmental concern while we also distinguish between private and public environmental behaviors. Based on data from the China General Social Survey (CGSS) in 2003, 2010 and 2021, this research investigated changes in Chinese residents’ environmental awareness and environmental behavior and the relationship between them. The relevant empirical methods were the MV-Probit model, the Poisson model and a mediating effect model. The results are as follows: (1) From 2003 to 2021, environmental awareness of the public has improved significantly. Among them, environmental values, environmental knowledge and environmental concern have increased by 24.5%, 12.6% and 12.77%, respectively, while environmental capacity has decreased by 7.27% from 2010 to 2021. The eastern region of China has the highest score of environmental awareness, while the western region has the lowest one. (2) From 2003 to 2021, the public’s green consumption behavior changed from more than half of the public never consuming green products in 2003 to nearly 75% always or often consuming green products in 2021. Increases in recycling were also found over time. However, the participation rate in public environmental behavior declined. In 2021, environmental behaviors were lowest in the eastern region and highest in the western region. (3) Environmental responsibility, environmental concern and environmental capacity direct and indirectly affect private and public environmental behaviors and the number of environmental behaviors through the willingness to protect the environment, which plays a semi-mediating role. Environmental knowledge only has a direct impact on private green consumption behavior. (4) There is a correlation between public and private environmental behaviors. Given the results of this study, a series of policy implications and recommendations are provided. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental protection interview and corporate environmental investment: Evidence from China,"This study examines the impact of a new government's environmental governance tool, namely, the environmental protection interview system, on corporate environmental investment. Using Chinese A-share companies and a difference-in-differences design, we show that enhanced environmental law enforcement significantly boosts corporate investment in environmental initiatives. Mechanism tests indicate that this effect works in two ways: it raises public awareness of environmental issues and improves green awareness among internal management. Further analysis shows that the policy's positive impact is most pronounced in non-state-owned sectors, manufacturing industries, and companies operating in highly marketized regions. These results highlight the relationship between macro-level environmental policies and corporate investment in green initiatives, and they provide policy implications for strengthening environmental supervision and enforcement and improving the environmental law enforcement system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying potential cropland losses when conserving 30% and 50% earth with different approaches and spatial scales,"Biodiversity conservation is the cornerstone for sustainable development. Bold conservation targets provide the last opportunities to halt the human-driven mass extinction. Recently, bold conservation targets have been proposed to protect 30% or 50% of Earth. However, little is known about its potential impacts on cropland. We identify potential cropland losses when 30% and 50% of global terrestrial area is given back to nature by 2030/2050, at three spatial scales (global, biome and country) and using two approaches (“nature-only landscapes” and “shared landscapes”). We find that different targets, applied scales and approaches will lead to different cropland losses: (1) At the global scale, it is possible to protect 50% of the Earth while having minimum cropland losses. (2) At biome scale, 0.64% and 8.54% cropland will be lost globally in 2030 and 2050 under the nature-only approach while by contrast, the shared approach substantially reduces the number of countries confronted by cropland losses, demanding only 0% and 2.59% of global cropland losses in 2030 and 2050. (3) At the national scale, the nature-only approach causes losses of 3.58% and 10.73% of global cropland in 2030 and 2050, while the shared approach requires 0.77% and 7.55% cropland in 2030 and 2050. Our results indicate that bold conservation targets could be considered, especially when adopting the shared approach, and we suggest adopting ambitious targets (protecting at least 30% by 2030) at the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP 15) to ensure a sustainable future for Earth. © 2021 by the authors.

Spatial impact of green finance reform pilot zones on environmental efficiency: A pathway to mitigating China's energy trilemma,"The energy trilemma is a critical global challenge requiring urgent resolution; however, existing solutions remain inefficient. This study utilizes a detailed environmental input-output indicator system, applying the SBM-DEA model for measurement and incorporating the Spatial Difference-in-Differences (SDID) model to assess the impact of Green Finance Policy (GFP) on environmental efficiency in Chinese cities from 2006 to 2021. The findings demonstrate that GFP significantly enhances environmental efficiency within a 500-km radius, as confirmed by various robustness tests. Mechanism analyses indicate that optimizing industrial structure, reducing energy consumption, advancing green innovation, and strengthening environmental regulations are critical pathways to improving environmental efficiency. Heterogeneity tests further examine the spatial policy effects under different factor endowments. Ultimately, the study concludes that improving environmental efficiency through GFP can alleviate the energy trilemma. This paper highlights the importance of implementing city-specific policies, offering new insights into energy economics, and providing fresh perspectives for policymakers, financial institutions, and enterprises. Despite the study's contributions, future research should further explore the comprehensive effects of GFP on energy, the environment, and the economy to provide more precise and holistic solutions for addressing the energy trilemma. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The heterogeneous effects of non-hydro renewable energy and water resources on industrial development of the Yellow river and Yangtze river basins,"Exploring the relationship between non-hydro renewable energy (NHRE) and water resources can help achieve high-quality development in China's industrial sector under the constraints of water conservation. This study investigated the interrelationships and regional heterogeneity of capital, labor, water and NHRE in the industrial sectors of 158 cities in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) and Yangtze River Basin (YZRB) in China using a heterogeneous stochastic frontier model. Based on reconstructed NHRE consumption data, it is found that the NHRE output elasticity (OE) in the NHRE-rich YRB (median value: 0.1) was lower than that in the NHRE-scarce YZRB (0.24), while the water OE in the water-rich YZRB (0.07) was lower than that in the water-scarce YRB (0.09). Classification analysis of infrastructure construction revealed that the energy OE in NHRE outflow regions (0.11) was lower than in NHRE inflow regions (0.28). This study also optimized the allocation of projected NHRE additions in China by 2030 and found that the optimized strategy can generate an additional industrial output of 8.8 × 1011 Yuan and save 8.6 × 107 tons of water compared to existing strategies. The results indicated that a win-win situation of industrial growth and water conservation could be achieved by reallocation of NHRE. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Managerial myopia and biodiversity alignment- evidence from China,"The preservation of biodiversity is a critical global issue intrinsically linked to humanity's future. Despite its importance, research examining the intersection of corporate management and biodiversity practices remains scarce. This study addresses this gap by investigating the influence of managerial myopia on corporate biodiversity performance. Using a dataset of 952 A-share listed companies in China from 2015 to 2022, our empirical analysis reveals that a one-unit reduction in managerial myopia corresponds to a 0.83 % improvement in biodiversity outcomes. These findings are robust, as confirmed through comprehensive sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, we identify several factors that significantly influence this relationship: the stringency of environmental regulations, resource reliability, market competition, and innovation. Notably, managerial myopia not only undermines a firm's short-term profitability but also impairs its capacity for long-term value creation by hindering its biodiversity performance. © 2025",Not About Sufficiency
The impacts of cropland balance policy on habitat quality in China: A multiscale administrative perspective,"Cropland protection policies are implemented to guarantee food security, especially the cropland balance policy in China. Although these policies alleviate the quantitative loss of cropland, they cause a serious decline in habitat quality and reduce biodiversity. With the reform trial of China's cropland balance policy from the within-province scale to the cross-provincial scale, the evaluation of habitat quality for obtaining cropland balance at different administrative scales is necessary to help seek sustainable strategies of cropland protection. Thus, taking Chinese mainland as the study area, this research assessed the different impacts of the cropland balance policy on habitat quality during 2000–2015 and 2015–2030 at national, provincial, municipal and county scales on the basis of the LAND System Cellular Automata model for Potential Effects (LANDSCAPE) and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model (InVEST). The results revealed that (1) the loss of habitat quality by compensated cropland was 4.02 times that of the loss by occupied cropland in 2000–2015. Compared with occupied cropland, compensated cropland dominated the impacts of cropland change on habitat quality. (2) For both cropland quantity balance and cropland quality balance, habitat quality was slightly lost the most on the national scale in 2030. In detail, the greatest loss of habitat quality mostly occurred in areas where the ecological environment is already vulnerable at the national scale, whereas habitat quality was relatively less in these areas at the provincial, municipal and county scales. (3) Under the same administrative scales, habitat quality was lost more in cropland quality balance scenarios than in cropland quantity balance scenarios. The loss of habitat quality caused by cropland quality balance at national, provincial, municipal and county scales was 1.25, 1.05, 0.90 and 1.37 times higher than that by cropland quantity balance, respectively. The research highlights that considering the differentiated loss of habitat quality caused by cropland protection is quite important when implementing the cropland balance policy and land use planning. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Investigating the environmental externalities of digital financial inclusion and the COVID-19 pandemic: an environmental sustainability perspective,"Financial inclusion enhances economic growth by facilitating businesses and individuals to access financial resources. Financial inclusion also contributes to environmental sustainability; however, very few studies have explored the link between financial inclusion and the environment. Also, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on environmental performance remains unexplored. From this perspective, this study probes the objective of whether financial inclusion and environmental performance co-move in COVID-19 in highly polluted economies. This objective is tested with the help of 2SLS and GMM approaches. The study also gets assistance from a panel quantile regression approach for empirical tasks. The results show that financial inclusion and the COVID-19 pandemic have a negative impact on CO2 emissions. Based on these findings, the study suggests that highly polluted economies should promote financial inclusion and assimilate environmental policies with financial inclusion policies to attain environment-related goals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Nexus between natural resources and digital economy: The role of geopolitical risk,"In the current age of globalization, the interplay between natural resources, geopolitical risk, and the digital economy assumes paramount significance. The vulnerability of natural resources, such as rare minerals and energy sources, to geopolitical conflicts arises from their indispensability in the production of digital technology. Geopolitical threats, encompassing trade disputes and resource wars, possess the potential to disrupt the digital supply chain, thereby exerting an influence on the global economy. In an era characterized by growing reliance on digital technologies, it becomes imperative for nations to effectively navigate these dynamics in order to ensure resource stability and sustained economic expansion. This study investigates the impact of natural resources and geopolitical risk on the digital economy in the BRICS nations from 2000 to 2021, employing the AMG methodology. The empirical findings suggest that the digital economy experiences adverse consequences from domestic GDP and geopolitical risk, whereas it benefits from global GDP, natural resource rent, and real effective exchange rate. In order to foster the advancement of the digital economy, it is recommended that policymakers prioritize the stimulation of innovation and diversification within the digital sector. Additionally, they should strengthen international trade linkages, implement sustainable resource management strategies, maintain exchange rate stability, mitigate geopolitical risks, and address the joint impact of natural resource rent and geopolitical risk through tailored policy measures. The implementation of these measures will create a favorable environment for the growth of the digital economy, thereby improving economic welfare and increasing competitiveness within the BRICS region. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Environmental Performance and SDGs: How Do Income Disparity, Urbanization, Resource Consumption, and Female Employers Affect the Ecological Footprint in Emerging Economies?","The significance of environmental deterioration as a pressing issue has led to its prominence in global discussions on strategies for prevention. It can be asserted that there exists a universal agreement that the enhancement of environmental quality is imperative for the promotion of sustainable development and societal well-being, especially in emerging economies. In this perspective, the present research uses panel data of the E7 economies from 1992 to 2021 to assess the effects of income disparity, urbanization, resources consumption (nonrenewable and renewable energy consumption), and women employers on ecological footprint. This study employs second-generation empirical techniques such as CIPS and CADF unit root tests, Westerlund bootstrap cointegration, and DFE/MG/PMG-ARDL models to check the relationships between the studied variables. The empirical findings of this study reveal that in the E7 countries, the ecological footprint is increased with an increased income disparity and nonrenewable energy consumption. On the other hand, urbanization, renewable energy consumption, and female employers help reduce the ecological footprint. Additionally, the results of the causality measure under the Dumitrescu and Hurlin test unveil bidirectional causality between all the independent variables except nonrenewable energy and ecological footprint. From the policy perspective, the selected countries must implement policies that promote equitable income distribution, planned urbanization to promote compact cities, efficient transportation systems, and green infrastructure, and provide opportunities for women to attain higher positions in organizations, particularly at the managerial and decision-making levels in order to address the adverse environmental consequences in emerging economies. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
The ASEAN comprehensive investment agreement: Realizing a regional community,"In recent decades, States have concluded numerous regional investment treaties, even as the feverish growth in bilateral investment treaties worldwide continues apace. This increasing regionalism within international investment law is a double-edged phenomenon. On the one hand, the risks of fragmentation and incoherence increase exponentially as a regional layer is added to the already-messy ""spaghetti bowl"" of investment treaties. The noble dream of a uniform, multilateralized set of investment-protection standards thus looks ever more unattainable. On the other hand, a regional investment treaty affords an opportunity for a group of States to balance, in a particularistic manner, between investment-related obligations and other non-investment priorities. This essay focuses on the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement signed in 2009, arguing that it is a region-specific bargain embedded within ASEAN's wider normative and institutional framework. The potential conflicts between ASEAN Member States' investment-related obligations and their commitments under two other regional projects are explored, and recommendations are made as to how arbitral tribunals can manage such conflicts. © 2011 Berkeley Electronic Press.

"Natural resources and the trilemma of financial development, institutions, and markets: Sustainable development pathway via natural resources for China","A plethora of studies are available on the linkage of natural resources, economic growth, and financial development. However, studies on the different financial indices are lacking in the literature concerning sustainable development; hence, to cover the gaps in the literature, this study evaluates the nexus of natural resources with the trilemma of financial development, markets, and institutions in China from 1983 to 2021. The study also checked the role of government expenditures (GEXEDU), renewable electricity (EREC), and economic growth (GDP). Several econometric strategies have been deployed as time series data, including ADF with break years to check the unit root in the data and Bayer-Hanck for each predicted variable to ensure the long-run equilibrium of explanatory variables with the predicted one. FMOLS and CCR are utilized for primary estimations, while the robust least squares method is used for robustness checks. The outcomes indicate that all variables are found static at level except the financial development index and renewable electricity, whereas long-run cointegration has been confirmed between all models. The primary outcomes reveal that GDP stimulates financial development and its three indices, while natural resources have a resource curse in financial development multidimensional and institutional indices while blessing exists on the financial markets index. Moreover, the negative effect of government education expenditures is present only in the financial markets index, while renewable electricity has a positive and significant influence on financial development multidimensional and market indices. Moreover, renewable electricity reduces the financial markets index in the short and long run. Besides, robustness check analysis provides similar outcomes that are robust and valid. Relevant policies regarding the nexus of natural resources and financial development indices are suggested. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Can intellectual property rights within climate technology transfer work for the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement?,"Since the UNFCCC 1992 mandated technology transfer commitments, how to fulfil the commitments and effectively facilitate the international transfer of climate-friendly technology in reality has been the subject of debate. In theory, climate change policymakers provide a broad framework for technology transfer through the UNFCCC regime. The 2015 Paris Agreement commits the Parties to strengthening cooperation on climate technology. In practice, however, the dynamic transfer of these technologies on an international scale does not take place fast enough to reach the full potential required by the UNFCCC. This shortcoming is partly due to intellectual property rights, which pose a significant obstacle to quick and efficient technology transfer. This article examines the kinds of changes in intellectual property laws needed to promote accessible, affordable and adaptable technology transfers and to help prepare host countries for potentially mandatory emission reductions in the post-Paris era. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Identification of Impeding Factors in Utilising Prefabrication during Lifecycle of Construction Projects: An Extensive Literature Review,"In recent years, the topic of climate change has been increasingly noticed by the public, and carbon emission reduction is one of the primary targets for various industries worldwide. The construction industry has a profound influence in this field, so it is significant to consider what kind of efforts can be made in building projects. Many scholars agree to promote prefabrication technology for construction, but its application still faces several challenges. By undertaking desk research, this paper explores the motivation and barriers to adopting modular techniques in construction projects under the lifecycle analysis. The preliminary information of the literature review is collated from dozens of peer-reviewed academic papers. Under the whole lifecycle thought, the PEST analysis tools also present the analytical results. This research finds that the top five barriers are the attitudinal resistance to using modular constructions, lack of sufficient modular expertise and practice, increasing costs and risks on supply chain management, insufficient government support and policy making, and high design and planning requirements. Moreover, the lifecycle analysis can divide the collated barriers into each stage, and adequate government support can assist in promoting the prefabrication in building projects in financial, legal, and technical aspects. The current findings can facilitate the broader use of prefabrication in building projects, improving the environmental sustainability of stakeholders. The process of proposed desk research can also be considered a referenced pattern for other related studies. More first-hand data should be collected and evaluated in further research to improve accuracy and adapt to the newest research field and industrial situations. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatial Distribution and Convergence of Agricultural Green Total Factor Productivity in China,"The power source, spatial-temporal differentiation and convergence of the growth rate of green total factor productivity in China’s agriculture were analyzed. The Malmquist index was used to measure the growth rate, and the spatial-temporal convergence was tested by (Formula presented.) convergence, absolute (Formula presented.) convergence, conditional (Formula presented.) convergence and dynamic spatial convergence. The study drew conclusions that the impetus for the intensive growth of green agriculture was insufficient, and the driving force for the growth of agricultural green total factor productivity (AGTFP) in the eastern, western and central region was green technology progress. In addition, AGTFP did not have an absolute σ convergence trend. Dynamic spatial absolute (Formula presented.) and conditional (Formula presented.) convergence indicated that regional differences were not completely related to regional endowment conditions, and regional green agricultural production was unbalanced. This study provides an important support for regional green development in China’s agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

How industry integration improves the eco-efficiency of the textile industry: The case of Qun-yi village in China,"During the formulation of policies related to China's Rural revitalization strategy in recent decades, industries (e.g., the textile industry) with high environmental restoration costs and low added value of social and economic benefits have been transformed or phased out to achieve eco-efficiency. In the policy implementation, a new self-organized social network of village committees, entrepreneurs, enterprises and villagers has been established to support village-level self-organization. Aiming to explore the nexus of industry integration and eco-efficiency for industry development in rural areas, we conducted a longitudinal single case study Qun-yi Village. In the evolution process from 1995 to 2022, the textile industry integration process of the Village was divided into three periods. We found that first comprehensive industrial integration characterized by increasing complex industry structures and blurred industry boundaries, has greatly improved eco-efficiency by reducing economic and environmental restoration costs and increasing output value. Second, a successful village-level self-organization featured by strong village committee leadership, participation of actors and perceived benefits significantly facilitate and moderate the process of industrial integration aiming for high eco-efficiency. This study provided important theoretical and policy insights into the industrial integration for high eco-efficiency in rural areas in developing countries from the perspective of village-level self-organization. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of the digital economy on food system resilience: Evidence from China,"Despite the widespread influence of the burgeoning digital economy on agricultural productivity in recent years, China’s food system confronts numerous challenges. Notably, research exploring the digital economy’s impact on food system resilience remains scarce, and the pivotal role of industrial agglomeration in this context remains unclear. Therefore, this article is based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2021, this paper empirically examines the direct effect, the mechanism of action, and the spatial spillover effect of the resilience of a digital economy-enabled food system using a double fixed-effects model, mediated-effects model, and spatial econometric model. The results show the following: (1) The resilience of China’s urban food system shows obvious spatial differences, but the overall trend in improvement requires attention. (2) The development of a digital economy has a facilitating effect on the level of resilience of the food system, and industrial agglomeration induces an intermediary effect. (3) The digital economy has a significant positive spatial spillover effect on the resilience of the food system; i.e., the digital economy can improve the resilience of the food system in the region and the neighboring regions. Accordingly, policy recommendations have been put forward to improve infrastructure construction and promote the development of digital villages; strengthen the construction of industrial agglomerations and promote the enhancement of the quality and efficiency of industries; and promote the development of regional linkages and build a solid foundation for food security. © 2024 Zhu et al.

Blockchain Empowerment: Unveiling Managerial Choices in Carbon Finance Investment Across Supply Chains,"We examine the potential of blockchain technology for carbon financing by organizations and within supply chains. Blockchain can provide transparent, trustworthy, secure, and efficient carbon-related transactions. Signaling and attribution theories inform the study that uses choice-based conjoint (CBC) experimentation to evaluate offsetting and insetting carbon finance investment scenarios. Factors on project attributes—including price, the scope of carbon finance project, blockchain adoption level, and stakeholder involvement—relationships to managerial investment decisions are investigated. We also investigate an important question on whether managerial ecological value propensity affects investment decisions and blockchain adoption preferences. The findings show that contrary to original suppositions, price was not as influential as presumed. Of greater concern to managerial decisions is the nature of carbon initiatives—the decision on whether to pursue carbon offsetting and/or insetting investments. Managerial environmental values significantly influenced decisions on carbon finance investments–with a preference for carbon reduction projects within their own supply chains. There is also an inclination for greater blockchain technology usage in carbon investment projects. Managers with greater ecological values were also more open to involving external parties favoring the adoption more extensive blockchain solutions. These results highlight blockchain's importance in making carbon finance projects more credible and trustworthy. Practically, the study highlights the importance of carbon finance project scope, nature, and blockchain technology in promoting sustainability initiatives. There are insights into a nuanced approach to addressing complexities of carbon finance within organizations and their supply chains. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
An analysis of urban renewal decision-making in China from the perspective of transaction costs theory: the case of Chongqing,"In China, there is a growing number of urban renewal projects due to the rapid growth of the economy and urbanization. To meet the needs of urban development, urban renewal requires a sound decision-making approach involving various stakeholder groups. However, current urban renewal decision-making is criticized for poor efficiency, equity, and resulting in many unintended adverse outcomes. It is claimed that high-level transaction costs (e.g., a great deal of time spent on negotiation and coordination) are the factors hidden behind the problems. However, few studies have analyzed urban renewal decision-making in a transaction costs perspective. Using the case of Chongqing, this paper aims at adopting transaction costs theory to understand the administrative process of urban renewal decision-making in China. This research focuses on four key stakeholder groups: municipal government, district government, local administrative organizations, and the consulting parties. A transaction costs analytical framework is established. First, the decision-making stages of urban renewal and involved key stakeholder groups are clarified. Second, the transactions done by different stakeholder groups in each stage is identified, thus to analyze what types of transaction costs are generated. Third, the relative levels of transaction costs among different stakeholder groups were measured based on the interview. The empirical analysis reveals how transaction costs occur and affect urban renewal decision-making. Finally, policy implications were proposed to reduce transaction costs in order to enhance urban renewal. © 2020, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Applications of 3D Paleontological Data at the Florida Museum of Natural History,"The past decade has seen an exponential increase of innovative applications of 3D technology in the geosciences. Here, we present a case study from the Florida Museum of Natural History applied to the multidisciplinary field of paleontology. We have deployed 3D scanning and printing techniques for the purposes of scientific research, formal education, and informal outreach. Depending on the application of the 3D file, different techniques are utilized to create high-fidelity models of physical fossil specimens or geologic field sites. These techniques include X-ray CT scans, surface scans, and photogrammetry, all of which produce 3D models that vary in resolution and scale. Novel paleontological research applied non-destructive CT scanning to explore the internal anatomy of fossil museum specimens, additionally, 3D models are being used to create K–12 curricula aligned with national and state-specific education standards that are implemented in formal classroom settings. Many of these lessons are part of the NSF-funded iDigFossils project, which aims to evaluate students’ motivation and interest towards science, technology, engineering, and mathematics after participating in integrated 3D printing and paleontology lessons. Specifically, lessons on dinosaur trackways, horse evolution, and the Great American Biotic Interchange teach geologic concepts such as deep time, taphonomy, plate tectonics, and evolutionary trends. The same 3D models developed for these K–12 lessons have been used during Florida Museum’s outreach events to engage broad audiences with hands-on exhibits and activities. All 3D files are stored on open-access, online repositories, providing accessibility to fossil specimens and field sites. The application of 3D technology for the study of fossils and paleontology will continue to expand the impact of scientific discoveries for basic research as well as for broader impacts on society. © Copyright © 2020 Ziegler, Perez, Pirlo, Narducci, Moran, Selba, Hastings, Vargas-Vergara, Antonenko and MacFadden.",Not About Sufficiency
Biological diversity in agriculture and global change,"Biological diversity of agriculture consists of several analytic levels and spatial management scales that are subject to complex interactions with global change. The complexity of interactions is related to the bidirectional impacts and influences of global land use and climate change in combination with social-environmental shifts (globalization of agricultural development; market integration; technological change; and regulation through global treaties, policies, and institutions). This article develops a conceptual framework of the complexity of interactions using four thematic nodesbiological diversity in agriculture; global change; management and scale; and social-environmental adaptation, vulnerability, and resilience. It argues for the increased relevance of this framework. Linking expanded scientific research and policy to this group of conceptual nodes yields insight into the impacts of global change on biological diversity in agriculture and into the design of conservation strategies, monitoring approaches, and sustainability policies. Future policy must anticipate interactions of biological diversity, agroecosystem complexity, and global change stemming from the acceleration and integration of region-scale land-use intensification and disintensification.

Unveiling the effect of social networks on farmers’ diversified energy-saving behaviors in the Tibetan plateau region of China,"An improved comprehension of the factors that influence farmers' diversified energy-saving behaviors makes significant sense for enacting potent energy policies and curbing rural energy consumption. This paper investigated the effect of social networks on diversified energy-saving behaviors adopted by farmers in the Tibetan Plateau region of China, by establishing a generalized Poisson regression model. A total of 480 farmers were randomly interviewed. The results indicate that farmers' social networks were relatively abundant in the study area, and the diversified energy-saving behaviors exhibited good performance at the overall level. Farmers' social networks are of paramount importance in the execution of diversified energy-saving behaviors. In particular, the scale and frequency of social networks are instrumental in the success of the implementation of diversified energy-saving behaviors. Farmers’ sociodemographic characteristics, including gender, education level, household size, and residential housing area, also facilitate their adoption of diversified energy-saving behaviors. The findings contribute to the further exploration of the value of social networks in determining environmental actions in rural areas and provide an effective basis for policy formulation to save energy consumption in similar regions in other countries. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Ecological Engineering Integration: A PBL Journey Towards Sustainability in Rural Project Contexts,"Amid the current challenges posed by climate change and human-induced environmental shifts, rural higher education plays a crucial role, serving as a dynamic platform to address diverse issues across various disciplines. Although education in rural areas is uneven, leading to significant gaps in the learning process and differences in educational content, it is a platform to introduce sustainability approaches. To address rural education, the Universidad Nacional de Colombia has a Special Admission Program using Problem-Based Learning (PBL). This four-term program aims to enhance both soft and hard skills through transversal projects. Being rural implies ecology as a central theme in several disciplines. Ecology prompts students to reflect deeply on their communities. PBL projects encourage students to explore multidisciplinary connections, seeking alternative solutions for their communities. Within this framework, ecology provides an excellent opportunity to examine different dimensions—economic, social, and environmental issues. The process begins by constructing a problem tree that encapsulates these challenges. Various tools, such as field trips and basic descriptive analyses of real situations, are then employed for in-depth study. Between 2022 and 2023, a total of 20 student projects were implemented. In the initial semester, students adopted an observational approach to familiarise themselves with their territories and refine their problem trees. Subsequent terms empowered students to conduct experiments within their communities, aiming to explore and address significant issues from a sustainable perspective grounded in an interdisciplinary. Among these projects, 15 utilised socio-ecological systems and maps, while three explored various strategies to enhance their understanding of sustainability through experiments and tools such as biodiversity catalogues and surveys in rural communities. This approach illustrates how engineering students can deepen their comprehension of their territories, acting as a guiding tool for their learning process and reflection on different problems within the special program, providing valuable tools for future academic projects. © 2024 University of Minho.

Formulation of an innovative model for the bioeconomy,"Background The bioeconomy, an evolving concept promoting sustainable use of renewable biological resources, confronts the challenge of balancing growth and sustainability across sectors like biotechnology, agriculture, and forestry. This study aims to elucidate the bioeconomy’s dynamic nature, constructing a comprehensive theoretical model addressing these complexities. Methodology Through an extensive literature review, foundational elements for this model were identified: defining the core concept, delineating relevant variables, specifying assumptions and parameters, and depicting relationships through equations or diagrams. Special attention was given to integrating Georgescu-Roegen’s insights, emphasizing causal links, state variables, measurement scales, and validation plans. Results The model incorporates Georgescu-Roegen’s insights, highlighting the importance of clearly defining the bioeconomy for a comprehensive understanding. The proposed model leverages variables, assumptions, and equations within Georgescu-Roegen’s framework, serving as a crucial tool for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders. This approach facilitates research structuring, informed decision-making, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Conclusion By addressing the bioeconomy’s evolution, and cross-sectional boundaries, and adopting a broader perspective, this study contributes to policy development for a more sustainable and integrated bioeconomy. Based on empirical knowledge, this model provides not only a solid theoretical framework but also practical guidelines for advancing toward a balanced and resilient bioeconomy. © 2024 Zuniga-Gonzalez et al.

"Intergenerational dialogue, collaboration, learning, and decision-making in global environmental governance: The case of the IUCN intergenerational partnership for sustainability","This article provides evidence and a rationale based on adaptive governance studies for why creating meaningful youth engagement should be understood in terms of intergenerational dialogue, collaboration, learning, and substantive decision-making in global environmental governance. We have centered our discussion on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as the largest global conservation organization. Through an organizational ethnography approach, we have demonstrated how generational concerns within the IUCN have been framed in terms of participation, and then present the IUCN Intergenerational Partnership for Sustainability (IPS) as a case study of a grassroots movement that is focused on transforming the IUCN towards being a fully intergenerational global governance system for nature conservation. We have described the development of intergenerational thinking and action within the IUCN, and discussed intergenerational governance as being essential for addressing nature conservation challenges faced by local communities in times of increasing global uncertainty. We conclude by providing recommendations for enhancing intergenerational dialogue and building intergenerational governance structures within global conservation organizations. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

"Food Waste and Carbon Footprint Assessment of Eateries in Kelantan, Malaysia","Introduction: Food service establishments in Malaysia have grown positively in response to the rising demand for dining out and takeaway food. However, they also exert a high demand for energy resources and contribute to negative environmental impacts. In this study, an environmental assessment of food waste generation was carried out alongside carbon footprint quantification across electricity and water consumption in two different food service establishments with a focus on cafeterias and casual dining restaurants. Methods: Ten food premises with the same criteria in service were selected, consisting of cafeterias and Thai food restaurants located in Kelantan state of Malaysia. Food waste from preparation losses, serving losses and plate waste were collected and measured for a 7-day period to establish respective quantities. Material Flow Analysis (MFA) was used to visualize the material flow from the operation of both the cafeterias and Thai food restaurants while carbon footprint analysis was undertaken to calculate carbon emissions. Results: The findings revealed consistent results for both the cafeterias and Thai food restaurants as higher proportions of food waste arose from customer plate waste (67.99% and 62.12%) rather than preparation losses (32.01% and 37.88%). It was identified that cafeterias contribute larger volumes of carbon emissions for both electricity (105.93 kgCO2e) and water related consumption (8.39 kgCO2e) compared to Thai food restaurants (57.58 kgCO2e and 3.63 kgCO2e). Conclusion: These findings may provide guidance for the food service management to recognize the priority areas of improvement in reducing environmental impact associated food service sector. © 2022 UPM Press.

Climate-Related Vulnerability Assessment Toward Disaster Risk Reduction: Insight from Pakistan,"Globally, climate-related disasters (CRDs) have become a common phenomenon in the last few decades, increasing vulnerability and causing disaster mortality. To manage disaster risk, the global Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction (SFDRR) provides a solid action plan for disaster risk reduction (DRR) considering all the dimensions of vulnerability. However, countries are still less receptive at the local level to adopting the SFDRR. Also, the global research community did not explore vulnerability features based on the Sendai Framework nor integrated such features with the four priorities of SFDRR. Based on the case of Pakistan, this study seeks to bridge the gap through three objectives. The first objective of the study is to identify the vulnerability features cited in the SFDRR. In addition, the research aims to develop a new vulnerability model by integrating SFDRR's four priorities. As a second objective, it is intended to develop a decision support framework for ranking and evaluating each of the SFDRR priority action areas under local conditions. A third objective is to assess the impact of climate-induced environmental, socioeconomic and political vulnerabilities on climate-driven mortality. To meet these three different objectives, the authors have adopted a multi-method approach by using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and binary logistic regression method (BLRM). Based on the assessment, the authors suggested some policy implications. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",About Sufficiency
"Navigating the complex realities of electric vehicle adoption: A comprehensive study of government strategies, policies, and incentives","Management of sustainable transportation currently is one of the most important aspects of a country's or a region's development from an economic and social point of view considering the net zero requirements The use of electric vehicles (EVs) is recognized as an essential means of achieving global net-zero emission goals. To promote their widespread adoption, the challenges they face must be addressed. These challenges are divided into several categories: infrastructure, adoption, costs, energy transition, awareness, and market-related challenges. Robust regulatory frameworks and incentive policies must be implemented to overcome most of these challenges. For EV adoption to increase rapidly and steadily, such frameworks must include fiscal and non-fiscal incentives that will encourage the masses to convert to EVs. The key findings of the work include identification of several barrier not widely discussed in the literature, emphasizing the need for non-fiscal incentives for EV adoption, and presenting a comprehensive analysis of various incentive policies alongside a detailed implementation framework. The implementation framework provides research directions for academics, engineers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders regarding further refinement and enhancement of policy incentives to facilitate the widespread adoption of EVs. © 2024 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Urban climate adaptation and mitigation action plans: A critical review,"Local governments are expected now more than ever to lead climate action planning as climate change intensifies and urbanization increases rapidly. However, studies indicate limitations in the comprehensiveness and level of integration of adaptation and mitigation in existing climate action plans. To develop suitable climate action plans that are comprehensive and consistent with globally accepted standards and benchmarks, this study proposed an Urban Climate Action Planning framework and pilot-tested it with 257 urban climate action plans. Overall, 43 criteria are included in the framework across three stages of climate planning. The pilot test revealed that more than half of the sampled plans have a medium level of suitability, with 39% having a weak level of suitability. About 51% of plans from Europe have a weak level of suitability. Surprisingly, none of the plans sampled from Africa and Latin America achieved a weak level of suitability despite lacking a significant share of global climate research and development funding. A Kruskal-Wallis test shows a statistically significant association between stages of climate planning and (a) city types (p-value of 0.004326) and (b) year of adoption or publication of climate plans and suitability scores (p-value of 0.0001027). Urban climate action plans adopted or published more recently (2018–2022) are likely more suitable than those adopted or published earlier. The sampled urban climate action plans from the Global South had higher average suitability scores than those from the Global North. The study presents key findings and considerations for urban climate action planning and future research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Framing water policy in a carbon affected and carbon constrained environment,"Climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions is substantially altering water availability while increasing water demand. Shifts in domestic energy policy and production, while needed to confront the challenge of climate change, may further stress the nation's water resources. These changes and new demands will be most severe in regions that are already experiencing water stresses and conflicts. This article examines the extent of the changes in water supply and demand by assessing how water conflicts will be addressed in the four overarching water use categories: water for population security, water for ecological security, water for energy security, and water for food security. The analysis suggests that water governance institutions and policies need to be retooled to better accommodate the necessary reallocation of water that will serve the nation's water security needs.",About Sufficiency
Pervious area change as surrogate to diverse climatic variables trends in the CONUS: A county-scale assessment,"The increase in worldwide population is putting much pressure on the existent urban management plans. In this context, strategies and policies should be updated to conserve natural resources, but more importantly, to improve inhabitants' well-being. Studies focusing on pervious areas have many potentials, particularly regarding the assessment of potential green infrastructures within the vicinities of cities. This study highlights the pervious area change between 2001 and 2016 within every county in the CONtiguous United States (CONUS) based on the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The study found that 43 different counties can be considered dense. A statistical analysis is followed, highlighting the air temperature, wind speed, precipitation, solar radiation, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trends in five characteristic counties. These datasets were retrieved from diverse remote sensing and satellite platforms between 1980 and 2019. The main results also found that air temperature was significantly (at α = 0.95) increasing for the same period. The other climatic variables depict fluctuating and usually insignificant trends. Such information would benefit decision- and policy-makers to focus their initiatives towards the most vulnerable counties while projecting different scenarios based on their current and historical conditions. Furthermore, this approach can be portable to other countries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
"Providing a practical model of the waste management master plan with emphasis on public participation using the SWOT method, the QSPM matrix and the FAHP method","The purpose of this study was to present a practical model of strategic waste management via two Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threats (SWOT) models and hierarchical analysis. In this regard, the strengths and weaknesses of the present situation and the factors affecting waste management in Tehran were investigated. In this study, the importance of public participation in waste management was investigated by means of the Delphi method and the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). Based on the results of the SWOT analysis, a team of experts identified the internal and external factors and rated the primary factors; each factor was weighted, then according to their scores, the proposed waste management framework was developed. Finally, the strategies were quantitatively prioritized by the planning matrix. Then, using the analysis method, the hierarchy was used in this study as a SWOT supplement. The results of two questionnaires designed in this study identified the socio-economic, educational, cultural, and political factors as first to fourth, respectively. The most viable strategies, which were selected based on the analysis, include the potential use of social networks to encourage society to reduce waste and to promote the separation of waste as well as compliance with the proposed comprehensive waste management program; another choice strategy was providing economic incentives to maximize social participation in reducing waste production waste sorting. © 2019, Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology.

Globalized poverty and environment: 21st century challenges and innovative solutions,"This book reviews the key conceptions and economic theories of poverty, explains poverty-environment nexus, and finally offers innovative socio-economic and scientific geospatial solutions for the 21st Century. The book makes it possible for our readers to understand poverty thorough a concise review of the major theoretical economic frameworks, measures of poverty, and points out the need to understand rural-urban dichotomy of poverty. We find the theories and measures to be less-than perfect and therefore point out the need to treat these measures and theories as convenient tools lacking perfect accuracy and utmost scientific reliability. It follows then that the supposedly knowledgeably crafted poverty reduction and environmental preservation solutions are inherently imperfect. The economic solutions proposed in this book transcend extant humdrum macroeconomic and policy measures targeting poverty and environmental issues. We point to a new paradigm in which private sector and other stakeholders can create new and inclusive markets where value is co-created and shared. Above all, this book offers timely state-of-the-art geospatial solutions targeting the most pressing global problems of water, e.g., the use of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) missions to estimate changes in stored water in the water-poverty-environment nexus, pollution, agriculture and disaster management, where geospatial techniques are applied under strong environmental impact assessment regulatory regimes. ""This book provides a good summary of economic theories of poverty as well as a vivid depiction of the state of environmental degradation in the world. People often work separately on different issues that are, in fact, closely intertwined. The principle of holism is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and I believe that this joint-venture of two experts on poverty and environment has produced something more than a sum of two separate monographs on the issues. Various points raised in this volume are worth heeding when we think of formulation and implementation of a truly effective post-MDGs development agenda.

"The role of economic production, energy consumption, and trade openness in urbanization-environment nexus: a heterogeneous analysis on developing economies along the Belt and Road route","In today’s world, where urbanization is at its pinnacle, has created a significant economic gap between rural and urban populations in developing economies and substantially influenced environmental degradation. This study investigates the relationship between urbanization and environmental degradation via carbon emissions among developing countries along the Belt and Road route from 1990 to 2019 while using economic production, energy consumption, and trade openness as control variables. The study engages current econometric methodologies to uncover accurate and reliable findings, and the outcomes reveal that the panel under investigation is cross-sectionally dependent and heterogeneous. Therefore, the AMG, CCEMG, and DCCEMG estimators are employed to examine the effect connection between the variables. The outcomes unveil that urbanization, economic production, and energy consumption escalate environmental degradation, but trade openness is confirmed as a trivial determinant of environmental degradation. Furthermore, the causal connections between the variables disclose bi-directional causalities between urbanization and environmental degradation and between energy consumption and environmental degradation. Nevertheless, uni-directional causalities are affirmed, spanning from economic production to environmental degradation and from trade openness to environmental degradation. Finally, policy implications are discussed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",About Sufficiency
Discovery of a possible Well-being Turning Point within energy footprint accounts which may support the degrowth theory,"The former consensus on a link between energy consumption and improved well-being of a country has been scrutinized by scholars for decades and is, succinctly, for the time being a contested thesis. Until the 1970s the relation of energy to well-being was defined as linearly proportional, and in a later period still as an increasing logarithmic function. Recent empirical research falsified the assumption of an overt link between well-being and increased energy consumption in countries with high per-capita energy usage. Going forward, our research shows for the first time a possible proof for a negative correlation between energy consumption and well-being after a Well-being Turning Point (WTP). We used a world data set, not limited to high-income countries but including 176 nations with available data sets. Our findings could support both the logarithmic growth of well-being together with energy, as well as the contradicting saturation theses supporting degrowth, and thus opens the discussion in all directions. In this paper Energy Footprint data within Eora database and Global Multi Regional Input Output methodology have been calculated, which includes also the energy embodied in imported/exported products and services (also known as consumption-based energy accounts). The use of footprint accounts has been demonstrated in our previous research to be necessary when analysing global energy consumption trends; as it records the energy consumption reality better than the usually used Total Primary Energy Supply which is provided by the International Energy Agency. In this paper, we provide in a novel way, some statistical support for an Energy WTP, i.e. a high-energy threshold after which a further consumption increase results in a reduced Human Development Index. We tested our results for possible biases (e.g. excluding outlier countries and including a factor for considering the weight of high population countries) and concluded that a WTP is one possible interpretation of the data. Thus, we would like to open a discussion about how energy consumption could end up having a negative effect on well-being, considering its indirect impacts in citizens of a country.

Forecasting the Impact of the Environmental and Energy Factor to Improve Urban Sustainability by Using (SEM),"The environmental and energy factor is one of the important factors that most studies have focused on in the field of sustainability, especially in light of the increasing population growth rates and the accompanying increase in consumption and environmental pollution rates. This paper focuses on presenting several different theories and models of urban sustainability for the purpose of identifying the overall factors that constitute it. Structural Equations Modeling (SEM) allows knowledge of the relationships and the strength of influence between these factors. The paper focuses on studying the environmental and energy factors and their impact on other sustainability factors. As most researchers resort to descriptive methods and measures in discussing the subject. The paper aims to adopt models and quantitative measures to determine the factors and indicators of urban sustainability and to clarify the importance, variation, and interdependence between these factors and indicators, adopting the hypothesis that structural equation modeling provides highly reliable tools through which sustainability factors, their relationships, and the mutual influence between them can be measured using the analysis of moment structures (AMOS) program. The result shows that the environmental and energy factors are highly related to the urban design factor (6.0). © 2023 by the authors. Licensee C.E.J, Tehran, Iran.",About Sufficiency
"Assessing public perception and parametric analysis of municipal solid waste management solutions in Tabuk City, Saudi Arabia","Accelerated urbanization, population growth, and industrial revolution have resulted in significant environmental degradation and health issues for residents due to municipal solid waste. The effective management of solid waste is a significant issue, especially in developing economies, where improper waste disposal leads to economic losses and adverse impacts on environmental and public health. This study evaluates existing waste management procedures in Tabuk City in northern Saudi Arabia, finds significant challenges, and suggests possible solutions. For this purpose, this study administered a survey to assess public awareness regarding municipal solid waste recycling and management. Therefore, a two-stage analytic investigation was conducted that included a total of 228 respondents from Tabuk City, Saudi Arabia. Among them, 62.28% were male, and 37.72% were female, with the largest age group represented was 22–35 years, accounting for 42.10% of participants. The questionnaire responses were evaluated using SPSS V27, and relative scores were analyzed using SHapley Additive exPlanations and Partial Dependence Plots. Based on the study results, most respondents are knowledgeable and worried about the adverse environmental effects of solid waste. The Pearson correlation highlighted that lack of awareness with responsible authorities exhibited the highest positive correlations with recycling behavior improvement, with respective correlation values of + 0.55. The results also revealed an absence of recycling systems since the majority of respondents were uninformed of existing practices and expressed a readiness to engage in recycling programs if established. Further, parametric modeling illustrates that most of the participants believe that lack of awareness along with authority responsibility is the most influential factor impacting poor waste management practice. The study concluded by highlighting the necessity for an organized municipal solid waste recycling system, enhanced community education, and more stringent governmental restrictions to mitigate environmental damage and foster sustainable waste management in Tabuk. © The Author(s) 2025.",About Sufficiency
Sustainable Development Goals Indicators at Territorial Level: Conceptual and Methodological Issues—The Italian Perspective,"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2015) can be considered the synthesis of a debate, which sets the sustainable development as a priority for the International Community. The achievement of the sustainable development goals has made necessary to develop a system of indicators. Indicators and data should be collected and reported sub-nationally, giving attention to the territory. This is a necessity even more for Italy, a country historically characterized by strong regional specificities and differences, which find their radicalization in the so-called North–South gap. In this paper, we want to examine and monitor the Italian situation as to the achievement of the SDGs, based on the analysis of the Regions, to highlight potential differences or territorial homogeneity. In particular, we want to emphasize not only how there is actually a gap between the North and the South of the country, but also how the synthesis tends often to be representative of situations profoundly different from each other, as a result of different values in the basic indicators, or similar situations between them. Due to the difficulty of reporting on a paper a detailed analysis of all 17 sustainable development goals, we focus only on the first three goals one. In particular, for each goal we select indicators all useful for the analysis of regional realities and appropriate some for monitoring the present condition, others for providing information on the future one (risk). The research methodology is to use the Adjusted Mazziotta–Pareto Index for creating a composite index for each goal considered.

Environmental Adaptation Tools as an Approach to Meet Challenges in Urban Planning in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"Urban areas are facing the risk of climate change due to high temperatures, floods, storms, droughts, and the expected rise in sea levels, as a result of the rapid growth in urban and industrial activities. Cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are primarily exposed to the effects of high heat and floods after rare events of heavy rainfall. This requires the search for sustainable and appropriate planning solutions to adapt to climate change within the framework of sustainable urban planning. Urban planning can play a significant role in addressing climate change through sustainable adaptation. Therefore, the research aims to study and identify appropriate environmental tools and planning approaches that can be integrated into the urban planning methodology to adapt to climate change in urban areas in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Some case studies of urban areas exposed to the risk of climate change were studied and analyzed to evaluate the planning tools and approaches adopted to confront these risks. five cases were studied. The challenges and positives of these tools and approaches were deduced. The appropriate planning approach has been selected for the privacy of Saudi cities to face the effects of climate change. The research concluded that sponge cities are the appropriate approach for Saudi cities to face the risks of floods.

Do economic development and human capital decrease non-renewable energy consumption? Evidence for OECD countries,"The false hope that economic development would lead to a decrease in fossil sources’ energy consumption can be an obstacle to fighting global warming. Is it realistic to expect that more knowledge will lead public policymakers to take more decisive action to mitigate climate change's adverse effects? This research attempts to answer both premises using data for developed countries with high human capital levels: 27-member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development-OECD during 1980–2015. Access to energy and that it is non-polluting is raised as a goal of the Sustainable Development Goals. We combine linear and non-linear models: we specifically employ threshold regressions and second-generation cointegration techniques, FMOLS, and causality. Our results are disappointing for the first premise: economic development does not reduce energy consumption from fossil sources. However, human capital does decrease the consumption of non-renewable energy. In order to capture current trends in economies, we include the globalization index, the urbanization rate, and services. The results of the cointegration tests suggest the existence of a long-term relationship between the variables. Our results indicate that the human capital index and globalization are the last hope to promote the transition to a more sustainable energy matrix in developed countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
The spatial and scalar politics of a just energy transition in Illinois,"Illinois passed the Energy Transition Act (i.e., the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act or CEJA) in 2021, which established clean energy mandates with an emphasis on social equity. We examine CEJA and related policies to understand the politics of Illinois' energy transition. While CEJA has been praised as an approach to a just transition, critics argue that it exacerbated Illinois' rural-urban dichotomy by distributing benefits to urban areas defined as ‘environmental justice communities’ and tangible costs, in the form of clean energy infrastructure, to rural communities. We demonstrate that, leading up to and in response, 1) local governments deployed measures to oppose renewable energy development and 2) the state, in turn, scaled authority for energy governance upward to inhibit opposition. By framing reduced participation as necessary for just climate action, Illinois undermined procedural forms of justice viewed as critical to a just transition and reinforced energy as a partisan political issue. This case illustrates how a narrow definition of justice can contribute to distributive conflict in the energy transition and identifies a need for more inclusive strategies to manage such conflict. © 2024 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency

A systematic review of the impacts of open burning and open dumping of waste in Ghana: A way forward for sustainable waste management,"Waste management (WM) is a growing concern in Ghana, characterised by the widespread practice of open dumping and burning of waste. These unsustainable methods have raised significant environmental, health, and social concerns. This systematic review aims to comprehensively analyse the impacts of waste burning and open dumping in Ghana and propose a sustainable way forward for waste management. A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles, reports, and government documents was conducted using various academic databases and official websites. Studies published from 2000 to 2024 were included, focusing on the environmental, health, and socioeconomic impacts of waste burning and open dumping. Relevant sources were identified and critically assessed. The review revealed that open dumping and waste burning have substantial adverse impacts. The effects of waste burning and open dumping necessitate a holistic approach to address these challenges. This includes infrastructure development, implementation and enforcement of WM regulations, community engagement, technological solutions, promotion of recycling technologies, and public-private partnerships. By adopting these strategies, Ghana can mitigate the adverse effects of inappropriate waste disposal, protect public health, preserve the environment, and make significant progress toward a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future. This review contributes valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders committed to addressing the WM crisis in Ghana.

New urban management: Attracting value flows to branded hubs,"New Urban Management discusses how the logic of economic flows poses a challenge to local governments throughout the world. The book argues that the increased fluidity in economic life must have its reflection in local economic development policy. The analysis begins with the idea of space of flows, but this goes much further than available literature in urban political analysis. The starting point is the observation metropolitan governments' ability to maintain their economic vitality depends on their ability to attract flows of values through their assets. Such assets are, however, symbolic rather than physical, which implies the relevance of city branding. On that basis, this book builds a coherent picture of how flow analysis can be utilised in brand-oriented economic development policy. © Ari-Veikko Anttiroiko 2015.",About Sufficiency
Risk assessment framework for cumulative effects (RAFCE),"Introduction: Regional environmental risk assessment is a practical approach to understanding and proactively addressing the cumulative effects of resource development in areas of regional importance. However, regional assessment is methodologically complex, and frameworks to identify and prioritize regional risk issues to guide effective management decisions are lacking. This research develops a risk and impacts-based cumulative effects assessment framework for scoping regional cumulative effects issues to guide present and future project and regional assessment. We operationalized the framework dubbed Risk Assessment Framework for Cumulative Effects (RAFCE) to assess the risks and impacts of proposed mining development in the Ring of Fire region of Northern Ontario, Canada. Methods: Methodologically, we built on existing studies to understand the key valued ecosystem components (VECs) impacted by mining; organized an expert Bowtie Risk Assessment Tool workshop and interviews to identify regional risks and define the VECs impacted by mining; and developed an impact prioritization model that helped quantify and prioritize impacts of mining. Results and Discussion: RAFCE enabled us to: a) identify drivers and impacts of cumulative effects and potential preventive and mitigation measures for effective cumulative effects management and b) describe, quantify, and rank the major impact and components of regional interest. Using RAFCE, we can identify and prioritize impacts that are cross-cutting, multisector‐driven, synergistic, and relevant to a region, visualize and understand the risk management process, identify policy and management issues to prevent risks or mitigate impacts, and ultimately inform resource allocation for effective regional cumulative effects assessment outcomes. RAFCE is suitable for engaging diverse stakeholders in planning for regional cumulative effects assessment.

Key governance and sustainability indicators for certification systems: Bridging certification and policy frameworks in the bioeconomy,"The European bioeconomy offers a sustainable development model, but its successful implementation requires robust sustainability measures. Ensuring sustainability in bio-based value chains requires clearly defined operational characteristics and indicators that comprehensively address key sustainability and circularity aspects. These indicators must align with the European Union (EU) sustainability framework, policies and directives. This study analyzed existing certification schemes and labels (CSLs), benchmarking monitoring systems, and EU policies to identify key sustainability indicators. A grey literature review further supplemented this analysis. Additionally, an alignment study was conducted to assess how EU policies guide the transition towards a bioeconomy. The research identified the key indicators that CSLs should adopt to effectively support the EU sustainability policy framework. A total of 142 sustainability indicators were proposed across environmental (7 areas), social (5), and economic/circularity (4) pillars, along with 60 operational indicators in governance (4 principles), assurance (5), traceability (4), and standard setting (3). The analysis revealed gaps in CSLs and policies, particularly in the economic and circularity pillars, while environmental and social indicators showed better coverage but still need improvements in areas such as land use, air quality, water depletion and consumer feedback. These findings provide valuable insights for certification bodies, industry stakeholders, and policymakers, offering guidance towards the harmonization of CSLs and their alignment with the European bioeconomy policy framework. © 2025 The Authors",About Sufficiency

Employing statistical mechanics methods to scrutinize Hamiltonian system costs related to administrative interactions for water supply-demand, the study assessed the structural fit of the water governance system to the basin across distinct stages: without- and with-including the ULRP. Results revealed diminished costs following ULRP involvement, notably in entities with higher water demands, head offices and the system overall, further improved by water-saving measures. These findings highlighted the efficacy of vertical (re)arrangements and structural reform through ULRP incorporation in enhancing system fit, stressing the significance of its water-saving policy. The methodology provides a fast and explicit scan of the system structure, demonstrating its ability to project the effect of institutional reforms on the system state. Serving as a constructive tool for policymakers, it facilitates rapid, efficient and informed decision-making in water governance. Furthermore, following the UN SDG 6, this framework supports integrated water resources management (IWRM) across sectors and regions, particularly targeting water-stressed contexts. © 2024 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Sacrifice Zones as a Socio-Ecological System: The Case of the Quintero-Puchuncaví Bay,"The purpose of this article is to analyze the slaughter zones from the perspective of socio-ecological systems (SSE) taking the Bahía de Quintero and Puchuncaví as a case study. For this, the work methodology consists of placing the issue in the context of environmental history and the Anthropocene, to then apply the theoretical elements that characterize the SSE, to the case study and the environmental conflict that has developed in the area. Although the case has been widely studied from different perspectives, holistic approaches such as the one proposed are required to better understand the problem. Through a combination of theoretical literature and literature on the case, it is argued that the SES of the area has evolved from an agrarian and fishing one, to a purely industrial and polluting one. In its development it has faced various shocks and crises. As a result, the system is characterized by a decrease in its resilience, being practically nil today, a high vulnerability and, above all, being unsustainable, therefore, it is concluded that it does not comply with supporting human well-being, one of the important elements in any socio-ecological system. © 2023 Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Debrecen.

Flood risk assessments—Exploring maturity and challenges in Sweden,"Floods are destructive to society. Hence, to assess and manage flood risk is imperative. Flood risk assessments require several layers of analysis, from flood hazard to societal impact. This paper explores the maturity level and challenges related to three components of a comprehensive risk assessment: flood hazard, direct consequences, and indirect consequences. This is achieved by introducing and applying a maturity framework on flood hazard reports and flood risk management plans in Sweden, as required by the EU Floods Directive (FD). A longitudinal analysis is conducted over two FD cycles (2009–2015 and 2016–2021). Complementary interviews with county administrative boards and responsible authorities provide deeper insights into processes and practical challenges. The results reveal that the maturity level of flood hazard assessment is high, while direct and, in particular, indirect consequences assessments need increased attention and substantial improvements. Further, there is no significant increase in maturity between the FD cycles, indicating fundamental challenges towards achieving this. Critical steps forward include developing applicable methods for analysing both direct and indirect consequences of floods, improving data availability on functionality and interdependency of critical infrastructure and society at large, and creating incentives for a broader range of societal actors to participate in flood risk management. © 2024 The Authors.

Wetland gentrification: the African variant on ecological gentrification,"There is growing scholarly interest in notions of ecological gentrification – whereby environmental improvements drive up real estate prices, with the subsequent displacement of low-income residents – particularly in the global North. Drawing on an integrative review of extant literature on African urbanism, urban greenery encroachment and gentrification, this paper argues that the Western notion of ecological gentrification has little or no application in African cities, which are confronted with rapid encroachment on urban wetlands amidst burgeoning urbanization and its attendant increasing demand for property development. We conceptualize the African variant on ecological gentrification as “wetland gentrification”. It occurs when land scarcity and rising property values in African cities cause indiscriminate depletion of urban wetlands for property development, leading to the destruction of ecological resources and displacement of human populations. This paper discusses, among other topics, the implications of wetland gentrification for urban governance and vice versa. © 2024 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).",About Sufficiency
Shifting power relations in sustainability transitions: A multi-actor perspective,"This paper contributes to understanding transition politics by conceptualizing (shifting) power relations between actors in sustainability transitions. The authors introduce a Multi-actor Perspective as a heuristic framework for specifying (shifting) power relations between different categories of actors at different levels of aggregation. First, an overview is provided of how power and empowerment have been treated in transition research, and remaining questions are identified on who exercises power and who is empowered by and with whom. It is argued that theoretical frameworks and empirical analyses in transition studies lack precision when it comes to distinguishing between different types and levels of actors. In response, a Multi-actor Perspective (MaP) is developed, which distinguishes among four sectors (state, market, community, third sector), and between actors at different levels of aggregation: (1) sectors, (2) organizational actors, and (3) individual actors. The paper moves on to specify how the MaP contributes to understanding transition politics specifically in conceptualizing shifting power relations. Throughout the paper, empirical illustrations are used regarding public debates on welfare state reform, civil society and ‘Big Society’, as well as more specific empirical examples of community energy initiatives. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",About Sufficiency
"The adequacy of the current policy, legal and institutional frameworks in addressing social, environmental, and occupational safety & health impacts of gold cyanidation in Siaya County, Kenya","This study evaluates Kenya’s policy, legal, and institutional frameworks for managing the environmental, social, and Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) impacts of gold cyanidation, focusing on Siaya County. Despite the robust national policies and legal structures, such as the National Environment Policy, 2013 and the Mining Act, 2016, effectiveness is compromised by enforcement gaps and insufficient institutional resources. The Siaya County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP) (2018–2022) lacks specific provisions for gold cyanidation, indicating a misalignment between local and national policies. Institutional assessment reveals significant deficiencies, including under-resourced regulatory bodies like the Ministry of Mining and National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), which hamper effective oversight and enforcement. The study suggests that a multi-faceted approach involving strengthening public regulations, enhancing institutional capacities, and integrating private sector initiatives could offer a more comprehensive and sustainable management strategy for gold cyanidation impacts. By combining robust public frameworks with proactive private sector practices, Kenya can improve mining governance and address existing regulatory gaps. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",About Sufficiency
"Community Resilience Related to Community Resources Access to Peatland in Political Ecological Perspectives: A Case Study of Purun (Eleocharis dulcis) Craftmen in Ogan Komering Ilir, South Sumatera, Indonesia","Community resilience is widely used in managing natural resources and the environment as a means of system capacity to cope with stress. However, our findings show that resilience is not easily applied to common-pool resources (CPRs) such as peatlands, which are open access and full of importance. This is experienced by the community of purun craftsmen (Eleocharis dulcis) in Ogan Komering, Ilir Regency, South Sumatra, Indonesia. This paper was conducted to determine the community's social resilience in overcoming pressures originating from environmental, socio-economic, and political changes. We used a qualitative research method with a descriptive approach and obtained data through observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation. Our findings suggest that community resilience on peatlands is influenced by mechanisms to gain and maintain access to the resource. This mechanism is relatively limited, so it can be said that it is less robust, mainly if three threat scenarios co-occur, such as massive activity by companies, weak rules for managing, utilizing, and protecting resources, and extreme weather conditions. In conclusion, from these findings, we show that “access politics” and policy implications also play an essential role in increasing the resilience of socio-ecological systems in important peatland areas. © 2022 WITPress.

Empirical research on polycentric governance: Critical gaps and a framework for studying long-term change,"Polycentric governance (PG) describes governance systems characterized by multiple, interdependent centers of decision-making, offering an alternative to centralized governance models. PG is often assumed to be effective at helping policy actors address complex collective action problems, but burgeoning empirical literature on PG shows that it is not a panacea – PG is associated with both positive and negative governance outcomes. In this article, we ask: what do we know about why PG performs well in some cases but not in others? We start with a systematic review, synthesizing findings that provide empirical support for positive and negative features that are theorized to accompany PG. Our review reveals a critical gap in relation to our understanding of PG: the existing empirical literature largely fails to address change and evolution over time in PG systems, undermining our understanding of why PG works – or does not– across different contexts and over time. To fill this gap, we propose a “Context – Operations – Outcomes – Feedbacks” (COOF) framework that draws explicit attention to the interplay between context, operational arrangements, outcomes and identifies feedback pathways and adjustment mechanisms that drive dynamic change and evolution over time. © 2023 The Authors.

"Frameworks to envision equitable urban futures in a changing climate: A multi-level, multidisciplinary case study of New York City","Cities are at the forefront of climate change action and planning for futures that are concomitantly more resilient and equitable, making local goals imperative for global sustainability. Under the multiple challenges of changing climatic, ecological and socio-economic conditions, cities need the means to meet these goals. We know cities are and will continue to be points of concentrated and diverse populations, socioeconomic vulnerability, amplified exposure, transformed ecosystems and are responsible for the bulk of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, much is also unknown and intrinsically uncertain about urban futures: there is a range of potential plausible futures which have differing implications for both potential mitigation and adaptation actions. To better assess these plausible futures, the “global change” research community developed a framework including scenarios that are applicable for global and regional policy, entitled the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and scenarios exploring future emissions that will drive climate change, entitled Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Importantly, this global scale framework does not include specific city-level perspectives or data at the spatial scales necessary to address questions of local relevance. While the SSPs address many of the key population and socioeconomic drivers of climate change, they do not address important concerns that are particularly relevant to cities, such as racial justice, ecosystem change or migration. Nevertheless, city-level impacts will evolve, in part, as a function of the global scale change characterized by the SSPs, and in part based on demographic and social processes already underway. As such, applying a modification of this framework to cities has the potential to help limit local climate impacts, and create a more resilient, equitable city. To address these needs and respond to city and regional stakeholders, we propose a framework for science-based narratives and quantitative projections for cities and metropolitan areas, such as Greater New York City. In this paper, we review a wide-range of existing approaches to generate estimates of future populations and identify their vulnerabilities to climate-change hazards, ranging from subnational population projections or the spatially-explicit allocation of populations linked to SSPs for the US and selected cities, city-specific population forecasting without climate considerations, and participatory approaches to future scenario development and fine-scale, within-city land use change models. By showcasing the strengths and limitations of various approaches and modeling efforts, their spatial and temporal scales, and thematic breadth, we propose a novel framework that leverages state-of-the art quantitative approaches and couples it with stakeholder engagement that can help cities plan equitably under uncertainty.

On the definition and prioritization of strategies and actions to minimize greenhouse gas emissions in cities: An actor-oriented approach,"Cities as hotspots of human economic activity and infrastructures provide some of the best opportunities for decarbonizing sectors essential for limiting the global warming to 1.5, such as buildings and transport. For this reason, regulators and researchers have widely recognized the necessity to put cities, as an important object of assessment, and city authorities, as an important actor group, at the core of climate mitigation efforts. In their pursuit of a low-emission future, however, cities are confronted with a number of theoretical and practical questions regarding allocation and accounting of city-related greenhouse gas (GHG), target setting and subsequent planning for mitigation. A wide literature is currently focused on the first two. However, to achieve ambitious climate targets, research should urgently focus more on how to reap all available urban mitigation actions and encourage rapid and radical changes. Identifying and prioritising mitigation strategies and actions to achieve the targets, as well as putting them together into a coherent plan with a clear vision of the future, are critical steps in actionable and effective climate action planning. As a first contribution in this direction, this paper provides recommendations for research and practice to support a more integrated and conscious definition and prioritization of actions by municipal stakeholders, based on: (1) the specific context of each city type as a determinant of what actions may work, (2) the executive power of city authority to act as the main actor and (3) the multiple benefits and/or trade-offs accruing from each local climate action. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",About Sufficiency
"Use of Climate Change Projections for Resilience Planning in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","In this study we use three different methodologies to document and compare temperature and precipitation projections for the city of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) over the 21st century. It aims to explore in what way the differences and similarities of those methodologies and their outcomes support the incorporation of climate risks in urban planning and improve effective urban climate change governance. We compared the projections for RJ from the Eta Regional Climate Model from the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research nested in two Hadley Center Global Climate Models (GCMs) (Eta-HadCM3 method and Eta-HadGEM2-ES method) and 33 GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 multi-model dataset (Urban Climate Change Research Network - UCCRN method). The three methods showed increasing temperatures for RJ at the end of the century. Precipitation projections span a 13% decrease to a 12% increase when using the UCCRN method or are reduced between 0.4 and 0.5%, when using the Eta-HadGEM2-ES method. However, the middle range of the projections from UCCRN and Eta-HadGEM2-ES is similar. The three methods project an increase of warm days and nights and a decrease of cold days and nights. Nevertheless, although the directions of change are the same applying the three methods, the magnitude differs when considering warm and cold nights. Hence, city stakeholders are better informed when we apply different projection methods as it gives them the opportunity to consider the level of risk they are willing to bear in the future. We observed that defining climate change projections on the city scale based on clear communication and an interactive process between scientists and stakeholders can be used to inform citywide adaptation strategies and sector-specific uses, as well as promote urban climate risk governance.

A multilevel analysis of the drivers of household water consumption in a semi-arid region,"Communities across the Western United States face the growing challenge of managing water resources in the face of rapid population growth and climate change. There are two contrasting approaches to understanding and managing residential water demand in this context. Many scientists and water managers see water use as a reflection of individual attitudes and decisions where people are assumed to have the agency to act independently of structural constraints. Conversely, other scientists and policymakers focus on the importance of the built environment and the broader social, economic, and policy contexts within which households make water decisions. Using multilevel models, we compared attitudinal, demographic, and structural drivers of indoor and outdoor residential water use for a sample of households in Northern Utah. We estimated multilevel mixed-effect Poisson models with robust standard errors using matched household survey data with metered residential water use records. Outdoor water use had a substantially greater amount of neighborhood-level variation than indoor water use. Structural factors generally eclipsed individual agency in our analysis. While indoor use was most strongly predicted by household size, tenure status, and length of residence, outdoor water use was most associated with the built environment (lot size and the presence of vegetable gardens and underground sprinklers), socioeconomic status (household income, rental status), and residents' sensitivity to lawn watering norms. Higher water prices were associated with lower water use, with lower-income households being more responsive to prices than higher-income households. Our findings have important implications for water managers and policymakers. © 2020",About Sufficiency
Mismatches between ecosystem services supply and demand in urban areas: A quantitative assessment in five European cities,"Assessing mismatches between ecosystem service (ES) supply and demand can provide relevant insights for enhancing human well-being in urban areas. This paper provides a novel methodological approach to assess regulating ES mismatches on the basis of environmental quality standards and policy goals. Environmental quality standards (EQS) indicate the relationship between environmental quality and human well-being. Thus, they can be used as a common minimum threshold value to determine whether the difference between ES supply and demand is problematic for human well-being. The methodological approach includes three main steps: (1) selection of EQS, (2) definition and quantification of ES supply and demand indicators, and (3) identification and assessment of ES mismatches on the basis of EQS considering certain additional criteria. While ES supply indicators estimate the flow of an ES actually used or delivered, ES demand indicators express the amount of regulation needed in relation to the standard. The approach is applied to a case study consisting of five European cities: Barcelona, Berlin, Stockholm, Rotterdam and Salzburg, considering three regulating ES which are relevant in urban areas: air purification, global climate regulation and urban temperature regulation. The results show that levels of ES supply and demand are highly heterogeneous across the five studied cities and across the EQS considered. The assessment shows that ES supply contributes very moderately in relation to the compliance with the EQS in most part of the identified mismatches. Therefore, this research suggests that regulating ES supplied by urban green infrastructure are expected to play only a minor or complementary role to other urban policies intended to abate air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions at the city scale. The approach has revealed to be appropriate for the regulating ES air purification and global climate regulation, for which well-established standards or targets are available at the city level. Yet, its applicability to the ES urban temperature regulation has proved more problematic due to scale and user dependent constraints. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
"Urban governance, sustainability and environmental movements: Post-democracy in French and British cities","Drawing on an empirical study of environmental policies in Manchester (UK) and Saint-Etienne (France), this article attempts to provide a periodization of the evolution of the management of urban environmental issues. The periodization traces the shift in discourse from a focus on 'local environment' to 'sustainable urban development'. Three main sequences are identified corresponding to three different ways of tackling environmental issues covering a period from the late 1970s up to the present. The aim of this article is twofold. First, it will use environmental policies as a tool to understand the transformations of urban governance, and in particular the transformations of the actors involved in policy-making. Second, it will show how sustainable development policies are used by local elites to neutralize urban conflicts by excluding environmental grassroots movements from the management of environmental issues. Finally, the article will discuss how this marginalization should be considered as a sign of the emergence of a post-democratic era. © The Author(s) 2011.",About Sufficiency
Building equity into public park and recreation service investment: A review of public agency approaches,"In recent decades, academic and professional research has increased understanding of the importance of city and landscape planners engaging with social and environmental justice issues, including contemporary inequities inherent in the planning, distribution, use, and access of public green and open spaces. However, there is a gap between this research centering equity and the planning, development, and implementation rate demonstrated by public agencies. In this article, we examine examples of emerging practice in the public park and recreation sector to understand the strategies and approaches public agencies are taking to provide equitable park and recreation systems. Our research identifies and analyzes 17 examples of North American public park and open space management agencies using equity-based planning frameworks to prioritize park investment and resource distribution. Equity-focused resource analysis is distinct because while it assesses budget and project-based funding distributions, it further incorporates assessments of historical allocations to understand better areas of under-investment and the evolving needs of different communities. As economic inequities become more pronounced, local governments, and other public institutions providing services to populations, are important in helping communities navigate changes. Our findings support the ongoing advancement of equity-driven planning and implementation for public park and recreation agencies by providing practical information on existing approaches to redress the impact of unfair patterns of under-investment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Sustainability Science: Managing Risk and Resilience for Sustainable Development,"Continues to fill gaps between the descriptive, conceptual, and transformative sustainability science Sustainability is increasingly important across functional sectors and scientific disciplines.

Sustainability assessment of urban communities through rating systems,"This paper focuses on the sustainability assessment of urban communities through multi-criterion rating systems. Recent interpretations of the concepts of sustainability, assessment and community are discussed before reviewing existing assessment systems. In particular, the systems BREEAM for Communities, LEED for Neighbourhood Development and CASBEE for Urban Development are presented and compared. Each one of these systems bases the assessment on the summation of rates for different criteria often similar to those considered in sustainability assessments of buildings. The comparison shows that existing systems often accept a weak sustainability where natural resources may be subsidized by other priorities. Missing assessment criteria are proposed mainly within the social and economic dimensions of sustainability. This paper also shows that the dynamicity of a community suggests considering the sustainability assessment systems as tools to monitor the evolution of communities. Finally, it shows that an increase in citizen engagement in the selection of assessment criteria is necessary to share priorities and customize sustainability goals for each community. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",About Sufficiency
On Cherishing a Beautiful Place: Epistemic Politics and Historic Heritage in a Nordic Controversy,"Urban-development controversies usually involve complicated struggles over knowledge. One way to analyse them is the framework of epistemic injustice – the feeling of one’s knowledge not being acted upon – often experienced by vulnerable groups. The present case shows that middle-class citizens are also affected as the controversy pits different understandings of ‘green’ against each other. Even activists in well-resourced positions protesting the development of a beautiful island, sense the weakness of official, modern types of evidence. They are, however, willing to host activist-artistic experiments that highlight various historical legacies of modern life, simultaneously challenging conventional ways of knowing and definitions of what is environmental. The paper interprets this form of activism as making the island itself appear as a crystallisation of harmful processes, diffused in time and space and involving diverse types of actors. Difficult to capture with modern ways of knowing, these processes are nevertheless embedded in the natural and cultural heritage accumulated over time in urban landscapes. © 2023 The White Horse Press.",About Sufficiency
Transitioning from Smart Cities to Smarter Cities: The Future Potential of ICT of Pervasive Computing for Advancing Environmental Sustainability,"Smart cities are evolving and ever changing, i.e., morphing into new faces. This is being fueled by the rapid computerization and urbanization of the world, driven by the evolvement of ICT visions of various forms of pervasive computing into deployable and achievable computing paradigms, as well as by the perceived role of advanced ICT in overcoming the challenge of urbanization. Indeed, visions of noteworthy advances in computing and ICT bring with them wide-ranging common visions on how cities as social fabrics will evolve in the future along with the immense opportunities and potential threats such future will bring. However, there are several critical issues that remain largely ignored concerning smarter cities. In particular, smarter (and smart) cities involve several problems—when it comes to their development and implementation as to their concrete contribution to and explicit incorporation of the fundamental goal of environmentally sustainable development. They moreover pose many risks to environmental sustainability due to the ubiquity of computing and the massive use of ICT throughout all urban domains. Also, relatively little or no attention has been given to smarter cities as future visions of smart cities in terms of the potential of ICT of various forms of pervasive computing to respond to the challenge of environmental sustainability. In addition, it is important not to conceive of smarter cities as “isolated islands”, like some urban scholars might presume. Instead, the interplay between such cities and other scales, as well as the links to political and regulatory processes on a macro level have to be recognized. The purpose of this chapter is manifold. First, it reviews the key deficiencies, misunderstandings, fallacies, and challenges associated with smart and smarter cities with respect to environmental sustainability. Second, it identifies the significant risks that smarter cities pose to environmental sustainability, which are expected to escalate during the transition of smart cities to smarter cities. Third, it substantiates the potential that smarter cities hold in accelerating and advancing environmental sustainability on the basis of ICT of various forms of pervasive computing. The underlying assumption is that smarter cities are still at the early stage of their development and thus could, if planned strategically, do a lot more in this regard, including the mitigation of environmental risks posed by ICT itself, if linked to the goal of environmentally sustainable development. Fourth, this chapter endeavors to reflect on what it means for smart cities to move behind their foundational visions as they transition to smarter cities and embrace environmental sustainability as an important trend increasingly gaining prominence in urban development as a result of the unprecedented urbanization of the world. Fifth, this chapter probes both the ways in which the transition of smart cities to smarter cities (with environmental sustainability in mind) can be managed or governed at the macro level as well as the role of politics and policy in the creation and evolution of smarter cities. This entails drawing on different theoretical perspectives from socio-technical studies, innovation studies, and discursive studies, most notably transition governance; technological and national innovation systems; and the link between political practice and the emergence, insertion, and functioning of new discourses. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",About Sufficiency
Resilience in urban drainage risk management systems,"Resilience is defined here considering the behaviour of an urban drainage risk management (UDRM) system in terms of its response and recovery under different rainfall events focusing on institutional and social aspects. A set of indicators is defined to operationalise definition for UDRM systems. To quantify the indicators, a hierarchical fuzzy system is developed to consider uncertainties in the UDRM system’s social and institutional parameters and also to prevent the curse of dimensionality. The proposed scheme is tested on a real case study in Tehran in order to evaluate the effectiveness of some urban drainage plans to improve the current urban drainage system in terms of resilience. The results show that the presented indicators may be used as decision making criteria to help urban authorities select urban drainage options based on the behaviour of the UDRM system under different rainfall events. © 2016, Thomas Telford Services Ltd.

THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT PARADIGM AND SOCIAL VALUE OF ENERGY,"Marginalization of communities is a global, multidimensional challenge with social, ecological, and economic implications for sustainable futures. Energy systems may be an active component in the creation and perpetuation of marginalization, as well as in its disruption. Therefore, while one of the key goals of undertaking deliberate transitions of energy systems lies in rapidly cutting emissions for planetary well-being, an equally critical and inseparable goal is to transform the human well-being landscape - that is, to accelerate human development in historically marginalized communities. This chapter explores facets of human development including equitable growth, agency, and identity, socioeconomic opportunity and justice, safeguards for vulnerabilities to climate change and exclusion, and so on, in marginalized communities undergoing localized energy transitions. Employing the social value of energy framework for a systemic analysis of case studies from Bolivia, Nepal, and Bangladesh, illustrations of positive shifts, missed opportunities, and future pathways of the intertwined energy and human development transitions are discussed. Three critical aspects emerge for the pursuit of equitable, just, and sustainable energy transitions for human development in marginalized communities: identifying social purpose of designing energy systems, incorporating ethics and sociocultural values in energy decisions, and inclusion of due process and legitimate actors in energy governance. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Kathleen M.

Challenges of implementing à la mode transport projects: Case studies of bus rapid transit and cable cars in Colombia,"Politicians, consultants, and researchers often look at successful transport and urban transformation projects in cities in developing countries and assume that these may be an appropriate solution for similar cities. In reality, customizing such projects for a city-specific context is a difficult challenge that does not always end well, for example, because of poor technical and financial capacity of transport institutions, scarce information on travel demand behavior during the planning stage, private companies operating routes with a certain degree of informality, and poor political commitment. The authors reviewed the experience of implementing bus rapiti transit systems in five cities in Colombia that followed the steps of the successful Transmilenio in Bogotá. Most projects had cost overruns and lower demand and therefore performed worse than expected in ex-post assessments. Competition from traditional and private transport and institutional capacity at the local level were key problems to be addressed. The authors also reviewed the experience or cable cars, the new à la mode project, which was promoted in a number of developing cities such as Cali and Soacha after the success of the Metrocable in Medellín. Cable cars could contribute to equity in cities, but these contributions would be extremely limited if the project did not inject the urban environment with complementary investments. Transferring successful transportation projects to new areas or to other cities is an important, difficult challenge. Key success factors must be considered to implement transport solutions successfully in different contexts.",About Sufficiency
How smart and sustainable are the cities in Turkiye? - National policies and the enthusiasm level of the local governments,"In the past decade, the importance of the smart city applications has gained popularity by the city governments to use their resources in an efficient and effective way, present better services and quality of life for their residents, make their cities more competitive, provide better disaster management. As the world has experienced crisis such as energy and grain in the recent past due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war between Russia and Ukraine, the management of the resources has become more important for the countries and local governments, as well. In this study national government plans of Turkiye, such as Eleventh Development Plan and 2020–2023 National Strategy and Action Plan for Smart Cities, have been addressed as reference documents and the actions of some city governments, including the most populous city, Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, have been examined with the purpose of determining the level of smart city willingness. This study peruses the degree of enthusiasm of the local governments to become smart and maintain sustainable city services considering the main smart city characteristics. Based on the information gathered concerning the selected cities, it has been observed that the cities having populations quite lower than the great metropolitans such as Istanbul and Ankara are more enthusiastic and successful to provide services for their citizens that can be associated with the smart city concept. © 2024 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Power for development: A review of distributed generation projects in the developing world,"The paradigm for providing affordable electricity for the world's poor-power for development-has begun to change. Historically, centralized governments built large consolidated power plants and distribution and transmission lines with the ultimate goal of providing electricity to all of their citizens. It has become increasingly common in recent decades, however, for donors, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), firms, and communities to collaborate with governments to develop small-scale localized energy systems known as distributed generation (DG) either as complements or alternatives to centralized operations. DG programs have been implemented around the world but with a mixed record of success. Based on an analysis of the existing case study literature, we examine DG program goals and outcomes, identifying major factors that affect these outcomes, including appropriately chosen technology, adequate financing and payment arrangements, ongoing end users' involvement, and supportive national policies. We highlight the importance of institutions for collaborative governance in the pursuit of these factors. © Copyright ©2012 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
"Integrated ecological, economic and social impact assessment of alternative flood control policies in the Netherlands","The main objective of this paper is to combine and integrate environmental, economic and social impact assessment procedures in order to support decision-making in the context of flood control policy in the Netherlands. The hydraulic, hydrological, ecological, economic and social effects of alternative flood control policies, such as land use change and floodplain restoration, are evaluated using a combination of advanced quantitative modelling techniques and qualitative expert judgement. The results from the ecological, economic and social impact assessment are evaluated in an integrated way through cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and multi-criteria analysis (MCA). As expected, these methods produce different outcomes. Although traditional flood control policy-building higher and stronger dikes-is a cost-effective option, investment in alternative flood control policy-land use changes and floodplain restoration-can be justified on the basis of both CBA and MCA when including the additional ecological and socio-economic benefits in the long run. The outcome of the MCA appears to be especially sensitive to the inclusion of the qualitative scores for the expected social impacts of land use change and floodplain restoration. An important research question remains how to assess, integrate and trade-off (1) significantly different types of impacts in a methodologically sound way in both cost-benefit and multi-criteria analysis, and (2) significantly different types and quality of available knowledge and information about these impacts. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Interpretation of sustainability as the social adaptation of resiliency,"The paper briefly overviews different types of diversity; not only ecological ones but also its various socio, economical as well as local, regional and global technological appearances, like the importance of retaining irreplaceable cultural diversity and the diverse ways of thinking and behaviour. The first part of the study analyses these different types of diversity which are preserved. The discussion of the mutual connections of the bio-cultural diversity is the content of the next section. Sustainable development is in great need of adequate competencies and expertise, both in the planning and implementation phase of promoting programmes and projects, including the long-term and complicated effects of them. The fundamental condition of sustainability - and therefore any plan which intends to produce a sustainable socio, economical, moreover ecological system (SES), is that it should express the need for resilient improvement of institutions, and, in particular, the suitable institutionalisation of the decision making process. The research and assessment methodology of this study has been the gathering of a broad spectrum of social, economical, technological and ecological publications on this topic, evaluation of the scientific literature and also the combination of their results. The end of the paper consists of conclusions and furthermore, suggestions for scientists, experts and politicians on how to apply a holistic, multidisciplinary approach and methodology both in proposal and decision making processes. © 2013 WIT Press.",About Sufficiency
Urban spatial dynamic modeling based on urban amenity data to inform smart city planning,"An ideal form of smart city planning would focus on the availability of urban amenities that can meet the basic needs of a resident's material life, civil connections, and humanistic spirit. Previous studies have concentrated on analyzing the spatial distribution of urban services, with less attention on their contribution as local urban amenities. In this study, we propose a spatial dynamic modeling approach based on urban amenities using social media data from Google Place API to provide locational information on potential resident interactions. We use a representative region in Europe (Stockholm County, SE) to simulate and project urban development in the region until 2050. Our circular conceptual framework of spatial information and feedback supports decision-makers in testing possible urban planning scenarios that align with the vision of a smart city. Simulation results reveal the interplay between human-land interactions on a specific spatial-temporal scale, and we analyze scenario outcomes in relation to commercial and residential land uses. Overall, our study provides a new perspective on human-social behavior-driven urban development, through a smart, spatial dynamic model as a planning support system that can enhance realism, and ultimately help realize planned development objectives in the region. © 2023 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Analysis of hotspots of urban eco-environmental problems: A case study of Shenzhen City,"Urban eco-environmental management is a key focus in the modernization of national governance systems and governance capacity. Advanced information technology should be used to identify ecological problems in urban areas accurately while enhancing the environmental management capacity to promote the sustainable development of cities. This study centers on statistical data from PM2.5 air monitoring stations in Shenzhen, China, and supplemental data, such as population distribution data from China Unicom's mobile phone signaling. Data cleaning and fusion are used to construct a spatial dataset of an eco-environmental problem: PM2.5 concentrations. The geostatistical analysis tool ArcGIS is used to identify the most suitable interpolation method for reflecting this eco-environmental problem based on multiple parameter adjustments and repeated testing. A hotspot distribution map of PM2.5 concentrations is generated, and correlation analysis is conducted on the population density and distribution patterns in these hotspot areas. This enables the quantitative analysis and exploration of the spatial characteristics and coupling relationships of PM2.5 concentrations. The results show a positive correlation between the PM2.5 concentration distribution and the points of interest, road network density, number of dead-end roads, and average building height in Shenzhen. No correlation is found between population and building densities and the PM2.5 concentration distribution, possibly due to the city's effective environmental management and pollution control measures. These findings help advance the development of precise, scientific, legally compliant pollution control strategies and decision-making processes. Furthermore, they provide technical support for urban eco-environmental planning, management, and sustainable development. © 2025 Shandong Normal University",About Sufficiency
Innovative approaches to green digital twin technologies of sustainable smart cities using a novel hybrid decision-making system,"Digital twin technologies play a very important role in the provision of smart cities. However, it is not clear which innovative strategies should be implemented first on how to optimize digital twin technologies for sustainable smart cities. The main performance indicators should be identified to use the limited resources more efficiently and to generate more effective investment strategies. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to generate innovative approaches to green digital twin technologies of sustainable smart cities. To achieve this issue, first, important criteria of digital twin technologies for assessing sustainable smart cities are weighted via spherical fuzzy simple weight calculation (SIWEC). The second part includes ranking innovative alternatives for green digital twin technologies by considering spherical fuzzy simple additive weighting (SAW). The main contribution of this manuscript is to identify the most effective investment strategies for the improvements of digital twin technologies to reach smart cities by establishing a novel model. The preference of the SIWEC method in the criteria weighting process provides some advantages to the model. The most important feature of this method is that the direct importance of the criterion is taken into consideration in the questions asked to the experts. In this way, it is possible for the experts to give more sensitive answers. The findings indicate that smart grid integration (weight: 0.231) is determined as the most important criterion in the development of digital twin technologies for the provision of smart cities. Circular economy (weight: 0.230) is another variable that plays an important role in the provision of smart cities. On the other hand, decentralized energy system with microgrids is found as the most important alternative for this situation. Some critical actions should be taken to improve the smart grid effectiveness. In this scope, providing renewable energy incentives has a strong influence on the improvements of these projects. © 2025 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency
The role of communication in environmental awareness according to circular economy stakeholders,"In order to make the transition from a linear to a circular economy, unprecedented measures are required from all social actors. Communication plays a fundamental role in this transition. The use of social marketing as an alternative to traditional communication models can promote the paradigm shift in order to increase communicative effectiveness. Understanding the perception of circular economy drivers is crucial for communication efforts aimed at persuading citizens to change their habits. To this end, this study analyzes drivers' perceptions of communication processes aimed at environmental awareness and sensitization. Using grounded theory, a qualitative methodology, 44 interviews were conducted with four groups that are considered promoters of the circular economy: Public administration and private enterprises representatives, university professors and scientific personnel. The actors' discourse was analyzed and the results show how they perceive their involvement in the transition process, the level of public awareness and the awareness-raising measures. The conclusion is: a) communication plays a fundamental role in fostering cooperation between all actors involved in the transition to a circular economy; b) communication strategies targeting society should be segmented by population groups, taking into account aspects such as area, age and level of awareness. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Participative future scenarios for integrated coastal zone management,"Coastal zones are rapidly changing all around the world due to strong human pressures such as urban sprawl, agriculture intensification, infrastructure expansion and industrial growth. In addition, climate change might become an important factor in the years to come, and its associated effects might affect coastal areas. To cope with this situation the need to adopt an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) approach has been internationally recognised during the last decades. Nonetheless to be able to plan and manage coastal areas in the long-term while facing all the challenges that lie ahead, it is necessary to develop new tools that not only put into practice the ICZM principles but also incorporate and deal with the uncertainties that surround the future. In this paper, we present Participative Future Scenarios (PFS) as a tool to support decision-making in coastal areas under the ICZM principles. PFS allow exploring how coastal areas could develop in the future, using an integrative approach that combines quantitative and qualitative methods, taking into consideration coastal hazards and climate change, as well as human interaction, as the process is based on participatory techniques involving local stakeholders. The process carried out to implement PFS at the local scale has been pilot-tested in the Andalusian coastal municipality of Ayamonte, South Western Spain. Four well-differentiated scenarios showing alternative and plausible futures for the study site for the year 2050 were obtained. The result of this pioneer exercise points out that PFS are a powerful and ground-breaking tool for ICZM with a double potential: i) The generation of PFS is a valuable exercise per se as it provides an opportunity to promote participation, understand public's different opinions, facilitate communication between stakeholders and increase public awareness about coastal future problems (e.g. coastal hazards). ii) PFS can be-and should be-used as part of the decision making process for coastal planning, allowing policies to be designed in a more robust manner, accounting for critical uncertainties-as diverse as economic fluctuations or climate change- and helping to select the path to the most desirable future. Additionally, the PFS process proposed in this paper is a transferable technique that can be easily replicated in other coastal areas. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.",About Sufficiency
Hybridizing Sustainability Metric Applications with Local Stakeholder Inputs: A life cycle assessment with a co-design demonstration,"Sustainability standards have been criticized as being complex and overlapping, with unclear metrics and messy timelines—all of which have led to sustainability shortfalls. As part of the special issue on addressing sustainability metric shortcomings, we develop a hybridizing protocol for sustainability standards that elicits community stakeholder ideological predispositions, preferences, ratings, and heuristics and injects them into a prioritized, vetted metric in order to reduce immediate and longer-range life cycle impacts of corporate operations in the local ecosystem. We demonstrate our method using a quasi-field experiment, conducted by expert intermediary facilitators, in which community members co-design oil sands wetland reclamation and their choices are integrated into life cycle assessments (LCAs) of wetland designs and remediation products. Hybridizing LCA with local co-design not only generates an effective wetland-material choice, but reduces life cycle impacts and increases the likelihood of community acceptance. © The Author(s) 2025.",About Sufficiency
How Are Medium-Sized Cities Implementing Their Smart City Governance? Experiences from the Emilia-Romagna Region,"Within the smart city debate, this paper aims to reflect on whether and how medium-sized Italian cities are organizing their smart transition technically as well as administratively. The smart city concept was developed in the 1990s when major European cities began a smart transition through widespread urban regeneration projects and the introduction of advanced technologies applied not only to the physical city but also to governance, policymaking, and communication, involving multiple sectors of city administrations. In the last decade, medium-sized cities have also started this transition process, although with lower emphasis than metropolitan cities. In most medium-sized Italian cities, this transition, in accordance with national and regional guidelines, has sometimes led to competencies reorganization within local governments. Within this framework, the paper examines the tools with which medium-sized Italian cities’ administrations address the smart transformation in their territories, comparing a sample of 10 cities in Emilia-Romagna and considering policymaking, governance structure, past and current projects, and communication transparency. The expected result is therefore a systematic review of experiences to reconstruct a complex picture of the political and administrative choices that have led to the implementation or setting in motion of smart transformation processes to draw some useful lessons. © 2022 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Designing stakeholder learning dialogues for effective global governance,"A growing scholarship on multistakeholder learning dialogues suggests the importance of closely managing learning processes to help stakeholders anticipate which policies are likely to be effective. Much less work has focused on how to manage effective transnational multistakeholder learning dialogues, many of which aim to help address critical global environmental and social problems such as climate change or biodiversity loss. They face three central challenges. First, they rarely shape policies and behaviors directly, but work to ‘nudge’ or ‘tip the scales’ in domestic settings. Second, they run the risk of generating ‘compromise’ approaches incapable of ameliorating the original problem definition for which the dialogue was created. Third, they run the risk of being overly influenced, or captured, by powerful interests whose rationale for participating is to shift problem definitions or narrow instrument choices to those innocuous to their organizational or individual interests. Drawing on policy learning scholarship, we identify a six-stage learning process for anticipating effectiveness designed to minimize these risks while simultaneously fostering innovative approaches for meaningful and longlasting problem solving: Problem definition assessments; Problem framing; Developing coalition membership; Causal framework development; Scoping exercises; Knowledge institutionalization. We also identify six management techniques within each process for engaging transnational dialogues around problem solving. We show that doing so almost always requires anticipating multiple-step causal pathways through which influence of transnational and/or international actors and institutions might occur. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Playing in the park to promote environmental education for children,"The social, environmental, and technological transformations that cities are experiencing have limi-ted children's opportunities to interact with nature and care for the environment. This study analyzed the relationship between pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors with children's level of contact with nature and their visits to urban green spaces designed for play. A mixed methodology was used that involved individual interviews, didactic activities and drawings on specific topics by children from elementary schools. The results of the study highlighted a significant relationship between pro-environmental attitudes and children's visits to parks. However, limitations were identified in the ex-ploration of pro-environment behaviors. The authors concluded that parks can be considered out-door play spaces and children have the potential to develop pro-environmental attitudes. © 2024 Revista Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales.

What does it take to renature cities? An expert-based analysis of barriers and strategies for the implementation of nature-based solutions,"This paper uses an expert-based methodology to survey the barriers and strategies related to the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS). The ambition of the paper is to offer a bird's eye overview of the difficulties encountered by NBS deployment and ways to overcome them. With a wide participation of 80 experts from COST Action Circular City, we identify barriers specific to 35 pre-defined NBS of the following four categories: Vertical Greening Systems and Green Roofs; Food and Biomass Production; Rainwater Management; and Remediation, Treatment, and Recovery. The research sheds light on how a major interdisciplinary – yet predominantly technically-oriented - community of scientists and practitioners views this important topic. Overall, the most relevant barriers are related to technological complexity, lack of skilled staff and training programs and the lack of awareness that NBS is an option. Our results highlight concerns related to post implementation issues, especially operation and maintenance, which subsequently affect social acceptance. The paper identifies a “chain” effect across barriers, meaning that one barrier can affect the existence or the relevance of other barriers. In terms of strategies, most of them target governance, information, and education aspects, despite the predominantly technical expertise of the participants. The study innovates with respect to state-of-the-art research by showing a fine-grained connection between barriers, strategies and individual NBS and categories, a level of detail which is not encountered in any other study to date. © 2024 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Ideas for development,"Our world seems entangled in systems increasingly dominated by power, greed, ignorance, self-deception and denial, with spiralling inequity and injustice. Against a backdrop of climate change, failing ecosystems, poverty, crushing debt and corporate exploitation, the future of our world looks dire and the solutions almost too monumental to consider. Yet all is not lost. Robert Chambers, one of the 'glass is half full' optimists of international development, suggests that the problems can be solved and everyone has the power at a personal level to take action, develop solutions and remake our world as it can and should be. Chambers peels apart and analyses aspects of development that have been neglected or misunderstood. In each chapter, he presents an earlier writing which he then reviews and reflects upon in a contemporary light before harvesting a wealth of powerful conclusions and practical implications for the future. The book draws on experiences from Africa, Asia and elsewhere, covering topics and concepts as wide and varied as irreversibility, continuity and commitment; administrative capacity as a scarce resource; procedures and principles; participation in the past, present and future; scaling up; behaviour and attitudes; responsible wellbeing; and concepts for development in the 21st century. © Institute of Development Studies, 2005.

Do structural transformation and urbanization assist in enhancing sustainable energy technologies innovations? Evidence from ASEAN countries,"The need for a carbon-free ecosystem is a quest that cannot be answered without the engagement, participation, commitment, and deployment of sophisticated countermeasure strategies by national and international governing bodies and institutions. Therefore, the current study explores the context of ASEAN countries because of their significance in the global economy, whereas the role of structural transformation, urbanization, and renewable energy consumption was explored in determining the possible effects of sustainable energy technologies innovations from 1995 to 2020. Using Methods of Moments Quantile Regression, the current study's findings show that structural transformation, urbanization, and renewable energy consumption significantly derive sustainable energy technology innovations. However, the marginal contribution towards innovation-driven technologies is substantially varied at lower and higher quantiles. Similar findings are echoed in alternative estimators and offer substantial policy implications for driving green innovation. © 2023",About Sufficiency
"Spatial correlation and interaction effect intensity between territorial spatial ecological quality and new urbanization level in Nanchang metropolitan area, China","While promoting the rapid development of social economy, new urbanization has brought great pressure to the ecological environment. It is of great significance to explore the interaction mechanism between ecological environment and new urbanization for the sustainable development of metropolitan area. The metropolitan area of Nanchang in China was taken as the research area, and based on remote sensing, meteorological and social statistics data, and considering the functions, structures and effects of urban, agricultural and ecological spaces as well as the realistic demands of new urbanization construction, this research constructed “natural foundation-structure-coerce-benefit” (NSCB) and “land use-economic-population-infrastructure-public service” (LEPIP) comprehensive assessment models to quantitatively analyze the spatial and temporal heterogeneity, spatial correlation and interaction strength of ecological quality and new urbanization level in the study area from mesoscopic and microscopic perspectives by using spatial analysis software such as ENVI, ArcGIS, Fragstats, Geoda and Geodetector. The results showed that the ecological environment quality and urbanization level of the land space in the study area were improved from 2005 to 2018, and the overall gap within the region was gradually reduced. The spatial relationship between land use efficiency and ecological quality was “synergistic-trade-off-synergistic”. The economic development level and ecological quality showed a gradually enhanced synergistic relationship, and the population urbanization, infrastructure construction and ecological quality showed an “N” type synergistic relationship. The results of interaction intensity showed that the combined effects of population urbanization, public service guarantee, land use efficiency and economic development had a great impact on the spatial heterogeneity of territorial ecological quality in the study area. Finally, we suggest that the urbanization construction in the study area should strengthen the industrial agglomeration effect, improve the efficiency of land output, build a good urban ecological network, and promote the coordinated and healthy development of natural resources and urban construction. The results of this study can provide scientific basis for the precise formulation of spatial planning, ecological restoration and spatial collaborative development strategies in the study area, and provide reference experience for the coordinated development of natural environment and social economy in other metropolitan areas and urban agglomerations. © 2023",About Sufficiency
Investigating intentions and barriers in adopting decentralized home energy management systems: A justice dimension of demand flexibility,"The integration of a decentralized home energy management system (HEMS) marks a pivotal advancement in the pursuit of enhanced energy efficiency and sustainability within modern households. While numerous studies focus on developing efficient and innovative programs from technical perspectives, the willingness of individuals to adopt these systems is equally crucial for achieving widespread adoption and ultimately creating a more energy-efficient society. Based on a large-scale online survey with 1,196 participants in California in 2021, we investigated the intentions related to the adoption of decentralized HEMS, particularly considering demand flexibility encompassing both air-conditioning (AC) and electric vehicles (EV) control, specifically focusing on socio-demographic disparities. Our analysis found greater openness for allowing HEMS to control AC usage compared to scheduling EV charging, possibly due to immediate comfort needs or trust in AC predictability. Low-income households showed less flexibility in adjusting both AC and EVs, while high-income households were less likely to decrease EV charging. Furthermore, homeowners exhibited greater flexibility compared to renters. Disparities between different racial backgrounds in EV charging time-shifting were more pronounced than in AC aspects. Our findings indicated that vulnerable populations may lack the flexibility and resources necessary to shift their energy consumption patterns effectively, potentially amplifying energy-related disparities and exacerbating their energy burden. Policy recommendations highlight the need for multifaceted approaches in addressing demand flexibility and energy management, especially with emerging technologies like EVs, to ensure equitable strategies for promoting sustainable energy practices across diverse communities. © 2024",About Sufficiency
A review of research on public transport priority based on CiteSpace,"The prioritization of public transit as an essential means of promoting sustainable urban development has a significant role in improving the quality of public transportation services, reducing traffic congestion, and enhancing air quality.

Conflicts at the Crossroads: Unpacking Land-Use Challenges in the Greater Bay Area with the “Production–Living–Ecological” Perspective,"Under the influence of factors such as extreme weather and accelerated urbanization, China has witnessed a sharp escalation in conflicts between various land-use functions, leading to a significant rise in tensions between people and land. The coordination of production, living, and ecological functions is particularly important for strengthening ecological civilization and achieving regional high-quality development. The concept of “Production–Living–Ecological” (PLE) Spaces, proposed as part of China’s ecological civilization initiative, refers to a spatial framework that integrates production spaces (land for agriculture, industry, and commerce), living spaces (land for housing, consumption, and public services), and ecological spaces (land supporting ecosystem regulation and biodiversity). Based on this perspective, this paper investigates the current situation and potential of land-use function conflicts in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area in 2020. Utilizing the multi-criteria evaluation analysis method, the study develops a land-use function-evaluation model. Furthermore, the paper establishes a diagnostic model for the intensity of land-use function conflicts based on the different permutations and combinations of land unit function intensities. The land-use function conflicts are categorized into ten types and four stages. The main findings are as follows: (1) In 2020, the overall production, living, and ecological functions of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao Greater Bay Area were at high, medium-high, and low levels, respectively. The land in the stable and controllable stage, the largely controllable stage, the largely out-of-control stage, and the severely out-of-control stage accounted for 39.22%, 28.73%, 25.41%, and 6.64%. The focal points of the intensity of land-use function conflicts were mainly located in Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen, and Dongguan. (2) The study area was exposed to varying degrees of risk from land-use function conflicts, and the area proportion of low conflict potential area, with the proportions of low, general, higher, and high-conflict-potential areas being 47.88%, 23.43%, 22.14%, and 6.54%, respectively. (3) The primary hotspots of conflict potential were concentrated in Dongguan City and the administrative border areas of “Foshan–Zhaoqing”, “Foshan–Jiangmen”, and “Guangzhou–Zhongshan”. © 2025 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Operationalizing capabilities in a segmented society: The role of institutions,"Introduction: The world is characterized by the co-existence of excessive opulence and considerable destitution. Some groups have had success in accessing and taking advantage of the opportunities offered by modern economic growth; others have been left behind. It is a well-known fact that societies throughout time have always had this ‘two-tier’ structure of ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots.’ So, the question that arises is this: Is it possible to achieve equality among all groups and among all individuals? The answer depends in large part on the definition of ‘equality’ and the subsequent question, ‘equality of what?’ (Sen 1980). The one simple truism we accept and value is the heterogeneity of human beings. We all come into this world with different natural attributes as well as social and economic endowments – what we might call intrinsic initial conditions. It is the very differences among individuals that provide the incentives to change, adapt and innovate. However, we also need to ask ourselves whether we are willing to accept a world where individuals starve, die from the lack of drinking water, succumb to diseases which could have been treated with little cost, not have homes to live in or the ability for children to go to school and learn. Can we accept these as just manifestations of our intrinsic conditions or can some form of equality be established which at the same time does not destroy our unique values and attributes that make us all so different? © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",About Sufficiency
Can ‘poor’ cities breathe: Responses to climate change in low-income countries,"Cities, especially in the poor countries, are competing with one another to generate higher growth. Such competition makes everything including the environment subservient to ‘technology’. As a consequence, they are faced with extreme weather events and are therefore important in the context of responding to climate change. They are increasingly being recognised as having unique climate risks and specific vulnerabilities due to higher concentration of people and activities. Adaptation seems to be indispensable though mitigation still will help avoiding future impacts. Urban authorities in poor countries encounter specific realities, such as occupancy in low-lying, often flood-prone, coastal locations that lack adequate protection in addition to possible vector-borne infections. In this backdrop, this paper analyzes specific factors likely to shape climate change responses of urban authorities in poorer countries who have to find ways to tackle impacts of climate change in tune to their specific institutional and social contexts and compulsions. © 2019",About Sufficiency
Cities and climate change,"As the hubs of economic activity, cities drive the vast majority of the world's energy use and are major contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. Because they are home to major infrastructure and highly concentrated populations, cities are also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms. At the same time, better urban planning and policies can reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions and improve the resilience of urban infrastructure to climate change, thus shaping future trends. This book shows how city and metropolitan regional governments working in tandem with national governments can change the way we think about responding to climate change. The chapters analyse: trends in urbanisation, economic growth, energy use and climate change; the economic benefits of climate action; the role of urban policies in reducing energy demand, improving resilience to climate change and complementing global climate policies; frameworks for multilevel governance of climate change including engagement with relevant stakeholders; and the contribution of cities to ""green growth"", including the ""greening"" of fiscal policies, innovation and jobs. The book also explores policy tools and best practices from both OECD and some non-member countries. Cities and Climate Change reveals the importance of addressing climate change across all levels of government. Local involvement through ""climate-conscious"" urban planning and management can help achieve national climate goals and minimise tradeoffs between environmental and economic priorities at local levels. The book will be relevant to policy makers, researchers, and others with an interest in learning more about urbanisation and climate change policy. © OECD 2010.",About Sufficiency
Growth machines and carbon emissions: A county-level analysis of how U.S. place-making contributes to global climate change,"Purpose - To combine insights from urban and environmental sociology to examine local drivers of carbon emissions in the United States, with particular focus on demographic, economic, and consumptive dynamics. Design/methodology/approach - Apply spatial regression analysis to a novel county-level data set to test hypotheses about how different conditions and activities relate independently and positively to total carbon emissions at the local level. Findings - Results provide strong support for theoretically derived hypotheses, even after controlling for other factors, including spatial autocorrelation. The implication is that within a social system that treats land as a commodity, efforts to increase the exchange value of this commodity tend to drive up local carbon emissions, thereby contributing to global climate change. Originality/value - Complements previous sociological work on greenhouse gas emissions at the national level. Shows how local processes in general and urbanization in particular contribute to global climate change at and from the local areas where they occur.

Resilience Practices Contribution Enabling European Landscape Policy Innovation and Implementation,"The paper is rooted in the results of the Resilience Practices Observatory (RPO) project, which engaged more than one hundred community-led practices to improve local resilience capacities and about fifty applied research and institutional-led initiatives. The article in retracing the complex and articulated RPO research-action project aims to stimulate the disciplinary debate on the contribution and role of resilience practices in a renewed landscape planning framework process. In particular, the paper focuses on the resilience practices acting on ecological landscape enhancement, assuming nature-based solutions as an umbrella concept under numerous approaches, models, and theoretical frameworks supporting the integration of ecological values in the territorial and urban transformation towards their conservation and improvement. The selected cases are placed in the Milano metropolitan area, aiming to safeguard, improve, and valorize urban and periurban landscapes. The cases are used to explore three emerging phenomena: (1) the alliances and the role of community in orienting landscape planning; (2) the role of practices in solution co-design and planning implementation; (3) the role of community in micro-intervention for urban biodiversity and landscape functionality. The final section emphasizes the potential role of community-led initiatives in implementing the NBS European policy and landscape planning guidelines. In the meantime, final remarks underline perspectives in overcoming the existing criticalities towards renovated and adaptive governance process, enabling a more collaborative arena supporting the engagement of differentiated actors along the whole process, from decision making to the implementation and management of landscape planning. © 2023 by the author.",About Sufficiency

Our analysis suggests that sustainability integration into RFPs is currently superficial with limited integration into the evaluation process. We also found that the integration of sustainability was narrow with significant gaps in the breadth of environmental and social impact areas that were considered. As such, we provide insights and recommendations that will enable governments to accelerate the advancement of sustainability through the use of procurement. © 2020 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Democratizing society and food systems: Or how do we transform modern structures of power?,"The evolution of societies and food systems across the grand transitions is traced to show how nature and culture have been transformed along with the basic structures of power, politics, and governance. A central, but neglected, element has been the synergy between the creation of industrial institutions and the exponential, but unsustainable growth of the built environment. The values, goals, and strategies needed to transform and diversify these structures - generally and in terms of food and agriculture - are discussed in terms of: 1) the need to diversify and decentralize the built environment as we move towards a post-fossil fuel society; and 2) the need to transform industrial institutions. To help develop more sustainable and regenerative institutions it is argued we will need to re-embed culture and society in nature; re-embed science, technology, and economics in society and nature; and re-embed governance and politics in society, something that requires a rethinking of representative democracy. Also, since the reforms needed to democratize society and to democratize food systems are parallel and reinforcing, it is crucial that each of us thinks through the linkages and the potential synergies and acts constructively in each realm. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",About Sufficiency
The dynamics of social capital and civic engagement in Asia,"The purpose of this volume is to highlight the impacts on civic engagement of social capital, and its various component parts (trust, norms, networks and associations), in diverse parts of Asia. Addressing the pressing need for improved governance within the spatial, political and cultural realities in the rapidly transforming landscapes of Asia, the contributors to the book bring together interdisciplinary work that focuses on the ways in which civic engagement can link with social capital building. The goal of this volume is to inspire policy that recognizes that a vibrant society with access to rich stores of positive social capital requires civil society, alternate civilities and the state. The result is a dialogue on the interplay of social capital and civic engagement in socio-political contexts quite different from those found in the West.

Policy for sustainable consumption – an assessment of Swedish municipalities,"Introduction: Municipalities have a key role to play in developing and implementing policy for sustainable consumption, yet the evidence on the extent of municipalities’ work in this area and the constraining and enabling factors they face in this endeavor is sparse. This study examines municipal policies for sustainable consumption and their implementation, using food consumption in Sweden as an example. Method: It combines data from a nationwide survey, policy document analysis, and a two-year in-depth investigation into two municipalities that serve as case studies. Results: Findings show that Swedish municipalities have several policies in place related to sustainable food consumption. They use multiple policy instruments to target specific areas of food consumption, and are positive about their current and potential impact in specific areas such as sustainable school meals and tackling food waste. However, municipalities face multiple challenges in delivering sustainable food consumption, including lack of resources and knowledge in some areas. If there is a lack of political support, it can also be a major inhibiting factor. The municipalities welcome national-level strategy, rules and regulations that are supportive of their goals. They rely on good data collection and strong networks and stakeholder relationships to enable their work. Discussion: Many of the latest recommendations for a comprehensive policy approach to sustainable food consumption are yet to be applied at the municipal level in Sweden. There was little evidence of the use of systems thinking and practices-based approaches for policy design for example. Likewise, strong visions and strategic approaches to food were also lacking. The least coercive, informative policy instruments remain most popular. However, this study did reveal several existing areas where there are strong policy foundations from which these approaches might be developed, such as innovative ways to engage different target groups and a suitable policy mix to deliver specific objectives. Tackling the identified constraints and expanding the enabling factors could further the work on sustainable food consumption at the municipal level in Sweden and provide insights for other countries and studies at the local level.

Reimagining cities as self-organising capital creating ecosystems,"Executives who lead cities face considerable challenges. Cities are complex ecosystems comprising myriad interacting systems, including information systems, which are vital for their operation and prosperity. Recognizing the value that information systems can offer, significant investments have been made to acquire these systems and make cities smarter or more intelligent. However, many smart city projects have failed to deliver on their promises due to a lack of clarity regarding their overall goals. Smarter or more intelligent towards what end? This article provides a systems-inspired approach to urban planning based on the premise that a city is a self-organising, capital-creating ecosystem composed of a city's administration and the many organizations within its domain. As the city's keystone entity, the administration's role is to create capital that enhances the capital productivity of other ecosystem members and nourishes innovators to boost capital creativity. A capital improvement budgeting framework can specify the allocation of all forms of capital to promote symbiotic connections between the various entities within a city. A city stack is designed to guide a city's administration in cooperating with its self-organising ecosystem. A research agenda to foster capital creation by city leaders is also outlined. © 2024 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency
Green Transitions in Developing Countries: Perspectives on Women’s Political Leadership,"Green transition by reducing CO2 emissions and curtailing the exploitation of natural resources while increasing renewable energy use and generation is one of the most important targets in sustainable development. This study investigated the impacts of women’s empowerment in politics on the green transition in developing countries. We applied a fixed-effects model to the panel data for 131 developing countries from 2000 to 2019. Our findings indicated that higher levels of participation by women in politics are likely to reduce CO2 emissions and reliance on natural resources. However, there was no statistically significant effect of women’s political empowerment on renewable energy consumption. Women’s political participation enhanced the transition towards sustainable energy sources such as geothermal and wind energy. We also found that the effects of women’s political participation on CO2 emissions were greater in countries with better political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, control of corruption, and voice and accountability. This study contributes to the growing literature in feminism and environmentalism on the achievement of sustainable development. JEL Codes: J16, O13, P48 © 2024 The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
Exploring Energy Poverty in Urban and Rural Contexts in the Era of Climate Change: A Comparative Analysis of European Countries and Israel,"This article examines the multidimensional problem of energy poverty, focusing on its connections to climate change and its manifestation at rural and urban scales across selected European countries and Israel. The study examined 31 locations in eight countries with diverse geographical and economic backgrounds: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, North Macedonia, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Slovakia, and Israel. The article aims to understand how winter energy vulnerability in rural and urban locations in these countries could be identified using selected energy poverty indicators and how it evolves under the influence of climate change. A set of sociodemographic, infrastructural, and economic variables, combined with climate analysis, were selected and assessed for their impact on energy poverty. We found that energy poverty in most countries depends significantly on location and regional development. Due to a combination of factors influencing energy poverty, rural households tend to be more vulnerable. Furthermore, climate change consequences will likely leave rural areas more likely to experience energy poverty in the future. © 2024 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
"Analysing trade-offs and synergies between SDGs for urban development, food security and poverty alleviation in rapidly changing peri-urban areas: a tool to support inclusive urban planning","Transitional peri-urban contexts are frontiers for sustainable development where land-use change involves negotiation and contestation between diverse interest groups. Multiple, complex trade-offs between outcomes emerge which have both negative and positive impacts on progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These trade-offs are often overlooked in policy and planning processes which depend on top-down expert perspectives and rely on course grain aggregate data which does not reflect complex peri-urban dynamics or the rapid pace of change. Tools are required to address this gap, integrate data from diverse perspectives and inform more inclusive planning processes. In this paper, we draw on a reinterpretation of empirical data concerned with land-use change and multiple dimensions of food security from the city of Wuhan in China to illustrate some of the complex trade-offs between SDG goals that tend to be overlooked with current planning approaches. We then describe the development of an interactive web-based tool that implements deep learning methods for fine-grained land-use classification of high-resolution remote sensing imagery and integrates this with a flexible method for rapid trade-off analysis of land-use change scenarios. The development and potential use of the tool are illustrated using data from the Wuhan case study example. This tool has the potential to support participatory planning processes by providing a platform for multiple stakeholders to explore the implications of planning decisions and land-use policies. Used alongside other planning, engagement and ecosystem service mapping tools it can help to reveal invisible trade-offs and foreground the perspectives of diverse stakeholders. This is vital for building approaches which recognise how trade-offs between the achievement of SDGs can be influenced by development interventions. © 2020, The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
"The long-run effects of congestion tolls, carbon tax, and land use regulations on urban CO2 emissions","CO2 emissions caused by urban residents' energy consumption arise from 1) transportation and 2) housing energy consumption. This energy consumption depends on the spatial population distribution of the city. The current study quantitatively examines the effectiveness of i) congestion tolls, ii) carbon tax, and iii) land use regulations on the social welfare and the reduction of urban CO2 emissions. Results show that the congestion tolls can increase the social welfare by about 85% of the increase in the first-best scenario, which is the best result among the three policies, and can reduce CO2 emissions from commuting and housing energy by about 22% and 3%, respectively. These results suggest that congestion tolling, which is primarily the Pigovian tax for congestion, not only internalizes congestion externalities, but also effectively reduces CO2 emissions through downsizing commuting distances and housing sizes. Nevertheless, we show that because any spending, including consumption of goods, generates CO2, how tax revenues are used is important for determining total CO2. © 2021 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Social equity considerations in the implementation of caribbean climate change adaptation policies,"As the Small Island Developing States of the Caribbean prepare to take climate change adaptation measures, there is a distinct possibility that the most vulnerable groups, especially the poor, women, indigenous, elderly, and children in rural and coastal communities are at risk of being marginalized. It is necessary to take into consideration the adaptation needs of these groups that are likely to be disproportionately affected due to inherent structural and social disparities. In this paper we focus on the need to ensure inclusion and social equity in adaptation planning as climate change issues disproportionately impact health, settlement, and livelihoods of these vulnerable groups. We also focus on climate change potential impacts on tourism, agriculture and fisheries sectors, which are the major economic drivers of these island states. Based on Caribbean region wide observations, we recommend priority areas including increasing community participation, local initiatives and filling critical socio-economic and livelihood data gaps, which policy makers need to focus on and incorporate in their climate change adaptation plans in order to ensure effective and equitable climate change adaptation. © 2009 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
"Understanding the operational concept of a flood-resilient urban community in Jakarta, Indonesia, from the perspectives of disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and development agencies","Climate change-related extreme events such as floods have and will continue to present a great challenge to disaster risk management. There is a pressing need to develop a robust management strategy via enhancing the resiliency of the community, particularly in the context of complex urban environments, like Jakarta. Resilience is conceptualized within specific contexts and uniquely tailored to the targeted setting, yet research regarding the operational concept of a flood-resilient community in the context of Jakarta remains limited. This paper will elaborate this operational concept through understanding the desirable features and influential barriers of a flood-resilient community through the lenses of three main stakeholder groups: disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate change adaptation (CCA), and development. It will also discuss the ways in which the synergies that exist across these groups can be enhanced. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were applied in this study, and multiple sources of data were used. The findings indicate that these groups share common views regarding the importance of human aspects being central to resilience building efforts. We argue there is an urgent need to shift the flood resilience building paradigm towards building community resilience from the people and to apply a collaborative governance approach to facilitate effective partnership between the actors involved. © 2019 by the authors.

Perverse incentives: The case of wildfire smoke regulation,"Wildfire is on the rise. The United States is witnessing a spectacular increase in acres lost to catastrophic wildfires, a phenomenon fed by the generally hotter and dryer conditions associated with climate change. In addition to losses in lives, property, and natural resources, wildfires contribute thousands of tons of air pollution each year. Ironically, one of the most effective tools to reduce the incidence and severity of unplanned wildfires is fire. Prescribed, or controlled, burning reduces the buildup of vegetation resulting from years of wildfire-suppression policy. At present, the number of acres subject to prescribed burns falls far short of the optimal number needed to restore natural ecosystems and reduce damages from unplanned wildfires. Air-pollution law and policy is an important factor contributing to the under-provision of prescribed fire that has so far escaped in-depth treatment in the law and policy literature. After setting forth the relevant air quality framework, this Article argues that decisions regarding planned wildfire are marred by an anachronistic and inaccurate distinction between ""natural"" and ""anthropogenic"" fire. Rationalizing that unplanned wildfires are ""natural,"" the federal government excludes pollutants from such fires from air quality compliance calculations at the same time it encourages states to vigorously control pollutants from ""anthropogenic,"" prescribed fires. The result contributes to an undervaluation of necessary, planned wildfire. Wildfire air pollution policy is also hindered by governance structures that place air quality and resource agencies at odds with each other, and by state nuisance authorities that enable narrow local interests to shut down prescribed fire, all of which trump the broader public interest in reduced wildfire risk and healthier forests. This Article suggests several solutions to remove these distortions, including adopting a default rule whereby all wildfire smoke, of whatever origin, ""counts"" for purposes of air quality compliance. Together with adopting mechanisms to require air pollution and resource agencies to both participate in planned burning decisions and de-emphasize the influence of nuisance standards, this ""smoke is smoke"" rule will ensure that the air pollution policy better reflects the true costs and benefits of prescribed fire.

Distributional outcomes of urban heat island reduction pathways under climate extremes,"Global warming and the rise in extreme heat days elevate the risk of heat-related mortalities, particularly in cities due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and vulnerabilities tied to housing, exposure, and health conditions. City planners can mitigate these effects through urban adaptive actions. UHI mitigation, however, needs to balance several goals: strategies that maximize temperature reduction or minimize their impacts may not be best for cost effectiveness, carbon emissions, environmental amenities, health impacts, or distributional outcomes. Here, we implement a multi-objective robust decision-making tool for heat mitigation—the City-Heat Equity Adaptation Tool (City-HEAT)—to identify potential heat mitigation pathways at neighborhood scales. We find that more expensive pathways tend to have larger benefits in reducing heat-related deaths, but that these pathways sometimes underperform against other alternatives on reducing inequality in mortality outcomes. Pathways that focus on tree planting, a popular and powerful tool for UHI reduction, were found to be expensive and less effective at reducing health disparities than more diversified pathways, if no specific measures are taken to target tree distribution for distributional benefit. The generated pathways can reduce Baltimore’s heat related mortality by 81–670 deaths in the next 50 years, considering different investment plans in the city’s neighborhoods. We also find that these results are relatively insensitive to expectations for future warming: pathways designed for high warming rates are similar to those designed for low warming rates, suggesting that general strategies for UHI mitigation can be robust to climate uncertainties. © The Author(s) 2025.",About Sufficiency
Developments in Norway’s sustainability governance in the pre- and post-2030 Agenda era,"Since their introduction, in 2015, United Nations (UNs) 2030 Agenda, and associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), has now become an integral part of nations’ longer term policies. From the very beginning, Norway has shown exceptional sensitivity and zeal in establishing the values of sustainable development in its governmental strategic planning. However, the cataclysmic developments in this area call to explore further the long-standing Norwegian positions and future strategies in meeting global sustainability undertakings. The aim of the article is to explore and discuss Norway’s sustainability governance regime, as has been formulated from 1987 until today. In this context, this paper draws on a systematic review and analysis of concepts, policies and laws stemming from Norway’s governmental documents framed by the principles of a socio-legal research approach. The findings suggest that Norway maintains a clear regulatory and visionary base sustaining, thus, a sharp focus in enhancing its sustainable development policies.

Climate ChangeS Cities—A Project to Enhance Students’ Evaluation and Action Competencies Concerning Climate Change Impacts on Cities,"Concerning the social acceptance and realization of adaptation strategies, a raising awareness on the impacts of climate change among the population is indispensable, especially among young people as future decision makers. In this context, the article presents the structure and implementation of the environmental education project “Klimawandel findet Stadt” (Climate changeS cities), carried out in cooperation between the universities of Bochum, Heidelberg and Trier. The project shall facilitate the development of students’ evaluation and action competencies with regard to climate change consequences and sustainable adaptation strategies by using a new educational concept of climate change communication. It implies the design of learning modules with an emphasis on health and risk prevention, urban climate and planning, and urban ecology and biodiversity. External stakeholders, e.g. biological stations, environmental departments and municipal offices, are involved in the planning and implementation of the above mentioned modules leading to an enhanced cross-sectoral cooperation of institutions. The methodical approach of the project is based on the dialectical intertwining of a three-step approach of spheres, namely observation sphere, laboratory sphere and sphere of action. In the spheres, students are confronted cognitively and affectively with climate change. Thereby, students shall be enabled and motivated to understand, evaluate and communicate climate adaptation strategies. As the concept is so far only normatively justified, there is need for empirical evidence of its effectiveness. In order to address this need, three efficacy studies are designed. If the methodical-didactical concept proves to be efficient, it could be implemented as a new form of climate change communication in educational institutions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",About Sufficiency

Eco-districts: can they accelerate urban climate planning?,"Despite signing the Mayors Climate Change Agreement, few US cities have made significant progress in either climate mitigation or adaptation. For the most part, European cities have been more effective, albeit with assistance from the European Union and their national governments. Several of the most successful European cities have implemented eco-districts, which have offered many lessons for overall sustainability planning. Using Malmö, Sweden as a case study, we ask how planners and elected officials learned from implementing an eco-district, focusing on experimentation with new technologies and approaches to planning. We identify how “double-loop learning”, a term coined by Argyris and Shön, was at play in changing planning practice. As eco-districts are catching on in North American cities, there is much to be learned from European practice. © The Author(s) 2015.",About Sufficiency
"Culture and Power in Banaras: Community, Performance, and Environment, 1800-1980","This collection of ten essays on Banaras, one of the largest urban centers in India’s eastern Gangetic plain, is united by a common interest in examining everyday activities in order to learn about shared values and motivations, processes of identity formation, and self-conscious constructions of community. Part One examines the performance genres that have drawn audiences from throughout the city. Part Two focuses on the areas of neighborhood, leisure, and work, examining the processes by which urban residents use a sense of identity to organize their activities and bring meaning to their lives. Part Three links these experiences within Banaras to a series of ""larger worlds,"" ranging from language movements and political protests to disease ecology and regional environmental impact. Banaras is a complex world, with differences in religion, caste, class, language, and popular culture; the diversity of these essays embraces those differences.

How Can Psychology Contribute to Climate Change Governance? A Systematic Review,"The urgency to reply to climate change requires a governance perspective that connects multiple societal levels and sectors and involves a plurality of actors. Psychologists should take an important role in addressing the ongoing climate crisis, together with other practitioners, scholars, policymakers and citizens. This systematic review aims to show the contribution psychology has offered in the governance of climate change, illustrating how psychological scholarship is positioned in the interdisciplinary discourse on climate governance and the way psychological constructs and theories are implemented. Following the PRISMA guidelines, two electronic databases (APA PsycInfo and Scopus) were screened, and 52 publications meeting the eligibility criteria were included and thoroughly analysed. The literature at the intersection between climate governance and governance is relatively scarce, yet it covers different domains and scales of analysis. Psychological contributions are always integrated into a broader interdisciplinary discourse spanning from the environmental to the social sciences, yet a scarce theoretical specificity has been documented. We found an abundance of research on the determinants of pro-environmental behaviours, which often neglects context-grounded factors, while the relational and dynamic dimensions of governance concerning group processes and collective engagement are rarely taken into due consideration. We argue that psychologists should continue engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations to collectively craft climate solutions, especially focusing on citizenry’s active engagement. Deeper theoretical elaboration on the interface between governance and psychology is needed, particularly from an ecological and systemic perspective. © 2023 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
The relationship between adaptive management of social-ecological systems and law: A systematic review,"Adaptive management has been considered a valuable approach for managing social-ecological systems involving high levels of complexity and uncertainty. However, many obstacles still hamper its implementation. Law is often seen as a barrier for moving adaptive management beyond theory, although there has been no synthesis on the challenges of legal constraints or how to overcome them. We contribute to filling this knowledge gap by providing a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature on the relationship between adaptive management and law in relation to social-ecological systems. We analyze how the scholarship defines the concept of adaptive management, identifies the legal barriers to adaptive management, and the legal strategies suggested for enabling this approach. Research efforts in this domain are still highly geographically concentrated in the United States of America, unveiling gaps concerning the analysis of other legal jurisdictions. Overall, our results show that more flexible legal frameworks can allow for adaptive management without undermining the role of law in providing stability to social interactions. Achieving this balance will likely require the reform of existing laws, regulations, and other legal instruments. Legal reforms can facilitate the emergence of adaptive governance, with the potential to support not only adaptive management implementation but also to make law itself more adaptive. © 2018 by the author(s).",About Sufficiency
Combating urban heat: Systematic review of urban resilience and adaptation strategies,"Urban areas are currently facing the increasingly pressing issue of urban heat worldwide, which is being worsened by climate change and rising urbanization. As a result, there is a growing need for new approaches to enhance urban resilience and adapt to these challenges. The escalating occurrence and severity of urban heat events provide notable hazards, particularly to susceptible groups, necessitating proactive efforts to alleviate detrimental consequences. Therefore, this research addresses the inquiry, “What strategic approaches can be effectively employed to mitigate vulnerability and strengthen urban resilience in response to urban heat?” Thus, this study ascertains and examines approaches to enhance urban resilience, mitigate susceptibility, and implement adaptation strategies to combat urban heat. Utilizing the content analysis method, a comprehensive assortment of documents encompassing academic publications, policy documents, and reports was subjected to a systematic analysis employing the MAXQDA software. Databases searched included Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, and a total of 72 studies were included in the final analysis. The research reveals a wide range of novel ideas and practical measures that can be implemented to improve urban resilience and mitigate vulnerability to urban heat. Urban greening strategies, heatwave early warning sys-tems, and community involvement projects have exhibited differing effectiveness, application, and adaptation levels in many urban landscapes and socio-economic circumstances. Additionally, this research emphasizes the value of using multidimensional, context-specific strategies to address the unique challenges and needs of diverse urban regions and marginalized communities. Furthermore, structural changes, legislative reforms, and community-based solutions may be necessary to manage complex issues posed by urban heat. Therefore, effectively implementing adaptation strategies is vital to effectively combating challenges caused by urban heat in urban areas. © 2024",About Sufficiency

On the use of terrestrial laser scanners to facilitate project studies of urban transformation in the historic peninsula of the metropolitan area of Istanbul,"Due to both a rapid urbanization trend since the 1950s and development differences between areas, population and investment have been accumulated in certain regions in Istanbul which has led to disordered, unhealthy and unreliable urban areas. Istanbul is located on a seismic belt and is at risk of substantial damage should an earthquake occur due to irregular urbanization. Several transformation projects have started to be implemented with the intention of improving this fearsome picture and to evaluate the damages that would occur in an earthquake. To achieve this, urban transformation plans and projects must be done taking into consideration historical places, areas at risk and small-scale plans. This study is an evaluation of the development of unplanned housing and urban transformation projects during the urbanization process in the Istanbul Historic Peninsula. The peninsula has been an important cultural and civilization centre between Eastern and Western civilizations for centuries and has been listed in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List since 1985. Despite this, no documentation of this important area has yet been carried out. In 2006 the Istanbul Greater Municipality's Directory of the Protection of Historical Environment initiated the ""Historic Peninsula Project"", which comprises a project area of 1500 ha and approximately 48,000 buildings in crowded and narrow streets. Also, this project included the documentation of all buildings in the area of the Historic Peninsula by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in 2006.

Realigning practices of care and environmental governance: findings and reflections from a transdisciplinary research project in Wales (UK),"This article presents findings from a transdisciplinary research project on collaborative practices for the sustainable management of natural resources (SMNR) in Wales. Here, the legislation establishes that the national well-being agenda and the principle of SMNR in environmental governance must be achieved through collaborative and participatory practices, across sectors and organisations, including within the public sector. However, neoliberal and hyper-bureaucratic governance structures, characterised by a risk-adverse nature, do not allow public sector institutional actors to experiment and engage with such practices in their everyday work. This article discusses a collective experience of reflecting on, and challenging such oppressing neoliberal structures, through experimenting with alternative ways of doing and being together. The emerging community at the heart of this experience is composed of policymakers, practitioners, artists, and academics (including the authors), who together carved out a 'site of negotiation' to contest techno-managerialism and mere rational approaches to (natural resources) governance. In the course of this research, these actors began to collectively create and shape new and shared meanings of doing collaborative and cross-boundary work (as required by the Welsh legislation), based on relationships of trust, reflexivity, embodiment, and relationality. Reflecting also on our own experience (and interpretation) of working alongside them, we believe that such emergent processes of collective meaning-making have the potential to transform neoliberal (environmental) governance structures into 'lived' and 'owned' institutions. Inspired by relational, integrative and caring forms of democratic governance, we argue that professionals in public sector organisations can realign governance structures in ways that meet the challenge of enabling the rapid and wide sustainability transformations that are so desperately needed. © (2023), (University of Arizona Libraries).

Unlocking the Opportunities of a Circular Economy in South Africa,"The circular economy is not new to South Africa. As a country facing high levels of unemployment, poverty, and inequality, end-of-life products are often repaired and reused, driven largely by an active informal sector. As a water scarce country, grey water has been recycled and reused for decades, with returns making up 13% of South Africa’s available water. And facing an energy crisis since 2007, renewable energy has grown to 11% of South Africa’s energy supply. While there is certainly much progress still to be made in scaling-up activities in the waste, energy, and water sectors, this chapter provides insights into some of the initiatives already in place to catalyse South Africa’s transition to a more circular economy. In addition to the sector opportunities, the chapter also explores the role of government, business, and science, technology, and innovation in unlocking a circular economy in South Africa. It is acknowledged that further circular economy opportunities in resource-intensive sectors such as agriculture, human settlements, transport, and manufacturing need to be identified, and that more needs to be done in addressing “early stage” product design and resource demand. However, based on a growing body of knowledge, it is clear that the circular economy provides opportunities to address issues of national resource scarcity and security through sustainable resource utilisation. It provides opportunities to move the country forward in its local and international environmental commitments and development objectives. And it provides very real opportunities to strengthen local manufacturing, reduce dependence on resource imports, unlock new economic opportunities, improve the sustainability of other investment areas, create jobs, and position South Africa in the short term for a post-COVID19 green economic recovery and in the long term for a post-mining economy. © The Editor (s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021, corrected publication 2022.",About Sufficiency
Spatiotemporal modeling of urban growth using machine learning,"This paper presents a general framework for modeling the growth of three important variables for cities: population distribution, binary urban footprint, and urban footprint in color. The framework models the population distribution as a spatiotemporal regression problem using machine learning, and it obtains the binary urban footprint from the population distribution through a binary classifier plus a temporal correction for existing urban regions. The framework estimates the urban footprint in color from its previous value, as well as from past and current values of the binary urban footprint using a semantic inpainting algorithm. By combining this framework with free data from the Landsat archive and the Global Human Settlement Layer framework, interested users can get approximate growth predictions of any city in the world. These predictions can be improved with the inclusion in the framework of additional spatially distributed input variables over time subject to availability. Unlike widely used growth models based on cellular automata, there are two main advantages of using the proposed machine learning-based framework. Firstly, it does not require to define rules a priori because the model learns the dynamics of growth directly from the historical data. Secondly, it is very easy to train new machine learning models using different explanatory input variables to assess their impact. As a proof of concept, we tested the framework in Valledupar and Rionegro, two Latin American cities located in Colombia with different geomorphological characteristics, and found that the model predictions were in close agreement with the ground-truth based on performance metrics, such as the root-mean-square error, zero-mean normalized cross-correlation, Pearson's correlation coefficient for continuous variables, and a few others for discrete variables such as the intersection over union, accuracy, and the f1 metric. In summary, our framework for modeling urban growth is flexible, allows sensitivity analyses, and can help policymakers worldwide to assess different what-if scenarios during the planning cycle of sustainable and resilient cities. © 2019 by the authors.",About Sufficiency

"Co-creating a community visioning methodology for energy transitions: Principles, practices, and reflections","Visions of energy futures produced via co-created methodologies can provide robust alternatives to the prevailing imaginaries held by international and state actors – crucial for sustaining progress towards energy transitions that meet community needs and realities. This paper explores the co-creative design of a methodology for community visions for energy transitions. Insights are drawn from the development and outputs of a collaborative workshop aimed at adapting community visioning to different local contexts with four partners from across Europe. We analyse empirical evidence, including transcripts of conversations with participating local authorities and NGO representatives and resources prepared for the workshop, to detail how collaboration proceeded. The results highlight that practices fostering inclusion, mutual learning, and relationship building can give partners ownership over visioning to better ensure that its design reflects local, situated knowledges and is well suited to communities. However, the messy, human nature of co-creation requires commitment to flexibility and ongoing dialogue. Overall, the experiences highlighted in this paper serve as a valuable resource for future researchers and practitioners interested in exploring how to further energy system transformation and support community-driven local energy transitions. © 2024 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Accessible nature beyond city limits – A scoping review,"The health and well-being benefits of nature contact are well known, but inequitably distributed across society. Focusing on the access needs of persons with a disability, the purpose of this study was to systematically examine research on the accessibility of nature-based tourism and recreation spaces outside of urban/community settings. Following a scoping review methodology, this study sought to examine policies, services, physical infrastructures, and regulatory standards intended to enable equitable use of nature-based settings by individuals of all ages and abilities, particularly persons with a disability. In total, 41 relevant studies were identified and analyzed. Findings indicate that there are considerable gaps in the provision of services and information that enable self-determination in the use and enjoyment of nature, and that accessibility in nature-based settings is conceptualized through three interrelated policy/design pathways: the adaptation pathway, the accommodation pathway, and the universal design pathway. As a whole, accessibility policy and standards research specific to natural settings outside of urban/community settings is highly limited. Management implications: There are growing calls to promote inclusive nature experiences in tourism and recreation spaces outside of community settings. Management of such spaces must reconcile equity concerns with a host of other priorities like environmental conservation. In the case of promoting universal accessibility, few studies offer insight into the detailed standards that must be met to create barrier-free access, let alone how to integrate such standards with other management priorities. Transdisciplinary research partnerships that involve management personnel, environmental and public health researchers, and persons with a disability are needed to identify effective management synergies. © 2022",About Sufficiency
How does digital government affect natural resource sustainability? A global perspective,"Digital government is essential for modernizing public administration, enhancing citizen services, boosting government productivity, and encouraging transparency and citizen involvement. It plays a critical role in improving the management of natural resource rents by promoting transparency, accountability, and responsible governance. However, empirical evidence on the impact of digital government on natural resource rents is lacking. To plug this vacuum into the literature, the analysis tries to study the impact of digital government on natural resource rent from 2003 to 2021 by collecting data across many economies and dividing the data into five samples: Global, Asian, American, European, and African. For empirical analysis, the study utilizes the 2SLS and GMM techniques. The analysis's main findings indicate that digital government escalates natural resource rent globally in Asia, America, and Europe. Likewise, human capital and financial development also help to advance natural resource rent. Further, the trade causes the natural resource rent to rise globally in Asia, America, Europe, and the African model, while technology promotes natural resource rent in Global, American, and European models. In contrast, external conflict causes the natural resource rent to fall globally in America and Europe. From these findings, the study infers that policymakers should increase the role of digitalization in governance-related activities, particularly in the natural resource sector. © 2024",About Sufficiency
Building the city and its environment: Canadian metropolises and biodiversity,"Has global environmental change impacted on the urban way of life and on urban policy? Research shows that climate change has become a major urban political issue, but what can one say about biodiversity? This paper will, firstly, examine the urban assemblage perspective, which presents itself as a new approach to urban theory. This approach has been criticized, but its remains valid as a way of making sense of emerging urban practices. Among these practices are urban policy on climate change and biodiversity. Secondly, the paper examines action plans on biodiversity in six Canadian metropolises. The conclusion asks whether taking into account global environmental change in urban planning leads to a new reshaping of large urban areas.

Analysis of national strategies for sustainable development with regard to fundamental conceptual premise,"The problem of interaction between the economy and the environment gains special significance every year. At present, anthropogenic impact of industrial production on the environment has exceeded the sustainability limits of natural systems. Further conventional development of the economy is confronted with the limitations of the self-restoration potential of ecosystems: the non-renewable character of productive resources and the limited character of the environment to take production waste. The purpose of the paper is to identify the main directions for the implementation of national policies of sustainable development with account of the fundamental conceptual premise. The paper outlines the main principles, policies and scenarios for sustainable development and presents new components of environmental policy. The authors consider national strategies for sustainable development of the United States, China, Russia, the EU countries and pay special attention to the strategy adopted in the Netherlands. The paper determines the specific strategies features reflecting the interests of these countries' population and the role of national economies in world economic relations. The paper explores the possibilities of the SDG Index for the identification, assessment and comparative analysis of countries' actions to achieve the goals of sustainable development. Based on the results of the Sustainable Development Index for 2017, the authors carry out a cross-country analysis of the sustainability strategies of countries from the perspective of achieving sustainable development goals (SDG). It helps to identify the problems of using the index to track progress towards the SDG. Moreover, the article underlines the strengths and weaknesses of national sustainable development strategies of different countries, including Russia. It is shown that Russia has achieved high positions in eradicating poverty, with a significant lag behind other goals of sustainable development, especially such as the elimination of inequality, the provision of a healthy lifestyle, access to justice and the creation of effective institutions. Finally, the paper indicates the main directions of sustainable development in Russia. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Classification of Smart City Research - a Descriptive Literature Review and Future Research Agenda,"Smart City (SC) has been a popular area of research and practice during the last decade. An in-depth examination of the existing literature reviews on SCs divulges the scarcity of studies classifying the literature into multiple themes and identifying the popular and less popular themes based on the number of peer reviewed research papers under respective theme. Hence, in this study, a descriptive literature review of 86 peer-reviewed papers on SCs has been conducted to bridge this gap. The findings demonstrate that themes such as SC services design and management, innovation and technology, and citizens’ engagement in design and development of SCs have been extensively studied, whereas, themes such as the social impact, governance and policy, and performance indicators and standards have received moderate attention. However, there are also less popular themes such as the implementation barriers and SC strategy. Further, this study provides a reference source to future researchers. It also delivers valuable information to the policymakers and government bodies, which are actively, involved in the SC projects. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2019.",About Sufficiency
The battle to achieve Sustainable Development Goal Two: The role of environmental sustainability and government institutions,"The current period marked by addressing environmental sustainability challenges and the instability of government institutions has heightened the issue of food security, especially in developing countries as they work towards achieving Zero Hunger as highlighted in the Sustainable Development Goals. To assess the effect of environmental sustainability and government institutions on food security in West Africa with data from 1990 to 2021, two models have been deployed. The Generalized Method of Moments was deployed as the main model and while Two-Stage Least Squares was used as the robustness check. The findings of the study reveal that carbon emissions which represent environmental sustainability has no direct significant effect on food security, while government institutions has negative effect on food security. The study also reveals that income and urbanization promote food security, while renewable energy and population growth reduce food security. The findings of the study could be a reflection of the current political instability and attitude towards tackling carbon emissions mitigation in the region. Government institutions are encouraged to exercise authority without fear to implement policies that would encourage food security and restrict the use of high-emission technologies.",About Sufficiency
Public perception of climate change: Policy and communication,"Despite the findings on global climate change presented by the scientific community, there remains a significant gap between its recommendations and the actions of the public and policy makers. So far scientists and the media have failed to successfully communicate the urgency of the climate change situation in such a way that long-term, comprehensive, and legally binding policy commitments are being made on the national and international level. This book examines the way the public processes information, how they perceive threats and other perceptual factors that have a significant effect on how and to what degree climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies are supported. Understanding public risk perception plays a vital role in communicating the challenges of global climate change. Using a diverse range of international case studies, this book explores the nature of public perceptions of climate change and identifies the perception factors which have a significant impact on the public's willingness to support global climate change policies or commit to behavioral changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve urban resiliency. The comparative study of social and cultural factors, beliefs, attitudes and trust provides an international overview of best practices regarding the design, implementation and generation of public support for climate change policies at a global level. Offering valuable insight into climate change and risk communication, the book should be of interest to students and scholars of environment studies, politics, urban planning, and media and cultural studies. © 2016 Bjoern Hagen.",About Sufficiency
The economics of climate change impacts and policy benefits at city scale: A conceptual framework,"Cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change and climate extremes in part because they concentrate many activities, people and wealth in limited areas. As a result they represent an important scale for assessment and understanding of climate change impacts. This paper provides a conceptual and methodological framework for urban economic impact assessment of climate change. The focus of the paper is on model-based analysis of future scenarios, including a framing of uncertainty for these projections, as one valuable input into the decision-making process. The paper highlights the main assessment difficulties, methods and tools, and selected examples across these areas. A number of challenges are unique to climate change impact assessment and others are unique to the problem of working at local scales. The paper also identifies the need for additional research, including the need for more integrated and systemic approaches to address climate change as a part of the urban development challenge as well as the need to assess the economic impacts of climate change and response policy at local scale. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",About Sufficiency
"Household water consumption in an arid city: Affluence, affordance, and attitudes","Reducing consumption in affluent urban households is perhaps the most important driver of future natural resource conservation. This article examines how water consumption in individual households is affected by income and determines whether household amenities or attitudes toward community and the environment mediate the effect of income on residential water use, net of other factors. We matched household social surveys, property characteristics, and climate variables with 24 months of individually metered water usage records for single-family houses in Phoenix, AZ. Household income had a positive, significant effect on consumption that was mediated by house size. Irrigable lot size and landscape type also had significant effects on consumption, although attitudes did not. In order to promote environmentally sustainable behavior we must develop better models of the social organization of consumption and encourage affluent households to be more attuned to the water affordances of their lifestyles. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",About Sufficiency
The role of environmental diplomacy and economic factors on environmental degradation,"In recent years, rising carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and other negative environmental effects of human activity have raised concerns about the planet's future. Rapid industrialization, urbanization, and economic activity have shown a surge in CO2 emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change. The main purpose of this study is to examine the impact of such as gross domestic product, gross domestic product square, foreign direct investment, environmental diplomacy, environmental diplomacy security, and renewable energy consumption on environmental degradation. This study provides a new perspective on environmental diplomacy in OECD countries using panel data econometric methodologies from 1991 to 2020. It contributes to our understanding of the role of environmental and economic factors in reducing CO2 emissions. The panel data is also analyzed by CD, CIPS, FMOLS, DOLS, and PMG-ARDL tests. However, as per the findings of this research, all the factors significantly impact environmental degradation (Co2 emission). Finding data to either confirm or deny the efficacy of the Environmental Kuznets Curve theory within the framework of OECD countries is possible through this approach. This policy framework attempts to solve the issues at the connection of environmental diplomacy and economic concerns by emphasizing cooperation and sustainability and incorporating environmental considerations into economic decision-making processes in OECD countries. © 2024",About Sufficiency
Can Stockholm Royal Seaport be part of the puzzle towards global sustainability? – From local to global sustainability using the same set of criteria,"Urban sustainable development is today seen as one of the keys towards unlocking the quest for a sustainable world. One feature of urban sustainability is the increased interest in developing sustainable urban districts. For many of these developments, guiding sustainability documents are developed to frame future goals. However, few of these documents specify on which grounds they determine the sustainability of goals and they are largely developed as independent islands of local sustainability. This is unfortunate as cities and their districts are fully dependent on surrounding environments. Failing to include a holistic approach into the local planning increases the risk of sub-optimisation, future lock-ins and missed targets on a higher level. The aim of this study is to analyse whether the environmental and sustainability programme for Stockholm Royal Seaport, a new urban district in Stockholm, Sweden, can guide development of the district towards holistic ecological sustainability. By using the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development a holistic template for an ecologically sustainable planet has been described, important sectors for the built environment have been identified and the environmental and sustainability programme for the district has been analysed. This study showed that the vision and operational goals put forward in the Stockholm Royal Seaport programme complies relatively well with the designed template. However, important deviations in all sectors but land use have been identified. These deviations arise in the translation process between theory and practice. The vision for the district and the implementation phase are not aligned due to too narrow a perspective of a sustainable urban district, lack of robust sustainability principles including use of such to identify key strategic questions. In addition to the lack of an all-embracing conceptual framework, there is also a lack of structures for cooperation between stakeholders and conflicts between local and regional agendas. Use of a unifying framework can describe desirable future scenarios where the local level does not contribute to violation of the universal sustainability principles and identify step-wise routes towards such scenarios. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
A systematic map of responses to climate impacts in Urban Africa,"Over time African cities and their residents have responded to climate impacts in increasingly creative ways, based on local knowledge and available resources. Overviews of adaptation policy, plans and actions have largely been lacking for Africa, particularly at the local, city level. We applied a systematic map to assess what the human responses to climate impacts are in African cities, noting the climate drivers of these actions, the range of responses, where they have taken place, and who the actors are. Standardized, pre-selected search terms were used to systematically search peer-reviewed and grey literature, using Web of Science, Scopus, and Google. Publications were screened based on pre-approved inclusion criteria, and actions described in included articles were coded using categories from key conceptual framing papers on climate change adaptation. Of 2 042 peer-reviewed and 60 grey-literature publications, 252 underwent full-text screening, with 121 included for coding. We recorded 1 504 actions, taking place in 41 cities from 21 African countries, in response to various climate drivers. Anticipatory and reactive actions were taken by actors, from individuals to international agencies, and we highlighted successful adaptations, those taking advantage of climate impacts, and maladaptive actions. Combinations of climatic and non-climatic stimuli induced adaptive responses, which were frequently based on local knowledge, and provided a base upon which government action could build. Residents of informal settlements had less adaptive capacity than those in formal settlements, and government action could build their resilience. Since development is affected by climate impacts, climate change information should be integrated into development programmes. © 2020 The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
Spheres of public conversation: Experiences in strategic environmental assessment,"This paper draws on earlier research, a national review of Scottish SEA practice and a survey of practitioners and stakeholders engaged in SEA and spatial planning in one Scottish city-region, to explore claims being made in the academic literature for Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) as a tool for deliberative plan-making. We consider whether there is evidence that Scottish SEA practice is helping create more inclusive plan-making processes in light of recent legislative changes, thereby fulfilling one of the expectations of Scottish Government. The macro analysis found that although there are opportunities for stakeholders to engage in the Scottish SEA process the level in practice is extremely low, a finding which mirrors experience in England and elsewhere. The more detailed micro analysis reveals a more nuanced picture within the spatial planning system, however, suggesting the existence of two distinct spheres of public conversations, one characterised by active dialogue about the environmental effects of alternative strategies amongst public sector stakeholders and the other involving non-governmental stakeholders and community groups in a much more limited way. The paper concludes with a discussion of possible explanations for this outcome, concerning asymmetric incentive structures and the application of power, and a consideration of the implications in relation to the competing discourses of SEA. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",About Sufficiency
"The Impacts of Peri-Urban Expansion on Municipal and Ecosystem Services: Experiences from Makhado Biaba Town, South Africa","The sub-Saharan cities are growing and changing due to immigration and modernization. One of the consequences of the current urbanization is that an increasing number of families residing in peri-urban areas of small rural towns lack access to basic municipal and ecosystem services. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate the impacts of peri-urban expansion on municipal services provided by the governments and on ecosystems services through a case study of a small rural town called Makhado Biaba in Limpopo Province of South Africa. Makhado Biaba has been experiencing incessant rapid physical expansion over the years. Such spatial expansion into the peri-urban zone impacts the provision of municipal services such as water, electricity, sewerage, and refuse collection. In 2020, an exploratory mixed-methods study of some anthropocentric and ecosystem changes in Makhado Biaba Local Municipality in northeast South Africa was executed. Land use was mapped for the time period of 1990–2020, data were gathered through a household questionnaire in six villages, and interviews were held with municipal officials. Among others, the study showed that several municipal services are available in the peri-urban villages of Makhado Biaba Town despite the distant locations outside the urban core. However, services are not uniformly distributed due to that new peri-urban developments that are leapfrogging into vacant land without supporting infrastructure. The pace of the municipality in providing the necessary municipal services such as water and energy supply, as well as sanitation and refuse removal, is lagging behind the development of new and unplanned housing areas. The findings bring about information about the suburban livelihoods and how the administration of the peri-urban areas can respond to the needs of the inhabitants as well as to future challenges. For instance, to facilitate local development, recurrent and well-structured citizen dialogs with local groups to identify delivery failures are strongly recommended. In addition, the impact on ecosystem services by the city development and land use change stresses the need for guided urban development and expansion and also settlement upgrading programs in peri-urban zones to limit the bad effect on ecosystem services. © The Author(s) 2023.",About Sufficiency
Towards participatory geographic information systems for community-based environmental decision making,This article discusses the potential of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to become an information technology enabling groups of people to participate in decisions shaping their communities and promoting sustainable use of natural resources.

"Collaborative evolutionary governance of estuaries in Kerala, India","Governance of the estuarine social-ecological system is a challenge for policymakers and academicians. While local communities perceive estuaries as commons, the private sector values and uses them as a low-cost infrastructure for making economic profits. These conflicting perspectives have complicated resource uses between local communities and modern enterprises and led to the degradation of estuarine biodiversity. A critical examination of modern development experiences and estuarine resource management, however, reveals that the currently practised state-centric modes of estuarine governance are biased towards privatization and neglect local community needs and livelihood rights. A system of governance that guarantees sustainable development and ecosystem health and just shares estuarine resources to sustain community livelihoods is, therefore, essential. This paper identifies major challenges of the present estuarine governance strategies in Kerala and presents an alternate collaborative governance framework to ensure socially acceptable sharing of estuarine resources and ecological services between traditional and modern resource users. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

The public value of vacant urban land,"In contemporary cities there is a range of spaces leftover from development, undeveloped or spaces abandoned post-development, derelict. These lie dormant between other functional spaces of the city, voids in-between the built urban environment that surrounds them. Often these are also temporary spaces: in-between what was there before and what will soon come. This temporary character may, however, be seen as permanent, for instance in the eyes of a generation of children growing up playing in leftover spaces over the period of a decade. This paper will investigate whether there is value in such spaces for everyday life and public space in the city. It will examine and determine their function in terms of three factors: ecological value, social value and open space value.

Revealing Legal Politics in City Branding: A Study of Padang Panjang City as the Kota Serambi Mekah,"This research aims to analyze in depth the political power of legal aspects of the branding of the city of Padang Panjang as the Kota Serambi Mekah. The focus of this research explains the reasons behind the branding of the city of Padang Panjang as the City of Serambi Mekkah at the beginning of its determination, the political power of legal (regulations and programs) in building and maintaining the city’s branding. This research uses a qualitative approach. The data sources collected are a combination of data on the law in the books with the law in practices. The interpretation of the data refers to the normative legal research procedure by confirming it to the understanding practices of the respondents. Data was collected through interviews with the mayor and his staff, and the community. While the literature study collected policy documents and the internet such as the Padang Panjang Government website. The empirical approach analyzes field data to explain Padang Panjang’s branding policy as the City of Serambi Mekah, while the normative approach analyzes scientific documents to explain regulations related to the branding. The results of this study show that the rationale behind city branding is to strengthen the Islamic and cultural identity of Padang Panjang City. In addition, although the Kota Serambi Mekah branding has been practically implemented through various regulations and programs, the consistency in the emphasis of branding in strategic planning has changed, from an emphasis on concrete implementation in the 2005-2045 Regional Long-Term Development Plan (RPJPD) to a more explicit emphasis in the Draft RPJPD 2025-2045. This research is novel in exploring the political power of legal in shaping and sustaining the branding of cities, particularly Padang Panjang as the Kota Serambi Mekah. The contribution of this research lies in an in-depth understanding of the role of legal and policy frameworks in strengthening the city’s cultural and religious identity, as well as how this branding can adapt to changes in long-term development strategies. This research also provides suggestions for the government to be consistent in maintaining the implementation of branding in every strategic planning, so that the identity of Kota Serambi Mekah remains relevant and effective in facing social and political challenges. © 2024, Universitas Islam Negeri Mahmud Yunus Batusangkar.

Comparing these cases, we analyse strategic policy documents on green growth, circular economy, bioeconomy, low-carbon transitions, and sustainable development. While comprehensive national policy strategies on the green economy are lacking, the studied documents display policy approaches that reflect different aspects of a green economic transformations, such as low-carbon developments, promotion of environmental technology sectors, and enhanced circularity. Our findings indicate the presence of a transformative Nordic model for greening the economy, in which the state plays an active role in supporting innovation and technology development, facilitating cooperation among societal actors, and securing social welfare and human wellbeing. It is underpinned by optimism about the opportunity to reconcile economic growth with sustainable development, while more radical beyond growth approaches are strikingly absent, reflecting their marginal roles in the established policy discourse of these countries.

Circularity in the Management of Municipal Solid Waste - A Systematic Review,"Municipal solid waste (MSW) management has emerged as one of the major environmental challenges globally. The consequences of inappropriate waste management are manifold and the trend would continue if immediate interventions are not taken for its reversion amid rapid urbanization and current consumption patterns of individuals. The concept of circular economy (CE) can contribute to a paradigm shift in the transformation of the traditional linear approach that does not favour reuse, recycle, recovery concept. Modern and proven waste management practices with collection systems, recycling facilities, sanitary landfills, and waste-to-energy (WtE) and nutrient recovery offer opportunities to improve urban environment through the valorization of waste and by-products in a CE. This study scrutinizes the existing literature on the assessment of circularity and helps to develop a unified circularity framework in the management of MSW in cities. Key aspects such as tools for measuring circularity, nexus and trade-offs, and conditions in promoting CE are discussed.

Neighborhood-level determining factors of travel distance by trip purpose: Policy implications for the N-minute city,"As part of efforts to reduce carbon emissions, the concept of n-minute cities has been proposed. Although many global cities have attempted to implement this idea, there is still a lack of quantitative research on n-minute cities. This study aims to analyze factors that influence living radii by utilizing mobile phone location-based mobility big data and spatial regression analysis, thereby contributing to the implementation of n-minute cities. By distinguishing between pre- and post-COVID-19 periods and between commuting and non-commuting travel, this study reveals decreased average travel distances in the post-pandemic period and identifies factors influencing living radii, thereby favoring the concept of n-minute cities. During the post-COVID-19 period, the impact of factors such as population density, commercial facilities, and the job-housing ratio on travel distance has shifted, while neighborhood living and cultural facilities maintain consistent influence. This underscores the importance of prioritizing these aspects in n-minute city planning. Additionally, the mix of residential and business uses consistently affects shorter commuting distances, highlighting its critical role in n-minute city development. This study is significant for identifying urban environmental factors that effectively reduce living radii based on actual travel behaviors. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Urban farming system and food security in sub-Saharan Africa: Analysis of the current status and challenges,"Abstract: By 2022, 42.39% of the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) population was living in urban areas. This urbanization correlates with increasing poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, environmental pollution, and the prevalence of informal settlements. These challenges worsened urban food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic in SSA cities. This review analyzed the role of urban farming system as a pivotal means to enhance urban food security, incorporating socioeconomic integration and environmental sustainability. The analysis is grounded in a systematic review using specific keywords, evaluating 46 articles and institutional reports related to the subject. The results revealed that 3.62% of SSA countries have implemented national urban governance and policies with minimal focus on urban farming. Rapid urbanization, urban population growth, and climate change are key factors contributing to cities' vulnerabilities to food insecurity in SSA. Predominantly characterized by horticultural practice, urban farming enhances the food supply system, nutritious security, jobs and income generation, reduces transportation costs, promotes the consumption of fresh food, and mitigates food loss in cities. Despite its importance, urban farming in SSA encounters several challenges: (i) urbanization governance and policy, (ii) knowledge and technology in urban farming, (iii) access to land and water, (iv) financing and capacity building for urban farming, and (v) environmental pollution. SSA countries need a coordinated mix of urbanization policies and technological advancements to integrate innovative urban farming methods, bolstering cities’ resilience to food insecurity. Implementing these measures could advance the achievement of sustainable development goals 2 and 11 in SSA cities. Core Ideas: Only 3.62% of sub-Saharan African countries implemented national urban policies, with little focus on urban farming integration. Limited technology and innovation, including land and water access, hinder urban farming productivity in SSA cities. Urban farming system is a nature-based solution that promotes food security, jobs, and climate resilience in SSA cities. To fully harness the benefits of urban farming, urban governance in SSA must incorporate it into cities' land-use planning. © 2024 The Author(s).

Structural barriers to sufficiency: the contribution of research on elites,"‘Sufficiency’ has become a key term within sustainability science. The satisfaction of basic human needs for all and for multiple generations is only possible if coupled to the implementation of ecological ceilings that prevent wealthy groups from disproportionate production and consumption patterns and energy use. While much sufficiency research has focused on the poor and how to provide corresponding social floors (i.e. an adequate level of sufficiency), this conceptual paper theorises structural barriers to implementing ecological ceilings for production and consumption by considering research on elites. The argument is illustrated with examples from urban spaces that are increasingly structured to accommodate the preferences of economic elites. A better scholarly understanding of the structural barriers to sufficiency dissemination can be facilitated through a systematic account of the political, social and symbolic strategies deployed by elites to accumulate and legitimise power. Conversely, a consideration of sufficiency principles would also be beneficial for research on elites, which has so far focused on social inequality and sidelined the ecological crisis. The discussion highlights how research on sufficiency and elite consumption may interact to be mutually beneficial. A research agenda is proposed to understand economic elites as barriers to the dissemination of sufficiency principles. © 2024 The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
Land-use planning and the public: Is there an optimal degree of civic participation?,"Civic participation has an irreplaceable role in the land-use planning process because it contributes a practical perspective to expert knowledge. This article discusses whether there is actually a level of civic participation that can be considered optimal, which would allow experts to effectively obtain information from everyday users of the territory, who have the best practical knowledge of it; experts may also gain sufficient feedback on intended developments, based on knowledge about civic participation from representatives of individual municipalities. The article also proposes measures that can promote an optimal degree of participation in the land-use planning process. The fieldwork was conducted in the form of semi-structured interviews with the mayors of municipalities with a population of up to 2000 inhabitants in selected districts of the ústí Region (Czech Republic). The results suggest that the optimal degree of civic participation in land-use planning should have a representative extent, so it should not merely be a matter of individuals, but also one of groups of dozens of people, and such groups should encompass a balanced variety of characteristics; an optimal level of civic participation should also provide the maximum number of relevant impulses. Measures that may secure and foster an optimal degree of civic participation in land-use planning include (1) striving to avoid preferring purely voluntary participation; (2) simultaneously utilizing various tools to engage inhabitants; (3) educating inhabitants on a regular basis; and (4) consistently communicating and providing feedback, while also searching for informal means of communication and discussion. © 2021 by the author.

The circular economy in Europe: Critical perspectives on policies and imaginaries,"The Circular Economy in Europe presents an overview and a critical discussion on how circularity is conceived, imagined, and enacted in current EU policy-making. In 2013, the idea of a circular economy entered the stage of European policy-making in the efforts to reconcile environmental and economic policy objectives. In 2019 the European Commission declared in a press release that the Circular Economy Action Plan has been delivered. The level of circularity in the European economy, however, has remained the same. Bringing together perspectives from social sciences, environmental economics and policy analysis, The Circular Economy in Europe provides a critical analysis of policies and promises of the next panacea for growth and sustainability. The authors provide a theoretical and empirical basis to discuss how contemporary societies conceive their need to re-organise production and consumption and explores the messy assemblage of institutions, actors, waste streams, biophysical flows, policy objectives, scientific disciplines, values, expectations, promises and aspirations involved. This book is essential reading for all those interested in understanding how ideas about the circular economy emerged historically, how they gained traction and are used in policy processes, and what the practical challenges in implementing this policy are. © 2020 Zora Kovacic, Roger Strand and Thomas Völker.",About Sufficiency
Developing an Approach for Assessing Urban Blue-Green Spaces Towards Sustainable Urban Growth Through Retrospective Cyber Metrics Analysis of Operational Estimations Approaches,"Urban blue-green spaces provide us abundant social, environmental, and economic benefits, but the disparities often exist in their distribution and accessibility. Traditionally urban blue-green spaces are a consolidation of ""blue-green infrastructure""within urban areas. Several urban features like parks, forests, gardens, visible water, such as parks, rivers, canals, reservoirs, ponds, lakes, fountains, etc. are categorized or considered under the blue-green spaces and these are very much crucial for various urban ecosystem services. These play a significant role for all stakeholders of the urban community. Thus, everyone must ensure the equitable number of blue-green spaces for all. Recently, several rules and regulations towards the safeguarding of urban blue-green spaces have been outlined. The work presents a methodological framework to develop an approach towards sustainable urban growth with the help of urban blue-green spaces assessments. The current work has attempted to examine the linkage between issues of the urban blue-green spaces for restoring the required infrastructures. It can be utilised for all sustainable urban development for urban planning and design projects to play a pivotal role. The work emphasizes more to develop a methodological framework to analyze the urban blue-green spaces for augmentation with a theoretical framework. It is expected that the advancement of a problem cum objectives-driven approach will help to design an impact-driven approach for planned and concrete action. © 2021 Sunita et al., published by Sciendo.",About Sufficiency
Grassroots innovations and sustainable energy use in urban contexts: case studies from India,"Purpose: Grassroots innovations, developed by local people using locally available resources, have shown the potential to provide low-cost technological solutions to the problems faced by underserved consumers in the global south.

Role of water-energy-food nexus in environmental management and climate action,"The demand for water, energy, and food resources increased in tandem with the world's population, industrialization, and urbanization. Anthropogenic sources of environmental pollutants degrade the water resources while population expansion contributes to rising demand for non-renewable energy resources which further enhances the greenhouse gas emissions. Also, maintaining the food security/-safety is another challenge which needs to be addressed for securing 'planetary public health'. The sustainability programs, pragmatic studies, and strategies from regulatory/scientific institutions attempt to reduce the depletion of these resources and mitigate environmental challenges however, the individualistic approaches proves to be inadequate. Therefore, the present review emphasizes the use of Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus as a tool to combat environmental degradation, address climate action, and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this article, we investigate methodological paradigm and application of WEF Nexus in an inter-related framework through case studies on water resources, energy efficiency, urban food production, food waste reduction, cross-sectoral perspectives, and the circular economy. It has been widely observed that excessive exploitation of these resources influences the global food supply and demand, water availability, resilience in energy and socio-economic sector. Also, such perturbations in water, energy, and food sectors were found to be inextricably linked with climate change. The results further revealed that WEF nexus approach stimulates multilevel and inter-sectoral governance, thereby aiding to address the complexities and inefficiencies in achieving the SDGs. The prioritization of WEF Nexus strategy, especially under the event of COVID-19 can be a holistic approach to sustainably utilise natural resources to help achieve the environmental sustainability.",About Sufficiency
"Cluster analysis reveals latent structure in stakeholder interests relevant to the management of Blueskin Bay estuary, Otago, Aotearoa New Zealand","Community participation is increasingly embedded into environmental policy with the aim of accelerating transformative change towards sustainable management. A common approach to engaging with communities is through key stakeholders, who are still often selected ad hoc based on their activities. We tested an analytical approach for identifying distinct groups of community preferences as part of a case study to develop a community-led management plan for Blueskin Bay estuary and its catchment. We interviewed 36 community members to elicit their preferences for predefined management objectives following a standardised protocol. Using an agglomerative hierarchical analysis, we determined value-preference clusters for high-level management objectives and more specific objectives. At both levels combined, preference clusters were attributed to some of the commercial interests, such as cockle harvesting, forestry or tourism, which we also identified ad hoc based on their activities in the Blueskin Bay area. However, in addition, cluster analyses revealed five additional preference types: Urban Development Advocates, Cultural Environmentalists, Economic Environmentalists, Integrative Thinkers and those with Diverse Interests. We conclude that cluster analysis more objectively and specifically maps community preferences and, consequently, increases the robustness of collaborative environmental management processes, such as the one underway for Blueskin Bay estuary. © 2022 The Royal Society of New Zealand.",About Sufficiency
Controversy in wind energy construction projects: How social systems impact project performance,"The energy industry strives to address a number of challenges—satisfy increasing energy demands, fulfill renewable energy policy requirements, and update aging infrastructure. Complicating energy projects are the controversies they can stir among stakeholders, sparking disagreements about environmental, economic, and aesthetic outcomes. Conflicts such as protests, petitions, or lawsuits can lead to schedule delays and cost overruns, which are difficult for project sponsors to predict. Using literature and news media, this study aims to identify trends in project controversies across energy projects. The study uses a mixed deductive and inductive content analysis to determine which actions, project phases, and stakeholders are discussed most frequently within both academic literature and news media. Using code cooccurrences, the study evaluates which stakeholders take specific actions at different project phases. Results show that the most active opposing stakeholders to energy development projects are community members, and actions opposing a project most frequently occur in the proposal phase. These results highlight the importance of engaging with communities early in project lifecycles. Opposition typically includes dissemination of information within communities, including letters to editors, internet newsletters, and public meetings. From this analysis, policy recommendations are provided for energy project sponsors to better anticipate and mitigate conflict. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Towards Addressing Unintended Environmental Consequences: A Planning Framework,"Efforts to decouple environmental impacts and resource consumption have been confounded by interactions and feedback between technical-economic, environmental and social aspects not considered prior to implementing improvement actions. This paper presents a planning framework that connects material flows and the socio-economic drivers that result in changes in these flows, in order to reduce conflicts between localized gains and global losses. The framework emphasizes the need for (i) having different settings of system boundaries (broader and narrower), (ii) explicitly accounting for causal relationships and feedback loops and (iii) identifying responsibilities between stakeholders (e.g. producers, consumers, collectors, recyclers, policy makers). Application of the framework is exemplified using the case of the global mobile phone product system. 'Product design and development' and 'Retailers and users as part of a collection system' were identified as central intervention points for implementing improvement strategies that included designing for longer life, designing for recycling and improving collection, designing for limiting phone hibernation time and internalizing external costs. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.",About Sufficiency
Adapting to changing climate risk by local government in New Zealand: institutional practice barriers and enablers,"Adaptation to climate change has been reviewed in several developed nations, but in none where consideration of the effects of climate change is required by statute and devolved to local government. We examine the role of institutional arrangements, the players operating under them, the barriers and enablers for adaptation decision-making in the developed nation of New Zealand. We examine how the roles and responsibilities between national, regional and local governments influence the ability of local government to deliver long-term flexible responses to changing climate risk. We found that the disciplinary practices of law, engineering and planning, within legal frameworks, result in the use of static mechanisms which create inflexible responses to changing risk. Several enablers are identified that could create greater integration between the different scales of government, including better use of national policy instruments, shared professional experience, standardised information collection and risk assessment methods that address uncertainties. The framing of climate risk as dynamic and changing that differentiates activities over their lifetime, development of mechanisms to fund transitions towards transformational change, are identified as necessary conditions for delivering flexible responses over time. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",About Sufficiency
Comprehensive local climate policy: The role of urban governance,"Given that climate change is a complicated collective action problem, local governments need a comprehensive approach to tackle climate change issues. Comprehensive climate policies concern an integrated approach in planning and implementing of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. Yet, not all local governments are actively engaged in global climate issues in a comprehensive manner. Why does local government's commitment on comprehensive climate change policy vary? This study analyzes the influences of urban climate change governance arrangements on the level of comprehensiveness in city-level climate change policies, using case studies of four cities. Urban climate change governance arrangement that includes researchers, NGO (Nongovernmental Organization) s along with public officials is a necessary factor for a city government to develop comprehensive climate policy. The case studies illustrate that cities with well-developed climate change governing organizations (Seattle and Seoul) present comprehensive climate change policy. Urban climate governance arrangements set the climate action agenda and promote implementation schemes. However, Anaheim and Busan have neither well developed urban governance arrangements nor comprehensive climate policies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Operationalizing the social-ecological systems framework to assess sustainability,"Environmental governance is more effective when the scales of ecological processes are well matched with the human institutions charged with managing human-environment interactions. The social-ecological systems (SESs) framework provides guidance on how to assess the social and ecological dimensions that contribute to sustainable resource use and management, but rarely if ever has been operationalized for multiple localities in a spatially explicit, quantitative manner. Here, we use the case of small-scale fisheries in Baja California Sur, Mexico, to identify distinct SES regions and test key aspects of coupled SESs theory. Regions that exhibit greater potential for social-ecological sustainability in one dimension do not necessarily exhibit it in others, highlighting the importance of integrative, coupled system analyses when implementing spatial planning and other ecosystem-based strategies.",About Sufficiency
Influencing factors of urban residents' willingness to pay for green housings from the perspective of generalized trust:Evidence from some first-tier cities in China,"The promotion and use of the green housing is an important way to reduce building energy consumption and achieve emission reduction targets. Based on the perspective of generalized trust, starting from the internal psychological factors and external situational factors, the research model for the influencing factors of urban residents' willingness to pay for green housing is systematically constructed. And the first-order and higher-order moderating effects of generalized trust and the boundary conditions influencing the effect are explored. The results show that, for internal psychological factors, generalized trust has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between green residential cognition and willingness to pay, but it is vulnerable to the negative influence of loss aversion psychology. Generalized trust has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between residents' environmental concern and willingness to pay, and is susceptible to the positive influence of residents' advertising appeals (source reliability appeals and self-interest appeals). Generalized trust has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between residents' moral identity and willingness to pay, and is easily affected by residents' high construal level. For external situational factors, generalized trust has a significant positive regulating effect on the relationship between social atmosphere/group pressure and willingness to pay. And the authoritative certification mark helps to increase residents' initial trust in green housing, and promote the formation of social atmosphere in which residents actively purchase green housing.

Unlocking Urbanization: The symbiotic relationship between inclusive finance and urban development in China,"The emergence and development of inclusive finance has made it possible for more economic entities to have easy access to a wider selection of financial services. This shift has significantly addressed the financial challenges inherent in the process of urbanization, making it a driver of the process of urban development. Therefore, this paper provides empirical evidence on the relationship between financial inclusion development and urbanization construction in China using provincial data and a panel-VAR model. The results show that: (1) There is a significant co-integration relationship among inclusive finance, urbanization, government support, and real estate development. (2) Inclusive finance has a long-term positive impact effect on urbanization. (3) Population urbanization has a positive impact on inclusive finance, but income urbanization has a negative impact on inclusive finance. To effectively promote the development of inclusive finance and urbanization, the following measures are of utmost importance: Firstly, while accelerating urbanization construction, it is necessary to expand and enhance the coverage of financial services. This will ensure that multiple regions can benefit from financial services. Secondly, to meet the diverse needs of different regions, more targeted financial products should be developed, making full use of the advantages of inclusive finance. Lastly, the government should strengthen its supervision of financial institutions and reduce the risks associated with inclusive finance, thereby ensuring a positive interaction between inclusive finance and urbanization development. © 2024 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Can indigenous transborder migrants affect environmental governance in their communities of origin? Evidence from Mexico,"Despite high rates of out-migration, Mexican indigenous communities play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation. However, little is known about migrants’ role in environmental management. This research brief explores the case of the Purépecha of San Pedro Ocumicho, Michoacán, and its transborder community in the Coachella Valley of California. We find that migrants maintain strong cultural ties to their community of origin. However, many are undocumented, are unable to access steady and well-paid employment, and would be unable to return to California were they to visit Mexico. Furthermore, government structures in Ocumicho are weak, providing few opportunities for migrants to contribute. These factors currently preclude migrants from influencing environmental decision making in their home community. Our findings point to the need for more comprehensive and longitudinal studies to better document and explain the variations in migrant support for environmental governance in their communities of origin. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",About Sufficiency
Can data center green reform facilitate urban green technology innovation? Evidence from China,"With the expansion of the digital information industry, the size of global data centers is exploding. As part of a high-energy-consuming industry, data centers can support sustainable urban development through green transformation. This study uses a quasi-natural experiment of China’s national green data center pilot policy implemented in 2015 to examine the impact of data center green transformation on green technology innovation in cities. Using a difference-in-difference (DID) analysis, this study finds that the national green data center pilot policy leads to higher levels of green technology innovation in cities, but the spillover effect of the policy on neighboring cities is insignificant. The mechanism test showed that the national green data center pilot policy could facilitate urban green technological innovation through capital deepening, market competition, and industrial agglomeration. In addition, the policy impact is more pronounced for cities with poorer environments, less civilization, high levels of network infrastructure, and more innovative endowments. The findings can provide new guidance for cleaner regional production from the standpoint of data center green development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",About Sufficiency
Driving Urban Transitions—Digital-Twin Solutions,"The pandemic has promoted an accelerated socioeconomic transformation enabled by digital transition generating a “new normal” and raising new potentials for responding to the grand challenges of climate change mitigation and creating net-zero neighbourhoods. Urban governance is crucial to realizing the full benefits of the twin digital and green revolutions promoted by visions of the 15-min city and liveable neighbourhoods. However, delivery of the 15-min city as a net-zero neighbourhood depends on effectively securing “win–win” policy co-benefits supporting climate change mitigation actions from a top-down perspective, allied to bottom-up open governance promoting co-design and co-development of urban plan solutions. This chapter outlines the concept of a smart urban governance model that deploys satellite-derived (Copernicus) intelligence to promote enhanced ICT-enabled tools. The model combines top-down and bottom-up urban planning processes in delivering climate change mitigation commitments at the urban scale. Finally, the chapter addresses research questions concerning the relevance of this Smarticipate as an open, integrated, and interoperable urban governance and planning model. The conclusions reflect the application of a digital-twin ensemble with Copernicus-derived methodologies, for the development of new models in the future new normal. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",About Sufficiency
Conflict Governance between Protected Areas and Surrounding Communities: Willingness and Behaviors of Communities—Empirical Evidence from Tanzania,"Under the dual pressures of climate change and human activities, the restrictions imposed by conservation policies, along with the increasing overlap between wildlife protected areas (PAs) and community living areas, have intensified the contradictions and conflicts between PAs and surrounding communities. Effective governance of such conflicts is particularly crucial to reconciling the contradictions between conservation and development. This study takes the Mikumi–Selous areas in Tanzania, Africa, as a case study. Through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, it explores the current state of conflicts between PAs and communities in the study area and summarizes conflict governance measures. Moreover, this research focuses on identifying various factors that influence the conservation willingness and action of community residents, further validating the relationships between residents’ household characteristics, conservation costs and benefits, conservation cognition, willingness, and behaviors through empirical analysis methods. The results indicate that residents’ conservation cognition significantly positively impacts their conservation willingness and behaviors, while conservation willingness also positively affects their conservation behaviors. Additionally, it was found that conservation costs inhibit residents’ conservation willingness and behaviors. This study primarily explores, from a community governance perspective, the participation willingness and behaviors of core stakeholders in conflict governance, emphasizing the critical role of community involvement in achieving biodiversity conservation and coordinated community development and providing a new perspective for alleviating conservation and development issues. © 2024 by the authors.",About Sufficiency

Capacity-building initiatives to implement the climate change convention in Africa,"Capacity-building has long been recognized by African countries as one of the principal issues to be urgently addressed in order to support national and regional initiatives to effectively implement the provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in ways that contribute to their efforts aimed at achieving sustainable development. This chapter briefly outlines the ecological and socio-economic impacts of projected climate change on Africa, and identifies the key capacity-building needs and concerns of African countries as described in their national communications, as well as in published literature. These needs include the capacity to (i) prepare national inventories of greenhouse gases; (ii) assess impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change; (iii) undertake greenhouse gas mitigation analysis in major sectors of the economies; (iv) elaborate on education, training and public awareness programmes; and (v) cooperate in the development and transfer of climate friendly technologies. Other needs relate to capacities to mainstream the adaptation to climate change and thereby integrate the implementation of adaptation and mitigation measures within the framework of implementing national sustainable development plans and strategies. Since the process for preparing national communications was not designed as the principal vehicle for identifying capacity-building needs and concerns, some of the needs identified within the initial national communications lack specificity and clarity of prioritization in the context of national Climate Change and Africa, ed.

There is an urgent need for adequate and predictable bilateral and multilateral assistance to help build the human and institutional capabilities of African countries to fully utilize the opportunities offered by the UNFCCC to advance the process of achieving sustainable development. African countries must therefore evaluate their options more closely and provide the needed political, financial and institutional support so that capacities built with donor support to address climate change would be sustainable. © Cambridge University Press 2005.",About Sufficiency
Getting Londoners on two wheels: A comparative approach analysing London's potential pathways to a cycling transition,"This article compares the current state of cycling in London to the Amsterdam cycling transition of the 1970s, applying the Multi-Level Perspective to identify potential pathways and obstacles to the wider adoption of the cycling niche in London. Our approach is two-pronged, consisting of a historical perspective to analyse the cycling transition in Amsterdam, and a policy analysis in contemporary London, based on semi-structured interviews with respondents involved in London's cycling policy. We identify factors that reinforce cycling's niche status in London, thus making the wider adoption of cycling more challenging than it was in Amsterdam. Based on our comparison, we also highlight policy, infrastructure and cultural changes that will aid in promoting a cycling transition in London. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Local heat stroke prevention plans in Japan: Characteristics and elements for public health adaptation to climate change,"The adverse health effects from hot weather and heat waves represent significant public health risks in vulnerable areas worldwide. Rising temperatures due to climate change are aggravating these risks in a context of fast urbanization, population growth and societal ageing. However, environmental heat-related health effects are largely preventable through adequate preparedness and responses. Public health adaptation to climate change will often require the implementation of heat wave warning systems and targeted preventive activities at different levels. While several national governments have established such systems at the country level, municipalities do not generally play a major role in the prevention of heat disorders. This paper analyzes selected examples of locally operated heat-health prevention plans in Japan. The analysis of these plans highlights their strengths, but also the need of local institutions for assistance to make the transition towards an effective public health management of high temperatures and heat waves. It can also provide useful elements for municipal governments in vulnerable areas, both in planning their climate change and health adaptation activities or to better protect their communities against current health effects from heat. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",About Sufficiency
Advancing responses to climate change through improved interplay between planning theory and practice,"Many planning agencies worldwide now see climate change response as unavoidable. This paper proposes that a central task for contemporary planning theory is to guide planning practice as it develops multi-dimensional responses. We examine three theoretical constructs: anticipatory governance, legitimacy and social-ecological resilience. We argue that each conceptualises challenges climate change presents to planning practice, while providing theoretically informed options for responses. Building on this, we utilize Friedmann’s [2008. “The Uses of Planning Theory: A Bibliographic Essay.” Journal of Planning Education and Research 28 (2): 247–257. doi:10.1177/0739456X08325220] tasks for planning theory as a framework to assess the utility of planning theories to guide climate change response through practice. Associated issues are discussed, including the influence of translatable planning theories and the value of importing knowledge from other disciplines.

"A social-ecological-technological system approach to just nature-based solutions: A case of digital participatory mapping of meaningful places in a marginalized neighborhood in Copenhagen, Denmark","Systems-based frameworks offer a promising opportunity to integrate smart and green city approaches to create positive contributions to urban sustainability. In particular, digital public participatory GIS (PPGIS) presents a tool for combining technological approaches to urban planning with an agenda for more just nature-based solutions (NBS) by elucidating community voices and subjective perspectives. In this study, we investigate the potential for PPGIS to support more just and inclusive planning and implementation of NBS in a marginalized housing area (Hørgården) in Copenhagen, Denmark. Combining digital PPGIS with qualitative approaches, we identify residents’ meaningful places, narratives about community priorities and needs, and relational values expressed therein. We identify three key findings: (1) an absence of demographic difference in meaningful places identified in Hørgården; (2) a core-periphery structure in the presence of relational value and distribution of sites identified as unsafe or in need of care that is the inverse of that found in Danish policy discourse, and (3) the essential role of qualitative, community-engaged, and reflexive approaches to PPGIS in deriving these results. Based on these findings we conclude that smart technologies like digital PPGIS, framed within systems-based approaches and utilized in locally sensitive and responsive ways, can contribute to more just NBS for sustainable cities by connecting local neighborhood experience to municipal planning and policy agendas. © 2023 The Authors",About Sufficiency

"Sustainable action and motivation: Pathways for individuals, institutions and humanity","Sustainable Action and Motivation proposes individual competencies and institutional policies that can help overcome the motivational hurdles that hamper sustainable action. Following the Paris Agreement of 2015 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the political momentum urgently to begin the drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has increased significantly. Affluent, high-income OECD countries are expected to take the lead in the global transition to a low carbon society. Given this, we need a better understanding of the motivational problems that people in affluent countries face with acting sustainably. This book investigates the above questions by analysing three fundamentally different perspectives: individuals and their motivation to act sustainably; institutions who take responsibility for issuing policies that steer us towards taking sustainable action; and humanity, each individual member of which ought to understand his or her non-sustainable behaviour in relation to the continued existence of the collective of human beings. Using theories from empirical psychology and a phenomenological approach to the research, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of practical philosophy, psychology of motivation and environmental psychology, as well as policymakers looking for ways to implement effective policies that encourage pro-environmental behaviour. © 2020 Roland Mees.",About Sufficiency

"Intergenerational Preparedness: Climate Change, Community Interest Obligations and the Environmental Rule of Law","This article argues that the protection of ‘community interests’ in international law includes intertemporal obligations of States, in cases where it is scientifically foreseeable that preserving the ‘status quo’ of a protected community interest is increasingly unlikely. The argument is developed for climate change as a ‘common concern of humankind’ and based on the premise that even if a temperature limitation of 1.5°C would be achieved towards the end of this century, future generations will nevertheless live in a world that has fundamentally changed due to current policy and law choices. The article introduces the new concept of ‘intergenerational preparedness’ to operationalise and expand the normative scope of the principle of intergenerational equity. While some argumentative structures will be examined where intergenerational preparedness can be given effect through legal interpretation, the expectation that States must adopt preparatory measures to account for their community interest obligations deserves a more explicit recognition. It is a matter of the (environmental) rule of law to protect community interests on a time continuum, and this encompasses measures to prevent the deterioration of protected interests and to prepare communities for foreseeable detrimental changes. © 2023 The Authors.

The public participated mainly in group discussions with the other professional organisations, and they were being consulted through in-depth interviews and by giving basic information through observation and secondary data. Within the Typology of Participation in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) model, this public participation could be classified as interactive participation. That is, the poverty alleviation policy was originally one of the Royal Development Projects; the environmental committee was formed to include the external and local representatives.

Climate-smart livelihood strategies in rural and urban communities in eastern Zimbabwe: an in-depth literature study,"Implementation of climate-smart livelihood strategies in communities is central to reducing impacts of climate shocks. Although the communities are vulnerable to climate variability, the magnitude of vulnerability depends on the choice of livelihood strategies being implemented. This paper applied a realist synthesis method to evaluate peer-reviewed literature on climate-smart livelihood strategies pursued in southern Africa in general and eastern Zimbabwe in particular. A holistic analysis of all climate variables was applied to adequately assess rural and urban communities’ adaptive strategies at micro-level. Accordingly, this review gave a nuanced analysis of vulnerability that frames the context in which communities’ livelihoods are affected by the increasing climate variability and extreme events. The review highlighted agriculture that involves forestry, crop and livestock farming as the predominant livelihoods in rural communities while crop farming and petty business dominates the informal economy as the core livelihoods in urban communities. Literature established the transformation of agriculture to climate smart practices that increase productivity and enhance the resilience of livelihoods. However, climate smart agriculture practices are not entirely new concepts. Most communities have always engaged in a variety of unorthodox farming methods to combat the impacts of climate variability and induced food insecurity. Given the right financial, technical and policy support, the communities are capable of constructing climate-smart livelihood strategies that are context specific. Fundamentally, the paper recommends that public and private institutions should develop capabilities to assess the impacts of climate related scenarios on vulnerable social groups to empower them to formulate bankable livelihood projects. © 2020 The Society of South African Geographers.",About Sufficiency
From NIMBY to acceptance: Toward a novel framework - VESPA - For organizing and interpreting community concerns,"Despite the prevailing national support for renewable energy development, the installation of wind energy turbines at the local level is often met with resistance. Opposition is commonly attributed to NIMBYism (Not-In-My-Back-Yard), which implies selfishness, ignorance, and irrationality on behalf of residents. This article examines the factors that lead to community support and opposition. Based on an in-depth literature review and surveys conducted in three Massachusetts towns, the author discards NIMBY as a valid explanation and proposes a novel framework (VESPA) for organizing community concerns into four categories-visual/landscape, environmental, socioeconomic, and procedural. By comprehensively assessing local concerns, VESPA seeks to help policy makers approach communities more effectively and thereby achieve wider acceptance of wind installations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",About Sufficiency
"Democratising planetary boundaries: experts, social values and deliberative risk evaluation in Earth system governance","Recent debates about the concept of planetary boundaries recall longstanding concerns about whether ecological limits are compatible with ecological democracy. The planetary boundaries framework (originally set out in Rockström et al., 2009a, 2009b) defines values for key Earth-system processes such as climate change and biodiversity that aim to maintain a ‘safe’ distance from thresholds or levels that could endanger human wellbeing. Despite having a significant impact in policy debates, the framework has been criticised as implying an expert-driven approach to governing global environmental risks that lacks democratic legitimacy. Drawing on research on deliberative democracy and the role of science in democratic societies, we argue that planetary boundaries can be interpreted in ways that remain consistent with democratic decision-making. We show how an iterative, dialogical process to formulate planetary boundaries and negotiate ‘planetary targets’ could form the basis for a democratically legitimate division of labour among experts, citizens and policy-makers in evaluating and responding to Earth-system risks. Crucial to this division of evaluative labour is opening up space for deliberative contestation about the value judgments inherent in collective responses to Earth-system risks, while also safeguarding the ability of experts to issue warnings about what they consider to be unacceptable risks. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Contested Urban Green Spaces and Environmental Justice in Northern Europe,"The chapter provides an overview of the objectives, structure, content and results of this joint volume. Starting from the paradox of well-known green space benefits on the one hand and multiple challenges to their fair provision on the other hand, the book argues to put green space contestations and environmental justice concerns into focus when striving for a sustainable city development. As the edited volume unites interdisciplinary and multi-method studies on green space use and planning, it enriches environmental justice studies by widening the understanding of green space access, critically evaluating cases of procedural injustice and providing in-depth studies on the contexts of injustices in urban greening. Based on the results of these studies, a future research agenda is proposed in this introductory chapter. © The Author(s) 2022.",About Sufficiency
The New European Development Scoreboard for SDG11 at the European Level,"Urban development is a current priority in terms of improving the sustainability of cities amid demographic pressure and intensive economic development in the European Union. In this context, we aim to critically analyze the progress achieved by the European Member States in the period of 2010–2022 from the perspective of Sustainable Development Goal 11—Sustainable Cities and Communities—and conceptualize the new development scoreboard from the perspective of SDG11. The methods used consist in applying principal components analysis for a set of 15 sustainability indicators related to the studied objective and designing the new sustainability index from the perspective of the ODD11 and the European ranking. The results of the study will allow for the formulation of public policies useful for European decision makers to improve the progress made relating to this objective, and we believe that their implementation could support the transformation of European cities in a sustainable and equitable way. © 2024 by the authors.",About Sufficiency

A systems approach for health/environment/climate co-benefits in cities,,About Sufficiency
Aligning global environmental and local urban issues,"India’s population of 1.21 billion (in 2011) makes it the second most populous country in the world. About 31% of India’s population lives in urban areas and the urban population has exhibited a higher decadal growth rate (31.8%) than its rural counterpart (12.2%), indicating that the country is urbanizing at a rapid pace. With an increasing number of people living in urban areas, the GHG emissions and environmental problems have also increased, owing to lacunae in urban planning and management. These GHG emissions ultimately contribute to climate change at both local and global levels. Therefore, measures to deal with climate change need to focus on both mitigation and adaptation. This study examines the status of a climate co-benefits approach in Indian cities, illustrated through various sectoral case studies. The study also attempts to examine how environmental issues in Indian cities align with local development issues. It discusses the context of climate and environmental co-benefits in urban India and relates it to urban policies. Implementation of the ACCCRN programme in three cities—Indore, Surat and Gorakhpur—is discussed to highlight climate change resilience issues at the local level and their environmental and social benefits. The final section deals with the future perspectives of integrating a climate co-benefits approach in urban development especially in light of the ‘100 Smart City Mission’ of India. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2018.",About Sufficiency
Climate resilient smart cities: Opportunities for innovative solutions in India,"India’s overall exposure to climate-induced risks—such as cyclones, extreme rainfall, riverine floods, heat waves, and disease outbreaks—is causing large-scale damage to many states as well as unprecedented economic loss in cities. Since the late 2000s, the Government of India has been actively trying to incorporate climate change within the country’s development goals. Inclusion of the Climate Change Department within the Ministry of Environment and Forestry is one such initiative. This initiative has had some success in preserving biodiversity, but has contrastingly led to limited actions in cities, which function under the Ministry of Urban Development. In cities, most urban administrators have a short tenure ranging from 1 to 3 years, while political representative such as the Mayor has a maximum term of 4 years, thus making it difficult for them to deal with challenges that are probable 10–20 years in the future. Further, the magnitude of developmental challenges given rapid urban migration has led urban managers to address the immediate basic needs of citizens rather than plan for future eventualities, both in terms of climate change adaptation/mitigation and future population growth. The lack of inclusion within government programs, lack of incentives, increasing exposure, and spending for coping has created opportunities for individuals, communities, and institutions to design and implement resilience measures to address the problems of shocks and stresses that arise from climate extremes. This chapter highlights some of the wicked challenges faced by smart city initiatives in the context of climate change and offers innovative solutions to address them across scales and in time. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",About Sufficiency
"POLICY MIXES FOR ADDRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES: Conceptual Foundations, Empirical Operationalisation, and Policy Implications","This chapter provides an introductory primer for academic researchers and policy practitioners to understand and apply the policy mix perspective in developing transformative solutions for tackling global environmental challenges. By comparing and synthesising currently divergent understandings of policy mixes across different research disciplines, an extended framework is introduced to better incorporate different conceptual blocks - the policy mix element, associated policy processes, and resulting policy mix characteristics - in systematically investigating the role of policy mixes for addressing environmental challenges. Two standard approaches for delineating complex policy mixes - the top-down and the bottom-up approach - are discussed as a guideline for analysts interested in investigating real-world policy mixes. Taking global climate change as an illustrative example, the chapter then showcases the insights that can be generated by applying this extended policy mix perspective and how it thereby can inform real-world policy formulation, implementation, and evaluation activities. As a concluding remark, three promising research areas - transformative change, multi-level governance settings, and policy regime reconfigurations - are suggested to further advance our understanding of addressing real-world pressing environmental challenges through policy mixes. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Helge Jörgens, Christoph Knill, and Yves Steinebach; individual chapters, the contributors.",About Sufficiency
"Do We Need Public Green Spaces Accessibility Standards for the Sustainable Development of Urban Settlements? The Evidence from Wrocław, Poland","Public green spaces (PGSs) have a positive impact on the health and wellbeing of urban residents. However, their accessibility can be limited due to high urbanisation pressures and inadequate or insufficient regulatory provisions. This problem has been recognised for Central European cities, of which Wrocław is an example, where the provision of PGS accessibility has not received major attention in recent decades, and the planning system has been in constant transformation since the transition from a centrally planned to a free-market economy. This study therefore aimed to examine the distribution and accessibility of PGSs in the expanding area of Wrocław today and upon implementation of the plans under the proposed standards. These analyses were performed using the QGIS application, network analysis, and the ISO-Area as polygon algorithm. The findings revealed a conspicuous lack of available PGSs, which includes areas above 2 ha, such as district and neighbourhood parks. New PGSs are now being planned, but even so, part of the residential areas will remain outside their catchment zone. The results obtained provide strong evidence that it is essential that standards should be a tool implemented in urban planning, and that the adopted procedure can be transferred to other cities. © 2023 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Advancing sustainable consumption and production in cities - A transdisciplinary research and stakeholder engagement framework to address consumption-based emissions and impacts,"Urban consumption patterns and lifestyles are increasingly important for the sustainability of cities today and in the future. However, considerations of consumption issues, social norms, behaviour and lifestyles within current urban sustainability research and practices are limited. Much untapped potential for the reduction of the environmental footprint of cities exists in combined production and consumption-based approaches, particularly in the “demand” areas of mobility, housing, food, and waste. To change unsustainable consumption and production patterns in cities, research needs to be transdisciplinary, actively involving stakeholders through co-creation processes. This paper builds on the premise that the perspectives and approaches of Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) for cities require the involvement of non-traditional stakeholders that are generally not included in urban planning processes such as social change initiatives, citizen groups and informal sector representatives. We present a transdisciplinary research and engagement framework to understand and advance the transition to sustainable SCP patterns and lifestyles in cities. This transdisciplinary approach to SCP transformations in cities combines co-creation, participatory visioning processes and back-casting methods, participatory urban governance and institutional change, and higher-order learning from small-scale community initiatives. We illustrate our conceptual framework through three empirical case studies in cities which take an integrative approach to lowering ecological footprints and carbon emissions. © 2018",About Sufficiency
Intermediaries’ perspectives on the public's role in the energy transitions needed to deliver UK climate change policy goals,"There is now a large body of research into public understanding of climate change and energy challenges. There is however little empirical examination of how actors from politics, government, civil society and non-governmental organisations regard the role of public engagement in climate and energy policy. Research is lacking as to their views on the desirability of active citizen participation or indeed whether they draw on the findings from social science research in forming strategies and policy. This paper presents an analysis of interviews with policy experts and deliberative seminars held with non-governmental stakeholders acting in an intermediary capacity between climate policy and the public. A comparison of four policy scenarios was used to explore intermediaries’ beliefs about the role of the public in delivering the UK's Climate Change Act targets. The results reveal a general antipathy to policies that seek to ‘engage’ the public and a lack of knowledge amongst seminar participants about how insights from the social sciences can be used to build and sustain public engagement. This research exposes the need to assess the means by which public engagement can better be understood, integrated and most effectively utilised for sustainable progression towards climate targets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Towards sustainable urban water management: an ecological compensation framework for sponge cities,"Rapid urbanization and climate change have intensified water-related challenges in urban areas, requiring innovative solutions for sustainable water management. This study critically examines China’s sponge city initiative, which integrates green infrastructure and ecological principles to enhance urban water resilience. The research identifies key challenges, including inadequate planning, design inconsistencies, and financial sustainability issues, which hinder the full realization of ecosystem service benefits. To address these gaps, we propose a novel ecological compensation framework that integrates the ecosystem services framework with urban planning and public payment mechanisms. Our four-step methodology leverages low impact development practices to enhance policy efficacy, aligning urban development with ecological integrity and sustainability. By transitioning from ecosystem service recognition to a publicly funded compensation model, this approach ensures the financial viability of sponge city projects, fosters broad societal participation, and supports resilient urban development. Importantly, the developed framework is adaptable, making it applicable to sponge city initiatives worldwide. It offers a flexible, evidence-based strategy for cities facing similar water management challenges, promoting ecological resilience while ensuring long-term financial sustainability. This study contributes to global urban water management discourse, providing a scalable model that supports integrated, community-backed urban planning and sets a new standard for sponge city development. © 2024 The Author(s).

From federal to city mitigation and adaptation: Climate change policy in Mexico City,"Climate change is projected to affect Latin America and the Caribbean as a result of increased temperatures and changed rainfall patterns. The impacts of climate change are expected to be unevenly distributed throughout the region, due to differences in geographic location, demographic pressures, levels of poverty, and natural resource dependence. To date, few studies have explored these impacts and the governmental responses to cope with them at a city scale. This article examines the challenges faced by the Mexico City government as it translates the federal climate change policy into successful mitigation and adaptation. It analyzes climate change impacts on Mexico and Mexico City (also known as the Federal District), the federal and city’s mitigation and adaptation responses, and advances and contradictions in the implementation of these strategies at the national and city levels. Similar problems have limited the effectiveness of these actions at both the federal and city levels, including the overexploitation of natural resources, a lack of climate information and monitoring systems, and the subordination of climate change strategies to the objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. These problems have resulted in poor coordination and collaboration among various levels of government to cope with climate change, in addition to avoiding local capacity building, particularly in regard to forest conservation. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",About Sufficiency

Circular sharing: Community-initiated free(cycling) markets/workshops encouraging reuse in Singapore,"This paper examines community-initiated free(cycling) markets/workshops as emerging frontiers of a sharing and circular economy in Singapore. Research on sharing platforms have frequently underscored the significance of digital networks in catalysing temporary access to goods/services. As a departure from this, we shift our attention to sharing arenas involving the physical co-presence of actors and objects. Drawing on an ethnographic study of three case studies, we illustrate how free(cycling) markets entail not just the sharing of material resources but also more-than-material ones such as skills, knowledge, labour and time. These more-than-material resources are pivotal in sustaining sharing collectives, but have been glossed over in the literature. In particular, we coin the term ‘circular sharing’ to illuminate the overlaps in how sharing and circularity have been conceived. We contend that these ideas are complementary; ‘sharing’ highlights the socio-relational dimensions of closing resource circularity loops while ‘circularity’ gives weight to the recirculation of resources that sharing engenders. Additionally, we evaluate the pitfalls and potentials of circular sharing markets/workshops in Singapore, especially in terms of how they can help to realise a transformative sharing/circular society. Taken together, this paper is instructive in fostering a productive dialogue between the scholarship on circular and sharing economies. © 2025 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Community engagement and sustainability: Two cases of implementation of mini-grids in Lesotho,"Based on a survey of two Lesotho communities, this study assessed the type of governance of energy that favours the emergence of energy democracy or community energy. It established that the centralized energy governance of Semonkong seems less effective in solving conflicts compared to the decentralized energy governance of Ha-Makebe. Poor communication and lack of will to respond to community needs caused dissatisfaction and misunderstanding towards the centralized energy project. The study found that the decentralized energy project was more likely to be sustainable because it was characterized by community participation and engagement. The findings also revealed that the satisfaction of energy consumers results from a consistent supply of energy accompanied by responsiveness to community needs as opposed to a cheap inconsistent electricity supply. The implications are that the Semonkong plant’s sustainability is at risk, and the project may collapse unless the Government of Lesotho, in the short term, engages with the community regarding its concerns. © The Author(s) 2023.",About Sufficiency
Sustainability-oriented innovations in smart cities: A systematic review and emerging themes,"The purpose of the paper is to clarify the relationship between sustainability-oriented innovations (SOI) and smart city development based on the systematic review of existing literature in the field. As an outcome of the review process, 159 articles were carefully selected for the in-depth analysis of the inter-linked concepts of smart city and sustainability-oriented innovations. The results show a growing trend of research papers in this field, especially in the last five years. The findings show the significance of a systemic multi-dimensional view of innovations for the smart sustainable development of cities. We have identified four main perspectives through which the scholars discourse the SOI dimensions in the smart city context: technology perspective, organizational perspective, social innovation perspective with citizen engagement, as well as system-level changes with innovation ecosystems. Second, we have recognized various focused themes under each main perspective. The various types of innovations also have impacts on different components of smart cities. Although the technological innovation perspectives dominate, and governance aspects are also paid attention to in recent studies, the increasing amount of research outputs also report on the developments of other components and perspectives, such as new human-centric approaches like citizen engagement. © 2022 The Authors",About Sufficiency
"Process, Resource, People and Change (PRPC) approach to city infrastructure sustainability in context of climate change","This paper provides a general understanding of the various approaches to city sustainability and weather and how the current approaches are useful to deal with climate change. A working definition of sustainability is provided, then various approaches to sustainability are reviewed, and a process based approach is proposed for assessing infrastructures sustainability. Sustainability is continuous improvement in the following three domains: minimization and optimization of resource consumption, fundamental health and well being of people, and innovating and perusing ways to manage change. The current approaches to sustainability: ranking, indicators, urban footprint, metabolism and extended metabolism are reviewed, as well as the combination of footprint and indicators in city sustainability assessment. In addition, the application of mathematical models in sustainability is also discussed. Based on the review and analysis it was found that current models for city sustainability do not consider human health and climate change explicitly into the decision making. Moreover, all the approaches to date are parameter based and a process based approach to infrastructure sustainability is necessary. The proposed Process, Resource, People and Change (PRPC) approach to sustainability will enable cities to factor resource usage reduction, climate change adaptation and people's health and well being in the infrastructure related decision making.",About Sufficiency

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DIVERSITY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE ROAD TO GREEN ECONOMY,"Purpose: The chapter analyses the diversity of the European Union (EU) member states in terms of the transition to a sustainable, green, and just economy.Need for the study: Sustainable development is an important concern that the EU approaches by aiming to transition to a greener economy, fairly and inclusively. Moreover, the actual context, post-pandemic period and ongoing war at the EU border, makes the social and economic development of the EU countries matter even more in the light of this just transition. Methodology: The authors relied on a multidimensional approach, using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The cluster analysis allowed us to group the countries in such a way that made it possible to identify the best and worst performers, as well as certain patterns that can be the basis for the formulation of good practices and transferable to the states that need more support in the transition to a green economy.Findings: The results indicated that EU member states can be grouped into five clusters, each needing specific policies to ensure sustainable and inclusive development. Denmark, Finland, and Sweden turned out the best performers, while Estonia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, and Romania proved to have the most unfavourable situation.Practical implications: The findings provide relevant policy implication insights for policy decision-makers in the field of green economy, economic development, and social policies, with directions for future research. © 2024 by Maria Denisa Vasilescu, Mădălina Ecaterina Popescu, Larisa Stănilă and Eva Militaru Published under exclusive licence by Emerald Publishing Limited.",About Sufficiency
The governance of collaboration for sustainable development: Exploring the “black box”,"Private sector collaboration for sustainable development remains a “black box” in terms of collaborative governance mechanisms: the specific arrangements or types of collaboration used by multiple actors to come together and implement and oversee rules to align their efforts towards shared goals. Therefore, a theoretical framework is needed to guide the design of collaborative efforts towards the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) . We address such a need, using a systematic literature review to conceptualize the main dimensions of collaborative governance (hierarchy, formalization, centralization), and the factors influencing the impact of collaborative governance choice on sustainable development outcomes. Our results highlight that there are different types of collaboration as a governance mechanism for progress towards Sustainable Development Goals and that alternative governance arrangements should be combined. We also found that the success of collaboration is contingent not only on governance-specific dimensions but also on the type of SDG and the type of partners involved. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency

Children's Green Infrastructure: Children and Their Rights to Nature and the City,"The development of green spaces in cities has corresponded to a need to deal with a series of socio-environmental and health problems felt in urban spaces. However, these are often fragmented or somewhat disconnected interventions that leave out vulnerable and subaltern groups like children, being also commonly based on strictly formatted designs, with more urban furniture than natural elements. In view of the need to make urban spaces healthier, safer, more resilient, and at the same time more child-friendly, in this Conceptual Analysis paper we build from the literature on Urban Green Spaces, Child-Friendly Cities and environments, and Children's Infrastructure to propose the concept of Children Green Infrastructure (CGI), and discuss its application to urban planning, foregrounding the need for fairer, more inclusive and participatory approaches. GGI derives from the Children Infrastructure concept but it puts at the center of the debate the idea of connecting children to nature where they live, learn and play. CGI is based on the assumption that nature should be transversal in urban planning processes, and that it must be perfectly integrated within urban infrastructures, ensuring access to all. Understanding children's needs and integrating their voices in urban planning and design processes are necessary conditions to moving forward to a fairer, more inclusive and truly collective urban project.

Planning paradise,"""Sprawl"" is one of the ugliest words in the American political lexicon. Virtually no one wants America's rural landscapes, farmland, and natural areas to be lost to bland, placeless malls, freeways, and subdivisions. Yet few of America's fast-growing rural areas have effective rules to limit or contain sprawl. Oregon is one of the nation's most celebrated exceptions. In the early 1970s Oregon established the nation's first and only comprehensive statewide system of land-use planning and largely succeeded in confining residential and commercial growth to urban areas while preserving the state's rural farmland, forests, and natural areas. Despite repeated political attacks, the state's planning system remained essentially politically unscathed for three decades. In the early- and mid-2000s, however, the Oregon public appeared disenchanted, voting repeatedly in favor of statewide ballot initiatives that undermined the ability of the state to regulate growth. One of America's most celebrated ""success stories"" in the war against sprawl appeared to crumble, inspiring property rights activists in numerous other western states to launch copycat ballot initiatives against land-use regulation. This is the first book to tell the story of Oregon's unique land-use planning system from its rise in the early 1970s to its near-death experience in the first decade of the 2000s. Using participant observation and extensive original interviews with key figures on both sides of the state's land use wars past and present, this book examines the question of how and why a planning system that was once the nation's most visible and successful example of a comprehensive regulatory approach to preventing runaway sprawl nearly collapsed. Planning Paradise is tough love for Oregon planning. While admiring much of what the state's planning system has accomplished, Walker and Hurley believe that scholars, professionals, activists, and citizens engaged in the battle against sprawl would be well advised to think long and deeply about the lessons that the recent struggles of one of America's most celebrated planning systems may hold for the future of land-use planning in Oregon and beyond. © 2011 by The University of Arizona Press All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Optimal governance radius of environmental information disclosure policy: Evidence from China,"Urban pollution governance requires the joint participation of government, society, and enterprises, with the environmental information disclosure policy serving as a novel tool to promote multi-stakeholder engagement. This study aims to delve into the impact of the environmental information disclosure policy on regional environmental quality by using data from Chinese cities. Through analysis, the study gets the following conclusions. Firstly, the environmental information disclosure policy not only effectively reduces urban environmental pollution but also exhibits an apparent spatial spillover effect. The impact of this policy on air pollution in neighboring cities shows an inverted U-shaped pattern of first rising and then falling, with the optimal radius of this external effect estimated at 250 km. Secondly, the results of the mechanism test indicate that government regulatory efforts and clean industry alternatives are essential channels for curbing urban environmental pollution. Lastly, the heterogeneity test shows that the inhibitory effect of the environmental information disclosure policy on environmental pollution is more pronounced in civilized cities, cities in the “two control zones”, sulfur dioxide control zones, and cities with high Pollution Information Transparency Index scores. © 2024 The Economic Society of Australia (Queensland) Inc.",About Sufficiency

Conflict or consensus? Stakeholders' willingness to participate in China's Sponge City program,"In 2015, China initiated the Sponge City Program (SCP), an integrated urban stormwater management strategy, to mitigate the paradoxical challenges of urban flooding and water shortages. Very few studies have attempted to examine the willingness to participate of multi-level stakeholders in the case of storm-water management initiatives. To address this gap in the existing body of knowledge, this study took Guyuan city, Ningxia Province, a Stage 2 pilot city located in the arid northwest region of the People's Republic of China, as a case study. Members of three key stakeholder groups were surveyed, i.e., government, commercial entities and communities, and a total of 687 valid questionnaires were obtained in the SCP. Via a logistic regression model, the results showed that: (1) the stakeholders reached a consensus during the participation process that they were motivated by personal benefits and expected to improve water usage through the participatory process; (2) the government represented the public interest by prioritizing the overall improvement of the urban water environment and improving standards of living by contributing to the program; (3) the commercial entities prioritized the acquisition of knowledge and technical issues relevant to their business operations, and expressed concerns about how these operations might be affected by stakeholder participation; (4) both the commercial and community groups were more willing to participate if they perceived that the SCP would affect their daily lives, and the general public were willing to participate for multiple reasons. This study will help to guide future studies to continuously explore the diverse factors that influence the stakeholder participation of diverse stakeholders. The findings can also benefit the design of future projects with a view to enhancing stakeholder participation. Recognizing the quantifiable benefits of the SCP, this paper demonstrates how the evaluation of diverse stakeholders' priorities and the assessment of the drivers for their willingness to participate can further benefit the implementation of sustainable urban water initiatives, as in the case of this megaproject, and their enduring success. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency

(2) The improvement of ICT significantly promotes the UGTE in these cities, and the promotional effect reaches a peak after a lag of 6 periods; the original UGTE also has a negative impact on the future ICT development level, and the negative impact reaches a peak after a lag of 6 periods. (3) The promotional effect of ICT on UGTE in resource-exhausted cities consists of being strongest in the eastern region (0.477⁎⁎⁎), then in the central region (0.233⁎⁎⁎), weaker in the western region (0.167⁎⁎), and weakest in the northeastern region (0.080*). (4) The improvement of energy structure, green innovation structure, and urban-rural consumption structure strengthens the promotional effect of ICT on UGTE in resource-exhausted cities. Finally, targeted policy recommendations were proposed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Towards a green world: how new urbanization affects green total factor carbon productivity,"Introduction: New urbanization is a powerful support for regional economic growth and green transformation. Methods: In this paper, we select data from 237 cities at prefecture level and above in China from 2010 to 2021 for quasi-experimental design, and investigate the effects of new urbanization policy pilots on urban green total factor productivity (GTFP) and its mechanism by constructing a multi-period difference-in-differences model. Results: The study finds that: a) the construction of new urbanization has a positive impact on promoting urban GTFP, and this result is verified by a series of robustness tests; b) the promotion of industrial structure upgrading, the facilitation of green technological innovation, and the reduction of the degree of resource mismatch all partially mediate the relationship between new urbanization and urban GTFP; c) environmental regulation and market integration both modulate the relationship between the construction of new urbanization and urban GTFP in positive directions; d) heterogeneity analysis shows that, in terms of the two-dimensional city attributes of ‘location-characteristics’, the increase in GTFP is more significant in eastern and central cities, and in non-resource cities; e) further analysis shows that the pilot policies of new urbanization have a spatial spillover effect on GTFP, and the policy spillover effects are mainly affected through mechanisms such as industrial structure upgrading in neighboring municipalities. Discussion: This study provides new ideas for the next stage of sustainable regional green development in China, thus promoting China's high-quality development with theoretical and practical significance.

Machine learning analysis of socioeconomic drivers in urban ozone pollution in Chinese cities,"The escalation of ground-level ozone (O3) pollution presents a significant challenge to the sustainable growth of Chinese cities. This study utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to investigate the intricate interplay between urban socioeconomic growth and O3 levels. Surpassing traditional environmental chemistry, it assesses the effectiveness of these algorithms in interpreting socioeconomic and environmental data, while elucidating urban development’s environmental impacts from a novel socioeconomic perspective. Key findings indicate that factors such as urban infrastructure, industrial activities, and demographic dynamics significantly influence O3 pollution. The study highlights the particular sensitivity of urban public transportation and population density, each exerting a unique and substantial effect on O3 levels. Additionally, the research identifies nuanced interactions among these factors, indicating a complex web of influences on urban O3 pollution. These interactions suggest that the impact of individual socioeconomic elements on O3 pollution is interdependent, being either amplified or mitigated by other factors. The study emphasizes the crucial need to integrate socioeconomic variables into urban O3 pollution strategies, advocating for policies tailored to each city’s distinct characteristics, informed by the detailed analysis provided by machine learning. This approach is essential for developing effective and nuanced urban pollution management strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",About Sufficiency
Role of green innovation technologies and urbanization growth for energy demand: Contextual evidence from G7 countries,"In the context of rising energy demand, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity in G7 countries, the prime objective of this research is to explore the role of green innovation technologies, economic progress, and urbanization in energy demand. The long-standing relationship between green innovation technologies, urbanization, trade, and G7 countries from 1990 to 2020 was analyzed using the Kao and Pedroni cointegration test, panel causality, and dynamic and fully modified ordinary least squares methods. Empirical findings suggest that trade, gross domestic product per capita, and urbanization enhance energy demand, whereas environmental technology reduces energy consumption. The econometric results support promoting environmental technologies (“smart technology,” renewable energy, carbon dioxide removal, and electric vehicles) as policy tools to reduce energy demand and achieve sustainable development goals related to clean energy, a pollution-free climate, and green growth. Moreover, an energy conservation policy is recommended to ensure efficient energy use in G7 countries. In addition, novel implications in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-7, 13) are discussed. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research",About Sufficiency
The impact of the new energy demonstration city policy on the green total factor productivity of resource-based cities: empirical evidence from a quasi-natural experiment in China,"The new energy demonstration city policy (NEDC), an essential economic system aiming to implement innovative development strategies and energy structure transformations in China, is crucial for solving the current plight of resource-based cities. This paper studies the effect of the implementation of the NEDC on the green total factor productivity (GTFP) of resource-based cities in China; understanding this relation is of great significance for the further promotion of the NEDC. For this purpose, the SBM-undesirable model is employed to measure GTFP. The propensity score matching and difference-in-difference (PSM-DID) model and the mediation effect model are also utilized to empirically examine the impact of the NEDC on GTFP across a dataset of 106 resource-based cities between 2005 and 2016. The empirical results indicate that the NEDC can significantly improve the GTFP of resource-based cities. After both counterfactual and common trend tests are performed, the research conclusion of this paper is still robust. Moreover, the NEDC promotes the GTFP of resource-based cities through structural effects, technological innovation effects, and fiscal support effects. Furthermore, the effect of the NEDC on GTFP is also affected by the regions, sizes, and types of the different resource-based cities. This research provides evidence for the ability of the NEDC to improve GTFP and optimize the spatial layout of new energy demonstration cities in resource-based cities. © 2021 Newcastle University.",About Sufficiency
"Full title: The performance evaluation of marine ecological civilization construction (MECC): A case study of coastal cities in Jiangsu Province, China","Conducting Marine Ecological Civilization Construction (MECC) will help to form the coordination of socio-economic, marine ecosystem, and stable marine society. How to evaluate the performance of MECC precisely is an urgent problem in the development of coastal areas. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation indices system consisting of 41 indicators and five dimensions was constructed to reflect the performance of MECC in three coastal cities of Jiangsu Province. Entropy and AHP methods were integrally used to determine the weight of each index, and then, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method was applied to depict the relative performance level of marine ecological civilization. The results showed that: (1) From 2011 to 2021, the MECC of Jiangsu coastal regions has gradually increased from 0.3649 to 0.5933, indicating that the development of Jiangsu is undergoing a transformation from resource intensive to environmentally friendly. (2) Different cities had different strengths in marine subsystem layer, with Lianyungang dominated by resource endowment, Yancheng capitalizing on its environmental strengths, and Nantong being significant in marine economic. (3) A decade long dynamic showed that Yancheng achieved the largest improvement by 84.82% from 2011 to 2021, followed by Nantong (69.48%) and Lianyungang (38.15%). (4) For further promoting MECC process, Jiangsu should strategically prioritize land-sea coordination, undertake comprehensive governance and waging a resolute battle for comprehensive marine governance in critical areas. The comprehensive performance evaluation indices system of MECC proposed in this study would be robust and reliable for application in other areas. Meanwhile, the results and recommendations of Jiangsu Province could be valuable for further enhancing MECC development and providing scientific bases for local decision-makers. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Understanding City 4.0: A Triple Bottom Line Approach,"Rapid urbanization and population increase, along with remarkable technological advances, have accelerated the speed of digital transformation, or at least the need for it, in our cities. Whilst being smart and sustainable is seen somewhat as an ideal city quality globally, a new city concept has emerged—the so-called City 4.0—that combines Industry 4.0 and Society 4.0 in the context of smart cities. While there is growing literature on the topic, there is limited understanding of City 4.0. This communication piece aims to bring clarity to City 4.0 by elaborating it from three diverse but interrelated perspectives—namely, societal, environmental, and economic lenses or domains (also know as the triple bottom line approach)—and highlights the key City 4.0 themes—namely, circularity, adaptability, livability, accessibility, authenticity, and responsibility. The methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current City 4.0 literature. This communication paper informs researchers, local and regional authorities, and urban planners on the rising importance of the notion of City 4.0 and its prospective research areas. © 2023 by the authors.",About Sufficiency

A new sustainability framework for urban underground space,"In the past two decades, great efforts have been made to develop sustainability solutions for the built environment. One way to measure the efficacy of such solutions is by using sustainability indicators. Greater use of underground space is one of the proposed solutions. However, a detailed review of the current construction sector sustainability indicator systems, such as the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method and Civil Engineering Environmental Quality Assessment and Awards Scheme, shows that there is a need for a bespoke sustainability indicator framework system tailored to urban underground space. The aim of this paper is to extend previous discussions about the role of underground space in urban areas, with the intention of addressing this shortfall. A new framework is proposed, called Uspear, developed on the basis of the Sustainable Project Appraisal Routine framework revised and restructured specifically for application on urban underground space projects. By the use of an innovative weighting system adopted through extensive stakeholder engagement, the new framework represents a comprehensive indicator framework for addressing sustainability in underground urban space projects. © 2018 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Integrating SDGs into China's ecological civilization construction: Practical indicators and progress assessment,"Incorporating the internationally recognized Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into national strategies is essential for achieving these goals within the specified timelines. To this end, China is advancing the construction of ecological civilization, aiming to promote economic growth while safeguarding the environment. This study seeks to establish a connection between the SDGs and China's efforts in Ecological Civilization Construction (ECC) by developing a set of practical performance evaluation indicators consistent with the global SDG framework. The research employs various methods, including entropy weighting, coupling coordination models, the Dagum Gini coefficient, and Kernel density estimation, to assess SDGs indicators based ECC performance in China from 2011 to 2022. It explores the spatiotemporal variations in ECC performance across different regions and provinces, evaluates the coupling and coordination between subsystems, examines regional disparities, and investigates the dynamic evolution of these disparities. The results show that: (1) overall, ECC performance in China has been on the rise, with the eastern region performing notably better than other regions; (2) the coupling coordination among subsystems is still in its early stages, indicating considerable progress is required to reach a higher level of ecological civilization; (3) although there are disparities in ECC performance, they are not severe and are mainly due to inter-regional differences; (4) absolute disparities in ECC performance between regions and provinces are gradually diminishing. These findings are crucial for China to enhance its ecological civilization comprehensively, promote sustainable development, and achieve the SDGs within the designated time frame. © 2024 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Guidance experiments on residents’ participation in decision-making activities related to urban settlement regeneration in China,"In China, how to guide residents on actively participating in decision-making activities related to urban settlement regeneration is critical and must be addressed. Referring to the theory of planned behavior (TPB), combined with the characteristics of regeneration decision-making, the external environmental factors affecting residents’ participation in such decision-making activities, through impacting psychological environmental factors, were determined by establishing the structural equation model (SEM) and conducting a survey. The guidance measures of enhancing external pressure and providing regeneration information were selected. Participation guidance experiments were designed, and the typical communities located in the development zone and city center of Harbin, China were selected as the experiment regions. Forty-eight subjects were screened in each experimental region and divided into six groups; three participated in the experiments regarding the leading role of representatives, enhancing communication, and incentives, and three in the experiments on policy advocacy, regeneration technology popularization, and regeneration case sharing. Guidance measures’ effects for introversion or extraversion, regardless of region are, from large to small, incentives, regeneration case sharing, leading role of representatives, enhancing communication, policy advocacy and regeneration technology popularization. There are significant differences in the effects of enhancing external pressure measures between different personalities, and enhancing external pressure measures are more effective for extraversion. Although the differences in the effects of providing regeneration information measures are statistically insignificant, providing such measures is more effective for introversion. The results reflect the analysis of the influencing factors. TPB application is enriched and the guidance experiments used to verify guiding measures’ effectiveness are provided. Practically-significant implications include: communities and proprietor committees should organize neighborhood-relationship to enhance community activities, with the proprietor committee solving residents’ daily problems to win authority and trust, positively guiding residents’ participation. Community staff can also understand, via daily participation, residents’ personality traits, so as to implement the above-mentioned guidance measures. © The Author(s) 2024.",About Sufficiency
How Is Spatial Planning Adapting to Climate Change? A Textual Analysis Based on the Territorial and Spatial Plans of 368 Chinese Cities,"Spatial planning is broadly acknowledged for its pivotal role in local climate change adaptation. Nevertheless, variations persist among countries in their perceptions and practices concerning the effectiveness and feasibility of utilizing spatial planning for climate change adaptation. Chinese cities confront the challenges of global warming, rapid urbanization, and intensified extreme weather events. Climate change adaptation agreements, frameworks, and policies have predominantly emphasized the national scale, often overlooking local adaptation efforts. However, the ongoing reform and restructuring of China’s territorial and spatial planning system encompasses the categorization, hierarchical management, control of comprehensive national land resource development, and conservation. This process is gradually establishing spatial planning strategies that synergize with the impacts of climate change, thereby offering an opportunity to integrate climate change adaptation objectives into spatial planning. This endeavor is supported by a series of regulatory standards and guidelines to ensure its effective implementation. The study scrutinizes the public draft of territorial and spatial master plans for 368 Chinese cities to assess the integration of climate change concerns at the local level and to identify disparities among cities. Employing the Awareness, Analysis, and Action Framework (3A Framework), which draws from prior scholarship and integrates relevant existing research, we identified and assessed 30 criteria for recognizing and appraising climate change adaptation strategies in territorial and spatial planning. The study’s findings indicate that: (1) The role of territorial and spatial planning in integrating climate change issues at the city level requires enhancement, as reflected in the generally low “awareness” of climate change concerns, limited “analytical capacity” regarding climate change, and a certain foundation for “action response” to climate change adaptation; (2) Large cities, characterized by robust economies and population concentrations, generally outperform small and medium-sized cities. They exhibit a superior ability to delineate quantifiable climate adaptation indicators and measures. In conclusion, the study provides prospective recommendations concerning technical approaches, spatial governance, mechanisms, and actions to more effectively incorporate climate change adaptation objectives into local-level territorial and spatial planning. © 2023 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
